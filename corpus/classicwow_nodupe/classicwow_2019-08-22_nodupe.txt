The solution was for blizzard to implement their own gold selling.
---
---
---
Let’s not forget they will also have to deal with the massive login queues...
---
No problem! 
---
You can run bear form tanking all the way to 60 minus a few tougher runs like BRD. 
---
Druid PvP is very much dot up and kite for your life. Very hard to kill when mastered though, if that's a play style you enjoy there are very few 1v1s you'll lose. 
---

---
Warlock has become popular because people know how strong they get at end game. Will even half of those people make it that far before they want to see big numbers like a mage? Probably not. You'll see much less of them than rogues, but you'll see less of both than warriors and mages.
---
It's hugely demoralizing to invest in folks, train them, gear them, and have them attrition out, either to guild hopping or out of game.  I'd estimate that over the course of any given raid tier, we'd attrition out about 1/3rd of our raid at least once over, sometimes 2-3 times, depending on difficulty and duration of that tier.
---
I would hire that guy, too
---
This is the most PR way the devs have of saying: “FULL MEANS FULL, GTFO OF FULL REALMS NOW OR YOU'LL BE REAL FUCKING SORRY AT LAUNCH—DON'T FUCKING CRY WHEN YOU CAN'T PLAY FOR DAYS.”
---
just add the blimps to the horde side!
---
If $5 hurts that badly, maybe use some of those brains to make more money.
---
Wrong. Autoloot came in BC. Before you had to hold shift to loot.
---
I am out of the loop 100%, thanks for the link.
---
No achievements marked out and no dungeon guid so excited to be back to vanilla and never leave
---
No one on this site has heard of google, be patient lol
---
idk, but I should probably stop talking like this because I'm getting downvoted lol
---
??
---
It's a list of people who are LFG. Nothing more nothing less.
---
We wouldn't have this issue if they used good server names.
---
Why don't they just lock them at this point? I know they said they don't want to but if people are still making characters anyway...I don't really see the harm.
---
Your gear will never become obsolete either. In retail, new patch comes out? All that hard work down the drain. In classic, the shit you get is the shit you get. Absolutely thrilled
---
What in the fuck.  
---
Take your upvote you filthy animal.
---
Wait I thought it was August 27th am I missing something?
---
strong
---
Yeah, because things that players make and things that blizzard makes are roughly the same thing
---
Next week this forum will be flooded with post of people complaining about long waits to play.
---
I don't know if you're serious or not, but just in case:
---
Some reddit survey is hardly a good representation of what the reality will be. It might give you an idea of what the most populated realms will be, but the vast majority of players will never even visit this subreddit.
---
People will cry and blame it on Blizz
---
Can confirm. Hadn’t played since February...forgot I was subbed til last week when I saw my sub hit my bank statement after I noticed it updated automatically.
---
Probably just an iv for hydration, uber eats / door dash, coke to wash it down, a few diapers and meth.
---
Yes people will be advertising ingame for guilds.
---
Wrong.  Autoloot came in 1.9.  The ability to set the key came later.  Before 1.9 you had to loot everything one at a time. [Suck it.](http://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Autoloot)
---
People seem to think millennials are boomers now.
---
Thats not even that bad. The two wow mice that I have are completely white. Got them for free for waiting about 4 hours for the Cataclysm midnight release at best buy.
---
Coordinating 40+ people is tedious and hard, though.
---
As a fellow harod chad i agree , harod is the only playable server and will remain so unlike the rest of them after 2 days, so i will stay determined no matter what lies blizzard will throw at us
---
Why's that..?

&gt; IF is closer to a bunch of end game content

Much appreciated!

Wrong about what? Bang bang pow pow.

im serious the realm is dead on ARRIVAL!!!! it says full but its lowest on survery pls explain that to me mr smarty pants
---
Wrong as always.
---
There's a bunch of grinds for gear, patterns, mats and a mount that are otherwise unobtainable without grinding the same thing over and over until a vendor will sell you them. 
---
These grinds have traditionally taken a long time. Humans just get to cut out a good chunk of it just for being a human.

---
im scared , so much shit i need to do at 60
---
Have fun playing hours of World of Queuecraft while everybody else is hitting level 20.
---
I'd say avoid warrior between those two. Warrior takes a lot of time and love to get working, if you're playing on a time budget that'll feel shitty for a looooong time.
---
Translated: If you do not appear to be *at least* middle-aged then you will get carded.
---
I dont know. 
---
I have no intention of going to 60 as fast as possible. As someone who didn’t play Classic, the journey is just as important as the destination, possibly more so for me because I don’t know if I’ll have the chops for raiding. Especially since I’m going to be playing as a Warrior. I’ve heard/read that Warrior was pretty brutal for leveling. 
---
So I think I’ll use something that just kinda points me in the right directions when I need it rather than something that’s trying to maximize quest time
---
Not sure if there’s one like that though
---
That's fine, from the looks of you in that picture you'll die of old age before your server queue pops.
---
Good. Exactly as it should be. Its not classic unless you have to start logging in on your lunch break.
---
God that was a chore
---
Hello Kitty Island Adventure

Man, does every Steelseries paint chip off like that? I had one a few years back that chipped the same exact way. It'd leave flecks of the paint all over my skin after I used my computer.
---
Herod's Shoulders ;)
---
Except I'm not.  It's literally right there in the link.
---
Well when you push really hard for raid progression and your guild decides to put in extra time and effort and you finally clear the raid, don’t you take a break after? I mean this is normal. But no one outright quits the game, that’s just a ridiculous sensational statement.
---
Dwarf Priest might be the most in-demand class/race combination of all time.
---
Thanks. Do you know how well Ele can farm?
---
"In patch 4.1, Blizzard finally streamlined the maze aspect of the dungeon. The infamous jump is, alas, no more"
---
"cringe gif here"
---
Blammo... Ohhhh!!!
---
I see it as "blow me" and that's why I won't go to that server. Lmao
---
You can't really argue that it wasn't generally easier though. People have been arguing it for years but the general consensus seems to always have been that the BC/Vanilla crowd complained that it was too easy (hence the term Wrath Babies came to be) and Cataclysm suddenly became too hard when they walked away from WotLK. To the point where people were regularly complaining about the dungeons themselves being too difficult.
---
I thought Cata had a fantastic bar at the start of the expansion tbh, *most* of the dungeons were interesting as well.
---
I'll admit I was slightly peeved when I saw it.  Then I got over it because he/she has done a shit-load of legwork and if people don't want to pay for it then screw them.
---
You're welcome to your opinion of course, but I fully welcome the possibility of being able to go out and farm while LFG, instead of sitting in a city spamming it. 
---
This is an improvement.
---
Can't you just pdf the guides after 1 month anf save them all forever? Wont that just happen anyway and be shared all over thr internet
---
Yea you will find friends in game and even guilds. 
---
Typically though if you want to play with less casual player you will have to apply and you will have to join there discord as Discord will be a must for out of game communications and voice chat. It is afree voice service that you can customise a tonne.
---
Dont be disheartened. I would wait and let it all happen organically.
---
But most likely if you want to join a guild maybe do some raiding/organised pvp you will need some sort of voice chat.
---
In retail you don't Classic you should.
---
Hello, I am mushroom.
---
Druids are almost always the least played. You can play literally anything with a mage for leveling, the mage is great at carrying the leveling stage of things.
---
I'd say it's more important to think about the endgame playstyle and what you want to end up as.
---
At least I'm not gonna sell my low greens/blues for that sweet high level white vendor armor this time
---
Those are some extremely Warhammer-looking orcs, Samwise.
---
But guys will this HIGH POPULATION SERVER be dead on release?
---
Give this man a medal
---
Yeah, you have it correct, in the modern client, for retail WoW, the Spell Batching window is extremely, extremely short. Probably like 10 milliseconds or something like that. So vanishing deathcoils, blinding trinkets in same global, etc just aren’t possible anymore.
---
Blizzard went in and manually increased the “window” for Spell batching for Classic to feel more like Vanilla. Imagine that it’s 100 milliseconds long, instead of 10, so much more crazy stuff can happen in the same batch.
---
You’ll be just fine. A lot of what has formed on Discord wont survive in game anyway. Everyone has this perfect vision of how things will go once it launches and thinks that is exactly how the game will play out. Ultimately people will outlevel one another, realize others suck, or just generally realize they dislike playing with these people. 
---
You’ll have no issues meeting people, finding groups and guilds or doing anything else in game.
---
Earth Shock is a bigger PvP gamechanger than WF, IMO.
---
Oh man i guess im going to have a hard time finding someone to play with on Thalnos who speaks fluent English lol.

Still really excited!

Cringy shitpost...

Boooooo hisssss
---
He dances like the draenei. Awesome clip!
---
Ya I actually have no problem with this addon and will 99% use it, not sure why I wrote worse. I guess since the OP paints a negative picture I had that in mind.
---
Somewhat casual player here, certainly not picking my race to min-max. Always rolled Horde for the interesting lore and because, having entered the franchise with Warcraft 3, they've always been the good guys in my experience.
---
Though I hear that's, uh, a touchier subject in retail these days.
---
Come on Blizzard
---
Yeah the link proves how wrong you are. You’ve never been right in your life.

Not sure the specifics on ele for where exactly is optimal, but if a warrior can solo grind an ele definilty can. So without being sure I'd say you could at least pull the numbers I mentioned earlier.

Deleting comments on the YouTube video I see I’ll just post it here. At least you’re hot😜

I joined the server Discord that someone set up, but I haven't posted on it or chatted with anyone.  I have just been keeping an eye on it to see what sort of people will be on the server that I am on.
---
So far no toxic shit.
---
I don't care for guilds so I doubt I will be joining one any time soon.
---
advertisements and livestreaming was probably more than enough. but both faction guides are already making their rounds and being shared.
---
this type of thing doesn't work in /current year/
---
Sub Rogue?
---
These all look cool, but what state of mind you gotta be in for this information to be useful?
---
Doesn't matter. 30 minutes and you are kicked.
---
Doesn't work. 30 min hard limit.
---
I'm literally going to set myself on fire in front of Blizzard HQ if they don't bring back multiple skeletons and fix strafing animations.
---
This is the only thing in life that matters to me and I spend every minute of every day thinking about it.
---
Actually, the chat issue is much easier to solve.  Just randomly change the letters of the message to different letters.
---
What if the skeleton randomly changed its orientation. Then you could still know someone died there, but you would have a harder time spelling things out and making pictures. I think that may actually work... The problem is that you can choose which way the skeleton faces when you die, so that means you can creat lines with multiple...

A somewhat related topic to the confluence of Warcraft and Tolkien world-building: I have started working on a functional Orcish language that I hope to use for in-character speech, character journaling, etc. I hope to make it easy enough for other players to quickly pick up and use for extra RP flavor. It will be written with Latin script and will inherit much from English in order to facilitate use by ENL speakers. Hopefully, I can encourage some people to use it as a way of reinforcing the lore and the Horde community.
---
Leveled a Lock in vanilla and found demo to be the best at the time. Buffed my void so he could tank and then cleaned everything off him??? (Could also take down 2 mobs at a time.) I always found I was too squishy for affliction and destruction.
---
I hope there are wheels on that chair.
---
Okay Tinfoil, calm down now.
---
You know a friend of mine had that same idea the other day, a social friendly guild for parents and people who can't do regular hours and I have to admit it's sounding like a decent idea.
---
I agree playing the AH is the best way to get gold with low effort, there are some people who even make it a challenge for themselves to earn lots of gold without ever moving from a city.
---
I am praying that layering lets me get a BT with no issue. 
---
A hope? . .  a chance.

Stop posting this holy shit

I'm from PA and drank yuengling for the longest time, but it just hurts my teeth now. There's way too much sugar in it for my teeth anymore I guess.

Can you share some better guides/add-ons? So many others have said there are better guides for free but no sources..
---
And as an undead rogue, I share the sentiment.
---
I'll admit I will miss my polar bear mount I got in WOTLK. Took me almost a year of doing dailies to get it, but that being said I don't play retail anymore and haven't for a long time so I'm excited to get back to playing.

Join a guild and make friends; solo and playing with guildys/friends turns it into a whole mother game.

I'm not really active in the LGBT community there but I play on Proudmoore and overhead people say Ateish too.

Always expect an enemy player is close by when you engage in combat out in the world. A ganker will rarely attack you 1v1 when you're at full health. Use a mostly pve build with some useful pvp talents while leveling up. Then spec to match your playstyle focus at 60.
---
We did decent enough in battlegrounds and world pvp in our pve specs as a mostly raiding-focused guild. If you wanted to compete with the marshal groups, then you'd want to have the optimal pvp spec.
---
Roving tank squads may exist, and you can choose to stay there despite getting ganked, group up with others in the area and fight back, or head out to find a quieter place.

---
Pretty large fuck up to not block new players from joining servers listed as "Full".
---
Now the players who were there from day 1 are going to sit in a 3 hour que because mongoloids keep joining the full servers.
---
I wonder how the issue will change this time around. Blizzard's reporting and banning system is more sophisticated than 2004-2007, and there are new security tools like battle.net authentication. 
---
I think gold buying/selling will be a more difficult task, but depending on how big classic servers get and stay there might still be a market since there will be no legitimate gold buying.
---
It’s crazy that they are not opening more servers like now.....
---
Every pvp east server is medium (skeram) or high and full, and you know that will just grow.
---
Every pve east server is full.
---
How do you make a post basically saying everyone on any of these servers will see login queues and not also announce new servers.
---
Even if you say “cool I’m going to switch” your only option is to switch to a server that they also just said will have queues. Granted not as bad as the main 3 listed but still.....
---
It’s just asinine
---
because blizz are a bunch of fucking idiots
---
this is such an underrated comment
---
Fenald made a decent point. I love the info graphic, but your notations aren't accurate. Affliction and demonology are the two highest pve specs used for raiding. While you're correct that ruin is used in all pve build, those destruction talents are ONLY for that in all cases. Destruction was never used as a raiding spec, but could be used to great effect in pvp
---
I would argue priest will have more loot competition (all healers can wear cloth, not all can wear mail). And priests share itemization with druids, while shaman have their own thing going on. 
---
Priest is easier to heal dungeons with, but healing as a Shaman isn’t exactly difficult either. 
---
As for farming, I’m not sure.
---
I'm excited to deliberately miss the jump for that authentic Vanilla experience.
---
People have this image that it's poor asian farmers crammed into warehouses doing this shit when it was actually multinational companies with skyscraper offices in Hong Kong and tens of millions in investment capital from Goldman Sachs and the like.

See the article linked above about Steve Bannon when he was vice chairman of one of those companies
---
Awesome dude, this now replaced the ragnaros one!
---
Have fun and don’t listen to elitist. There is a guild out there for everyone.

you'll miss the best part :(
---
Class above race imo, would suck being stuck with a class that you dont have the most fun with.
---
Does the silver dragon stay on your pet? Is that why it's sought after?

Not gonna lie. That's sick af.

Can you link the most recent one? Please?

man races don't mean shit no matter what anyone says. i'll be playing a human warlock, honestly i think gear looks great on humans. animations arent the best but it's better than playing a freaking gnome. 
---
just play whatever class/race you want.
---
I'm not the only one!!!
---
Plz stop you're crashing the downvote economy by farming too many downvotes.
---
Just enjoy the journey and learn along the way. A lot of us wish we could go in the same way we did when we first played :)
---
That TOS is talking about Videos. It mentions it multiple times through the page.
---
Naw. But this baby had the fastest attack speed which doesn't do much for DPS but does interrupt spellcasters a whole lot more.
---
Unobtanium is pretty 😎 cool
---
And it will still be fun. Knowing nothing else is coming out m, I can comfortably farm for items and sets.
---
Additionally to pretend that other people posting like myself don't care is just dumb. Go bitch about skeletons for the next 3 years
---
This was doable back in vanilla with mods, it just comes down to the fact that now there's significantly more experienced people programming the mods, with more resources to make decent interfaces for them to give them the look that it's more user friendly.
---
This same thing existed back then, just it didn't have the newest coat of paint this does.
---
This doesn't harm the interaction in any way. It just cuts down on some potential spam and at the end of the day, not everyone is going to use it so you're going to be communicating in game anyways.
---
As others have mentioned... an LFG website, Discord, *something* will actively be used to help find groups easier. This mod doesn't ruin the spirit of anything other than potentially making chat slightly more readable with a little less spam going on.
---
... any of you ever regret having kids?
---
So in your opinion they should scrap a large portion of their work and start over, following advice from their community members when deciding how to remake it? (Similar to when they listened to the community, as you mentioned, for flying mounts?)
---
If you didn't like the mechanics then don't play the expansion.
---
They've stated Classic will likely be available as a Museum Piece.
---
It's exceptionally unreasonable to think they'd remake an entire game because it doesn't match your wishlist.
---
# BringBackTheSkeles.
---
You realize Joana provided the exact market access you are referencing. The product is right there in the open for a modest fee (if you play world of warcraft you can afford 5$). 
---
The mental gymnastics here are hilarious. You are beating yourself in your own argument. 
---
You're stealing an available product you can afford and making excuse after excuse rather than just admitting it. Everyone can see it, get over yourself.
---
It is like going to a supermarket.
---
Thousands of Gouda cheeses, without any difference between them, and then there is one you actually want hidden on the end, the read deal, with red PDO marker.
---
You are dead right on all counts, I had entirely forgotten that existed. And yet as soon as I read about it, a whole load of the details came flooding back. Memory is so strange.
---
Don't forget the carpenter that designed and built the table is no longer around to explain how they did it in the first place

My PC is 10 years old.  I have upgraded my RAM and video card, raided both my wife and son's old PCs when they got new ones, but the old girl is still doing fine and I think that she has a few more years left in her.
---
Solid tips. 
---
Knowing what people want is key. Monopoly on certain rare/hard to obtain items early on is a huge advantage that not many but a few will have. 
---
Whats even better is to have deep knowledge and understanding of the current market, and that is a very dynamic thing to master.
---
the third one SURELY. I am not even italian but I love this word
---
This is so fucking good. What a laugh!
---
I guarantee the servers that are the fullest will definitely completely crash several times so even if you end up "tricking the system" and login in advance and hit the "Enter" button as soon as it becomes available... you will not get far.
---
Personally I am convinced that servers like Herod will be forcibly split by Blizzard within the week because no one will be able to play on it outside of really odd hours and people will just pile on to try to "play" with their friends within that week - instead of the population getting lower.
---
That means Herod will be the server that will be dead, ironic.
---
Hello!
---
I'm having trouble chosing between spriest and warlock. When it comes to magical abilities, shadow has always been my favorite, no matter what game I've been playing.
---
The dilemma is this:  I love spriests. I'm aware of the problems with spriests in classic (usually on per raid for debuff, lackluster dps, Hard to gear etc) but spriest has always been my jam. I've played and raided as one from TBC til today, and I aim to raid in classic. I'm not looking to push for world firsts or anything, but let's say I'm looking to be a medium to a semi-hardcore raider. Do you think that because of the highwr knowledge and skull of the averagw player this time around (compared to vanilla) will lead to that people chill the f out and be a bit more liberal when it comes to classes and specs and that it therwfore is worth it to play what I love, or should I go with the more safe choice and play a warlock? At the end of the day, raiding is lore important to me than the class or specc I play, but I just adore spriests. 
---
My priorities are: Raiding (as spriest) &gt; raiding (as lock) &gt; raiding (as hpriest &gt; basicly everthing else.
---
I will only pvp for the off-hand and for the lulz with friends, so I'm looking for advice and opinions for PvE content.
---
Thanks!
---
[Sage's Guide](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/lime.html) is used by speedrunners and one of the best.
---
Because they will be getting rid of layering by phase 2.
---
Nice
---
I've always been vehemently against buying gold/leveling still got my account hacked and stuff stolen in vanilla.
---
I'm pretty sure this is missing the horde flight path in the hinterlands. maybe more
---
Lol no one really called them scarab lord back in the day. It wasn’t until the scarab lord title was added. I still remember when achievements were introduced and a night elf warrior on my server was awarded the title. Nobody gave a fuck prior to that. Yes, you get a legendary mount for banging the gong.  If that’s what you meant in the video then fine.
---
That’s what I’m leaning towards, just needed someone to confirm my thinking, thanks mate!
---
If you can afford to quest for it, you don't need it.  Rag and Thunderfury are huge dps increases that drastically improve a guild's ability to progress.
---
I saw an old battlenet friend log in the other day too.  I hadn’t seen him since like Wotlk.  I didn’t say anything but I smiled to myself and thought “welcome back, buddy.”
---
The time you could have spent farming the stuff to sell could be spent on farming the stuff you need. With inflated prices it makes the gold you use on NPC easier. I could say that players that are able to play 12h a day have an advantage over those that are on time constraints. Rich player being able to buy his gear and epic mount faster isn't going to hurt me though. Actually it would probably benifit me since if I had to play with them they would pass on gear I need and they would be waiting on me walking there, not me waiting on them.
---
I will be, but most of the people I'm competing with for a BT tame are hunters who will be, too.
---
warrior is really tough for a first character. they're like playing the game on hard mode.
---
hunter on the other hand is incredibly easy to level with but they require skill in pvp and raids.
---
i would recommend hunter if this is your first dive into WoW.
---
Haha nope. It doesn't make sense.
---
That's not released yet, though. Right?
---
Oh fuck. I did that as soon as I was done with teldrassil. My buddy rolled a human pally and I wanted to go lvl with him.
---
That run through the wetlands, Loch Modan...ughh...i died so many goddamn times. But when I first ran into IF and that music started. I'm pretty sure the top half of my head was somewhere no longer attatched to my body.
---
To this day IF is probably my favorite background music
---
Yea I started recruiting on discord but stopped; nothing better than the good ole trade chat or dungeon groups to find good people. I usually form my guild by running consistent weekly pugs and players start coming back and a guild of formed.
---
Realistically the only reason you should roll human over nelf is if every time you miss an auto attack you get mad and think "wouldn't have missed if I were a human". If you actively enjoy the idea of setting up ganks with shadowmeld it should be a no brainer haha
---
That's not the point. If you'd like to respond to me you'll have to send me $5 first.
---
Damn, that means Stalagg will have a queue
---
Don't do it would be my advice.
---
The game was never better when I literally DIDN'T know what to do or where to go next.
---
Don't forget Sac and Sanctuary.
---
Official Brown eye server is Pagle.  Us brown eyers are insecure, and need everyone to know we exist and will make sure it happen in trade chat.
---
That's a good idea. Central timezone, basically random hours due to my work.

I remember launch day.

It was a crap show of queues and server crashes.

History could be about to repeat itself.

I will be a few days behind everyone else, but hopefully by Friday when I get back into town the server situation will have calmed down a little.  And I have the following week off work so I will have plenty of time to play.
---
Oh seriously? I see, it's the lowest level tame you can get for that 1.0 attack speed. The rest are in ZG, all level 60, which isn't out phase 1. Next best is a 1.2 attack speed from a level 10 rare "The Rake" or a level 18 elite worg from SFK.
---
Lengthy queues day1 is infinitely better than opening way too many and having to deal with dead servers in a few weeks-months.
---
Yes, absolutely people will chill out and take non optimal things for their raids. 40 slots is a lot of seats to fill. I'll be GM/Raid lead this time around and I'll tell you that I'm helping both a spriest and a ret pally friend achieve their meme dreams. 
---
Sounds like you're a priest at heart, just do it. Worst comes to worst you respec as holy for a raid if we're down a heal slot. 
---
Also, vanilla mind control is the best spell in the game.
---
These are primarily for new players who haven't decided on their class yet, and want a quick look guide to help narrow the options.
---
Sounds like a reasonable idea. Could also just sell the herbs.
---
&gt; Guess the BOP gear from tailor is also nice to have
---
Yeah, my priest used it for a long time, and a friend dropped alchemy to get tailoring to 100 just for the BoP chest, then dropped it and went back to alchemy.
---
how is naxx not even tier one?
---
I mean, at least you're having fun.
---
My concern is I don’t think he’s helping anybody pull their heads out of their asses, but offering facile feel-good philosophy. If it helps you, great, but it doesn’t make me feel optimistic about the future at all.
---
There will be! so far we have an imgur linked elsewhere that has all but the last one of mage.
---
He's a noob and he fell.
---
unless they coordinated and you could see their bank etc as they went about their day but super third-person, via you...
---
That’s a really good point! Leveling now is just a means to max level (upon which you’d then learn your class); back then, leveling then was an actual tool to learn your class on the way. It’s more digestible that way.
---
Be sure you like the aestethics of your chosen race though, since you'll be stuck viewing (and listening) it for hundreds of hours. Consider looks, animations and voice lines too!

Hello,

Can you re up the list because the Github link issnt working anymore and i didnt get the chaance to view the lisst : /

cant find accurate info besides speculative forum postss from 2006
---
They are all pure SHIT but I like ‘em tho
---
if you’re strapped for cash you can buy a refurbished computer capable of running classic on Ebay for about 100$
---
no but that sounds amazing. I need to know more about this...
---
You've won Reddit.
---
Same, also bought a new monitor and headset for it.
---
Is gold selling really a thing or are they just fishing for your password to steal your account?
---
Thanks for sharing this. I'll definitely use it.
---
Why would I tell my employer why I'm using my pto?
---
Where in the actual hell are you getting "feel good philosophy" from?! He literally promotes the exact opposite of that lmfaooooooooo.

This will be the 2nd time in my life I do this.

---
If I die....I will die doing what I love.
---
They're playing on a server with 4 confirmed languages on it. That's the best place for them cause nobody will be able to understand one another.
---
Yep, absolutely. If you're not in a rush to establish yourself as a raid tank early on, level a Hunter and use that money/gear to funnel it into a warrior after. Much smoother if you're looking to experience dps as a warrior.
---
Yeah that's heartening for sure. Hey thanks a lot for your help. Hope to see you in-game :)
---
Fuck I shouldn't have watched that. No way I'm gonna be able to focus at work the next two days.
---
"Oh, there's some big world PvP going down closest to Stormwind?  Guess I'll go to Ironforge and make some money..."
---
hehe
---
I am headed the opposite direction to Teldrassil at lvl 4.
---
I can only bring my laptop to me to college so I’m also very happy it can run on anything :)
---
For me that's one of the best parts of classic. 
---
Seeing someone in the wild in a full raid set and being like "Oh damn, that person's a beast".
---
Maybe it'll be less impressive than it was when I was 13 and level 32 in vanilla but I think it's still cool.
---
Can't decide between rogue and warlock! I want to be self reliant and like the fact that locks can take a beating, rogue sneaking around and killing high priority targets its also very interesting. 
---
I think I am going to do both pvp and pve so idk
---

---
Yeah but he needs to come to classic, not retail. He can lead us and shape the game into what it was meant to be.
---
While I agree with your first point, the second point is not valid.
---
The size of the number doesn't really matter, but the fact there's 15 different numbers popping up when you auto attack a mob on retail matters. 2 different trinkets pop, 5 of your dots tick at the same time and 3 of your talents explode onto the mob, totaling to a mediocre damage output.
---
I feel like in classic every number has a greater value. When you cast a fireblast on a target that's it. 1 number pops up and you can easily see the impact of the spell. Doesn't matter if the fireblast hits for 500 dmg or 50'000 dmg.
---
I think this is also the key reason why something like Shaman or Warrior hitting 3 times with proccs is so epic in classic. Every number counts. And when suddendly there's 4 attack + earthshock's damage numbers on a target - it feels amazing.
---
Comparing Venruki bursting on [retail arena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_FQPmH0vSg&amp;t=4m50s) and [classic beta tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6W8E_cSVpQ&amp;t=15m24s) makes this pretty apparent imo.
---
Tfw you get a wep drop but, it's the same wep you have but, less ilevel. Really sucks.
---
And you may want to let people know what type of server you are wanting to play on, PvP or PvE.
---
I was trying to explain this to a coworker today.  He joined during BC and I told him remember the little camp in the north of STV (where I think you first encounter nesingwary?). He goes: "no". I said trust me... You will know and you will remember for the rest of your life.

You body will shut down by itself you’ll be fine good luck

I will, trying to push as much as i can for the 3 weeks off i have.
---
Only problems is that I want to roll pvp for the first time, and this limit my ability to roll both faction on same realm.
---
Still thinking what to do.

(ive settle on a dwarf rogue so far)

My main in vanilla where a 60, female dwarf hunter and a 60, orc shaman.

---
Best is to tell them that one of your healers agreed to give them 20g.
---
I think he means the level 40 mount. Epic mount as you say isn't much cheaper than a regular one and also shitton of work to get. I hated when people said my mount was free back then :D
---
That sucks that you had that happen, that's definitely an unpleasant feeling. Your account isn't going to get hacked in this day and age though unless you download a shady addon, etc. It's even more air tight now with an authenticator and notification when suspect ip login to your emails, etc.
---
Why do you need to give a reason to use your time off?
---
/fact
---
&gt; It's exceptionally unreasonable to think they'd remake an entire game because it doesn't match your wishlist.
---
You are just being dishonest.  All I've done here is list issues that people in the Classic community have repeated ad nauseam, and you are trying to pretend like this is some personal request I just came up with 5 minutes ago.
---
Blizzard is a video game development company.  They make video game content.  The idea here is to make new video game content that happens to not be TBC.  This is clearly not an impossible idea, and blizzard employees have stated openly that they'd be open to the idea if it's what the community wants.
---
5 days from now, there's going to be a lot of angry neckbeards complaining about Blizzard because of the queue times. All of them will have refused to move off these realms.

Leveling guides are generally built for speed and efficiency. If you aren't concerned about these things, I'd recommend just using the Questie addon so you can spot where quests are at more easily and then just look at  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones\_by\_level](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level)  to see what level the zones are. As for me, I'll be haphazardly following a guide off and on, but there are a few places that are just spots I love to chill and grind a bit while listening to music - a level or two in the Duskwood crypts, a couple levels on hippogryphs in Feralas, waste too much time PvPing in STV. If you just follow a guide, you might miss out on discovering some of these favorite things for yourself.  Whatever you decide, have a blast!  :)
---
spectacular.
---
Back in Vanilla days, I almost only played on PvE. Now I'm wondering if I have toughened up since then, and could handle the emotional challenges of a PvP server
---
I told my boss I need a couple days off next week. He said ok.  That’s pretty much exactly what happened.
---
got Alliance version, by chance?
---
Either that or like me he had to rename a lot of his characters and he chose Thex and is trying to pull a sneaky one.
---
I wish I still had my script. Really hate not having insurance and shit.
---
I was browsing the guild thread the other day and there was a guild called “Get off my lawn”. I believe it was an alliance guild on stalagg, it mentioned how it was for 30+ year olds that only have a few hours to play...I might check out their discord.   If your friend makes a guild like that send me the details!
---
You'll get the white one.

Awesome. The warrior would be primarily for PvP anyhow. I think I’ll main hunter to really experience the game and learn both PvP and PvE with and then Warrior later.  Thanks for the input!
---
Same for me, we stalled at 4 horsemen, it was like trying to squeeze blood out of a stone at that point.
---
Even with tactics and gear requirements being a solved problem, the amount of time and dedication needed to clear the later raid content will be a barrier for most people. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there are actually fewer raid clears (relatively speaking) because of that. Back in the day we didn't know better and were grinding towards the unknown, I'd imagine burnout will happen a lot quicker now people have experienced the QoL changes in later expansions. Easy to forget just how much life vanilla sucked up.
---
Any time! Down the road if you need advice feel free to shoot me a pm! 
---
I'll be GM/Raid leading/streaming on stalagg(most likely) under "Drewisaname" 
---
Happy adventures my friend, can't wait to see you when we all go back home.

Well, both EU PVE servers are high right now, the only medium is the RP one, so either they open another PVE realm or I don't think I have much of a choice (considering I'm bad at RPing so it wouldn't be a good idea to move there).
---
Behold, the power of the [internet](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests?filter=1;69;0)!
---
I'm planning on getting a mage to 60 since they're one of the quickest to level then farm gold. Shortly after I plan on leveling a warrior with some buddies and maining that.
---
I also plan on twinking a lot so I'm gonna try and buy as many bis boe items as early as I can before BGs come out and prices go way up. Of course a lot of people are gonna hold on to those lucky random drops, but I'm hoping some will just wanna make a quick buck.
---
Then who's tanking?
---
I work in construction as well, I said I was taking time off for a game release. Why the need to hide it? It's your time off not theirs. I don't care much what people think
---
Obviously fine to have a classic event.. but don’t call it “world first” if you aren’t going for it.
---
Araga.. in classic was a Liger! farmed this girl for 8+ hours to get her. Just for her to be changed later in bc I think.. So will Araga have her Liger model?!!
---
The scrub pic was my toon after years in vanilla. Too bad not much will change this time either lol.
---
Are cats still in the game?
---
I recommend the twitch app. For me updating all in 1 click is haven.
---
You just need to add the path to wow classic in the mod menu and then you're god to browse more addon.
---
Everything will have a queue.
---
They don’t want to let an infinite number of people onto a server now even if they could. This would only delay the problem to when they remove layering and have an even bigger queue problem.
---
Metalus Gravis Frostmane, or Expletus doomhammer. Period
---
Fairbanks seems safe still imo. Probably not as long a queue. Probably like 30 min max at launch.
---
Yeah Everyone has that you are not special. To answer your question no don’t play this game.
---
It’s feel good in that it is primarily intended to flatter the listener and promote them to think “lmfaooooooooo” is a reasonable thing to say in what was otherwise a reasonable back-and-forth.

Good luck.

I think that's a stellar choice you'll enjoy a lot more! See you in azeroth my friend.

I'm the guy who works all day and has children, except I'm getting my kids to grind for me :)
---
Oh, so there's TWO people to blame for condemning Enhance to uselessness for all eternity?
---
I don't understand how they tell people to switch servers but don't really give any options to do it.
---
Only 1 EST PVP server is Medium and will likely be High anytime now.
---
PVE players have it even worse since every PVE server is either High or Full right now.
---
Where exactly do we switch to ?
---
&gt;For Warlock it is much more of a stationary, spam shadowbolts because there's only 16 debuff slots kind of gameplay.   
---
    
---
This really turns me off from Warlock since in all other phases of the game I would be interested in affliction     
---
     
---
Also, I know I'm going to draw the ire of the #nochanges crowd again, but they should remove the 16 debuff limit if they have specs where debuffs play a huge role.
---
Yeah I immediately bought a keychain authenticator after I got my account back. And I actually ended up profiting because they gave me all my stuff back and left the stuff thief had on it.
---
Maybe you can join your realms discord. That way you can easily group up with people when you need to etc

That never leaves phase one as numbers haven't lowered enough for it.  As Blizzard recently stated in the German interview.
---
Have fun running MC over and over while everyone else gets BWL.
---
Its not like demo is bad at all, its more that the general consensus seems to be that the extra tankiness isnt necesary.
---
overall IMO it doesnt particuarly matter what spec people run while leveling, as you should take your own time and have fun, experimenting with talents as you level! If you find the demo is workin for you for leveling, then you do you friend!
---
Prepare for a lot of Trump, I mean I love barrens chat but that’s my experience in private servers — just trying to get a rise out of people.

I don't even know what to call this gathering of things.

This gave me a good chuckle LOL

It is viable but is suboptimal.

Depending on your gear, you might do better dps than if you spec DW fury, but once your gear improves, DW is better than slam.
---
Druids should murder all tailors on sight

Don’t tell me what to do!
---
When you have a 7 hour que and you're the lucky one.

This is clearly wrong. Where is the 4hr queue?
---
&gt; I always thought you can draw a lot of parallels between WoW vanilla and Morrowind. The latter is of course a single player game, but nevertheless it occupies a similar spot in game design thinking. There's no fast travel like in oblivion/skyrim, teleportation requires investment and magic use, silk striders are a thing but you're still required to get to them and discover the major cities, etc.
---
Wow, could not have said it better myself. Thank you for this.

I'll try to line it up a little better

Plebs using guides
---
You guys don’t count...
---
At least you can stab good
---
From the looks of it, you could probably queue up at launch and come back just in time to wait only a little while to enter the realm.  People are talking about like 5+ hour wait times the first week.
---
İ actually like the ide of being jack of all trades and want to roll either a shaman or a druid. İ know both are dedmanded to heal in endgame but which one has the upper hand if i want to do other things too mob farming, dpsing, pvp etc. I also want to know if any od these classes has an opportunity to go with a hybrid talent tree and perform multiple roles without needing to respec. Any other class suggestion is also welcomed.
---
Which is earlier than the Classic patch, so there is no need to use Ironforge, can still use Stormwind as the capital?
---
Being an undead warlock, I had a very complicated relationship with WotF when I dueled my friends.
---
Have them release an Ultima Onlilne: Classic that's original release, pre T2A?  Yes, please.
---
We checked Silithus on Beta and adjusted our guide accordingly. 
---
Sometimes it’s that simple.
---
Been trying to find it but there was an ooze that dropped a pet in the Plaguelands outside the cave next to the river. Can’t remember the name but remember it being relevant for the DOT it put on you. Was used in A raid.
---
Twitch app, go!
---
Nice. I will have the EXACT same model for my nelf.
---
That's free transfers. Paid transfers don't necessarily have that restriction.
---
Most definitely but it was posted the day after the blue post about the queues so I thought it fit considering this specific to the Classic release :)
---
This one might pass cause nobody is going to read it right at a glance
---
1 tank and an offtank for when drakk conflags is enough, but it's easier to manage the CC fails and focus fire fails with 2 tanking throughout and will speed the run up. Also because one tank can spend all his rage on the first kill target while the other keeps the rest of the pack off the healers, meaning mobs just die faster. 3 heals also tends to be faster than 2 heals. 5 DPS is tons for Rend event.   
---
You'll never get an ideal group though. Just be sure to have a tank of any class, a warrior, and two heals. It's easiest if you also get a hunter, but a mix of warlocks, rogues, mages, and druids can cover for a missing hunter.

This would also be very difficult to manage in the long term. Say 5 years down the line you've got 10 new raids after Naxx. New players still have to progress and get fully geared in MC. Then ZG. Etc... 
---
You're slowly distributing the playerbase across a huge number of raids, where doing older raids has no value and doing future raids isn't possible.
---
Joana’s guide is not even good. He’s using the same slow routes from 15 years ago. The guys a conman.
---
I'm talking about the stress test the other weekend where everyone was let in.
---
Wow, fire resist would be about the best random enchant you could get on this ring. Did it have more than 30 fire resist?
---
Not even that to actually stand a chance in pvp you need gear from raiding. So to get your bis rank 14 weapons you are gonna need to raid first.
---
I'm doing the opposite. I cannot wait for the trek TO teldrassil. I just want a cat mount, tbh.
---
because when they get rid of layering, there will be too many characters
---
Even though you're correct that the pattern drops from bosses, once it drops for one person, they can then craft it for everyone else before the other players step foot into a raid, making it pre-raid gear.

People also seem to be missing that classic is not a 1:1 re-release of 1.12. Everyone's calling it vanilla, but we don't even know for sure yet just how close it is to that experience.

Yes. It makes no difference if all of them are full including the "medium" ones.

I rolled Horde on Pagle too, but I'm not worried at all. First of all, this isn't a scientific poll at all, although it probably is a decent indicator that Pagle is skewed towards alliance, but probably not as high as 80/20. So what, though? It's a "Full" server and 20%+ is still a lot of people.
---
I just feel sorry for anyone not rolling easily the greatest class, druid.
---
My question is: how will this affect the *ofher* realms launch experience? There are PVE and RP players that might have issues logging in because people won’t spread out on PVP servers.
---
no you got it wrong too. alliance is for the non plebs.
---
Wow captain obvious. Let me go ahead and make a night elf mage in wow classic. Oh wait, you can’t.

I'm excited to be able to tell gear apart by name/model.

was literally coming here to say this
---
Farthest north city on Eastern Kingdoms for Alliance which is useful for Scholomance, Stratholme and later Naxx runs.  
---
Closest city to Menethil which is how you got to Elflands and dustwallow for Ony, AQ and Dire maul.  
---
About the same distance from MC and BWL as Stormwind which is only really closer to ZG.  
---
It also had the weird lava moat thing inside the city, giving people who were waiting on a group to form something to jump over to pass the time.
---
same here lol , i used my twitch prime  for his channel

Boom good 24 hour session guys. Tomorrow we’ll go for lvl 30!

I'd pay money to see Jeff Kaplan playing WoW. Can we get him back from the Overwatch team?
---
I got to level 7 or 6 and found an issue with a step that can’t be done, so kinda scared of using the guide for launch if there are mistakes that early on.
---
These are so fun!
---
Except there are two opposing factions that each think the other is evil.
---
I'm very set on my mains class... my alt however keeps changing
---
Depends on how fast you're looking to get viable. Locks will get dumpstered for a good long while until they have gear. After that turning point they become an s-tier PvP class though. 
---
They also have very different play styles and goals for PvP/PvE
---
You'll have a much more engaging rotation as a rogue. 
---
You'll eventually shadowbolt your way to the top as Warlock. 
---
Do you want to stand around and cast spells or be moving around?
---
Warlock and mage both have incredible pvp usefulness. Pyro blast, fireblast, presence of mind, insta Pyro = madness.
---
Priest is really useful all around. But I'd say mage, cause you always have a way to make money (ports, foods)
---
If this is reverse psychology from someone who doesn't want Herod players to move to his server, I think it's working.
---
Couldn’t it be the Blasted Lands before the invasions took place?
---
I’ve never been able to decide. I can usually make it like a week before I start thinking again and ultimately start leaning towards another class. I’ve literally planned to roll just about every class except mage and rogue at this point. I really need the game to launch so I can make a decision and get on with it.

Haha great! I can't remember why I invited a rogue, maybe to protect me from ganks or something.
---
Would be kind of cool. Honestly, these days everything is all about reflex, as opposed to thought, with the exception being card games oddly enough championing the turn based aspect of gaming. I think classic captured the concept of slow enough to give you time to think, but fast enough to not be slow due to turn length, with a lot of free actions you can take that don't change damage output, but change other factors like survivability (hamstring kiting for example).   
---
On the other hand what turned me off from retail was that it was mostly a reflex test. I'd just commit a rotation to muscle memory and then focus on evading the bad stuff while absently going through the rotation. Granted, Classic didn't fully fix this issue, but it did put a lot more focus on things outside of your rotation as the rotation was usually very simple.
---
I don’t think I had many good steelseries stuff.

My zboard was bad to...I’m sorry I can’t even finish that sentence lolololol

It's like a 3 minute walk to SW/IF if you're ally, a little longer to Darnassus since the path winds all over the place.

pretty cringy when I look back on it, good times though

I'd say pick a profession early and work on it as you level up. It will be more useful to you and you won't ever feel like blowing your accumulated fortune at level 60 trying to catch up with it. I've always regretted not leveling my professions up with my character in every MMO I've played

Add more servers like what the fuck are they waiting for?
---
Dude, for real. I just went through and checked and in the last 24h we've had 23 threads on this single topic and more than half of them are basically identical/spam. I reported every single one of them because frankly I'm sick of reading about it. Most people also aren't even informed enough to realize that they didn't REMOVE SKELETONS FROM THE GAME. You can still have a single skeleton present after you rez and in a large pvp fight or some such,  you will still know some shit went down. Everyone who is up in arms about this is being completely silly or is just ignorant.   
---
If you are sick of this, you should report these threads as well. Even when layering was the "in" thing to bitch about, the mods only allowed one thread to be up at a time about it. Not sure why they are allowing us to have 10 on the front page alone for this.
---
People who reserved characters on Herod, Thalnos, etc (the extremely popular realms that blizz is warning against), are you moving realms or hoping the population will thin out? What's your plan? I made characters on Herod and I don't want to deal with the several hour queue times, but it seems most realms are filling up. Is it worth staying on these realms and waiting? What do
---
Damn, Chevelle. Listened to them religiously up until Sci-Fi Crimes.  glad to see that shout-out.
---
BoP = Bind on Pickup or Soulbound. Once you loot it you can't trade it/sell it in AH.
---
BoE = Bind on Equip. You can trade or sell it until you equip it. 
---
In this case BoE makes no sense since we're discussing a pattern but BoP/BoE are usually used synonymously with Soulbound/Non-Soulbound
---
Omg yes! I listened to System of a Down for hours grinding through the barrens!!!
---
If you actually choose your server based on the name you are likely 10 years old.
---
Lies. Deception. An illusion. What are you hiding?
---
I assumed that was the case but was trying to give the dude the benefit of the doubt since that is such a noob thing to say/do.
---
A starter account has never had gametime added, so not.  
---
The moment you add a subscription it becomes a "standard" account. And you cannot play Classic without a subscription.  
---
All you need is a subscription to play, you do not need to buy BfA. I just wanted to be difficult since you could have just googled the answer in less time than it took to make a thread.
---
Thanks, this was really helpful.
---
Blizzard: but muh hatespeech
---
Just make herod a mega server and your problem is solved
---
I hope they dont focus too much on the "nostalgia" and realize that a majority of us want this because its simply a more enjoyable MMORPG game, not because of nostalgia.
---
If you have stable &lt;200ms ping you can play anything but fighting games without really noticing in my experience. I regularly play mmos on european servers with 140ms no problems. Put another way, you're only getting 30ms higher than most NA players get to NA servers.
---
Not sure what classes are the most sensitive to ping though.

I was hoping someone else had experienced this.  This was a long time ago but what I remember was we were in Arathi Basin and my priest guildy mind controlled this guy off the side of the lumber mill.  After that he had a ghost version of the guy following him around the rest of the match.
---
While I agree, I'll totally miss my spectral tiger and my glaives on my rogue
---
Ah, I was mistaken then. It’s been a long time since I last did WC on Retail. I knew it was shortened, but I didn’t know the jump was removed.
---
First play through Ill do Classicwow.live if they let you save your spot in the guide. If not I have Joanas guide.
---
Try clicking the ø on that page and tell me it sounds like the oo's in food.
---
How's that?
---
basically says that assuming parity in population across the two sides, each faction will be:
---
8%ish warriors
---
4.5%ish hunters
---
6.5% ish priests
---
7.5%ish mages
---
6%ish warlocks
---
3%ish druids
---
6%ish rogues
---
6.3% shaman (horde)
---
6.5% paladin (alliance)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
except for druid, looks pretty decent. the hunter number though....

No worries, my wife and I are running a Warrior/Shaman combo and when we can't play together in leveling a Druid.

Guess I'll see you on the other side alliance scum... Kill ya later! ;)
---
see my comment to marshdteach above... I'm fine with the idea of adding expansions, it's a matter of how they do it.
---
I think they patched it in one of the later patches  in vanilla, but I'm not sure. Hoping someone can confirm.
---
Ugh thank you I couldn't remember atlas loot.
---
After the nerf they were still strong, just not...godlike. I enjoyed wrath as a retadin. Some of my best memories of wow were topping dps charts in icc. I got all my serious pvp in during vanilla and tbc, I just didn't care by the time wotlk and cata were out.
---
Doesn't your bis guide have a list of gear not just bis but the top x fear for each slot? Just go down the list until you find the first piece that meets your criteria.  Maybe mage bis lists aren't stier like druids.
---
&gt; I'm 13 actually.
---
Excessive use of the word 'chad'
---
13 confirmed.
---
The retail developers such as RNG Ion have a long way to go before they can catch up with these legends!
---
With that logic, wouldn’t that work in your favor? All the 10 year olds leave your server for a new shiny name? Kys.
---
orc shaman bloodlust + windfury = fun times in pvp. i dunno.
---
I believe they are doing small things like having npc's added later in wow that were retconed to be there put into the background or giving names to npc's who got them later but I think that's about it.
---
too much work, so I just took the free version.
---

Funny story, my raid guild was working on Flamegor and Ebonroc and I didnt join the raid because the leading guild was about to ring the gong and open AQ. It was a once in a life time event to watch and I made sure I was there. I was kicked from the guild minutes before AQ opened. I never got to see past Lashlayer and didnt really get back into raiding until BC dropped.
---
This time though, I think I'm going to stay away from Dwarf pally and go straight warlock for raiding. Though I think I still might do a dwarf of some class just for nostalgia

It's meta though.  He's going outside the game to collude with the enemy for what?  To betray his own faction?  For what?  He's getting nothing out of it and he's ruining other people's fun.

Using a hosted payments page is fine. The payments provider not supplying a valid certificate is not fine. I am a web dev btw, you should not give out advice on topics you don't know much about.
---
&gt; just saying the SSL certificate for the hosted payment page does not match the SSL certificate for the hosted payments page. 
---
"Just". This is very, very bad. This is how a MITM attack could work. Someone could interject the request and send you a page with a certificate for a website they own. Ignore this warning and you could be sending your credit card details to a third party with malicious intent.
---
&gt; This is exactly how "Pay by PayPal" buttons work on 99% of websites
---
No. The Paypal button redirects you to a domain owned by Paypal, and with a valid certificate.
---
In 99% of cases, this is simply a configuration error and not an actual attack. But the average user won't be able to distinguish the two. Telling them to ignore certificate errors during a payments process is very bad advice.
---
That may be true to a certain extent. Some of the difficulty early on was figuring out strategies for the mechanics. Also, competing for first place and merely aim to clear something are very different things. To the guilds vying for glory I say: Good luck!
---
You are right. Thanks for pointing that out.

I agree. It's also numbered 3 on the slider, which would put vanilla medium at 2, and vanilla low at 1. This makes sense to me

classic wow didnt have paypal, nochanges

its a joke, I couldnt pass up
---
Of course, our glorious  Great Leader  is level 60 already and is soloing Rag right now!
---
Hes obviously making a joke but a pretty shit tier one
---
&gt; where mobs were much more serious - and the challenges to 5 mans and 10 mans were some of my favorite memories. I hope they've aged we..
---
I died 3 times getting to level 8 during the stress test weekend.  3 times.  It was awesome.  The open world being threatening again was sorely missed.
---
Open world is unpredictable and could feature toons anywhere from levels 1-60 and in unknown numbers. Exciting and frustrating, in turn. The majority appear to be coming back to classic for this experience. 
---
BGs are "fair" arenas wherein you fight and compete against opponents of like level and number. As time goes on, you will likely see The advent of "twinks" (disproportionately high geared, lower level toons - think a level 19 in all blues against some mid-teens in some greens) which may have an impact on your enjoyment of lower ranged bgs. 
---
Tbh, I'm coming back for my guildies and bgs. But to each their own.
---
Yah I rly do think the rogue will be the most enjoyable for me. Especially since I come from both a fury warrior and frost DK background. The fast pace nature of their rotations are what engage me.
---
Oh man I hope that still works in Classic. I don't recall how to do it but I'm sure I can figure it out
---
It's pretty stupid frankly.  Was then, is now.   Honestly I just thought it was shitty internet/network/servers back in the day.  Now it's just shit design.
---
...to an American who doesn't speak a lick of French and has never heard  ø before, yes. It sounds perfectly like a Frenchman mispronouncing \\u\\. 
---
Do I think that ø sounds like u? Did I write that? I do not and I did not -- however, I've seen enough people writing "blow-mer" to know that using a rhoticized vowel is not wise when describing the sounds of words to people who don't speak the language.
---
&gt; how hard it may be to find groups.
---
you should play a holy priest.
---
orgrimmar and ironforge were the only cities with auction houses. they added them later though, so plenty of people will be hanging out in stormwind in classic because it's based on the patch after AH were put in each city.
---
Seems like a good way to get kicked out of the raid.
---
I got killed a few times but they must have pitied a holy priest leveler. :3 I was usually pretty lucky! 🥺
---
Literally my friends because “greedy blizzard can’t make servers and are just trying to get people’s money to reserve names”
---
I resubed to shake rust off too
---
Doesn't save your progress or let you skip ahead? Hard pass.
---
Primary PvP spec is Ele/Resto, not Enhancement.  It's top-tier.
---
I don't really care what they are named.
---
If "Server Bob" is medium and has good latency I'll join it.
---
Does the quest item drop for all hunters in the raid, or does it go to just one who wins the roll?
---
I feel the same way about Wisconsin, cheers friendo
---
Care to explain how this wasn’t a marketing ploy now?
---
can't lock xp in classic, no bg's until phase 3
---
I'm rolling Alliance on Herod, I want the full experience..for about 5 minutes, then I'll give up and go to Desolace.
---
unless youre the guilds dedicated alch. then yes it would be. you could just buy/altfarm the herbs and give them to the guild to make you pots.
---
Comically huge numbers don't help at all either. To me, Overwatch has a pretty perfect integer range, but I don't mind seeing numbers of a few hundreds either.
---
I do also agree with you though that they've heavily diluted the importance of the numbers you see. Back to the Overwatch example...your weapon deals 70 damage, heroes have 200 to 500hp. You have no dots, no procs, no double attacks. Every shot is 70 damage, and every shot takes a huge chunk out of someone. That makes combat feel really impactful.
---
Filling up every single GCD with action is part of the problem too. Vanilla has some downtime in rotations which is really nice and gives you a chance to enjoy the action.
---
Ironforge has the best layout out of any city.
---
It's a perfect circle with 5 connections to the middle. At any point in the middle of the city you're the same distance from any end of the city. There's not a single "far end" that will take a long time to run to.
---
On top of that there's only one entrance to the city unlike horde cities that have multiple. The only "second entrance" leads directly to stormwind. And the only way in the front you have to pass through the auction house AND bank area. The chances of being afk-ganked by a horde rogue while you're flagged is probably the smallest!
---
Ironforge also has the closest auction house to bank to mailbox route. In stormwind you have to run much farther to get from the auctioneer to the banker.
---
On top of all of this, Ironforge has the best location of any major city in the game. You're right next to Menethil harbor which has TWO boats. One that leads to Auberdine on the other side of the planet, and one that leads to Theramore ALSO on the other side of the planet. ON TOP OF THAT you have a free tram to stormwind which i've calculated is faster than taking a flight path. Even if you miss the tram at the last second!
---
So with the 3 fast travel locations nearby, ironforge has access to Northern Kalimdor with the boat, southern Kalimdor with the other boat, Northern eastern kingdoms (by being in northern EK), and southern eastern kingdoms with the tram to stormwind.
---
 
---
Also don't forget end game raids. Ironforge is right next to blackrock mountain which has like 4 end game raids. AND it's right next to Menethil Harbor which leads DIRECTLY to Onyxia's lair the first end game raid!!!
---
Finally let's look at aesthetics. A freaking city CARVED OUT OF A MOUNTAIN WITH LAVA MOATS. It has its own lag defense against horde invaders when it gets so laggy they fall in the pit surrounding the auction house and bank!!!!
---
If you were Immortal like a NE you should remember where is the toilet in Darnassus

Seriously! This has been handled so fucking poorly.

No idea how it happened. I can only assume addons played a part in it.

---
Well good thing I’m trying to stick with Herod...
---
Open trade window, put 5g in the window, afk.

That's technically correct, it gave you the "creature type" undead, which meant no sleep, no fear, but you could get shackled.

I made a post like this https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cs7xfq/worried_about_druid_tanking/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Has a mixture of answers and the most well reasoned out come is that tanking is viable in 5 mans and off tank very viable in raids if you're geared.

His name was inactive for 24 months and taken over by someone else.

Then he logs in and is asked to rename his character. He has followed this subreddit for a long time and renamed his old character Thex.

Speaking of mounts: Is the Dawnsaber available for Night Elves, or was that added later? (I started in BC).
---
This is why my guild is going to be MC gods. We will realistically be stuck in MC until ZG, tier 0, and AQ are released for catchup gear so we have a chance in BWL.

I mean vanilla had mechano-striders.. but they didn't make obnoxious screeching noises.

On a roleplaying level, I really like the change to mounts being more expensive. It makes more sense.

So is wow classic like the final release of wow, it's finally out of beta after 15 years?

I bet it smells great!
---
5 irl friends and I are already in an amazing guild on Fae and have a raid group already assigned. 
---
We know it’s a streamer server but we don’t care that’s where we all wanted to play and it’ll stay that way. 
---
I’m hoping long ass q times will deter tourists and most casuals at launch time or at least they’ll roll another server with lower pop.
---
Having a group disband because you can’t find X role is not some badge of honor.  
---
  
---
Between memers, gold spam, trade spammers, local messages, yells, and whispers I’ve always had to created several distinct chat tabs to filter out specific messages.  
---
Look at dps type addons. You can join a channel, share metrics, and synchronize performance by using an addon. It doesn’t give you anything more than what’s available in game. It does provide a nice easy to read format that can be used by others. This functions as an LFG filter nothing like the LFG function of retail.
---
Arugal is currently listed as High and will presumably have a queue.
---
the best kind of pvp you mean.
---
Head over immediately, because you get less rep the lower the quests are in relation to your character level.
---
You don't, actually. I'm not subbed and just downloaded it today.
---
Especially when most of the coolest-looking mounts are store-bought mounts that took 0 effort to get, so everyone has them and you can walk through the main city and see like 30 people with that mount.

You can do your starter quests at Northsire Abbey first. Quests start giving less reputation once you're 6 levels above.

If you want to play it safe, go once you get level 4 spells.

Shenanigans.

I played NE hunter during vanilla and kinda wanna go re live my NE hunter life, plus night sabers are sick! But I'm afraid of falling off in DPS after BWL. It's been long since I've played, do hunters also fall off in DPS in PvP as well in BGs? I know they kinda suck 1v1 in duels but are they still strong in BGs? Would I be easily able to find pre made and rank up to 12 or 13? 
---
My other pull is towards Warlock I love the class style and they have such a strong 1v1 as well as 1v2. They also stay high on DPS in naxx. Would it be easier to rank to 12 or 13 on a lock? 
---
I just dont want to play a class and fall off late in the game after being so invested. I a class that will benefit from the amount of time I will put in. Planning to be 60 in the first week or 2 and playing 2 to 4 hrs a day afterwards.
---
I plan to play a decent amount of PvE at 60 raiding 
---
each raid atleast once a week when ready.
---
See ya in Azeroth! 👍🏻

Screw law school it's overated WoW is where it's at!

Noggenfogger doesn't cost much at all. Even a 16-slot bag would only take ~22 gold to fill up, and that's before rep discounts.

It wouldn't be, if it had done that, correct, but I didn't. All I did was say you made a mistake, something we all do, and you choose to double down on it and try to weasel your way around it.

Can’t wait to see the mage as well as that’s what I’m rolling. I would say a Dalaran Mage for the artwork.

&gt; will I be successful in makings friends and finding guilds in-game only? 
---
This will be the best way.  You will meet and be forced to actually interact with a lot of people as you quest, run dungeons, and level up.  Some of these people will become friends you regularly run content with.  Those friend groups turn into guilds, or they join a guild as a group.
---
&gt; things like discord seem to have really changed the landscape.
---
Not really.  There were public Ventrilo and TS servers for every Vanilla server that people frequently used.  Sure Discord is unquestionably better than other VoIP applications, but it's just that, *better*, not new or unique concepts or technologies.  I think we can thank cultural shifts for a lot of the things we are seeing talked about.
---
My brother is having a LAN for launch, and I've never played before.  I've played LOTRO, so I have some general understanding, but I'm just looking for a class that's fun to level and enjoy the flavor of WOW with.  I'm not really concerned with PVP or end game content.
---
I'll probably be dual or group leveling from the start, if that makes a difference.  I'm most interested in mage, warlock, and hunter.  I'm wondering if the latter 2 are bad in groups early since they're so good solo.
---
I mean...you took 5 images of unusual transmog and said "Look how retail players transmog!". I felt the same way when transmog came out, but I love it now, and so do most people. It's just another culture that changed. In Vanilla your best set is also the one you'd be most likely to use as your transmog so it wouldn't have been as good then.
---
Yeah classic wow has a lot of natural competition.  I hear warhammer, age of conan, and swtor are going to kill it.  If they don't wildstar certainly will.
---
My register at work can barely even run the point of sales program and here you are lmao
---
Pretty sure Activision Blizzard reported record breaking profits not too long ago, which was right before the 800 employee layoffs, so I don't agree that they are hurting. 
---
Also, AAA publishers in general are doing just fine. While they haven't increased the box cost, games no longer simply cost $60 anymore if you want more than the bare minimum they typically put in them. They stuff games full of season passes, microtransactions, or bits of DLC, and 5-6 different deluxe edition these days. 
---
But regardless of all that, none of that actually seems relevant to WoW's sub fee, and the $15 still seems fine. That is the price it has always been to play on WoW's servers. I don't see why that would change just because you choose to only play 1 version of it.
---
Hell no. I hated it. Rfc, SM (all wings), SF, ST, ZF (with mallet) uldaman and strat, scholo are the only ones i truly loved. I did my best to ignore the rest. Especially BRD Maraudon and RFK
---
yeah, pvp was fun...but I could not really help out clearing end dungeons until I had my mage ready
---
this one is way better and you can save your progress https://www.vanilla-questing.me/
---
I like both sites tho.
---
People bought gold in vanilla #nochanges
---
Tool all day baby
---
Exactly. If they would add more servers at a time maybe we'd be able to get our names too rather than everyone concentrated on the same server trying to snag names ASAP. I happened to get mine on Faerlina and haven't had success getting it anywhere else so I feel stuck there. You can't tell me if they added 2 more servers per region that they won't have healthy pops at launch when everyone is either stuck in a queue or able to instantly log in there.
---
For 5mans if you want to be dps and desirable, mage is the way to go.  Poly is hands down the best CC, water is legit expensive, and mages are the only real aoe while still being good single target.
---
I think you missed the part where I said *could* but *won't* because it is not good value
---
Once you get the gear yeah
---
This was a big deal and we definitely heard those rumors. It was a point of pride for us that we cleared BWL with no outside input, and not very far behind the world first. Our raid leader made it a rule that if anybody shared, guild wide, leaked strategy they were in serious, serious shit. We had forum threads on our forums pages upon pages discussing Razorgore, Vale and Nef. All of the other bosses were familiar mechanics which is why we down them in one night.
---
still playing though
---
It's not sharding but if sharding will allow 50k people to be on a single realm, sure. 
---
My idea is have 50k people spread across 5 different Herod realms. They are kinda like layers but you can choose which one you wanna be on so your guildies are on the same realm. If population ever dies, Herod 5 goes offline and disappears. You pick between Herod 1, Herod 2, etc
---
Because people play how they want.  I might level up a bit quickly to get some gold, and then make an alt and level slower.  I have played a ton of vanilla on private servers.  I guess not a new player.
---
I absolutely do.
---
Should be banned. It's going to ruin the spirit of classic if no one is talking to each other and just zombie queing/joining random groups and not interacting. All the effort to get classic wow and it's going to be ruined and just a huge waste.
---
Classic WoW is well worth $15 a month. If it's not worth it to you, don't play. It's really simple.
---
the burden is on you to disprove it, because he said it several times during his streams 2-3 months ago. i'm obviously not the only one that was watching and remembers this.  
---
he 100% said that the web versions of his guides would remain free  and he even made a point of making that very clear because people in chat kept asking how he was going to make money off of it. he said he would probably make a paid members area and wasn't sure what would be in it, but that being a member could be tied to the addon he was going to make.
---
Most of the lists posted, including classicwowbis.com are all terrible.
---
But will take new servers as all of them are Med and above.
---
Which you have said means waiting queues.
---
FYI: Half the images in your zip are bandwidth limit exceeded images.
---
Mage, to start.  Rogue and warrior next.  After that the possibilities are endless!  Haha
---
It's the pre blasted lands
---
Twitch is the only one for the curse repository as far as I know, there is the tukui one but it has a limited number of add ons, also so far there is no way to sort for add ons working in classic, yet.
---
It's more about the racists and Nazis than the gold sellers
---
You walk into a liquor store, you see one of those tiny bottles of whiskey attached to the neck of a big bottle.
---
You say to the clerk "hey I don't want this big bottle of booze, I just want this little bonus bottle, it should be free right? Or can I atleast pay less for it?“
---
The clerk says "Uhh no, it's not free or discounted, it comes as a bonus with the big bottle."
---
"But I don't want the big bottle and I don't want to pay that much money."
---
"Then get out of here you smelly drunken bum."
---
So many years has gone by that I can hardly remember names lol. Found your name in a screenshot so it kinda brings back memories.   
---
I played a human warr, Epicfrostiee

---
Honestly this just makes Joana's guide even better. Aside from being the better product, less people will now be using it, meaning less competition.
---
Missing a lot of Soilwork songs tbh
---
It's going to be more like 8 or 9 days. Pretty close to 1 week, yes.
---
!remind me in 14 days
---
@mouseover works. As a note, if you are a rogue/druid using @mouseover on other than primary target loses all combo points.
---
Because I want to hit 60 quickly yes.
---
My alts are for exploration
---
In goldshire
---
You'll be stuck in que. Because 50k people will try and get on a realm with a pop cap of 10k.
---
Different population of people on the private servers. This addon, or others like it will take off because there will be a larger proportion of people who don't have the #nochanges mindset.
---
actually wow is already cheaper than it was before due to inflation. So you already getting it like 30% cheaper than normal
---
Damn you're no fun
---
Omg I forgot all about bearshare
---
Ally arugal?
---
Who cares about buying gold? Shit happened in vanilla and will still happen.
---
Been a warrior since burning Crusade. Watched blizzard nerf them into shit especially with demon hunter tanks and death knight tanks. 
---
Will be glorious to see them be the best tanks again. 
---
I might finally try healing though. Holy Paladin looks like a good healer to try.
---
As a fellow Millenial, born in 89. The Last Crusade came out the same year. I saw Indianna Jones because my dad insisted. Same with original trilogy Star Wars. However The Mummy came out in 99. So at 10.. O'Connell was the man.
---
We had the same -- but they were a sister guild, Ravencrest Guard. We ran open worlds together and filled in each other's raids whenever necessary. I joined up with RCW during their progression through Molten Core and I was undergeared because I had rerolled with a couple of friends from our original server, so I acted as a co-raid leader for RCG while I built out my gear. The main tank for their raids was the most sincere guy you'd ever meet. If I saw him today I'd give him a hug. Couldn't help but love the guy.
---
Maybe, but AoE looting isn't going to be in.
---
Damn I need to check it out. Didn’t know they had a new album
---
Not sure if meme or legitimately reserved 3 terrible names. 
---
These names look like you were 3 months late to Herod, lmao.
---
Can you still tame the green cat in felwood?
---
Any time I find a rogue  I have a good chance to kill, I take it. One of the prices of being a rogue is that it has a global taunt, because everyone hate you on sight.
---
You get a copy of WC3 when you buy reforged so you can play through all that good stuff. Just did it myself, it was awesome
---
How would most players get good at something they have never played?
---
People will be sorely disappointed if they think an addon is going to make it any easier to find a tank.
---
For the Horde !
---
NEW TOOL ALBUM 30TH
---
I still have a vivid memory of listening to Breaking Benjamin: polyamorous while finishing the 50-60 grind killing yetis in winterspring! Everytime I hear that song it comes back haha
---
Wait were there not auction houses in every city in Vanilla?
---
Because i figure the spells i get by lvl 4 will last me till i am done with teldrassil and also to maximise darnassus rep.
---
Not responder but having played hunter in vanilla I gotta give the nod to hunters in a lot of wPvP Scenarios. Especially if you are just kind of chilling on your own you can get the open on anyone and have a huge advantage on that fight.
---
The only time a r14 alliance was not in VC was the first round of honor. It was sold to the highest bidder after VC had pushed all that wanted it lol. It will be interesting to see how it plays out in classic. Will there be enough top tier guilds per server to actively challenge each other? Or will there be one dominating per faction?
---
Yeah but I haven't played with the stock UI basically since Vanilla lol. I use ElvUI now and have been for a long time. Before that it was like a combo of bartender, seximap, etc...
---
I always loved seeing the names of the multiplayer heroes used around WoW. Agamand Mills is the only one to come to mind but I known there were more
---
I have a station on play music, "Everlong radio" that is like 50% this and 50% 90s grunge and alternative like Pearl jam, smashing pumpkins, stp, Oasis, Nirvana, Bush and of course foo fighters. 
---
I usually have it going while playing hearthstone. I will now have it going for classic wow so that my immersion will be complete.
---
Several of those are actually really not very good.
---
RCW
---
This is quality
---
CRAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIN
---
Thank you!
---
Apparently my family is the only ones to watch A Christmas Story on Thanksgiving to hype upcoming Christmas lol
---
There will almost certainly be new servers on launch day so don't worry too much about it.
---
That was the case in Wrath-MoP, but by Legion and now BFA, its very rare I find straight up incorrect information--possibly overgeneralized, but rarely incorrect.
---
Druid and maybe a Warrior
---
Again perspective.
---
You could also benefit by playing retail Wow, and earn a free sub. 
---
You CHOOSE not to do that. Others benefit from it who do choose.
---
While i agree, there is some difference in that the people you group with will you actually probably see again and play with again unlike in retail. So that at least would add some sense of actually wanting to communicate with people more
---
You’re too late
---
Maybe, but it's hard to tell as this community is obviously the group that is most interested in it. As I said, I am willing to pay $15, with some reservations, but $30 and I'd be out. $8-$10 and I'd feel like I was getting a good value. I'm sure there are hardcore folks here who would even pay $100/month. Everyone, no matter what financial situation, has a price they are willing to pay, a price they want to pay, and a price so low they don't even bother to cancel the sub when they quit. For me that's about $20, $10 and $5, but most people are less well-off than me so I'm skeptical that $15 is optimal pricing for the demand.
---
"Individual Class Steps - So far we have all the Horde and Alliance starting zones complete with all class steps.  You will see a class menu at the top of the screen for those guides.  The page will dynamically update all the steps and images in the guide to your specific class.  12-60 Horde Hunter, Warlock, Warrior and Druid are finished along with 12-60 Alliance Hunter as well.  The rest will come slowly over time."
---
Same. Also, I don’t see Shadow Zone by Static X. That entire album is gold.
---
EU English will take one as well.
---
DS/Ruin lock spec please!
---
But WoW is my life. How else am I to make money and feed my family.  
---
Shame on you.
---
A mad man.
---
I've been dueling on a 60 realm as a warrior and it's pretty easy to beat all the classes once you have full epics and some engineering gadgets.
---
WTB \[this\] pst
---
the invasion begins rofl
---
I think you missed the part where I said your perception of value is skewed.
---
They're such a pain to level. They're really not that good at solo world PvP (they have few escapes), and the DoT playstyle isn't terribly well suited to leveling. At least they have a pet to help tank, though.
---
Leveling them is also annoying due to the bag space drain of soul shards. Especially for your first character when you won't be able to just give yourself all 14-slot bags, it can be a real pain.
---
If the dude can't justify shelling out $15 for WoW I doubt he give anything away to some rando on Reddit.
---
And its not even as good as the last one on the front page.
---
I got exalted with Thunderbluff before 50 in vanilla. Around 48ish I think. It was my first character so I was a noob, just really wanted a kodo. I didn't know anything about running to Mulgore to get the early quests; I think I decided to do it around 30 or so and went back and did them. I don't know if there was a way to look up quests by rep, but if there was I definitely didn't know about it. I just did every quest I could find with a tauren quest giver.
---
There's a repeatable quest that pops up around 45 I think where you can turn in morrowgrain for rep - that was the big chunk of it. It's related to NPC druid stuff so it only works for Thunderbluff and Darnassus rep.
---
Man I had one of these! Got it back in cata! Good times haha
---
Adolph Hitler was a human!
---
Imo, the newer style can be fun, but not in the same way. 
---
I do like feeling like an absolute badass killing these insignifcant mobs - to me it makes more sense that I'd roll through these guys since I'll eventually be part of groups that kill the most powerful enemies in the world.
---
From a gameplay perspective, the newer leveling system is objectively worse. Leveling becomes one long grind. You don't have to think about the differences between the types of mobs you're killing - you just mow right through them no matter what. For example, the fact that the Defias Pillagers have that fireball spell doesn't matter even a little bit in the modern game. I swear that I've leveled a couple alts without dying to anything but enemy players.
---
Don’t take yourself so seriously pal, life’s more fun that way
---
TL; DR: Hey poor people listen to why my money makes me entitled and also better than you.
---
roll for chest?
---
*/random 100*
---
atleast you owned up to it :')
---
this is layering lol. just that you cant chose what layer you want to join from the realm selection screen. there will be que's because there will probably be a cap of 10 layers or something.
---
I just filled out a slip. My boss asked if I was gonna visit my family, and I said nah, staycation. I mentioned I was playing a game with my brother (true) and she thinks it’s dopey but it’s fine. This is my first time taken off all year. (I work in the construction industry too, but in the office. My SO is a PM/scheduler for the same company and the guys are friendly, but they just fill out the PTO slip like I do, and it’s either approved or not.)
---
Do you know of any other alternatives for other slots? I am making myself a spreadsheet with links to everything and was just curious.
---
Nope.
---
u/behemothdan am I remembering this wrong?
---
I've gone off the rails with bragging up RCW but I'm willing to put my foot in my mouth.
---
Nope
---
None because those are the worst names ever.
---
If you don't care about your name then you should be playing another game.
---
Finally settled on a lock myself. most casters even healers are going to have boring rotation during raids its just how classic is, spam xxxbolt, BUT with classic starting at 16 debuff slots for raids, locks will maybe be able to press a couple extra buttons. Lock is awesome for pvp with a few different builds to mess around with. I will say though shaman seems like a ton of fun PVP so I would recommend watching youtube videos on their various pvp specs and see what seems like more fun to you! best of luck.
---
Nice.
---
Cool collection!
---
Torn between human warrior/warlock or gnome warlock (my group of 5 friends are all running humans)
---
My old guild leader was one of the first on my server to get the Winterspring mount. It wasn't super fancy--just a different color of sabre. But he spent tons of time and dedication farming it.
---
You knew he played a lot when he stayed on it in IF. Now? I never know where half of the mounts come from.
---
Yes. If you're so broke that 6 dollars a month is a big deal, please don't spend it on WoW. Focus on getting your life back together.
---
He was speaking for me dammit. Wait your turn!
---
If Blizzard gives notice of new servers opening up, it should be possible to coordinate and reserve names, but it is a very difficult task especially with large groups.  This is a problem that Blizzard has never encountered at this level previously - people feel quite strongly about the names they had in the past, which was never a problem when original WoW released because people had no 'sense of ownership' of a name yet.
---
Personally I feel like right now it doesn't matter which server you are on - every single one will be overpopulated at launch because their strategy is to wait until they're overpopulated.
---
I realized that after I unboxed them all! I have another box of them and decided to keep those boxed lol
---
By playing. There were no guides when Classic first came out, so people just played the game and got good over time.
---
Take of the training wheels and come over to pvp.  STV will be absolutely glorious.
---
&gt; having vanillas obscure quest locations and paths memorized
---
lol
---
If you start on release day you'll have a 2 day head start on people who start 2 days after release day.
---
oh wow didn't realize, ty &lt;3
---
I want this!
---
didn't they have something like this in game already back then?.. I seem to remember some sort of looking for group tool or board thing but maybe im remembering it wrong either way this doesn't bother me at all.
---
Sounds like Diablo.
---
In 1.12 there was an AH in Stormwind though.
---
Thanks captain obvious.
---
They should have made Blaumeux a PvE server. It's still low pop after a couple days of being up. I think we hit the cap for pvp servers.
---
Need Mage! :D Great job on these.
---
Right and if you don't pace yourself you "hit the wall", keel over, and quit.
---
Has anyone thought that *possibly* all this queue fear they've been spewing isn't quite as bad as they're making it out to be?
---
Think about it.  They want a healthy and balanced population at launch *including* the people who will probably sub in the last day. Yet they're not locking servers and they're not opening more now.  
---
If all they said now was "hey guys - we're making a couple new realms. Maybe you should move kthnx". No one would move. There's no incentive. So the psychological game begins.
---
Exactly what I have been thinking
---
good ol lava runs
---
Who drew the logo if it wasn't Tinkerbell?
---
Thats How LAYERS WORK.
---
I was in Afterlife.
---
Coming in at 189 characters leaving precious little space in your macro (reducable to 157 if you change the name of `roarframe`): `/run if not roarframe then roarframe=CreateFrame"Frame"roarframe:RegisterEvent"UNIT_SPELLCAST_START"roarframe:SetScript("OnEvent",function(_,_,u)if u=="player"then DoEmote"roar"end end)end`
---
Might be reducable further if you hook an existing default ui frame that receives this event instead of creating your own frame.
---
Yes it is.
---
No, not that I know of!
---
I’d really like to know the actual number of Classic subs.
---
Ive moved to blaumeux because I got my names and I think it will fill up. I dont care about this. But I think this is 100% true and blizzard should have expected this and used it as a strategy
---
Not Classic, but going to Shattrath for the first time definitely crashed my PC.
---
TIL Nat Pagle is named after a dev named Pat Nagle.
---
Hmm, I'm sorry if it came off that way. I was broke once and I do not think I am smarter or a better person now that I finally have some money. I only mentioned that to try to prevent the general "if you can't afford $15/month..." comments. I can afford it. Just about every person in the first world can afford it in fact. But we all have choices about how to spend our money and we all should want to get the most relative value for it. I just wanted to talk about the relative value of classic wow vs other games on the market, that's all.
---
That cataclysm guide is an absolute unit
---
Lol, man, I kind of want you to convince me out of paladin! Healing, something I’m not terrible at and good PvP...not bad at all
---
So when I need things crafted at 5 in the morning when nobody is online I should wake them up and force them to come online and help me out?
---
Exactly! There is no way he is able to adapt to anything that happens at server launch. He wont be able do dodge bottlenecks effective enough and any basic knowledge outside of his single player game is non-existent. 
---
He probably wont be trying to tag unique mobs with trap and pet aggro and will lose important tags to any shaman spamming earthshock.
---
Don't forget Tool putting out a new album soon as well after 13 years
---
Man...I'm rolling Orc but I really want to relive the leveling experience in Mulgore.  Is it possible without too much trouble or bad consequences for quests??
---
&gt; Our raid leader made it a rule that if anybody shared, guild wide, leaked strategy they were in serious, serious shit.
---
That kind of thing in a game is something I miss. Knowledge having value, instead of everyone knowing everything instantly.
---
This is very true! Its just general Psych
---
What does it mean if I heard the music and that stupid sound centaurs make when they attack?
---
Fairbanks? Who’s Fairbanks ?
---
On the other thread assuming mods didn’t nuke it but if they did load the thread and replace the R in reddit.com with a C
---
Nice story man. And youre welcome on herod :) i can make your first wand if you go warlock.
---
Thanks! I agree, I wanted to be fair to everything that was considered popular at the time. Not everything holds up, but some songs really do. I was surprised by how many absolute bangers I managed to rediscover while putting this together.
---
i'm not ashamed to shitpost

You could just make green tea and add your own antifreeze.

I can’t decide between this and my new Ragnaros background... come on you guys are killing me here...

If you have fast internet, low ping, login a few minutes before, spam click the enter world button then you'll get a few ms head start
---
Apparently that is the consensus among the commenters in this post 😀
---
I can assure you there are way more diapers in Grobbulus than that picture
---
Congrats, you’re the 420th person to post this by now.
---
In regards to the dungeons que question dont even worry about that stuff man! sooooooo many people are going to be playing there is no way you wont find a group as whatever you play.
---
I'm baffled by their server name choices to be honest. Why not use names people *know* and like?
---
If you get in on Herod in day 1 you'll have a 2 day head start over everyone else.
---
I used to listen to a lot of Loreena Mckennitt back then I guess. /shrug
---
Hope you have an absolute blast bro have fun :)
---
Ether... wait
---
This was such a lovely read, thank you for sharing.
---
Horde sucks because its capital city is ugly and has a horrible layout. It's like some African mud hut slum
---
Blurred the name on the right but I can see it in the center. Skol.

Sponsored by: Alliance stealthers. "Go check out that lonely roof top ... no really."
---
Pet's actually went through a bunch of changes from 1.0 - 1.12. Certain versions had pets that did shadow damage (Lupos) or faster than normal movement speed (I think the rare plain strider from Mulgore?)
---
That being said, Attack speed normalization happened sometime after 1.12. I believe Wrath or Cata. Broken Tooth will have a 1.0 attack speed in classic.
---
Getting the drake stone with the correct suffix could take forever though. It's not something you start farming until you have literally everything else on your list.
---
I played vanilla wow, and got exalted with Darn via runecloth turn ins. Was just hoping to ease it a bit this time around  :)
---
\+1 for Vurtne.  
---
Inspired me a lot even though I played a warlock back then, mainly how to properly utilize movement and engineering.
---
Well legion was an unreal expansion and was really well received by the fan base. Legion was also the second latest expac. So to assume everything’s been shit since wotlk is a bit of a stretch. 
---
They’ve broken new ground time and time again and it’s like the fan base thinks the game got shut after 2010. Which wasn’t really the case. MoP has gone as one of the best expacs as well.
---
Bfa is shit, so continuing to sub and make noise isn’t all that bad either.
---
I guess we just see different solutions. If everyone followed your steps. Wow would be dead and we wouldn’t have classic. It’s a joint effort making classic a reality. Both Nost (and other pservers) + retail players have made this a reality
---
I spent most of vanilla re-rolling and re-rolling and you know what I learned?
---
Outside of cities you don’t even look at your character. It’s like your eyes do that thing they do with your nose where they block it because it’s always there.
---
We don't have actual numbers for Retail anymore, so it'll be hard to really know. That said, I think it's doubtful. We might get close though!
---
"It's fucking *werid*!"
---
People should just listen to blizzard and transfer off Herod. Stop being stubborn.
---
Just realized what I should’ve tried to name my lock....
---
If you dislike lying, you can always arrange for some people to get “married” in-game and attend. So if people ask you details, you can readily provide them! “Venue was pretty, but kind of weird. Lots of religious fanatics around, and people that looked like zombies? Plus, I’m not sure the bride and groom have been alive for a long time...”
---
After that, no one will ask any more questions.
---
Yes, competition. And I disagree that there is no competition on the market. Perhaps there is no strong MMO competition. I do think Classic WoW will be the premier MMO on the market and much better than retail WoW once it's released. But there is lots of semi-direct competition from other games and indirect competition from other entertainment sources like Netflix and Youtube.
---
k?
---
Hmm...Hmm...Hhhmm...HhhMm...HHHHhhMmmm! 🖐
---
&gt;competitors
---
&gt;pay money to random guy on internets for game  guide similar to those that are free
---
&gt;compete for world first
---
&gt;fail
---
&gt;compete for server first
---
&gt;quit the game before reaching 40 lvl cus this game is too hard

/roll alone defaults to 0-100 mate

Invasion? I agree with this guy and guess what? I played in Vanilla. Some people on here are delusional.

Welcome to America, your english is great now!

This guy IFs

Same, it was round two for names lol
---
I want to do the same as an Orc.  Do you know if it messes up any quests or is it fine to run over there and start questing?
---
This is how layers work, except layers are better than this.
---
Unfortunately I played warlock the first time around and I want to change it up.
---
They are overpopulated hellholes.  Plus Faerelina has most of the streamers, yuck.

I pay attention and use keybinds, so already miles ahead of the average player

---
Ha sh\*t, here we go again.

Yeah, sounds like shit.

Imagine thinking that extreme low effort and risk to undue a year’s worth of effort for someone is fun or good game design. I wonder why you’re not playing games like that still?
---
Reincarnate is great for wpvp!

I'm gonna hunt you down SKOL!

It's PvE, only thing that will suck is mob tagging.
---
Blizzard needs to get on this immediately!
---
Only this is: what to call this layered tech thingy?
---
all beauty must die my friend. lets move on together &lt;3
---
Warhammer Online was brilliant. WoW actually stole so many things from that game going forward. Their problem was the devs played the game so one faction was overpowered as shit. Also when they did an expansion and raised the level cap, **which they promised not to do** that is when it died. People were tired of their work being thrown away by a level increase in WoW and they said they wouldn't be doing that.
---
Very much agreed. There has been many shady things going on, such as RMT websites making server discords. Honestly, I'd be most skeptical of the data that some of these leveling addons are gathering, given how actively they've been promoting themselves.
---
I so look forward to all the random tells I get from people doing a "/who warrior 60"!
---
Quilboar.
---
&gt; I played NE hunter during vanilla and kinda wanna go re live my NE hunter life 
---
Same here, dude!  I really wanted to roll Hunter again, but ended up choosing a class I've never played before (Warrior).  Good luck with whatever you decide on.

Right.
---
Though really there's little point moving until closer to launch or launch day, every server currently available is gonna have stupid queues.
---
&gt; Nope. Don't like that. Not joining those people.
---
I agree. Addons shouldn't spam chat channels.
---
+1 because of Paladins
---
-1 because of Cows
---
server name is, and so is giving proper warning.  with ~5 days left, we're very quickly running out of time.  a few hours is not enough warning for guilds and friends to coordinate to switch realms, and if their character names get taken, they won't switch.
---
I had the same problem the other day, tried a number of fixes so I can’t say for sure what solved it but I think updating my graphics driver was the key, maybe give it a try?

Did anyone look to see if the  Hunter's **Eyes of the Beast** works on targets of **Gnomish Mind Control Cap** ? This worked in classic but was phased out at some point, as the "pet" controlled by the cap was actually a *minion*. 
---
It's worked on pservers, but I was curious if anyone tested it in the beta.
---
Salt
---
Paladin and hunter both have one. Warrior charge stun. Rogue has like 3 stuns.
---
Sorry, new player in general what makes Dwarf so desirable?
---
They'll probably add more and people will bitch and moan about not wanting to switch over because they're "only" medium population after being open for 2 hours.
---
Hopefully this addon will get banned.
---
I have one too — the phone app is far superior though.
---
This pic is inaccurate. There should be a 20k player queue.
---
That website confuses me on the initial quests. If I'm an Orc in the start zone, the first thing it tells me is to grab the [Report To Sen'jin Village](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=805) quest which has two pre-requisite quests with the first one requiring level 2 (at least in private vanilla servers despite the database saying level 1).
---
So I'm left wondering if I should complete the other quests in the zone or just unlock Report To Sen'jin Village as soon as possible. But if I leave Valley of Trials so soon I may not be able to kill the level 5-7 NPCs from a following quest. I never really tried to follow the guide in vanilla/Classic beta so I'm unsure about it.
---
Two of my friends who are rolling with us never gave it a crack back in the day. I'm sure there will be loads of new people. He'll, I haven't played since like 2012 and have forgotten so much I figure I may as well be new.

Incorrect. Blizzard has been saying for the past week there will be queues. Server still have a population cap.    
---
Layering is designed to spread the players out during launch, without congregating hundreds of players into a single zone, slowing and ruining the experience for everyone.
---
All 3 are pvp specs basically, very few useful pve talents compared to our biggest rivals the god forsaken no skill item grabbing class mage

Maybe not as user friendly but yes. It's basically the exact same thing as spamming trade chat, it's just displayed graphically instead.
---
Horde scum? I hear ya buddy.
---
how stupid are you? this is layering lol. just that you cant chose what layer you want to join from the realm selection screen. there will be que's because there will probably be a cap of 10 layers or something. lets say 4k are on each layer then 40,000 people will be able to join without being in que. that sounds reasonable for one server.
---
!remindme 5 days
---
No, even with layers you will have massive queues.
---
Warrior checks all those boxes, everything had a simple rotation compared to today’s standards. For both of those classes auto attacks and the buffing of those auto attacks is the majority of your damage.
---
People say warriors were terrible at leveling, and at a lot of aspects they were. Fury however excels at killing 1 mob very quickly, so they grind quite well.

I'd say the average player pays attention and uses keybinds.

What does Ally have on the PvE side besides Sword spec from Humans and Gnome int? How does that beat Berserk and Blood Fury? Not to mention Tauren tanks.

Don’t forget about hoping your gear Mcforges to the highest level or else you’re running it again for the same item!

sucks oce only has 1 pvp and its listed as HIGH already, obviously not worth adding a new one for such a low player base so it makes queue times unavoidable ;(

Please no.  Sit in the front and ask any question your professor can answer.

I for sure couldn't but I still made it work. You don't need to play 8 hours a day to get somewhere in WoW. The game was supposed to be a more causal MMO in the first place.

He started on the game as a quest designer but was a game director I believe by the time post launch end game content was being rolled out. Regardless of timing he was always the visible spokesperson for the direction the game was heading by then (here's a later interview where he discusses his role https://www.gameinformer.com/games/world_of_warcraft_cataclysm/b/pc/archive/2009/12/02/blizzard-s-jeff-kaplan-on-warcraft-s-past-and-future.aspx ).

Sure. Parachute jumps are not getting cheaper cause there is a wow out there or you can go skating for 3$ per hour or visit aquapark, go to cinema, theater, spa.

Trick will be to time your entrance into the queue so you're in the game at 20 minutes prior to servers.

Even as an Alliance druid (feral hybrid), the difference facing an Orc vs any other race is incredible. Getting your stuns resisted changes everything. When I saw a non-orc warrior, I know the fight would be easy. An orc warrior became a nightmare and I'd usually resort to a more magical damage approach.

I'm an old guy, and in no way an expert on marketing or game subs.  I was actually kind of surprised that it was still floating at $15 instead of inflating along with everything else.  :D
---
I would be surprised if they drop it tho, since they are kind of banking on diehards who have fought so hard to get it back onto a bliz platform and are likely to pay for it. (no changes ;D)
---
I don't know how much of a drop off difference the extra $8/m would make, but I would guess not much.  It might make a difference in getting new subs tho, players who are the "sale watchers" that might bite and get hooked.  But that type of audience probably wont jump up to the higher price point for retail, or if they do won't be the ones spending big money in cash shop.
---
I'm glad I don't halfta make the call.  Trying to make the right call where your consumer are a mix of old and new gamer nerds and outspoken net trolls has got to lead to many grey hairs!
---
I was in one of those 134 guilds.  We killed KT probably 3 weeks before BC came out and it was an amazing experience simply due to how much we wiped on him. You had to use every available world buff to do it. We had the ZG buff, dire mail, onxyia head ,etc.  I think people are In for a rude awakening. Mechanic wise vanilla wasn't hard but leveling and gearing up are much more a slog than people think. between getting rep to break runes and having FR gear for the tanks and at least 1-2 pieces for the rest of the raid will take some time.
---
Its one of a few possibilities that wont be decided on/announced until post phase 6 in classic.
---
&gt;Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.  
---

Wow, that's quirky.

Ah yes mankind back at it again with their greed not that i had any plans to use a guide its funny that its free all these years and now that classic is hype he slaps a fee on it haha all i can say is expect hate for your greed
---
People are in for a big surprise, the day Naxx releases it’ll get cleared. It’ll be more common to see Tier 3 than to not see Tier 3 not long after that. Nothing does anything, brains are smarter now.
---
Didn't they wey there wouldn't be any queue at launch ?
---
So is "great" better or worse than "very strong"? And is "strong" better than "arguably the best"?
---
I'm only teasing, good writeup, but I liked how it made every class sound even better than the one before.

Debuff slots in general, not just dots.  Minor correction :)

There will never be a time where people don't get pissed when people are speaking slurs at one another. So to do so and say the people you are insulting should just suck it up is just a person being an empathetic asshole. Your God awful belief that marginalized groups that think half the world is out to get them in, is a problem that you perpetuate and infects otherwise happy people. But go ahead, keep convincing yourself the rest of the world needs to lighten up, it's them that needs to change, the ones minding their own business seeking fulfilling lives and happiness that you shit on. Feeling amusement over other people's grief and anger is the most sickening thing in all of the human existence. I'd love to hear your take on how being verbally abusive is a good thing.
---

I mean there's still alot of people who believe the world is flat, invariably there will be some crossover and some of them will play games like WoW classic.
---
I still have all this music which I originally got from Limewire so I'm all set to go.
---
They haven't revamped milk to milk 2.0, and it's been around for 100's of years longer than WoW, it should be free by now or damn close to it.
---
Nah it auto refreshes
---
They are easy to level and get a free mount.  Polls show them behind mages but not by a huge amount. There will be plenty of them in classic.
---
&gt;So there is a limit to the amount of layers?
---
... yes. There's a limit on the amount of players, which means there's a limit on the amount of layers.
---
&gt;They are using the post as a warning to get people on other realms.
---
Yes, and do you know why? Because the queues will be hours and hours long.
---
Do you know why the queues will be hours and hours long? Because the servers have population caps.
---
Do you know why the servers have population caps? Because they eventually need to shrink down to one layer, and allowing two hundred fucking thousand people on the realm day 1 and later making the cap 5k is incredibly dumb when they could simply have a smaller cap now. A smaller cap now encourages people to spread out now, before they invest hundreds of hours in their character that they later wouldn't be able to play.
---
&gt;You sound like to believe everything you read, and dont think critically.
---
This isn't even thinking critically, it's common fucking sense.
---
People from retail are grabbing names, because why the hell not.  They have 832 mounts 420 pets, so why not grab 3 names on Classic just in case there is an achievement for it.
---
Jokes aside, don’t forget the ~X million players in retail with classic access for free, who just may want to dabble for a couple months between retail patches.
---
Glad I didnt buy into that lol
---
I wish I could remember which one of our players was the first R14. I want to say a warrior, Jorhik maybe? There were a handful of us who PvP'd on the regular, but we were mostly focused on raid progression.
---
When I play Classic (and I will) I'm going to be enjoying more PvP and RP. In fact, RP and story involvement is the thing I've never done with WoW. I play D&amp;D and other more character-driven games and I do enjoy the WoW realms and lore, but I played it strictly for competition from day one and it's the one thing I feel I'm missing in the experience.
---
Can’t wait until they release BFA that game looks sweet
---
I'm doing this.
---

---
And spend 50g on respecs every day?
---
What's wrong with wanting something to not change? Doesn't mean you dislike blizzard, only their reason for doing it - hence vocalising it for the best chance at getting the real classic experience
---
There's some real bs from blizz here. If low pop realms are the equivalent of a vanilla realm then why are they packing multiple times that many in classic realms. Yes there'll be a drop off but a 5x player drop off? Nah. The game will retain a lot of casual players because there's more hours of content than retail. 
---
Inb4 "we can't remove layering because the games too popular."
---
The exact opposite. I'm annoyed by people attacking Joana, who has been a part of the community, for their own benefit. That, and I do not trust their intentions in the slightest. Some of those addons/guides are potentially backed by RMT websites.
---
I get what you're saying, but we literally are capable of growing enough food to end world hunger. It's just not profitable and doesn't help people make money.
---
sucks for all the full server players who took a day off work next Monday. Don't even bother.
---
Hunter is absolutely not the choice for a new player. There's reason why so many of them are called huntards (they are the hardest class to play in pvp). They also require a shit ton of micro management to play at a respectable level.
---
They are easy AF to level with, yes. But a new player playing a hunter will be in for a shock once they hit 60.
---
It doesn't.  
---
But be prepared for some mumbo jumbo about how all the skeletons littered across a battlefield made such an impact on their playing experience.
---
Not entirely correct. Player skeletons will still be in the game, they will however despawn if the player who left the skeleton dies again in a different location (where they'd leave behind a new copy of their skeleton).
---
&gt; it's common fucking sense.
---
Yet, here we are. See you in 5 days friend. Blizz isnt going to let 5 hour long queues. oof.

A lot of wpvp happens in pve spec. There will be those players who focus solely on pvp and will be specced properly for it. But lots and lots of players are gonna be in dungeon/raid spec. You just make do, and fight with what you have!
---
Id fire that consultant...
---
Warlocks are weaker on the first few raids but they compete with mages in the later couple raids. They are always strong in PvP. They also have good utility for raids, especially with summons.
---
Just save the pieces of gear you want in the bank and equip them when you're in town.

You act like Joana invented the cure to a rare desease and makes money off of it.

It´s not something "special", many people know efficient ways to level. It´s just a lot of work to put it all down in writing. He definitely should use it for the benefit of himself.

Complete with the Mantle and Whitemane's Chapeau, there isn't much better than that for mid-tier looks.  The real question is will I farm SM for the Rod or give up like most people.

Yeah, here you are. Lmao.

But so can't ride through certain low areas like doors.

Just looking for links here my dude. Ty

we have a warrior , two rogues and a priest i'm pretty sure, mostly PvP focused, probably won't do super late game raids and stuff

Yes I would love to explain! First of all, me his sister, decided to post this on my own. He never knew I did it. I explain in many if the comments he lost power and and the nearly 10k ppl watching him on screen did not know why the feed cut out mid interview. So I posted this to let them know what happened. I woke up today and just found out about all the controversial stuff about his guide. I don't keep track of how he does his business nor do I care. And I am very close to my brother I always look out for him since we were young because he is the spectrum which a lot of people don't even know. And he is very ill. So I am always concerned about him. The post was an informative one on my part to his followers. Second of all, you can't fake devastating weather. If you would like pics of all the nearby damage I would be happy to show you. I can't believe all the awful things people have been saying about Paul it makes me sick. It breaks my heart because he is the kindest human being I have ever known and the fact that you feel my post from 3 days ago has a hidden agenda of some sort bamboozles me. Maybe it mutated into a marketing element of some sort but that was never the purpose of this post. Thank you for allowing me to explain and please have a blessed night 😊
---
I'd say you got your moneys worth on that mouse.... just let it retire man.... I guess old boy was right - for some things in life "you think you want, but you don't" is true!  Classic wow wasn't one of them, using this mouse is!
---
The easiest rule, might makes right. If they were stronger they wouldn't worry about spawning multiple skeletons.
---
destro good lvling spec? .....
---
I feel bad for the rogue that stabs that bag tryna bank him! 😂

Health cookies, soul shards and summoning group mates to the entrance to an instance are what we're best known for.

Omfg this is so cool ty so much for letting me know about this
---
I'm really torn between mage and rogue.  I played rogue main from vanilla till TBC. I had a mage alt. I loved my mage more towards the end of my time in the game, but perhaps i was just a little bored at that point.  I am leaning toward mage this time. But i'm worried i will miss out on cool wPvP stuff that you can do with stealth. Back in the day I would always go to ironforge and gank.  I was a dueling BEAST. I loved that.  Mage is more useful and has a lot of fun abilities. 
---
My main leveling partner will be a rogue. It would be fun to both be able to use stealth. But then again mage and rogue would be a great duo.  I'll be playing often but not HARDCORE. I plan on raiding but not like i did back in the day... just casually. I have  wife and a job and a lot has changed since then.
---
Help me figure out what to do! pros and cons from either POV.  I will be on an NA pvp server and going horde. Im 55% mage and 45% rogue at this moment.
---
You're trying really hard to split hairs, aren't you? His guide was created *in vanilla* and was perfectly usable and complete. All the updates to this point were for **extremely** minor efficiencies.
---
It's still gated by time and commitment, even if the person is a potato.
---
Ah let us wait for downvotes together brother
---
Yo dude I had this exact same dilemma, and I went with orc after reading all the hardcore opinions "helps vs rogues, helps vs nades which good players use".   Played 30+ warsong gulches and countless duels on the private pvp server everyone has been practicing on. 
---
Literally only won a single fight due from stun resist, when me and opponent were both super low hp I resisted a grenade that would have interrupted my winning immolate-&gt;conflag.   I wanna say that literally every single time you resist rogue cheap shot, the rogue is going to use blind, gouge, or any of their other tools to stun you / return to stealth and your stun resist was entirely useless. Never once was a stun resist what won my fight with a rogue. 
---
Conversely wotf makes a significant guaranteed swing in the fight vs priests and warlocks.   If you roll undead and have wotf as well as a spellstone the match up becomes incredibly easy compared to orc
---
Every time I select solo human warrior it only goes up to level 12. Am I just viewing a cashed version or something??
---
Yeah they have no business being so fast. I wish they at least animated them bounding quickly instead of that hyperspeed shuffle they do.
---
Thankfully I had just finished undergrad.  22 and living in an apartment with my two best friends.
---
Wow thats interesting, thanks for sharing!
---
I've done 60-ish hours once and at around the 24 hour mark I felt terrible but it passed after a while and sort of never came back. The exhaustion really hit me though once I stopped and went to go lie down - I literally just passed out and didn't wake up for about 10 hours.
---
Not making any point, just agreeing with OP in the insane bloat issue. I’m used to P99.
---
Go play BFA loser
---
Yep because the market agreed with you for the 15 years so far. 15 a month is totally unsustainable /s.
---
You know the beautiful think about markets? While yes they play off the preferences of the masses they don’t play off your personal preference. So if you don’t think it’s worth 15 - don’t fucking play you doughnut.
---
I wouldn't count on it. You mention all these games you've spent time on yet not a single one relies on server infrastructure like WoW. It costs like hundreds of thousands to fund these alone.
---
Absolutely right
---
Give him a break he's probably a vikings fan with that name, they're a little slow.

Nice. Following!

If you’re the guy who does these drawings, I love them.

I get a dull pain in my left hand after playing my havoc DH in retail wow. What are the lowest APM classes in classic?
---
Paladin and sword spec gives the alliance a slight advantage.
---
They could solve the issue by just having the skeleton of the dead player spawn in a random location within 3 meters of where they died. Can't spell anything out and we still get the effect.
---
3 meters is 3.28 yards
---
They already point blank said they aren't increasing the caps further. 
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.
---
[\(source\)](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835)
---
But I guess your stance is just that they are lying about that. I mean I hope there aren't queues, but I fully anticipate there will be on many servers and some much worse than others.
---
I asked Aratar to clarify. I've been sober a while but my brain cells, Frick and Frack, have taken a beating over the years. I get excited when I talk about Vanilla raiding and I could definitely be mashing up the memories. It's all good. All through BWL we had our eyes on world and US firsts and it was super exiciting. When Nef was firsted we were a little bummed, but that's life.
---
&gt; Lmao.
---
Just keep hitting next step, it should have darkshore as the next section to follow.
---
Were parts of Wrath easy? Absolutely. Were some of those easy parts put in place to remove some arguably arbitrary requirement? Yes.
---
Were all of the hard parts of Vanilla actually the result of well designed challenge? Not even close. Were some of Vanillas well though out and challenging mechanics removed or changed with little care? Certainly.
---
Wrath was generally easier, yes, but *only* generally. Let's be honest about some things:
---
* Hard modes like Obsidian Sanctum and Ulduar were super creative, super flavorful, super well designed, and certainly more mechanically challenging than anything in Vanilla. 
---
* Heroic raids like ToGC and ICC were more challenging still, and achieved this through creative and fun mechanics.
---
* Achievements would force you to change how you approached a fight and provided tangible reward at the end.
---
* Almost every spec was viable and had varying skill floors and caps, and variety of spell usage in rotations on average was well in excess of that in Vanilla 
---
Vanilla die-hards have some genuinely good arguments about TBC and Wrath. But to blindly argue difficulty as a sweeping argument against them is silly (and so much of the focus is on 5 mans, come on guys, there's so much more to the game than that). A significant part of the reason that Vanilla was difficult was because people had no clue how to play the game well.
---
And just a comment on Cata: In my personal experience, many people liked the more challenging Heroics. Some did not, but I have not heard of anyone who quit because of that difficulty spike. I quit but for very different reasons, that I think most people can agree on.
---
* It changed several classes beyond recognition for little to no reason and in ways that made extremely little sense.
---
* It significantly slowed down game play.
---
* It grew LFG into LFR.
---
* But most importantly, everything started becoming cross-realm. Server communities that had been established over 6 years began to die a slow and painful death.
---
Is there a legend?
---
I know but they flat out broke it at one point and made it super lame!
---
Yeah i messed up
---
For me it was the first scarab scene, where it crawls into the warden’s skin and up to his brain. I was fucking terrified of beetles after that.
---
If old school runescape is any indication of the amount of players that will flock from the live game to the old one, with enough time classic will be the new retail experience lol.
---
I don't really mind different types of mounts, so long as you know how rare or difficult they were to get.  Lots of times you see hundreds of different mounts in MMOs and they look so damn amazing and then you learn it was either a cash shop mount or something they basically give away.
---
Death was only the beginning
---
why? i dont remember guards on them. now getting TO them might be a different story!
---
10x level 60s is great, but who will be the first to 10x thunderfury
---
Cata put all the portals in stormwind and a bank closer to the AH in stormwind, in ironforge the bank is literally across the road from the auction house and is much closer to other end game content.
---
It’s also not classic at all
---
Cool! I'm still occasionally updating it. I intentionally limited this playlist to one song per artist (excluding some features here and there) for the sake of diversity. Definitely made it tough to choose each song!

Oh LOL. Yes I did.

Orcs are hardly little waifs themselves...

Yea those are supposed to lead to the Emerald Dream, I think.
---
Orgrimmar has the little path to the Barrens and Thunder Bluff has 2 elevators on opposite sides of the central bluff IIRC
---
It is cheaper than retail, you don't have to buy the game.
---
Im kinda outa the loop on this one. So the big deal is that skeletons despawn? Like when you die, and run back to your corpse your reclaim your body and your skeleton is there.
---
So this isn't happening anymore? your body wont leave behind a skeleton?
---
Actual answer: the games entire premise is about the faction war.  The name of the game is war craft.  War.  Blizzard understands that not everyone wants to be dealing with pvp server life.  So they have given you a pve server.  But that should not be construed as "as designed". You are removing a part of the game by doing that.  That is why people will shit on them.
---
haha I love all the classes really, just I went to rank 13 and did pre-made's so I think I am qualified to say a bit about all the healers. Genuinely though any healer is better than no healer :D
---
The ripping and the tearing.
---
Sweeeet I’m in this video :)
---
Raiding got significantly more complex and mecha cally difficult actually. Sunwell holds second place for the least amount of full clears and the raid mechanics in BFA are dramatically upscale from any vanilla content. The homogenization I'm referring to is the culling of the talent tree, abilities, class uniqueness, and barrier of entry. In retail, the talent tree for any spec is just a "pick one of these three abilities/modifiers" every 10 or so levels. Theres no talent points or tree anymore. A huge number of class specific and utility abilities have also been outright removed or, in reverse, given to way too many classes. A good example is fall damage mitigation. If my memory serves correct, the only class that doesnt have the ability to ignore fall damage with the press of a button now is Warlock. An example of the flip side is Blizzard taking away Hunters tranq shot, something that used to be an integral ability in raids even though it does no damage. Hell, thanks are just glorified dps at this point and even follow pretty rigid rotations for damage since almost all defensive CDs are off the GCD. My last point about barrier of entry is referring to access to content. No matter how casual you are in retail, you can easily experience all dungeon and raid content via LFG and LFR queuing. Attunements dont exist and every raid has 4 difficulty levels with LFR being the easiest and having an auto group finder feature. If you have the required ilvl, you can queue right into the last boss of the current raid tier and likely kill it while completely ignoring mechanics.
---
I've said this before and I'll say it again

Every single mount added devalues every mount that exists

Every retexture added devalues the original

I'm confused you don't think tbc is happening?  We can put money in escrow how much would you like to lose?

wont be like this for the majority of dads, if your kid is older than atleast 8 then at evenings he is either with his friends or he plays something himself, they most likely have free time on the evenings from 6 to 10 and thats enough to raid even naxxramas. my mom and dad always used to watch tv at evenings while i played myself, they could have just as well played wow. obviously if your kid is young he probably likes to spend more time with you, but often its the mom who plays with them and reads stories.

---
I reckon 8AM will be early enough for a lot of people to login right on 8AM, but a good chunk of them will have to bail after a while and go to work/school/uni. At least thats what I hope...
---
So like I said, I am ignorant on his stuff so I havent seen his guide, I was just sharing what an outsider might see
---
I'm a fairly veteran player, so for me WoWheads class guides are enough for me, so maybe they'll do for you, they give you a talent build, abilities to buy and which zones to do
---
That's all I need but I'm planning to enjoy my time and take my time, I'm not rushing to 60, maybe a light jog to 60 :)
---
It could.  Something like... a **RE-POST**!
---
If you install this just block me now.
---
Yes, I am aware.

What’s the level requirement for that? I’ve heard it’s a top tier pvp tame due to perfect attack speed
---
We outgrew the world.
---
The gloves, belt, legs, and boots slots from this image (and all the BiS lists) are pretty reasonable to obtain and are very good.
---
Green “of Frozen Wrath” gear is always an option.
---
I think bracers do not really matter much pre-raid, so you could just grab any of the high INT options like [Magister’s Bindings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16683/magisters-bindings) After a while, one could even buy Arcanist bindings (T1) off the AH if some are for sale and you can’t find time to raid, they are quite good and early hardcore guilds will soon have extras.
---
[Arcane Crystal Pendant](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20037/arcane-crystal-pendant) is a fine Neck from a mage quest.
---
I also think it’s worth mentioning how good [Hypnotic Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade) and [Icefury Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7514/icefury-wand) are for being so easy to acquire at such a low level. They will easily last 20+ levels til 60, though you’ll prob want to upgrade the wand for solo dps purposes.
---
Port? What about an airport?
---
I think its a good idea. I would do it if i worked hundreds or thousands of hours working at something. I see it as the same thing as a book.   
---
If someone writes a good book i dont get mad that they want to sell it. I would gladly pay for a good book. I dont think people that write books should have to give them for free and live of donations that some people give and hope people actually support when its an option... (few do) But thats my take on it i think what hes doing is in the right 100%
---
Did that a while ago, built a beefy rig so that I could play any AAA game with high refresh/resolution... Ended up playing old classic games like OSRS, WoW, Maple, Dota, LoL.. These are the games I enjoy playing, AAAs are not my jam..

I eventually sold the PC and just use my laptop connected to an external monitor, just as sufficient tbh.

Not really. All it does is spam trade chat for you and lists everyone else spamming trade chat in a list.

Cloth turn ins were a thing during the stress test.  So I’d be willing to bet they’re a thing in the live version.

God damn this was helpful but now I'm back to indecision. Ahhhhhh. Thanks man for real

LOL no.
---
Are you on Etsy?
---
Have you ever heard of metaphors or exaggeration for comedic effect?
---
They have indicated it is for both reasons. Ion said that each layer will hold an entire server's worth of players. Accordingly, it does allow for an increased population at launch, in addition to smoothing the choke points.
---
Which faction is supreme?
---
The joke
---
Your head
---
I feel like with the booming numbers that there seems to be, some Pserver people are going to start a meta-narrative about how new players are going to "ruin" Classic. Just as an excuse to go back to not paying for WoW.
---
It's not a documentary but give this is a read (you can get an ebook still), it has a lot of stories from WoW development.

Hey everyone, first off, beautiful wallpaper. Thank you for this. Second, if the wallpaper is laggy for anyone, make sure your FPS aren't capped at 5. I think this is the default setting. You can change this by clicking the little cog wheel on the top right of wallpaper engine. I hope this helps.

Yes please! I'd pirate WoW if I could.

I am trying to remember exactly. I remember our placement for the first dragon in the cubby inside the door and the next two were in the same place by the steps for line of sight. I don't think Chromaggus was the same night as them because we went through at least a two sets of breath combinations. I can still remember Prudence going "time lapse, frost burn, time lapse, frost burn, it's not that difficult."

I think it was more of an observation than a point.
---
I personally love grinding random junk mobs. Azshara has basically zero quests in vanilla but is chock full of low-50s beasts and hippogriffs. I remember running around killing bullshit mobs and skinning them for levels at a time without ever seeing a player. You have to factor in ganks and competition when you look at efficiency, and the exp and money was great despite the lack of quests.
---
I'd love for YOU to provide a clip of proof that he's said the entire guide would eventually be behind a paywall before today, but seeing as how his stream is up basically all the time replaying his videos and it's pretty much not possible to pick through the entire thing and find one single few-second statement, I'm not so naive to ask you to do that.
---
As for that first bit, I've been playing since vanilla and owned Joana's guide back in the day when it cost like $25, thanks. The questing order, spots where he says you should grind for a while, hearthing, etc. is nearly identical. Almost every single change is small changes in the order you turn in or accept quests, a few obnoxious ones to avoid like escorts, and things like that.
---
And that still happens, just with a somewhat smaller number of skeletons. It really doesn't change anything significant.
---
Humar &gt; Broken Tooth.
---
That is all.
---
Locks are boss PvP period. In PVE your dps is mediocre through BWL but bring tons of utility. AQ &amp; NAXX locks do ridiculous damage and compete with Ignite mages. Anyone saying otherwise didn't play a lock or was a shitty lock during vanilla.
---
I agree it got easier to gear for endgame, but I think what happened was that the skill floor got lowered, rather than the skill ceiling. In fact, I'd argue that the skill ceiling continued to rise. Content is very likely more mechanically challenging even now in retail than ever before in WoW's history. But I don't think many people remember to differentiate between skill floor and skill ceiling.
---
I also remember being able to raid on an alt with less knowledge of my class than I should. But that was certainly closer to the end of the expansion, and the probability of that being successful in hard mode / heroic content is much lower. I'm willing to bet on it.
---
Ultimately, more people got to see the raids, but Blizzard didn't make Yogg-0 lights any easier (they did make it easier once, but technically they were just making it *possible*). 
---
Also, some specs didn't even really have a rotation to learn in Vanilla. Cast 1 or 2 spells until you run out of mana, then wand while you regen.
---
Honestly this isn't that big of deal to me, it doesn't insta teleport you, it still requires u to download the plugin so you dont have to use it. No different than any tool scraping text chat for keywords.

Oof as a warlock main...demo in pvp. Ya you can...but there are 2 better options

The increased mount roster gives more agency to players ,allowing them to decide what to ride

I feel like my post speaks for itself. It's not a huge deal, but it's not negligible either.

Came here to say this

how about the other 6 games on Bnet that run on their servers yet don't have a monthly subscription cost?
---
this warmed my cold, dead heart and i loved it. glad to have you in murica brother, enjoy azeroth xo
---
Shaman. Good healers and fuck shit up PVP if you know what to do and geared.
---
How is Orc better than Undead for Lock?
---
Yep, this is some real stuff. Raiding for five or six straight hours with 40 people is difficult. I remember the first time we cleared MC start to finish in one night it was a really big deal. Then it got down to a relatively quick run, and when it got nerfed we basically speed ran it with music blaring in Team Speak.
---
But it can't be overstated how freaking difficult the early raids were when they were released.
---
Orc Rogues are badass visually personally. Plus pretty rare to see.

Well perhaps the market is speaking and Blizzard is not listening as WoW sub number have deteriorated from 10 million+ to &lt; 2 million in the last decade. Obviously price is not the only factor, but I'd gander it's a large one

Thanks man!

I'll be rolling priest come release, unsure which race to play on horde (with the unique class racial buff) I know the Dwarf on alliance side is the GOAT of priests.

Parry haste only affects the main hand swing timer but if being attacked - the parry can be triggered by both a main hand and off hand swing.
---
I find vanilla to be way more about positioning than later expansions. It's hard to describe, but I really like it. I found the next couple expansions became about memorizing specific encounters to deal certain classes and it felt tedious. Vanilla was always fresh.
---
Yeah stay on Herod. Do not come to the other servers :)
---
I honestly don't get this logic...like at all. I mean, sure, people will try it and not like it, but if you look at the sub numbers for the original vanilla WoW, they never went down, only up across its two year life cycle. I get that Blizzard is unsure of Classic's performance in the current market, but I have a feeling that they are underestimating the interest in their product for a second time. Vanilla WoW was literally THE game back in the day. It destroyed peoples lives and was all over the news and pop culture! If I was a betting man, I'd say this is going to be big. How do I know? Well I don't but what I can say is that I started in Wrath, and the idea of a game I've never even played before excites me more than retail does today!
---
Classic was heaven for me as a casual. Once I started hardcore raiding I couldn't just go do dungeons when I wanted, farm when I wanted. I had to get this thing, that thing, min/max everything.
---
Maybe it was the time, maybe it was the game, maybe both.
---
never forghetti
---
Hey, thanks for the reply. I'll DM you in a day or two when I have a little more time so we can figure out if Convicts would be a good fit for me and vice versa. Stalagg is definitely on my short list of servers.
---
Bank space would quickly fill
---
Applauds on the fallacious argument. I don't know what your agenda is, but I'll say that if you are part of any RMT, then I sincerely hope that it fails. If you simply don't want to pay for a guide, then don't. Ignore the man and move on. There is no need to slander and attack a member of the community. If you simply think that the guide hasn't changed, then feel free to use a older guide. You are within your right to value $5 over hours of your time.
---
Whatever it is, chill with the toxicity and just have fun in Classic.
---
Skeletons will still exist, they just won't last as long. As soon as you die a 2nd time, the first skeleton you left will disappear.
---
For some reason this is causing people to go berserk and seethe with rage, claiming that skeletons are "a huge aspect of vanilla" and other such nonsense.
---
It's not a "defense", it's a design principle and they are sticking to it.
---
My guild hit MC early in Vanilla (like January 2005ish) and we had a decent amount of people under 60 raiding. Most people had multiple green items and non-bis blues. Shit we first killed Luci like that with just 27/40 people. (hint Luci is easier with less than 40 if you're undergeared or have a bunch of new people to MC)
---
Looks like Alexa Bliss
---
Say what you will about that game, their brawls are by far the most unique events. Far more innovative than any single WoW quest. Kill boars, pick up poop, etc. Every quest is the same. 
---
Pat definitely went to the game that offered more variety in design.
---
Oh god the right image gave me nightmares. It looks exactly like my friend we used to run dungeons with at level 40ish in ZF.  
---
This particular mage had about 1000hp at level 40(my 29 twink had I think over 2k HP or close to 3k), was specced fire, and honestly had the worst situational awareness. Couple that with another warlock that also had about the same situational awareness... it made for a hell of a time. Example:
---
I was rogue/group leader. I mark out the targets for a pull... Skull, X, Moon(sheep), Circle(sap) and everyone's ready. I go in with the sap and the fight starts after tank pulls. Then what do I see? Dots on the sheep target. So for the next 15 + seconds of the dot's duration, this mage just kept sheeping the damn target until I noticed this and had to tell him to stop and just DPS the marked targets. 
---
Then what does he do? He AOEs the entire group hitting the sapped target as well and omg the mayhem. During the fight, i hear from then Teamspeak this "thud thud thud" sound from the healer. So I ask him what's going on? He replies "well, if I don't spam flash heals on mage, he dies instantly." and every pull basically went like this with me needing to stunlock mobs that goes after healer cause tank couldn't really tank either.
---
So that was our group. But it was so much fun compared to current wow. Will I play vanilla again? Nah. My friends aren't playing and I don't have time to sit through 2-3 hour dungeon runs.
---
Priests can’t really kite if something wants to be in our face so I’m not sure what point you think you’re making.  We can face tank a warrior really well though so see you in the BGs.
---
It's an old business model, pre-dating netflix. It wasn't uncommon for older internet forums and websites to have a subscription model to access content.
---
I went with an alienware, the only brand capable of 420 fps
---
Well we did ask for 1.12. The fact that they're delaying the catch-up gear from 1.10 is more than we asked for.
---
Pretty much. I'm doing overtime M-F next week 😥
---
Man, Bawls was the drink back then though
---
&gt;I would argue priest will have more loot competition
---
False.........no one is taking healing cloth over a Priest (in any organized group).
---
i will accept that also as canon.
---
Where does your complete trust of Blizzard come from?

They will still get to the game first tho unless it crashes and burns.
---
Cool
---
Not at all. I still love playing Kingdom Hearts 2, which came out around the same time as vanilla. Not for nostalgia, just because it has really good gameplay and progression.
---
I also love playing SSX Tricky from like 2002, again, because the gameplay is just really good, and better in my opinion than the later SSX titles.
---
Same could be said for SSB Melee... WoW is just literally a better game. For some reason game sequels can often really miss the ball and the devs don’t understand what made the original great. They can’t just make new content and update the graphics, the have to mess with the fundamentals and somehow make it worse...

Fuck the bow skills and all that other shit, just play what you want to play, at the end of the day if you get skilled enough at your class/race combo none of that shit will even matter, that and you will feel rewarded knowing that you kicking ass on a race that doesn't have that advantage.
---
Stuck deciding between a (human) warrior and a NE druid. More I've looked into each one, the less I feel sure of what to pick. I got a dranei warrior to 30 during BC when I played before and the leveling speed didnt bug me (atleast that I remember) and the faster leveling speed of druid is overall appealing since I want to raid but I also kind of want to I guess enjoy the climb to 60. I never really played a druid before but for awhile I played another MMO and enjoyed both tanking and healing (didnt mind dps either, just played with friends who did dps) but it seems like druids need to have a great understanding of their class and raids to do anything but heal. Theoretically, I have a good amount of irl friends or friends of theirs joining a guild together and plan to eventually raid/pvp/level together but I would still like to be able to join other groups if that falls through and both seem to be pretty common, going from raid guild recruitment messages on the discord (Herod) but I've heard alot of people give up on warrior so I guess it probably gets easier to eventually?
---
Nope.  It's literally outland looking into Tyne black morass.  What the blasted lands looked like before the first invasion.

&gt;but if everyone and their brother is a priest

That 100% will not be the case. Replace Priest with mage/rogue and your sentence makes sense. As it were in vanilla, Priests will be in highest demand at 60.

I agree though, they definitely need a new PvE EST server.

Nah, now that layering is confirmed to be getting removed as soon as possible, people have to find something else to whine and cry and crucify Blizzard for.

As someone who has a wife that does cross-stitch, I'm guessing this is like 300+ hours of needlework. I have a GREAT respect for the time and work that went into this. My sympathies for your eyes.

Never believe in the echo chamber that is Reddit. As much as I'm going to love the shit out of the game and am recruiting as many friends as possible, I am, too, imagining a huge dropoff after maybe a couple of months.
---
Its literally just going to be trump shitposting. Thats all that was on the first stress test and thats all thats on private servers.
---
lying is not exploitation. Exploitation infers a gain. This won't be the case for him here.
---
it's not. source: i got rank 80% into rank 10 as a lock in og classic. for as much as destro "scales with gear", so do SL (7/31/12) and good ol SM/Ruin (30/0/21). as destro you'll get destroyed in bg's. you aren't going to cast shit with the swarms of melee and hunter pets on you. trust me, i tried to make it work. SM/Ruin has good damage and you can draintank against some classes. it also doubles as *the* PvE spec as well. you just can't go wrong with it.

unless you just want to be a special snowflake, full destro isn't worth it until tbc.

I dunno man, PDT realms are super slow to fill up, there doesn't seem to be nearly as much of a demand as EDT.

Makes sense. I'm a BC baby so classic stuff is new to me. I'm excited to say the least. Thanks!
---
I don't think they ever released the presentation they made at Blizzard HQ, though in an interview later (i think with StaySafe or Esfand) they mention that statistics on realm / players was presented to justify a business case
---
Gimme 500 bucks.
---
Evolution is based on the principal of survival of the fittest ... what best fits and survives it's current climate and conditions.
---
If Classic maintains more players than current retail Wow, is that not evolution?
---
So if I understand you correctly, we should make 3 herods?

I was actually planning to donate $50-75 for the guide. I always intended to pay for it.

It’s funny because Blizzard released extra servers just like everyone asked for, and now people are still crying

i think i missed it. why are they removing skeletons?

Ironically, Tom Chilton killed UO before he left to work on WoW. I believe he was the lead dev on AoS, which changed UO from a skill-based sandbox game to an item-based theme park game. Ruined UO forever, but, it gave me a good reason to try WoW. Glad I did, though I wish UO never changed after T2A, or, hell, even Renaissance.

You keep using this word like it means something. The vast majority of people, myself included, are not name calling him or wishing him ill will. We're pointing out how shady and manipulative his behavior is. That's not "attacking". That's criticism. Something we're all perfectly allowed to do.
---
&gt; If you simply think that the guide hasn't changed, then feel free to use a older guide.

You haven't a clue

If you are suggesting that Classic would exist without pservers. You are dead wrong. 
---
Pservers and their community are precisely why Classic exists. You need to brush up on your history.
---
&gt;I can still remember Prudence going "time lapse, frost burn, time lapse, frost burn, it's not that difficult."
---
I fucking love Prudence.
---
I remember that on Chrom -- dude it's cause half the raid was dead ass tired! Prudence was ape because people were running around like chickens without heads. I love it though.
---
So you think we cleared up to Chrom that night? Does this sound right: We wiped on Chrom although he was mostly dead and we'd lost a lot of the raid to exhaustion, and we came back and killed him like... a day later? It's just burned in my mind that we went from stuck on Vael to attempting Nef in no time at all.

Why aren't you supporting the guys who put out free guides?
---
I was agreeing with you XD
---
Ok. So I’m torn. Played since vanilla, I’m an alt guy it’s really hard to focus. In vanilla I played mage and warrior on alliance. This time I’m taking the horde route. 
---
My primary love is PvP. I’m stuck between hunter, enhance shaman, mage and warlock mostly. 
---
I love that hunter is a good leveling experience, with uses in raids and easy to gear. Plus decent in pvp as well.
---
I want to play enhance because I just want to make it work. I want to one shot windfury people at times. Love the utility and buffs.
---
Mage because they are just good. But lots will play them. Good at everything. A T1 class in classic.
---
Warlock is recently intriguing me. Great leveling. Lots of utility. Easy raiding. Dominant pvp when controlled by a good player. Lots of viable spec variations. I can still one shot people. Or I could rot tank people. They can do a lot.
---
So ya. Help me out. That’s my quick mindset as I’m typing it up on my phone. Thanks.
---
WC, baby
---
Other people said so, though that could be sour grapes.  Also, the last 20 alliance levels weren't available.  Though that could be because he didn't want to update it until after he put up the paywall.
---
Why are you salty?
---
&gt; We wanted 1.12 talents and quest hubs and stuff, but the vanilla community before Classic was announced wanted progressive content and itemization.
---
That's what we wanted but that's not what we asked for. People were shouting 1.12 and #nochanges for over a year and didn't care to specify further than that. 
---
Most of them probably thought that 1.12 meant "do it like this private server I'm playing on where it says 1.12 in the bottom left corner."
---

---
Eh?
---
One that a few friends and I made. We've been practicing for months and took into account increased exp from dungeons, hinterlands and searing gorge quests, gearing for pre-bis, needed class quests, and the access to summons and portals in our group. I'd likely level faster solo as a warlock, but this way I help some other classes, and we have fun along the way.

That was my complaint. I don't consider an AH epic to be a viable option. But, it's pretty well designed otherwise. I use it. I'll check sixtyupgrades out.
---
So fucking awesome. This explains why the original is the best. It came from a place of passion and love and everybody just wanting to make their favorite game. I have to imagine the insane success of the game made future iterations heavily influenced by money more than other factors. (Though it's obvious there was still immense care put into TBC and WotLK at least)

Gear should, but I think materials won't even if it's green rarity.  Could be wrong, but I remember people would not loot chests and wait till others left so they could go back and loot it, otherwise people would see Someone looted Gold ore or whatever.  Similar to mining nodes in dungeons

True that. Players were able to participate in endgame content much easier but there were still the hardcore guilds that worked for heroic 25 achievement clears.

Our guild was a bit of a anamoly. Most guilds went heal-heavy in BWL, but we went DPS- heavy; we had NINE rogues on the roster and more often than not they all were in the raid.

I don't follow, is that a real thing that happened in the lore, that Ironforge was the Alliance capital and it switched to SW later?

---
You're right, only you have control over your own emotions, and everyone would be better of letting words roll off of them instead of angering them. However saying you have zero responsibility for how your words impact others because they could just ignore them is bullshit. Just because someone could choose to ignore it, doesn't give you the right to put them in situations where they might have to.
---
Also, you have to live in a bubble where hate crimes don't exist to think that someone can so easily let bigotry go, knowing that those words are the same words shouted at their people when they are marginalized, and assaulted. And that those words are used to let other people know what group of people they support in this issue. 
---
I mean how can you have such a lack of empathy that you can't imagine growing up a marginalized person, hearing while growing up how much people who use these words have fucked you and your people over, and just think, yeah, I could get over that easy peezy, that constant reminder of your people's place in the world. Put yourself in someone else's shoes, really try and imagine the psychology behind being the target of bigotry for something you have no control ove, imagine how that can shade your entire life. 
---
But I think that's where we differ, because I actually have empathy, and I use it to relate to people, to put myself in their shoes. As such I can't even imagine thinking to myself, "yeah, they should suck up generations of bigotry, because I feel like running my mouth."

I specifically mentioned how i discounted hybrid builds in the guide. The DS/ruin build is about as hybrid as you can get, and it only goes into the demonology tree in order to get ds, using almost nothing of the other talents taken. These two factors combined makes me extremely hesitant to label it as a demo raid spec, despite going into the tree.

Sure, but it turns them into mere cosmetics. People care about others’ mounts roughly as much as they care about others’ hair color 😂

But the burnout is real, I’ll be doing some MC/BWL and some 10 man stuff come Classic, probably not bothering with Naxx myself, requires too much time investment in my opinion :-) AQ40 got some “easy” stuff available as well, as does the start wing bosses of Naxx so there’s that as a possibility, all depending on how much I want to raid. I’m happy with Netherwind myself, so I don’t care terribly much.

More often than not, I'll find something redeeming about Retail's story, be it minor or otherwise. It has a lot of flaws, but I enjoy the campiness and ridiculousness of it all, and even has some legitimately good moments from time to time. But good God, that was probably the stupidest thing added with Chronicles. It feels like such a baby's-first-edgy-OC motivation.
---
Check Shazz discord. It’s a shithole full of kid retails and trolls. No way I’m playing on that server. 
---
All other realms will be full by release date.

Came here to say that lol

Engineering can definitely mitigate weaknesses for Warrior - especially grenades and rocket helmet. If you prefer melee and you want try tanking it should be an obvious choice. Also, if you’re able to run around with party member or two your usefulness in world PvP goes up a ton.
---
Chevelle slaps
---
As a Hordie, I didn't hear them much. But they're at least a bit more subdued, and even the engineering flyer was a bit rare when it came out. But after the mechano hog, the drop to lvl 20 for mounts, account-wide mounts, and especially the cheuffeur mounts for newbies... There's no peace for someone just trying to hang out in a city ;_;
---
WELL MET

I rolled on Proudmoore back in the day not realizing it was the LGBTQ+ one. Was overall a real chill server, with people not tolerating a whole lot of the racist/sexist/homophobic toxic stuff that a lot of other servers can get inundated with. I never joined specific LGBTQ+ guild, but i would say the majority of my guildies were. Was a good and pleasant server to raid on, imo.

Tram is not faster in Retail classic. Tested this myself. Unless you literally tell your friend to wait to start flight until tram arrives... MAYBE. Otherwise Flying won.
---
There’s far better free guides out there.
---
Why not m8?
---
You guys made this kid kill himself, AAA+ salt!
---
Would love to see the PvP destruction warlock tree, might hit you up!
---
You can clear all raids completely no problem only raiding 3 nights a week. Top tier raiding atm basically means no life levelling for the next 2 weeks, so you probably can't do that. If you just mean effortlessly clearing all raid content after 2-3 months levelling yes you can.
---
Pretty trash map actually. Lots of missing flight paths.
---
depends how close you are to the tram obviously
---
Second boss in bwl is where most semi competent guilds fell apart. I loved my vanilla wow experience, raids included, and that's about as far as I ever got
---
Aoe grinding in the open world will only be viable if you first get ahead of the crowd and also do it in areas away from quests mobs the other people who have outpaced the crowd will be grinding.
---
Aoe grinding dungeons can be absolutely viable but not so much as a solo player.
---
And strangely shadoefang keep was 10 man able for awhile.
---
I agree. Fixing a dead server is a lot harder than fixing an overcrowded server.
---
I'm supporting him.  Imagine forking over $5 for a guide that helps the vanilla grinder go down a lot easier than the hot-garbage that was a Subway $5 footlong.
---
Delicious.
---
Didn't end up joining, but these guys are cool. Check em out!
---
Yeah. I'm worried about this. I have a guide ready, but am unsure if its going to work about because of that. They didn't address that at all and I don't know why.
---
If you're coming from Eq2, then the difficulty will be hardly anything. As for druid... In classic they weren't really shining stars in any sense. If you're just trying to tag along to things as a back heals or as an add tank, then yeah. If you're trying to go for big dick stuff then I would recommend something else. Warrior mage priest rogue, the 4 pillar classes, are allstars. Everything else kinda just tags along. As for ease of leveling, the only classes that really have an "easy" time are lock and hunter.
---
That's just amazing honestly. I don't like her, I love her. We need MORE people like her. I remember when Fortnite came out, everyone on YouTube was hopping on that trend and then several YouTubers stayed only making Fortnite content. I mean sure, that's cool for them because it net them over a million subs but most of the people watching their videos now are between the ages of 6-15, just all kids. In fact, I have a 14 year old nephew who watches some of them. This is another reason why I'm hyped for Classic because it means several people are going to be making WoW content again and honestly I enjoy the hell out of that. Like, I can watch WoW WHILE playing it now.
---
Hitting 60 will be harder than life at 60 for a Pally. Focus on that first.
---
It tends to kill servers though if the population gets too onesided.  Nobody wants to play on a 35/65 split server where you can't move in the world without getting ganked.
---
#***CAN I HELP YE***
---
The trick is getting as close as you can to leveling... without leveling lolanf getting lucky on BOP drops
---
Have you considered female humans? They make great warlocks aesthetically
---
That's lawful evil not chaotic
---
Avoid using one while you're playing, but if you're sitting on the toilet pooping, it wouldn't hurt to scan one to see where you might be headed next or making sure you didn't miss something. Unless you have guild obligation of being raid ready by a certain date then you don't really have a choice.
---
I am thou
---
Thou art I
---
shh
---
LMFAO
---
er...really? I have somehow never noticed that.
---
That would probably make warlock utterly rediculous damage wise, as they were already quiet powerful even with the limitation on debuffs
---
Full world scaling, like with ESO. You can start the game in any zone whatsoever and progress through them in any order. The end game content consists of events that are spread throughout the old world, along with like 3 zones that are end-game exclusive simply because they have no quests to pick up until you reach a certain level. Mats are farmable by climate, and dynamically levelled rare spawns occur in all zones. 
---
Not a perfect MMO by any means still.
---
What up Skol
---
There’s some videos on YouTube that roll through the story of 1 and 2. Honesty, WC2 is still playable, WC1 not so much... the Warcraft movie is a great way to catch up on WC1 lore. It’s not perfect, but honestly the only fault I point towards the movie is them trying to pack too much in.
---
I agree with the comments below warlock lore and quests are great and summoning your epic mount for a quest feels amazing
---
Frost mage is a fast leveler already. Don’t sweat the AOE just enjoy the speedy safe leveling.
---
If you don't know there's a problem how can you fix it?  Also it's useful for the people looking at this do they can know it's useless.  I'm not your editor you can have a useless guide or put in the work to research and make a good one.  It doesn't matter to me and it's certainly not my job to fix it for you.
---
We taking this suggestion there?
---
You could use autoloot addons back in Vanilla. So they may as well offer it anyways.
---
Seems like a given when blizz decided to release so few servers.
---
unless the servers can hold 50-100k people each we are in for a slow launch
---
Yes, guarantee it's this. I had plenty of old characters that lost their names.
---
Because you have to play the game the same way I do REEEEEEE
---
NASA Approved!
---
Pointless thread gets a pointless reply.
---
Serpentis is a cool one I haven't thought about.
---
Horde is dominating 59% to 41%.
---
But he’s right.
---
My attack on the other poster was relevant. I was pointing out that **his** attack on those who may be offended by the Nazi meme was part of a larger pattern of toxicity and so people should take his words with a grain of salt. My post may not have been polite but it was pertinent. 
---
I don't see how "He's Rubber and You're Glue" really adds anything to the discussion.
---
I really hope arugal is balanced in terms of horde/alliance
---
People will go out of their way to ignore you because you probably won't die unless you get focused by a group but why would a group focus a Pally before a yummy Mage or Priest?  
---
Only thing you really gotta worry about is a psychopath Priest following you around with Mana Burn, that's not fun.
---
PvP didn't exist at launch so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
---
Well I enjoy it and that is how I did it back in vanilla. The biggest downside for me is having to see a ton of yellow ! everywhere at max level because not doing the quests.
---
Oh God. How dear I make a post stating that all the servers will be full and long queues are instore for everyone! 
---
Quick some tar and  feather the Alarmist!
---
I have vivid memories of listening to all these songs and doing Zulfarrak.
---
Oh hell yea.
---
This needs much, MUCH more incest or zoophilia jokes.
---
Damn I guess I have to go to whitemane...
---
As a holy paladin you'll be neigh invincible 1v1. And with a warrior partner, it'll take 4+ to kill you both.
---
Sarth 3D was a blast! I actually won the mount off 10 man :&gt;
---
They are using the newer faster mailbox UI and auction UI.
---
Addons will need to be for classic, so make sure you download the right ones over again.
---
There are like 5-6 content phases, look it up.
---
The game isn't designed for that amount of concurrents. It will be impossible to farm any consumables, no one will get any black lotus, no one would be able to farm devilsaurs, getting to BlackRock mountain on a pvp server would be a literal gauntlet. Private servers had to custom create more herb spawn nodes, add huge dynamic respawns for just 12-15k concurrents. 5x that would be a completely different game.
---
The community may very overwhelmingly want a vanillified burning crusade. No attunement skips. No heroics or maybe heroic is normal difficulty. No flying mounts. Flying mounts are probably the most contentious part of the burning crusade.
---
How bad will gear competition for warriors realistically be? I'm currently leaning towards playing one, but I've seen people talking about how difficult it will be to gear a warrior
---
I enjoy reading barrenschat
---
They'll probably just help you kill it so that it will respawn faster than waiting for you to take a half an hour to finish it off.
---
Imagine thinking there is going to be a queue for a long enough time that activision would have to make a queue skip system. Lmao, queues wont be here for a month
---
For instance, saying destro (the worst pve spec) as the best is wrong. The best specs are ds ruin &gt; sm ruin, but you can show that with these infographics.
---
&gt;DKP and shit. Oh God...
---
Tracking DKP in spreadsheets, published on forums and /roll'ing for loot.... Hahaha. That aspect of the game has come a long way.
---
It *can* be. By it's nature it's much faster, but it's also less reliable. I didn't play in beta, so someone with that experience might be able to shed more light on this, but I'd expect with how full realms are at the moment that most servers would be too active to really AOE farm.
---
The guys who made AzerothAutoPilot for retail are just going to make it for Classic and that'll be the end of this stupid nonsense.
---
New matrix movie being filmed in 2020 btw woot
---
Literally no one will get a full naxx set other than the high end progression rushers and hardcore players after 3 years. It takes yonks to hear enough tanks for it, let alone your DPS race being really close every fight if you don't have on point rotations and geared to the teeth damage
---
But I keep seeing comments about  hur dur only herod
---
And there will be character transfers if one server become empty.
---
Releases on my first day of college. Sorry future me.
---
I'M SLOW OKAY
---
The **entire** premise, huh? What about uh... all that other stuff that takes up arguably more of the player's time than world PvP? Dungeons, raids, BGs, professions, etc.? The game is named "war craft" as you say because it's set in the world of uh... Warcraft... a pre-existing universe with a name already. There's a large variety of content for every type of player, content "as designed" for those types of players. Get that shit out of here.
---
Your first mistake is playing retail
---
Hah, OP is busted.
---
Yeah paladin or hunter, to a small extent shaman, but thats pushing it.
---
Kara and CoT were in the Azeroth though
---
Why pay for a guide, if you really want to use one there are several that are completely free.
---
I'm hoping at some point there will be pug ony raids like there were back in the day. 
---
I dont care about the other raids but I always liked onyxia
---
I loved how the mage was close to great for both pvp and pve

It's not just a lack of depth, it's got straight up bad info.  I don't understand people who can't handle being told what they made isn't good.  Why would I look at something that's trash and be obligated to ignore it because I'm not willing to fix your mistakes for you?  You can't accept criticism so you hide from it under the guise of claiming it's not constructive.   Sometimes calling something trash is aa constructive as it needs to be.
---
If Orc doesn't excite you go Tauren. Better tanks and better reach for PVP.

---
&lt; NAH NAH YEAH &gt;
---
I vividly remember listening to Finger 11 - Paranoid on repeat allllll damn day when playing wow and leveling my Druid.
---
And what about Auction House, Skol of Herod?
---
On retail you just farm old raids and look exactly as cool as you want.
---
Make sure you add 'Do You Call My Name' by Ra.
---
Tauren, it will be a lot less crowded than other starting zones and Mulgore is like Nagrand lite. I’d say a female with teats in her name
---
If they guaranteed a free server transfers for dead 6 months after launch, I'd happily move to a medium pop server, but they won't, so I'm staying on Fairbanks.
---
What’s warlock PVP like as SM/Ruin?
---
Also, what are the advantages in world PvP if I played mage over warlock? I’m considering both.
---
Combat swords like others have said, and don’t bother with stealth or the first 30 levels or so, just chain pull. Stealth is worthless and just slows you down early on.
---
Also riposte makes it a breeze, it’s a MUST in talents for leveling.
---
Not accurate
---
He already got payed for it years ago...

Having a skeleton move from where I died is more immersion breaking than having my old skeletons fade out.  There's no real in game explanation on why I need to keep leaving old bones around, and why they never fade away, but mob corpses do.

Talk to some of the kids in my family, they think the "Old people movies" aren't as good as we say they are. It's difficult to sit those things down to make them watch a decent film. Growing up I had to sit through Wizard of Oz about 30 times (although to be fair, it was my mother's favorite film) and It's a Wonderful Life about 20 or so times. I can pretty much tell you exactly what happens in both and I'll be honest with you, IAWL is kind of a movie I really enjoy alongside Boys Town (Mickey Rooney was a true treasure). But seriously though, a lot of the kids these days think that the Mummy movies aren't great.
---
Exactly, leave all the retail kids gathered on Shazzrah server with all their memes because « iT iS ThE MoSt PoPUlaTeD SeRvEr»
---
I'm pretty sure OP is trying to say, Herod has 3 servers. Each of the three servers have layering build into them. Essentially is server laying because Herod 1 would have x pop cap, and Herod 2 and 3 would have the same pop cap. However as time goes on and if the servers start to die down, they would be able to merge into 1 single Herod server. This could reduce queue times on larger servers all while being able to stay on the larger server.
---
I prefer multiple but you're definitely not wrong.
---
The sheer effort it'll take to level the other Rogues, gear them, and set up this whole scenario tells me you guys are exactly my sort of people
---
I hope you record the payoff
---
Bro people in the Classic community are delusional its not even worth arguing with them.
---
Doubt it. No SW harbor in classic. Being near menethil is a good thing

On Herod I have Lonely and Gasoline

Looking for interesting names on Stalagg, send offers.

right down to the betaquest thing because people have been calling it beta for azeroth since release lol
---
Naw this one is a LONG time gripe, and it's pretty valid.
---
thanks, haven't had one of these posts in.... probably 5 hours
---
I think he's trolling you
---
The whole idea, is do you. Do what you want to do and what you think is best. Someone else said it in another thread, launch only happens once, you should experience it if you have the option.
---

I have a real life friend who I am probably going to roll on an RP server with. We play D&amp;D together and I completely skipped that piece of WoW the first go. Everything was about metagaming and I feel like I missed out on a fantastic story, only catching little glimpses of it.
---
But I'm going to roll on one of the PvP servers too, and I'll make sure I figure out where people are headed. I mostly want to PvP and run some dungeons and stuff. Even considering raiding again makes my eyes hurt. :) But to those who still have the appetite, godspeed!
---
Aeryx was active on Deathwing as recently as... Eight years ago? Holy shit, time flies. Well anyway, I played in another guild with Aeryx and some other former RCW during WotLK, but I was casual and I came in late after the competition had settled and everything had been killed. It was not long before Cata dropped.
---
Probably pretty stupid question that might not get answered. But why can we have an option to chose classic character models or current models for classic servers?
---
Thanks mate. Gonna label a map similar to Joanna's using yours as the source of truth and his to help give me directions on the quests, since I have none of the quests memorized. Might take a long time but there's still a while until launch.
---
Lmao
---
Druid is good. They are in high demand in raids for the utility they offer and underplayed so you probably won't struggle to find takers. If you are a heal spec then they are very in demand. 5 man dungeons they are just as good at healing as other classes, but they can only resurrect people through a really long cooldown spell which makes them weaker in groups where nobody else has a resurrection ability. 
---
They struggle the most in getting kills in solo pvp situations, as they have the lowest kill pressure of any class. On the flip side you will be the best at surviving and escaping from pvp scenarios because druids have the best in-combat mobility.
---
Yeah that makes sense and it would be good to play both bits of content. Thanks! I feel like mages are well rounded from start through endgame and easier to level but there’s always that wpvp ganking ability that rogues have which is appealing haha. Probably be better off to alt one eventually for that specific role
---
I reserve my right to ensure the Alliance are never allowed to turn in a single quest with zero repercussions. I'll be doing raid content to ensure this one way or another, blizzard needs to just remove them and eliminate this annoying barrier to entry.

---
Depending on how much you're going to play, you may want to consider the gearing requirements for both classes. Generally, Mages were better than Warlocks prior to gearing because Warlocks suffered from a lack of hit built into their talents. It wasn't uncommon for locks to miss two or three shadow bolts in a row prior to getting the pieces they needed.
---
(This is just an observation, you should play what you think will be fun.)
---
This is the single target build yes?
---
Yes, you can.  But what this person said is that all of us that subbed a couple weeks ago and reserved names get deep dicked out of the names we paid to get when we have to make new characters on a new server they open up on Monday to be able to play without waiting in line 3 hours every day.
---
Yes, 72 hours straight, no sleep. And I have already done it 3 times before despite what you believe. People have gone up to 11 days with no sleep, 3 isn't really outrageous but I do enjoy how jelly it's making you.
---
Jokes on you, I already have ALL of these Albums. I think I still have some songs from Limewire that say they're 1 song but when you listen to it, it's something entirely different. For years, I thought this 1 song was by a certain group until I found it on YouTube and it blew my mind that the band name and song name were entirely different.
---
Each week, your PVP contribution is weighed against the rest of your faction to determine your PVP rank. PVP Rank 3 comes with a 10% discount at vendors and access to the PVP trinket. After that, you don't get much until rank 7, which will take PVPing a consistent amount each week to achieve. 
---
So casually, you won't get much besides the rank 3 rewards. If you want to take it further and seriously PVP for a month or longer, you'll  be rewarded with a blue armor set at ranks 7-10, a unique mount at rank 11, and an epic armor set and epic weapons at ranks 13-14.

This was more my speed. All those other folks were far fancier than me.

I remember in the AMA, during the explanation of layering, they said they want to condition players to expect queues once layering disappears.
---
this is almost identical to my old winamp playlist, but you missed the most important of all:
---
https://youtu.be/Hy8kmNEo1i8
---
I'm excited.   Played Daoc, Everquest, Rift, and ESO.. and now I get to play wow for the first time and be a bit lost.  Will be avoiding guides and addons to try to get that oldschool feeling back.  I will not be an optimal player, and that excites me.
---
\&gt;  What I have heard is that each layer will aim to hold roughly the number of players from a *traditional* server, say roughly 3000 (though they have not stated specific numbers as far as I am aware).
---
That is what Ion says. 
---
\&gt;  Interesting - can you link a source for me?

Look man some people see the lines and others don't.   I see the lines tbc is 99% happening and the other 1% is classic somehow isn't financially successful enough for blizzard to continue with old content in any capacity.
---
Classic+ is NEVER happening and tbc will be no changes.
---
None because my boss doesn't ask why we're taking PTO.
---
that seems to be the consensus! I'll change it for the final version to a +
---
my hand hurts just looking at it
---
1.12 no changes.
---
You can probably stop pretending like you're being helpful.
---
eviscerate on 7? but at what cost
---
&gt;The solution is so laughably easy. It really is. Open up a new realm that is locked to new players and have a grace period that only allows transfers from full servers before opening it up to everyone else.
---
Not a bad idea, I'd just add that it'd be better to lock the realm to new (i.e. non-transferred) characters instead of new players.  Otherwise a determined player could make a character on a full realm, transfer it, then make a new char on the locked realm.
---
Oh trust me, Blaumeux will fill up by the time Classic releases. Quote me.
---
It’s going to be a cluster f* for sure. I’m am probably not the only one that think the real launch of the game when it’s actually playable won’t be for a few days afterwards.

"They weren't in the game originally so it's no changes" is a terrible argument. By that logic changing anything from after 1.0 is acceptable. "It was a very stupid design decision" is enough on an argument.

&gt;All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.
---
Then High and Full will never see the end of layering, and they dropped the ball on the amount of servers they needed, or they truly believe there will be a 90% attrition rating.  Which means anything under High or Full will be a dead server.
---
The first day will be toxic
---
Expect politics and other triggering things.
---
Lmao my first gryphon ride was a fucking slideshow. 20 seconds in between
---
I spent the time clearing out my retail characters banks and selling stuff that I hoarded. Bought a couple of tokens with the gold, so it turned out worth to have the spare time.
---
But yeah generally I feel like this name reservation thing has been a bad idea. Did they not realize that people won't want to leave their good names for a new server?
---
I had weird friends. I still do.
---
Yassss
---
Well thank you to blasting me back to my teenage years lol
---
Holy shit when you put it like that it’s so clear how shit retail has become
---
I read it and I shoulda linked to it. I'm just kinda noob.
---
There’s one high pop oceanic server and one medium normal server rip oceanic if what you say is true
---
Just play bro, this is the only time you'll experience a launch like this.
---
TRUE TRUE TRUE
---
Drink your own urine and eat your own shit to become perfectly efficient.
---
Absolutely agree. Bring back skeleton stacking. Pretty disappointed after so many of the Devs kept spitting "#nochanges" in the AMA.
---
 this is so dumb there will still be skeletons
---
as long as were still talking about 2005 and before then hell yeah
---
The faction balance on Bleaumeux is nice. But it is still a small sample. I hope it stays balanced
---
Throw in some weed and thats the good stuff bro
---
I really wish they went the Tall, Grande, Venti route that  we can all understand
---
We appreciate the application, but uh, we're full.
---
That staind album was so good
---
I’m prob going for a 48 hour session or pretty close. I’m gonna have granola bars, bananas, and lots of water, I also plan on cooking a meal or two ahead and just microwaving it. I’m thinking of making a chicken and broccoli Casserole. I can make a lot st once and it’ll heat up well and I can eat it with one hand while I keep playing. I’ll break out the energy drinks around the 18 hour mark probably.
---
Any easy snack is either terrible for you, expensive or flavorless. Just cook big meals. Lots of meat, veggies, spice and oil.
---
I am his sister. I really don't get involved in his guide stuff. Just pirate it like a bunch of other ppl who don't want to pay. Or pay and get a refund. It's really not that hard either way. People just like being mad I think
---
Maybe me AM that kind of Orc
---
Both are good, do you wanna level with invisibility and heals or with a tanky pet?
---
In Duskwood the Stalvan questline gives you a blue caster ring and the night watch questline gives a good quiver/ammo pouch. In Loch Modan the elite ogre quest gives what will probably be your first caster ring and the short questline at the lodge gives a choice between a decent gun or bow.
---
Mail sucks with them.
---
There are some mighty fine albums on that list, but for a truly authentic experience, I'd prefer to hear the game's ambient music.  When I walk into an inn I need that tavern music.  Or in Thunder Bluff, those smooth mellow tribal beats.
---
I liked wod and legion. But it wasnt amazing
---
I'm not expecting to get anything done in the first week. Awkward launch time, huge stress on the servers, tons of people, etc. However, I'd really like to experience all of those unique launch week blunders, so I'll still be logging in!
---
To play devil's advocate:
---
&gt;As seen in another reddit thread, the skeletons could randomly move a few feet from the death location. This allows them to still exist in mass like we want them but make it extremely difficult to spell out hate speech.
---
It's not really quite as simple as moving the skeleton a few feet, really. Instead, this is taking a system that takes your current body location and position and replacing it with a corresponding skeleton, to then replacing it to instead recalculate potential elevation and angle changes based on terrain of the random spot to position the new corpse in a way that doesn't look too fucky.
---
Not impossible (or probably even particularly difficult), but, to be honest, probably is not worth the time/effort to do it.
---
&gt;Limit the amount of skeletons per player. Instead of only having 1 skeleton per player out at a time like it is now, maybe allow 3-5 per character. This is a compromise solution. Meaning a single player could never spell out a full phrase alone. But in a battle where 20 players are involved there could still be a pile of 60+ skeletons, creating an authentic experience.
---
The issue isn't one person dying multiple times to spell things out. It is about coordinated efforts across dozens of accounts. This solution solves nothing.
---
There's nothing worse than Thunderbluff doe
---
Masturb...oh, in-game?  Probably fishing.
---
Yeah I didn’t love the songs tbh. They got old real fast for me.
---
lmao
---
I don't care to take the credit or anything my post was just largely ignored and if blizzards explanation is the only reason this solution just 100% solves it with no downsides so I'd like to see it implemented over skelly changes.   I'm not worried either way it's very minor to me
---
wow... im 19.
---
The Black Morass was a dark swamp, and the image in the portal is anything but
---
I really really don't care about this, I'm excited about classic for many reasons and the one OP points ain't one of them
---
Nah you need uppers for maximum play time
---
Well hear is what i know. I dont wana play range. I would be tempted to try to make kitty druid work but dont like the idea of bis being a 3 use weapon.   Im not interested in hunter as i play that on live. I would be interested in rogue but dont wana be locked to dps.  So that gets us to pally and warrior. Plate armor my fav.  I have been going back and fourth for a month.  (Prob will 100 more times)
---
I just read that as well. Is anyone able to shed more light on how this will look a few weeks into Classic? I'm kind of put off on the idea of having mega servers.
---
&gt; Blaumeux has a terrible name, and people won't roll there. I won't. I can't even pronounce the name
---
BLAMMO!
---
Meet in the middle, go with human druid.
---
30mg of melatonin?? Sheesh.
---
I was under the impression that the dot limit was one of the things they were changing in Classic. It was an absurd technical requirement that they solved. Telling hunters they can’t use Serpent Sting is not a part of Classic i want to repeat!
---
The Milk Crates will have something to say about that.
---
Yeah goodbye herod hello skeram
---
Mechanics have gotten so much more complicated over the years, I can’t imagine wiping to the dumb shit we used to wipe to. My guild had so many 2% wipes on Thaddius because they either couldn’t make the jump to the main platform or couldn’t pay attention to what charge they were. We never got him before BC came out.
---
Where are my Bloodsail boys at? Trying to decide if I go Nelf Druid/Hunter or Human Mage to start, would like a leveling buddy though if I decide on Druid/Mage. 
---
I moved to RP realms on retail a few months ago, so hoping we get something like TRP3 on classic. If not, would love to find a guild on Bloodsail Alliance that has plans for RP events.
---
Almost everything you replied with is either a lie or not what I said at all. But I'll break it down more simply this time I guess.
---
&gt;If you don't want to deal with world PvP heroes that's what pve servers are for.
---
Out of curiosity how do you not get that quest givers are NPC's so killing them isn't PvP, there are no other players involved with that.
---
&gt;Also again, they did not actually stop griefing
---
Of course it didn't stop it and I never said it did. If you read my post I said it slowed it down. Which is the truth, having a negative outcome for sniping out quest givers is a good thing. It creates a disincentive so that you can still do it but its less common.
---
&gt; Large scale World PvP battles were crushed
---
I took part in large scale PvP battles all the way through vanilla. They were very common back then even after DK's were added. If you were farming honor you just didn't join a raid with randos but it didn't "crush" PvP. It just changed how you group for it.
---
I think it will reach peak shithole the 25th. So much angst because everyone wants to play so badly
---
the great minds at blizzard thought it would be good to release game when school starts back up. so ill be fucked for leveling fast. I hope I hit 20.
---
Quit your job?  fake your own death? Learn to multiply yourself? Travel in time and invest stock on blizzard?
---
Im kinda out of ideas xD
---
Priest, mage, or warlock for casual world pvp and battlegrounds?  I kind of want to heal as priest, but am uncertain overall.
---
Autoloot addons did not exist in Vanilla.
---
Press “x” to doubt.
---
also i think we want beer and pizza.
---
Lol I remember this story. Start posting ads now ladies! Get your epic mount ASAP!
---
pet tankiness helps solo elite quests/multiple mobs
---
&gt; world PvP will be ruined unless I indulge in PvE to stay gear competitive. I'm not interested in battlegrounds.
---
World pvp is going to be terrible anyway, unless you forgot how it used to be back then. Bunch of 60s running around ganking lowbies until they logged their main and killed them. Occasionally a war would break out in Hillsbrad, but it died after a few hours.
---
&lt;3 2 too slow on tldw rip
---
Pretty reasonable. Don't see why that is not an option.
---
Could always make a fresh account, use that for classic exclusively. Gives you the option to eBay like we did back in the day too. 😂
---
Who made you believe that ONLY way to play druid is with 3 use weapon and nothing else? That is so ridiculous
---
Or poo.
---
There are a couple of clients still active that use the Gnutella network protocal that Limewire ran on. 
---
Limewire itself was shut down though.
---
I wonder if my friend who’s been offline for 49 years will resub?
---
What are the advantages of warlock over mage?
---
I wouldn't call it racing, but I'll be trying to efficiently level towards 60 - at least on my main. I don't expect to get there very fast as I'll be working most of launch week.
---
Killing it my dude
---
Wow that's a blast from the past.
---
Damn, I love little lore tidbits like this. Not stated outright or anything but it's just there for you to figure out
---
It's strange how linguistics puts in so much effort to be perfectly translingual but ends up with little things like this :o
---
I am planning on taking my time. Between school,  just wanting to enjoy the game, farm professions, and level with friends I am just going to probably take a month or so to level.
---
I used to raid on a shared computer in the living room that I had to bargain time from my siblings to get 3 hours of play time in a row
---
How i got my epic mount with Snapchat premium.
---
There are level gaps where it makes sense to move along to a new area, and quests will take you to the other continents. Possible to do a one continent leveling path, but you'll be grinding crap mobs for awhile.
---
Nothing beats the feeling of seeing the person in line next to you at McDonalds having their 6pc nugget McForge into a 20 piece despite waiting in line &amp; paying the same as you. :(
---
If you're coming from EQ2, then EVERY class is a good soloer lol
---
I’d honestly find a leveling guide. It’ll make you’re life way easier.
---
Also I imagine you’ll have way more zones than that given how scarce quests can be.
---
the sub numbers tanking over the last few years is the only reason we are getting classic
---
Nochanges pussy
---
I had a warrior named Chevelle, and a Paladin named Antisaint. Sad I had to scroll this far to see someone mention Chevelle.
---
This Type of Thinking and Wonder What's Next were the foundations of my WoW listening way back when.
---
Worst servers names I ever seen
---
Really good in battlegrounds
---
Yeah and also the notable items.
---
Then BC kicks in and everything goes to the bank ._.
---
Thunderfury is not transmogable in later version right?
---
I'll sip to that
---
Beers, and im still going.
---
Trying to decide what professions to take on my mage main - will be duoing with a friend who will be playing either hunter or rogue (which means he'll prob go herb/alch)
---
i was thinking tailoring/enchanting as both have good benefits for clothies..my concern with tailoring is that you really have to use a LARGE chunk of your cloth drops to level it, which means not really having good access to First Aid unless we farm cloth hardcore (or spend money buying it from players), and some of the really good stuff (spidersilk boots, etc) rely on getting lucky with spider silk/pearls, which can be a nightmare to farm for
---
I really want to get that level 40 mount, and it seems like most guides suggest skinning/mining and vendoring/AH'ing stuff. I feel like a lot of people will be doing that; I get the feeling that a LOT of people will be going for gathering professions which will make node competition fierce early on. So perhaps it would be better to be a player people come to for bags and enchants which would be rarer - people seem to not want to level enchanting on low levels/only have a bank alt for DE'ing
---
What do you all think? I was even considering going just skinning with nothing else and just selling for as much money as possible
---
Man, it’s not that he can’t handle being told you think it’s bad, but that you’re not giving any constructive criticism to make it better. You’re just being a dick lol
---
Nobody is "crying" here. You're part of the emotional crowd that comes rushing and shouting "who cares!" anytime someone offers a solution to a piece of the game many people don't want changed from it's original state.
---
Why is it so hard to believe I had a Shamen with the same name? I'm not trying to say I'm the original Thex. I just thought it was a funny coincidense. He only has 1 day and a half /played or so.
---
well low could mean 1 person or 1 person away from it being a "medium" pop server. I'm under the impression its closer to the latter
---
Water.

Nope 🤔

I explained what the infographics problem is, not enough info and bad info.
---
Yondu ???
---
Rich with virginity?
---
Yeah dude. Working during release, gonna ask my roommates to log me in to see the queue
---
Please no classic lfg.  Oh god.
---
When you rolled on a server in 2005 there weren't layers and dynamic respawns. Log in and enjoy the show. You might have to skip a quest (Samuel Fipps in UD comes to mind) but the other starters should all be doable...
---
Even if its slow and you aren't rushing server first 60 - you've waited 13 years, just log in those first couple of days and grind a few levels. It what we've all been waiting for.
---
Trying to remove his old guide is pretty lame and makes some people less likely to pay for an updated one.
---
A full server is literally just 1 layer and even a single layer may have more allowed on it. It's how Blizzard reconciles the population per realm when layering is removed that interests me. At least some servers won't reduce in numbers as some predict.
---
pretty sure tanks actually used thunderfury in the beginning of bc because the proc was still so strong
---
No point in taking launch day off. Your time would be better spent taking Friday +Monday off tbh
---
You don't need "snacks". 
---
I'll tell you exactly what you need for this session:
---
1. 64 Oz hydro flask filled with water.
---
2. Juul device
---
3. Juul charger
---
4. 10 juul pods (variety of flavor)
---
No snacking, no shitting.
---
Here I was churning through Razer mice once a year, shit.
---
The intellimouse explorer was king. The Zowie ec1-a I have now emulates it.
---
Who the hell even cares about this guy?
---
DKs were stupid, but since I'm on a PvE server, I don't much care.
---
So I'm not allowed to share my thoughts on a topic if they're not nice?  That seems silly
---
They will have 1 month till BC, If they are good.
---
from bank to bank, the FP is faster by a lot.

I grew up bullied and marginalized and as soon as I learned to ignore it, all of that went away. Only focusing on the good stuff will solve any problems you may have. The universe is one where you attract that which you focus upon, so if you focus on the things you dont want, you get more of it and vice versa. Everyone creates their reality by virtue of their thoughts and beliefs and are thus cooperative components to all of their own joy and suffering. Your empathy will only bring you misery. Dont waste your time empathizing with sad people, you do them no good as you only validate their suffering and draw it down upon yourself. So do what I do and be thrilled that WoW Classic is coming out and ignore literally everything else =] =] =]
---
&gt;layering will solve queues guys!
---
They increased it a bit from the old version where it was 8 only, but i think balance wise they wanted to keep some form of limit as bosses wern't designed around an entire raid worth of extra dot damage, which would probably make the encounter significantly easier.
---
Sweet sweet time.
---
I’m taking my time.
---
This won’t happen again
---
Nonsense. If you are in the guild that is chasing world first, then yes, probably. For 99% of other guilds, hell no. There will be 40 people in raid, it won’t affect whole boss encounter if dps of one supporting roles that your dps is 10%,20% or even 50% lower (idk how much it actually is) just your innervate and CR are good enough reason to bring you to raid.
---
Just kidding. You guys down there are all good in my book.
---
My family was very zealous and that album was one of the only ones that I could get past the "censors". They talked about Babylon and set me on my rasta approach before I left the church completely. Can't praise that album enough.
---
When did Jason Momoa pose for Rob Zombie?
---
The game is not difficult.  It was back then because everyone was shit, but that was 15 years ago.
---
The Napster I worked for was long after the death of the file sharing platform, after they were forced to sell off the brand to try and pay the huge fines they were given.
---
Funny enough though, I never really used the filesharing app. But I got a free account when I worked there, and I ripped ALL the music while I could.
---
... then later find out my at the time girlfriend fucked up a ton of it by playing The Sims on the computer I was using for ripping. Random tracks have skips in them because of it.
---
100% shadow/disc
---
bank didnt move, they just put the door on the ah closer to it.
---
and added second bank/ah in dwarven district
---
You’re the first person I’ve seen say this and I’m really thankful you did. I’m *so* uncomfortable with hearing kids asking for attention after I’ve been playing with their parent for days on end and hearing “no daddy’s busy”. Bruh gtfo and play legos with your kid. I hate being involved in that shit.
---
Honestly makes me want to swap factions and camp the shit out of them, best case scenario they log off for a while and spend time with their kids.
---
There was kind of an unspoken agreement, at least on Blackrock, that if a tank went kamikaze nobody would assist and when the healer finished drinking they'd rez the dummy and then heal the encounter. 
---
Ancient Blackrock proverb: Durability hits crush even the thickest skulls.
---
Instructions very clear, died of sleep deprivation.
---
John Deere, friend - with an e at the end.
---
As someone who has healed in every single MMO since Everquest, I concur...while also adding that a good tank will know what their healer can handle after 1-2 pulls and pace the group accordingly. I've had no problem drinking on the run/racing to catch up to a speedy tank if they know I'll make it in time. Just kills me...and everyone else...when I'm bone dry and in the middle of sitting down and you grab two packs.
---
This is exactly my question as well...
---
Warlock is good on self sufficient-ness and badassery overall, but 5 mans/raiding may be slow to come by.
---
Priest is awesome on 5 man + raids, but solo farming suffers as holy and respecs for shadow PVP are painfull.
---
Shaman has the good elemental/resto hybrid build for pvp, but in raids deep resto is the way to go.
---
As a note, I'll probably have 2-3 hours/daily play time (more on weekends), and I do enjoy both ranged DPS and healing.
---
You see .. you just went back on your original point of DK’s being “nochanges” (although they were introduced in an earlier patch so it’s technically not even a change so whatever) if you would make the mobs invincible that’s changing an aspect of the game.
---
hopefully your computer is set up in your bathroom cause that sounds like a lot of diarrhea lol
---
Didn’t see in flames on top 30 ☹️
---
Good luck with those double freezing bands. Lmao
---
Is that a transformer???
---
I’m chasing a first to 60 👍
---
One thing I will say to be fair - when it comes down to endgame raiding fury warrior is more APM than rogue. Rogue is a good bit of pressing sinister every 4 seconds and after 5 press SND. Nothing in classic is fast like retail mdps can be.
---
That being said - rogue is a fuckin ton of fun, it's just got so much right with the core. Which is why it's one of the least changed classes over wow's lifetime - it was pretty damn good the first time
---
missing alliance flight path at the camp west of kurzens compound in STV IIRC
---
For those who don't know, to get to this point your guild needs to be able to full clear Naxx and have been doing so for 3 months on average.
---
Man I know the exact feeling haha.
---
I remember staying home from school and watching this vid at my grandparents when I wasn’t by my computer.
---
Ive said it repeatedly before and in the thread, but the DS build literally only went into demo for DS, and in fact has 13 talents that literally do nothing due to having no pet. This makes it squarely not a demo build, especially from a noob perspective (as demo talent tree implies you will actually use your pet). This is all besides the fact that i'm discounting squarely hybrid builds, as they are too complex to fit in the guide.
---
Perhaps you should do your own research of the thread, before shouting at me to research more.
---
I'm going to jog to 60.  Maybe taking 3 or 4 weeks.  Want to do a lot of dungeons along the way.  Going to level a hybrid class so I can do multiple roles.
---
I think you can fit an MRE in there for maximum constipation
---
I don't think "stand in that one spot that lets you duel" is an exploit.
---
It seems like the misspelling of the name is real.
---
Yes system of a down
---
Go Engineer, get gadgetzan trasporter...have hearthstone to org ??? PROFIT!
---
Light low carb meals, chicken and vegies, salads, tuna, lots of water.
---
Beer. Only drinking will.make sure you only have to pee. No long toilet breaks.
---
Apparently so. I just remember it doing terrible damage.
---
Human npc’s. They have to have pockets to pick.
---
Also the honor system will not be implemented until phase 2 so that will give you time to get ready before pvp goes wild.
---
WoW involved very little grinding, and grinding could be ameliorated completely with just a little rest XP and willingness to relocate. Compared to its progenitor, Everquest, where a solid day of play was sitting on a hill with a group killing Mountain Giant Tumps for eight hours to get half a bubble of XP.
---
Something something about how when I was a kid we had to walk uphill both to and from school.
---
I'd say by 45. Right at 40 is possible if you are thrifty or spend a lot of time gathering and playing the AH. Best way to save money is only buy skills you will use from your trainer for leveling and avoid buying gear upgrades from the AH before lvl 50 (quests will give you enough gear upgrades through the whole leveling to 60).
---
I'm sure it will fill out on launch day.
---
I don't get it.  Whats the story?
---
On the most recent reddit poll Stalagg has the most responses. It's becoming one of the higher population servers lol
---
The bigger problem I've noticed from retailers is that they think threat is automatically generated to the tank.  I've had dumbasses range attack targets when I'm trying to do a line of sight pull (with an arrow that missed but still worked as a pull) and then getting mad at me for not getting aggro...  Or all the dps choose their own targets and don't know what crowd control is.
---
You're allowed to, you're just an asshole :D
---
I have to say , i didnt played classic at all so it was just my thought. Started playing wow at bc on a private server where wotlk was released :P
---
But still thunderfury is one of my fav weapons ingame and i also want to grind for it.
---
Man but ill so damn happy when bc is there and i can get my classic rogue the Black temple stuff in two years
---
He'd probably sell more guides if he just said "I'm leaving my old guides up for those that have used them over the years, but I've made some updates to be more in tune with Classic WoW.  Please consider donating the $5 for the new guides."
---
&gt;With cataclysm, lizard change the questing experience to allow for more instances of multiple quests being able to be completed in the same area.

Not only that, theconspiracyisreal.com tells us that the Lizards have infiltrated everywhere, including our highest levels of government.
---
We're through the looking glass now, people.
---
I've missed the park
---
Working as well - I think that's kind of the point - they want to stagger the release as much as possible.
---
Sorry, meant BleuChex
---
Europe got incredible ones.
---
I won’t have a problem. I’ll have my mount at 40, and my epic one when I ding 60. 
---
I know how to make money though, and I’m not bad.
---
In case anybody want this tees
---
They are more vanilla than not having them. It was only NOT in the game for 6.333 months. They existed in the game for almost 18 months.
---
The biggest question you would need to answer is how do you think they will solve the issue of killing quest givers. It was a real problem that is why they added DK's. If you think blizzard fixed the problem the wrong way then what is your solution to bring to the community? Do you think that the community would get behind making all quest givers invincible because I can't think they want that change.
---
Not a game breaking exploit.
---
An example of that would be the saronite bomb usage in ICC. That’s an exploit. A game mechanic implemented by the original developers INTENTIONALLY is NOT an exploit by any means. 
---
No changes.
---
I think it’s Ashenvale looking into Darkshore, yeah
---
Drinking from a hydro flask negates constipation
---
MRE is just going to make you diarrhea profusely; which would greatly impact total time played
---
First the "slippery slope fallacy" is an informal fallacy. If there is a sufficient causal link it is not a fallacy. Second that's not the argument I'm making. I'm saying what you said was faulty logic. 
---
Second you're defining brightlines of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Your prescribing a maxim which would be more in the pervue of Kants first formulation of the categorical imperative. If you want to put it in debate terms :P. 
---
 “act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law”
---
That logic leads to an acceptable conclusion here, but not in evaluations of other things. So it's a bad tool with which to evaluatle permissible and impermissible behavior. 
---
&gt;My point was it would neither add something completely new that was never apart of vanilla nor would it remove something that was always part of the game.
---
Neither would removing AQ. Or BWL. Or talent changes from &gt;1.0.
---
I feel like the hotfuzz gif saying shame and loading the shotgun will be more apt for me.
---
Not true for TBC, you could jump straight into raiding in your t3 gear, with new weapons.
---
The first two were what I mostly found when researching. I primarily labeled destro as a + because of the noob perspective, and the fact that every single raid spec does enter the tree. The guides simply wernt built to show the details of a hybrid raid spec, and when you think "destro" warlock, you think of someone casting spells (while demo is using pets, and affliction dots).
---
Based on all that, I labeled destro as a plus, but I HIGHLY encourage any noobies to use these as simple quick look guides, and to find more detailed ones when they dive into their class of choice.

19 bracket on whitemane
---
In vanilla, my Shaman had his mount money by 41, so it’s not unreasonable.
---
I put together a ~7 hour playlist of what was playing back in the day at the LAN center I played and worked at. It's mostly 90s and early 00s techno/electronica.
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1UU7CyqdPYGb7LPZhiun6r?si=4-Oy6yXWTEGNtfsxucXNMg
---
I will probably be adding more to it over time.
---
Fuck i was wrong, there was no pvp. But in my memory of this vid i remember getting so hype. Funny seeing it all these years later. But i was probably drunk then and i am now, so theres that lmao. I just like the transition from weak to unstoppable with enya then sean paul. I still love it
---
They already opened Skeram and Blaumeux.  Players aren't moving.  Adding even more realms isn't gonna change that.
---
I've been decided for 3 days now, we'll see if I keep to it until launch.
---
Im sticking to water and a good caffeinated tea for fluids (can’t drink coffee anymore). As much as I’d love to imbibe on my favorite beers and liquors, it’ll just tire me out! So I’m using launch week as a week to stay sober. I think tomorrow I’ll go to my local discount grocer to see if they have any “healthy” frozen meals marked down for cheap, as well as any good low sodium soups and noodles. Some jerky and mixed nuts for filling and energy packed snacks. Maybe cheap deli meat/salami for quick sandwiches to fill the gaps. And then simple stuff like apples/bananas with some peanut butter. Light popcorn. Veggies and hummus! Yogurt and granola for the morning. Snacks that are tasty and filling without weighing you down and making you sluggish are possible folks! Of course, I’ll still treat myself to an entire bag of Doritos and a whole pizza at some point, or else it wouldn’t be a proper launch 😛
---
That's a reasonable view. My memory might be incorrect, but wasn't dishonorable kills in the honor tab initially? I thought they just weren't actually occurring until later when the civilian tag was added.
---
As much as these peeps?  https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
Who offer theirs for free no less.
---
Can’t let those gainz go to waste
---
When estimating the queue times, are they taking into account that people with 3 characters on one server can only play one at a time?
---
I don’t know what this has to do with Alex Jones but I enjoyed it
---
I’ve got a family, working full time and going to school full time. I’ll get to 60 sometime between now and January lol
---
Thanks
---
I never understood complaining about the sub fee for WoW. You get a game that is constantly being updated, supported, and kept online. You'll get hundreds of hours a month worth of enjoyment out of it, and it is available whenever you want it. All that for the cost of a decent weekend lunch. Why wouldn't that be reasonable? 
---
If Joana is going to be doing the same thing with his guides, why not make it a monthly fee? Like he even stated in the message above, you can just get a refund afterwards if it really matters that much to you. Considering his original guides cost, what, $40? I'd say that's a pretty good deal.
---
If you want to use demo go for it! I'm simply basing this off the research I found, and in general most guides seem to avoid going deep demo.
---
Personally i think any new player should completely forgo guides specifically while leveling, and experiment with various talents as they go, as ultimately unless your going for world first it doesnt really matter when you hit 60
---
Literally read everything people have written beneath your post. Just take the time to read them out loud to yourself
---
Like it’s the same shit repeated over and over, No changes. 
---
DK’s we’re implemented in a patch prior to 1.12. The developers and the community are committed to NO CHANGES. Which means that DK’s are staying.
---
I know this is old, but feels so good to be able to say congrats on your achievement!!
---
I feel like the first few instances they tank will be more than enough to shock them away from face rolling ever again.
---
CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!!!
---
Mage or warlock will both work, but they have significantly different playstyles. Priest healer is strong if you have a good partner (especially a geared warrior) to pocket heal
---
Wow.. The guy put a lot of work into that guide, your essentially stealing. Why don't you think he deserves to get paid for the hard work he put in?
---
Yea, maybe it's just me but I actually keep track of what I am spending money on because I look at my accounts regularly. Everyone should be doing that.
---
Risky click of the day
---
Oh dont make my cry :0
---
I was always play classic because ive never played it but was much excited about getting to BC again (my start expansion)
---
If you care about topping meters*
---
The utility that druids provide can boost overall group efficiency (clear times) more than just adding another "top" class.  Yeah, it may not show up directly on meters, but no one is going to deny you a spot in a group. 
---
If you enjoy dynamic, flexible playstyle, you can have a really enjoyable time learning to master druid's full potential.
---
Yea. I was in Vanilla beta and remember the launch. Being part of the shitstorm is part of the experience. 
---
Don’t rage about it or anything...just experience it and enjoy.
---
You have to climb up the mountain and drop down into it.
---
i think they will. they said they would. im surprised someone made the effort. maybe its just guerrilla marketing.
---
BE GUUUUUT
---
Thats what my brain told me lol . Its totally different than i remember.  But i remembered the music atleast haha!
---
Heh, according to the latest blue post:  Medium servers and up will have ques.  It is going to be a massive disaster.  :(
---
I wouldnt even be mad, I have tons of retail gold that I can convert to bnet balance
---
Honestly, the 30-39 bracket seems a better choice for Druid because of travel form, no?
---
I feel like everyone had one of these. and for good reason.
---
I would expect it to fill out once all the people on Herod see the year long queue times
---
Y'all remember the video with the scat man song when they raid the funeral...now that was hype lmfao
---
MODS, Please delete this thread it has links to a stolen Joana guide
---
That’s what made vanilla so great though, every new piece of gear you got especially blues felt so good.
---
Yeah right lol
---
Thank you, typo is fixed.
---
Have fun walking everywhere for 60 levels. To make enough gold for a mount and professions, you have to take your time.
---
Or find a reason to not like the server name.
---
I'm assuming you are talking about pvp and sure shamans have some neat tools but paladins just output way to much healing have better buffs that are not limited by range and have crazy cooldown moves that save the day. Shaman have really fun tools but they do not really compare to paladins in true usefulness in pvp and pve.
---
¿Que?
---
Yeah most likely. Personally I am starting off solo, no friends or guilds to worry about, so I plan on jumping to whatever the lowest pop west coast PVP realm is no matter what
---
Have fun with them respec costs and not getting a mount at 40.
---
Not 100% but that sounds familiar.  Can u link it
---
#nochanges
---
I would expect more people from Herod to go Skeram.  
---
Probably Whitemane players will end up on Blaumeux
---
DKs don’t always do dishonorable kills. Sometimes they kill people who deserve it.
---
Hunters are more than fine in all types of PvP. You have nothing to worry about. But definitely consider picking up engineering. Obviously it's good in PvP, but it's actually really nice on hunters for pve as well
---
Probably gonna be taking my time. 
---
 None of my IRL friends are as jazzed for Classic as I am, and likely won’t even play it.  (We usually do all MMOs together)
---
 This means I have no incentive to quickly reach end game. We’re all filthy casuals anyways and wouldn’t be rushing too much, but without them I don’t have to feel guilty about not rushing.
---
Thank you for your words o blessed one.
---
I do remember a vid of someone raiding a funeral,  can you share it?
---
Вот щербет!
---
(Try to check spelling and translation at google, haha)
---
If you’re a holy paladin wearing plate people are just going to ignore you in world PvP. Maybe a priest or warlock who wanna be dicks and mana drain you but otherwise no other class is gonna sit there and spend 30 minutes trying to kill you when you can probably out heal most of their damage if it’s only one of them, never go oom, blessing of freedom and walk away, or bubble hearth.
---
Or low levels.
---
there is a category for that . 
---
on grinder :)
---
that shit is all 10 years older than wow
---
He probably means that people like to farm the elementals, bandits, and iron veins.
---
I would level a bit in Arathi before going into STV back in vanilla. I remember horde farming the place didn't much care to pvp as long as I wasn't competing with them. STV on the other hand was MUCH WORSE. Place was crawling with gankers.
---
My one complaint with classic. Best class is locked behind worst faction.
---
This is a great idea. If I wasn't dirt poor I would buy one.
---
https://youtu.be/dAM9bGHmg8o
---
&gt;He 100% did say his guide wouldn't cost money.
---
Do you have a link to someplace where he said this? I must have missed it.
---
You're totally right besides, spamming for a tank? you don't wanted, don't want do that, you think you do, but you dont.
---
Amazing
---
According to wiki, 1.2% of Mexico has significant African ancestry, so the population of Blaxmex is around 1.5 million.  That's pretty substantial if you ask me.
---
Yeah man idk how people think gear just became insignificant when bc came out. It's like they cant even remember. If you had good gear when BC came out it lasted a WHILE.
---
Oh okay that's acceptable to me.  Have a nice day
---
I’m on Fairbanks but the crew and I made backups on Blow Job in case queues get absurd. But I have a feeling everything is gona fill up quickly on Sunday night regardless.
---
People going into movie theatre look quite healthy. A time before they got their wow bodies.
---
Yeah Whitemane and Fairbanks for people who want to stay on a PST server
---
Everyone keeps giving Nostalrius all the glory, but I'd say that the private server community as a whole is who we should be thanking, not just 1 pserver.
---
Countless other pservers existed before and after Nost, it wasn't the only one.
---
Yeah can all you fucks please stop rolling whitemane, faer, or herod? They all filled literally day one (except faer, cause assmon dickery) it baffles me that someone would see "full" and still go on it (except the streamer legions, they have proven themselves as sheep--especially the assmon  herd). Kinda wish blizz would just lock the servers now until launch.
---
work is da poop. not sure what "friends" are, though.
---
I go in 2 hours before launch and get off 7 hours after. I just took the next day off. I'd be pretty mad to take a vacation day and not be able to play.
---
Oh really I thought MREs cause constipation to stop people shitting on the battlefield
---
It's so annoying how much you're exaggerating. I've seen very little actual rage in this subreddit. Most have been pretty calm in discussing it, with only some people getting rowdy.
---
I do think people are surprisingly attached to the skeletons changes. But I'm not in charge of what people find important in a video game, and neither are you.
---
NP :) Happy to help... for free.... hear that greedy paywallers? FOR FREE! :D
---
Filthy horde.
---
Look, I'll grant you this: Content will be cleared faster. However, we disagree about the reasons and I'll just leave it at that.
---
It's the only way to fix the problem without discouraging world PvP. Honestly though, I don't really care one way or the other. Quest givers can be campable or they can be invincible. I just don't want DK's.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0TSGUf1xbF8

A $5 subscription specifically. After he supposedly said the guide would remain free and supporters would receive bonus tips and the like in a members area. Or so I’ve been told, I haven’t been following too closely.
---
I've Done rogue druid... Rogue can backstab
---
Druid/druid
---
Druid/ shaman
---
Druid/ Hunter
---
Are all really good
---
Oh nice, I feel like I'm only allow to play this playlist if I'm rolling Undead.
---
Accurate! .. except for "5 hours of sleep" - that would be a fucking luxury next week
---
&gt; That's pure alarmism. 
---
110% bullshit. Blizzard posted just a few hours ago that everyone should expect queues on all servers above medium—so high and full. The problem is almost all the servers (including ALL PvE ones) are high or full. Literally everyone who wants to play on a regular old PvE server has been told by blizzard that they’re most likely going to have to queue. 
---
And for some reason they haven’t even hinted at making new servers before the “emergency” ones they’ve claimed they’re prepared to spin up on launch day.
---
Free server transfers once they open up new realms after Phase 1.
---
Seems like the most normal choice.
---
People are celebrating that layering will be removed so quickly but I can't wait to see their reaction when they're trying to compete for 1 node with 50 other people. Blizzard really fucked up by not limiting server player numbers.
---
Rogue so you can do stealthy stuff together.
---
I prefer full coverage, when it isn’t I cover the background in white anyway!
---
You think that based on your feelings by not knowing the numbers? Anxious redditors like a lot to guess, think they know well, when they are actually totally in the dark.
---
*"Oh but Blizzard didn't guessed the exactly number of servers at start."*
---
That's intentional dude, they start small because they can expand, people see all the servers getting high populations and they think it will be a blast. They don't have the tools to shrink the numbers of realms. You thinking that was a failure, and that guiding your thought process says a lot.
---
Goes well with dwarfs too. They always seemed to be hardcore to me.
---
TBH I didn't know they even make 2.5  Ill look into that thanks
---
Agreed, the day of launch when all of the people waiting to sub actually pull the trigger I could see all realms jumping to Full to be honest
---
If Bliz launches some emergency servers at that point I will be jumping again. I have the advantage of not really giving too much of a fuck about names (and no friends)
---
Phyrexian mana to pay for all that monster

Bless your heart man! I have kids now who are starting to play games. It's all good fun. See you around maybe. :)

Demonology is the best raid spec for 20% reduced threat generation. Why you have it as dogshit?

Hahaha they convinced thousands of people to resub so they could beta test the servers, generate hype, and force people to buy another month 2 weeks after launch.

Can anyone explain the meme or whatever around Thex?  The first I heard of it was that character name post where you use your first two initials and 2nd and 3rd levels of your favorite city where the OP came up with Thex
---
Thanks, I hate it. Take your silver.
---
&gt; 30 year old boomer
---
lol, 30 is like 20+ years younger than a boomer. 30 is squarely millennial
---
&gt; you would frequently end up back at these hubs many times and grow to really appreciate them as a temporary home
---
I was leveling a character on retail earlier and it just weirded me out that all the little hubs (the zone is covered with them, it's like somebody had an ejaculation of flight masters over the map) had a tavern keeper for your hearthstone. I stopped to think for a second, who would even bother to hearth *there* ? Whereas I'd definitely considered putting down a hearthstone in some zones playing Vanilla.
---
I feel like crazy windfury kills on shaman are going to be more rare than you think, and maybe harder to gear up to.
---
The other 3 are all ace. I think warlock will be the most variety and perhaps a higher skill ceiling.
---
No

Why does everything on the internet these days have to be a bullshit, drawn out video?  Are people too stupid anymore to put intelligent thought into 10 smartly crafted bullet points?

Tu crois que je n'entends pas la distinction entre "eux" et "ou" ?  
---
La raison pour laquelle j'ai fait cette comparaison n'est nullement pour dire que c'est précis, mais pour être idiot-proof. J'ai vu, depuis hier, beaucoup d'exemples de "Yes, I say blow-mer" parce qu'on a lu quelque part l'astuce d'Earl et on, n'étant point francophone, n'a vraiment pas voulu comprendre ce dont il parlait.

Si un anglo sale t'abordait et disait, "Blaumou," tu comprendrais ce qu'il voulait dire mieux que se ce même personnage disait "Blaumère", ouais ?

Je tentais pas de décrire un son qui est "as close as it gets". J'essayais seulement de partager quelque chose d'assez semblable. C'est tout.

Racist religious zealots with imperialist intentions.

I'll be rolling in Goldshire Inn.. love the cosey vibes in there!

The shutdown of nostalrius is what gotthis ball rolling. It got so much coverage around that time it sparked something in the communoty

can you DM me the link?
---
So.. you basically want free reign to be a jackass to lowbies.
---
Why you think the net was born?
---
You don't need to be an engineer to know that we will most likely be doubling the amount of suns for classic on launch.
---
It's funny how reddit seems to think everyone that wants to play has already rolled a toon
---
Holy shit.I can’t wait to get home and download this.Amazing!
---
It also gives you something to look forward to on the side. It's nice when you have 30 mins to kill before bed or going to work. Hop on and work dat forge.
---
Lol fu k mages amirite
---
I wouldn’t decide what to play based on “whats more optimal in endgame” thats like ignoring 80% of the very important part of the game. Go for class fantasy, not numbers
---
I should avoid tanking dungeons for the first few weeks.
---
Goal should be to trigger people, that's what classic was all about mang
---
I hope you don't mind if I do the same but opposite. It will be a good pick me up in six months for me :D
---
You're so ridiculous.
---
Have you ever put a thousand hours of work into any single thing in your life?
---
If you have, give it to me. Right now, for free. Otherwise you're a PoS.
---
Its going to grow after launch, but not for a long time. The streamers will advertise it, it will become known in the gaming community once again. Then it will fall off, just like every game.
---
True, but it was Nost that they went after, and it was Nost that stood up and said "You can shut us down, but you should learn from us". 
---
I never played on Nostralius, but I respect the hell out of them. They created something out of love, and they worked with Blizzard in the hopes that that love could reach as many people as possible.
---
There are mobs that have invisibility and there are mobs that are in stealth
---
Fair enough lol
---
I’ve been telling my friends and group this for several days; we’re gonna sit through a queue no matter what eastcoast server we play on, just sit tight and let people play where they got their names.
---
It's interesting for me. As a scandinavian I want to pick the server where all the other scands are. But I'm still going to be speaking Engliah primalily except for like in  whispers.
---
I nagged on my guild until we got the 10-man ICC achievement mount. But I missed out on that Ulduar drake and I still regret it to this day, it was beautiful. Ironbound Protodrake. God, I wish Blizzard had pushed back TOC further to let us enjoy Ulduar more.
---
I went with Blaumeux. No idea why people hate the name. Badass raid boss from Naxx that has a badass French name that silly muricans like to pronounce Blam-o. Shit is great.
---
Cuz they share the human model :D
---
In the stress test general chat were usually helpful for locating quest areas, id say its a more immersed experience to do it with no guide.
---
I would disagree with the other comments regarding hunter. Well...a good hunter anyway. A bad hunter can get away without much. 
---
I'd probably say mage.

There ain't gonna be no getting ahead of this crowd.

His guide is poorly optimized compared to good routes and much of the alliance route is pilfered.

Wait, karma is a currency?
---
I can't recall the exact mobs but Frostadamus has a bunch of guides for grinding spots before hitting max level that should get you enough gold for all your class skills and your 60% mount. Head on over to his [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwvBlnNJoP8EEUnR3laqbGg) and search for gold/farming spots.

I guess we have a much different view on when someone is being berserk and seething with rage.

Layering is so last week, we're on to skeletons now
---
Genuinely interested to see if you're right, but historical precedent suggests you're wrong. The market has changed a lot since the heyday and exponential growth of WoW. There is WAY more competition, and the MMO loot/level model that EQ pioneered and WoW popularized is considered stale, rather than the industry disruptor it was back in 2004. The players will be cannibalized aggressively, including by WoW itself as the retail version rolls out new patches and expansions.
---
None of this should be taken as a slam on Classic WoW. The fact they're re-launching a 15 year old game without any kind of makeover and it's garnered as much interest and excitement as it has is a testament to its enduring popularity and the hunger for a return to old-school world building MMOs. It will be a successful product in its own right and live on for years to come in the form of progression servers. Just don't expect it to surge to 10 million + players and sustain that growth for 3-5 years.
---
Why would you switch out enchanting. What makes sense to get rid of is tailoring if that level of neurosis really mattered to you.
---
Youre not a boomer. Boomers generation is the softest one though. Get offended by anything.

In Warhammer all the Elves call mortal races  "mayflies" as to say that their lives are short lived. They deliberately take the longest (while most precise) way to do anything.

Try another game. If you don't own other games, try something free like Fortnite or something. (I don't condone actual Fortnite gameplay) and see if that crashes too. 
---
If your PC crashes, it's probably a hardware issue. 
---
GPU most likely, but could also be CPU or PSU.
---
Are there any other symptoms? 
---
Green Screen? Blue Screen? Black Screen?
---
Pls STFU, now and forever
---
10/10 great effort
---
Remember when they did a stat crunch, which felt shitty... Then proceeded to go with astronomical scaling between tiers again?
---
I thought the goal of the crunch was to bring things in line, so we could have a more gradual scaling. Guess not.
---
Better chance  getting  TF then full tier 3
---
Actually, I hate item bloat in modern WoW. I've only played a few months of WoD and Legion, but since MoP, I feel like theres just alllll this random shit you're supposed to have in your bags. Theres like 50 different daily currency items, random turnins, upgrade boost items, transmogs. I can't wait to just have 5 16 slot bags and manage a reasonable assortment of items.
---
Do event viewer logs give any clues?
---
Straight up losing power and shutting down seems hardware related, and not software.
---
Discussion at this point is dumb.
---
The game is launching in a week and layering isn’t going anywhere.
---
Oh, it’s also been mentioned ad nauseum *that it’s temporary*.
---
Touch what?
---
Don't demonize them, demons don't drop cloth
---
Unless your guild is trying to push for server firsts, never. If a guild is anal enough that they require you to have engineering, they need to up their game, gear and consumables.
---
Walking into ironforge was my first "holy shit" moment of playing wow. Definitely looking forward to that nostalgia trip.
---
Im totally new to wow and im going to play on a pvp server. Im thinking of going as a pally. Are they fun to play in general, whether that be in raiding or pvp? What can I expect of their playstyle in pve and pvp?
---
Last word
---
On the stress test I went to Moonglade to learn about Bear form, then opted for the complimentary flight back to Thunderbluff. It takes you on an epic 7min flight down the western coast of Kalimdor across the NE areas and Stonetalon before arriving back in Mulgore. Must be jaw-dropping for someone genuinely new to the game.

God forbid you try to do a full BRS run, wow that was something that rarely happened. On the flip side, I did BRD full clears a number of times and it did truly take all day.
---
She can run to IF and tram to Stormwind to meet you in Elwynn or you can make the trek to Teldrassil. There's probably youtube videos showing you how to do either of these.
---
Honestly, I kinda wish I had played on the Nost servers. I started WoW in Cata, so I'm in the apparent minority of Classic players that haven't been playing for fifteen years. Classic is going to be great, but I get the feeling that Nolstralrius had more of a Vanilla feel than Classic will ever be able to provide.
---
I feel like you already know the answer. This reads like an /r/wowcirclejerk thread.
---
This is what kills current retail for me. There is just so much that I am far behind on that also doesn't feel rewarding to do.
---
issue is the wording it has some and i didnt wanna get banned
---
I think swifty fought against fs in his “incredible warrior tricks” movie
---
I clearly remember hearing: “There’s not enough demand to justify them.” over and over on the forums throughout the years, that has clearly been disproven at this point and yes, it feels glorious. 
---
However, I don’t know if “you think yoi do but you don’t” has been disproven yet, that gets proven right or wrong in the long term. I already know I know I do, will be here for the long term and Blizzard is mostly out of touch with it’s fans, but I can only speak for myself.
---
While others have said rogue/druid -- something to be aware of there is the gear itemization competition.
---
Whereas, if you go hunter for example, you will(Can) at least use mail at 40.
---
You can also cheese some of the stealthy duo stuff via feign death.
---
If you want super fast dungeon groups, leveling as priest/druid (even if shadow spec while leveling), you can easily get 3 dps to do dungeons.. BUT, this assumes that your druid is good enough to do tanking in vanilla.. one of the make or break version of the games for tank skill.
---
That being said.. the first 10 levels are the hardest, so being in the same area to start is going to be insanely helpful.
---
IF this is a huge issue, you can level with her to say.. level 15 as both nightelf's.. then re-roll YOUR character and solo level as human/dwarf/gnome (class-whatever) while she waits for you..
---
Take your pick.
---
---------------
---
My last 2cents tho.
---
As a 10 year wow vet starting all the way back in vanilla (quit Jan 2016), I do NOT recommend druid as a first class to start. It's not easy.
---
Mage is quite a bit more forgiving as a first class (especially duo with ANYTHING), especially as frost... and all groups appreciate a mage. (Portals/Water/Food)
---
Feel free to PM me or reply here for any further discussion.
---
It’ll be in some form whether we like it or not. A website will simply take its place if blizzard breaks the addon.
---
It got Simpsonized.
---
Another solution is to make unlimited skeletons a choice. By default it can be one skeleton per player as they have it now, but you can toggle on unlimited skeletons in the interface. So if someone is worried about seeing hate speech or something from the skeletons they can keep unlimited skeletons off.
---
Retail doesn't have shit on vanilla wows population at it's end. And I say end because vanilla wow ROSE in population over its life.
---
There are more people who loved vanilla and wanted to love retail but couldn't than there are active subs to retail.
---
Jawless undead shoots wand and /dances just outside of Brill
---
Yeah badass character and name imo. Moved from Whitemane skipping Fairbanks. Fairbanks sounds limp and lame.
---
This isnt some kind of masterpiece that needs to be on display bro, you wouldn't inflate a kids ego that much by keeping their drawing on the fridge for more than a few weeks so why talk this guy up when he is clearly a below average painter? Stop pretending mediocraty is greatness and at least give constructive criticism instead of pandering for karma. You can put all your effort into something and still be bad at it and that is okay. There is always room for improvement and this guy clearly needs much more practice.
---
But then they couldn't force the Alliance as a true "humans and their pals" as opposed to a true Alliance between independent races without a centralised leadership.
---
High King was an awful decision, the Alliance didn't need a blue Warchief
---
This addon does nothing to break whats allowed by addons, it simply collects chat messages and lets yoi reply to them
---
I raided uldir and bod this expansion and got CE in both tiers. Nothing he said is wrong outside of raid finder. Astronomical amounts of ap for clearing heroic and looking for a few lucky titanforges or sockets. 
---
When you get a helm of wrath in vanilla, you got it. No ifs, and, or what the fuckforging. 
---
It's just simply a better system. Are there faults? Oh my god, yes.
---
But its still better. And it's a good lesson for anyone trying to develop a new mmo.
---
Dont worry so much from the tanking aspect, the dps needs to learn how to control their threat. Learn when to back off abilities to let tank gain more threat. Threat is not instantly gained but built up so if a dps attacks another target either through aoe or just hitting a second mob in the group multiple times, that's now more threat the tank needs to make up to gain back the aggro.

I can’t understand how someone can take this so seriously 
---
It’s a game! They’re having fun. 
---
We have PvE servers for people like you, who don’t know how to laugh.
---
Based on what I saw of its specs online, it should run. Its graphics capabilities are a little low and the processor isn’t exactly fast, so I’m imagining poor performance. But I think it’ll run. 
---
Can always test it with retail. If classic is built in modified version of its engine. If it runs at all Classic will run better than that. Haha
---
That's good to hear. For some reason I was under the impression that even after layering is scaled down and removed that realm pops would be roughly twice as large.
---
Could do like I"m gonna I'm gonna log in and run my happy ass to a city to sit in rested area  for awhile and just enjoy the insanity of chat for a day or three
---
His name is Wes Borland, Munky is Korn's guitarist

Hmu when it drops im playing a disc priest and a hunter

---
Dear God, Stitches will return
---
Yes, yes it is
---
A decent chunk of people can't spell rogue right after 15 years.
---
Why roll? When you're a rogue you shall ninja loot it anyways
---
Then just go single target spec. Impossible to AoE farm at launch unless you're very far ahead of the pack or find a dungeon group to spam dungeons with.
---
&gt; I'm guessing they expect a 50-70% drop off in the first few months, that's the only real explanation for why there are so few realms.
---
50% would be extremely low dropoff. Several years ago, Blizzard stated their retention was around 30% for early levels.
---
I've ran/played wow on a 2012 and 2015 Macbook pro (MoP and BFA) and typically run about 25 fps on mostly low/settings. It's not as bad as it sounds and can definitely get you by in most areas with a few possible spikes. As for the cooling system, prepare for your Mac to become really hot and loud. I don't know the harm this can do on your mac but I would play 3+ hours and didnt notice any issues.
---
As for gaming on a Mac who cares. As you mentioned that you travel quite often you have to make deal with what you can and be happy that you're still able to game in any fashion :D
---
I hope this helps! I have the 2019 Macbook Pro and it runs 120 fps on low and about 40-60 on ultra for BFA. Hopefully this helps but best of luck and you'll probably be able to smoothly run WoW on low settings
---
The only thing I want from TBC are a few talent change they made to some of the hybrid specs to make them a little better. For example, Elemental Focus for Elemental: it went from a 10% chance on any offensive spell cast to make your next cast free, to critting with an offensive spell made your next 2 casts 40% reduced cost. Some minor changes like that, keeping in the spirit of Classic.
---
How should i know im new to classic i just want to try the classic experience without queue addons and what not.
---
Looking through your post history, this seems to be a throwaway account just to be contrarian, so I ain't mad that you didn't pay any mind to anything I said, but you lecturing people about not doing research and then citing google as how you did research is top fucking kek, sir. I applaud your persistence, but you don't fool me.
---
Keep it chill. Go slow, enjoy the world, and say hi to all of the people you meet! That's what Classic is about!
---
Ok thanks for your reply "Fenald" I quoted your name so that when you delete your post I can still rub it in your face.
---
And then aside from mage, all of these ccs end up not mattering if you're not garbage because you have intercept and hamstring and do twice their damage.
---
Didn't really mean optimal just more so curious on Druids "place" throughout the game.  Thanks for the quick responses btw, much appreciated!
---
They're slow to level unless you duo with someone. Mages are great all through classic, there's gong to be a lot of them. Rogue for some reason aren't as popular as they used to be. Maybe everyone is dreaming of being the epic fury warrior. Getting leveled and geared as a warrior is like climbing a mountain, but once your there your on top of the world.
---
The AMA covered it.
---
The old guide is incredibly out of date though.
---
Layering stops after phase 1 no matter what.
---
Oh, man! I am a little jealous of you right now, that sounds like the dream.
---
Right there with you. I want to get some enjoyment out of the low level dungeons in particular while there's still plenty of activity at those levels. There may not be a huge experience incentive to running WC a second time, but lord knows I'll be doing enough solo questing as well. Might as well meet some friends and have some fun in groups along the way. And I want my professions to more or less keep up with my level, so I can make myself some decent gear as I grow.
---
One of the best ever!
---
There was a vanilla lfg addon but few used it. It was still per realm and you made listings others could view.
---
Hey man I bet there's someone out there you can convince that 9/11 was an inside job. You're wasting your time here
---
He that was ancient when the world was young?
---
you mean AzureCeremonial?
---
Might as well make the experience as refreshing as possible and go with a new faction. If you hate it, roll Horde again. That's my plan and also my fallback.
---
Funny I love night elf zones so much and live in Wa.
---
WA pretty much looks like Darkshore.💗💗
---
Honestly Ironforge is almost tempting enough for me to main Alliance.
---
Almost.
---
Each server has a discord.
---
Yes, smh. I was looking forward to the old world being busy again and being able to pick a capital city, and instead they put up a bunch of portals and forced everyone into SW.
---
It's so weird, since they managed to go from vanilla to WotLK without needing to squish stats, and then now they can't even release a single expansion pack without things going haywire.
---
I never really played in Classic, this was basically what I had read when starting on servers. I started in TBC so it was completely different. I am thinking of starting a Warrior first off despite knowing they're a pain in the ass to level but I was reading guides online (old ones) basically stating it's best to get one class going for gold farming so that when you start leveling the class you really want to, you'll not have to worry about making the gold. Wasn't sure how accurate it was since I only got to about level 30 on a server before quitting. I might just take your advice since I see some guides online specifically geared towards leveling a Warrior in Classic (newer guides thankfully).
---
Addons like this existed on private servers for years and they still are around and are basically the reason we have classic.
---
And itll still be people on your server in your community
---
Pretty sure the left button was default to lock your run in wow also
---
Sure. My comment was to the comment I replied to 
---
&gt;As far as I know the realm caps once layering ends will be no different than they were in vanilla.
---
This isn't 2004 and this isn't' vanilla. This is 2019 and its a 15 year old style classic server competing with a modern one.
---
It doesn't work like you think it does.
---
I agree with what you just said 100% as it sounds like we had similar childhoods. But I cannot agree with the mindset that everyone should just suck it up, different people, different problems, different life's. Being bullied as a child doesn't compare to being bullied by a large amount of society your entire life, something you never escape, they don't even equate. There is nothing wrong with voicing that people should try to not be brought to emotions so quickly, but you were defending toxicity, and now you're backstepping the argument.
---
And you're wrong about empathy, through it I gain a better understanding of people and the world, empathy may create anger when others are mistreated, but it also creates more meaningful and deep relationships with a more diverse group of people who have different wisdoms and cultures to share.
---
I likely won't even remember to come back and mock you when you're overwhelmingly wrong.  I tell people they're wrong all day every day and I'm right 99% of the time.  Going back to mock all the idiots would be a full time job.
---
TIL Charlie Kelly plays WoW

God I vividly remember listening to Minutes to Midnight while leveling my druid in Desolace
---
This. Source:am 30.

The retail character models are shit.
---
And it's actually closer then most people are callingit
---
until you deviate slightly off the path and a vulture kills your ass... or you get stuck on a pebble :&lt;
---
My pvp videos on 240p thank you.
---
Eh, idk if it was the best. It was good but I personally thought it felt a little cringey.
---
Tendies and Mountain Dew.
---
TBC had some glaring flaws, notably the insane masses of trash that were respawning and the fact that warlocks were the only viable AoE class.   
---
I think the large majority of people who raided TBC hardcore back in the day would be ok if the trash stopped respawning in SSC and TK.
---
I mean I am excited about classic as well, but these people commenting that this could sell for thousands of dollars or it's some kind of masterpiece are delusional. An elementary school kid could of easily made this so not sure what they are going on about. Again I understand the hype for classic, but if people only want to hear positive comments about their content or art then don't post it on a site where literally anyone can critique it. I am sure if you keep at painting you can improve.
---
You don't want an outdated guide.
---
I have a 2016 MacBook Air and played BfA for a month or two when it was released. Had no issues including in cities. Classic should be totally fine, but maybe just expect to turn down graphics settings if cities are super crowded.
---
Glad I can see that original comment when I click on your profile. Those links are helpful.
---
Because they are a bunch of retail babies who can't see that this is literally just chat channel UI...
---
I got really good at xfering in public games. Sometimes people would notice and be searching for it. Best method was avoid cold plains wp.
---
Also a [new Static X album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Regeneration) is coming out this November.
---
I'll be in class but I don't envy them. I'll start playing when things have cooled down, queues are less and areas are less crowded so I'm happy with that.
---
Some people picked names they want to be called and not random words I guess.
---
&gt; almost demonically so
---
I'm pretty sure Sauron counts as a demon. He's a fallen Maiar (a LOTR angel).
---
Yeah, I take 3mg and even after several years it's pretty soothing (I'm one of the lucky 3% that gets the hypnotic effect tho.)  I couldn't imagine what 30mg would do to me.
---
Hoping I can login to skeram before the people avoiding queues and people waiting til launch day hit all the servers like a tsunami.
---
One of the best sensors for fps ever made. 450dpi, slight negative accel at high speeds. Perfect tracking.
---
This thing is legendary.
---
Mechanical Animals, What an amazing album.
---
Vanilla wow hit 8 million over it's life from a starting point of 1.5. No game since has had that ratio of growth over that time period.
---
I agree that the market is different. The problem is that nothing that has come out has been better than vanilla and that is the sad truth.
---
i mean the guides great, it really is.
---
but it doesnt save, and there isnt a fast way to skip ahead. even by the time you are in your level 20's its going to take 5 minutes of skipping through steps to get back to where im at. it *really* needs a save feature of some kind.
---
Well, since I have MacBook Air, I assume it should get really hot and loud. Im planning to play in 1-2 hour bursts, so I hope it wont melt too much :D
---
Oh interesting, so SW had their AH added later? I have minimal experience playing Alliance but have definitely preferred IF to SW for general navigation for sure.
---
Great stuff! Didn't see any Modest Mouse or Queens of the Stone Age though :-( Can't grind without them!
---
Sort by alphabetical, I have Float On and No One Knows in there :)
---
This is how I got the winter spring head accidentally. I was partied with two hunters who needed a buff, so I just FD’ed while one fought the demon. They forgot to change the loot so I was the only one who could loot it. I felt so bad for the guys. (But one less I had to do lol)
---
I’ve been thunderstormed off of enough cliffs, it’s hilarious when it happens. 
---
It’s hilarious, yeah the repair bill from fall damage sucks (and in this case, the receiving end needs to hearth or fly back to winterspring)
---
But moments like this are great imo. Wouldn’t be as fun without them.
---
“Oh shit I’ve been MCd”
---
“OH FUCK THEYRE JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF”
---
“OOOH MY GOD”
---
This. So much. Turning the Alliance into a copy of the Horde is one of the big reasons I'm so happy to go back to classic. And they destroyed the park with the moonwell!
---
I thought this too...
---
Still not moving. I'm happy to sit in a big queue for the first couple of weeks if it means I'll end up on a server that is still heavily populated after all the tourists have left. Nothing is going to change that.
---
Thanks man this really helped. I think I'm going to roll a druid now together with her druid so that I'll be able to be with her during the learning curve and if I don't like the druid I will eventually roll as a mage and that's it, problem solved.
---
For horde it's pretty nifty. For alliance it's a bit of a pain in the ass; a bunch of quests are locked behind chains that start in IF and SW I think. Have to travel all over the darn place but finally getting that shit over with and hearthing to IF to turn them in is god damn cathartic.
---
My last few rounds on pservers I managed to avoid STV until level 36/37. Highly recommend for either faction, it makes it so much less painful
---
I think i can post my playlist too [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WDm7XEBGjUrnFCxODgUlr?si=zkJ0ewTsSHWV6kEgzRUsxQ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WDm7XEBGjUrnFCxODgUlr?si=zkJ0ewTsSHWV6kEgzRUsxQ)
---
They had to remove AP scaling from almost every ability and set the pet stats to a flat value that makes them useless in endgame content.

Everything is cyclical. What was Stale 4 years ago may be hip again

---
Same. That and seeing the snow after you came out of the tunnel.
---
What a new take!
---
It's been 15 years. Vanilla steadily grew in popularity because it was new, it was easy to get into relative to everything else in the genre and it was made by a company that was very trustworthy at the time. None of those are valid anymore, and gaming as a whole has changed massively since then.
---
It's not even a question of expectations. People WILL leave in droves between the second week and the second month. That's just how it is.
---
Thank you for this!
---
lol'd hard
---
here's a protip for this time around... swim in the ocean, lol. If you're alliance you can swim all the way from the westfall lighthouse, on afk autorun
---
I mean, my sister played on my account back in vanilla and she got me a few boe epics from thirsty losers. I think most girls who play use their sex to their advantage.
---
This lady just tookit to a whole notha level, I ain't hatin
---
Basically all the lore by the point of BfA.
---
I remember seeing this exact picture back in like 2005 or 2006. Good stuff.
---
Who's triggered?  I don't even think druid would be my main in terms of play time... Though it is the class I've probably had the most fun [with.](https://with.You)  
---
You simply mentioned two spells that demonstrate the *vast* difference in capability between the classes. I pointed out that there isn't *that* much of a difference between them. Then it's talents. I even point out similar corresponding talents.  Now it's class specific racials? You keep moving the goal posts!  
---
Priests are rightfully considered the primary healer in the game.  They are a pure healer class and all other healers are hybrids. But the difference in their capabilities isn't so vast as to entirely dismiss those other classes. 
---
At the end of it all, play what you want.  They're all pretty valid within a totally playable margin.
---
I basically used up all of my retail luck on Sulfuras. I solo cleared MC twice and an eye dropped both times. I thought the game was broken.
---
I feel like a grumpy old man reading this thinking "that's cute, try EQ1".
---
Best threat wep in game for Warriors even in tbc
---
Sadly true bro
---
Why was he fired?
---
I think a more insidious thing to worry about is these changes that blizzard wants to make so their own lives are easier like the loot rule changes and the skeleton change.
---
To piggyback on this, OP, the guilds they want that have already done this before multiple times on a pserver and know exactly the fastest and best way to get it done.
---
You ain’t getting it. Sorry.
---
It is still showing as high but the [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update-august-21/262141) today said to expect wait times even in medium servers and more so on high and full servers.
---
A warlock or warrior because they benefit the most from having a healer with them. That even enables the druid to spec balance for leveling.
---
From your personal picks I think either rogue or druid so you can also be a night elf.   
---
If you want to get the druid to stormwind because you are a mage or paladin, what you do is, get to Menethil by a boat then swim along the coastline north of Dun Morogh to a point where you can be in the water, but be considered in Dun Morogh then drown yourself and spirit res in Kharanos.  
---
If you want to get the human to the NE zone, there is a similar skip west of Ironforge where you can jump a bit down the mountain to a point where you are considered in wetlands then suicide and spirit res in Menethil.
---
Just search classic wow wetlands skip on youtube there are many videos of both with the exact locations.
---
It’s not abuse, mind controlling is _used_ for making people suicide!
---
I got guildbankalt
---
What is the reason for that?
---
You’ll need to jack up your settings to recreate that atmosphere.
---
Try grindr
---
I could rant about it for so long. I loved the Alliance as, well, an Alliance. To me that's how it always made sense how they didn't crush the Horde despite their clear advantages in terms of land/economy, etc. You can actually see it portrayed well in early Wotlk. When the Warchief sounds the call to war, pretty much every Horde race is fighting together in Borean Tundra as the Horde has one, centralised leader. It's the example Bobby B gives in Game of Thrones, 5 armies, vs 1 army.
---
You look at the Alliance, on the other hand, and outside of the 7th legion the war effort is being fought mostly by humans and dwarves, with the occasional gnome. We see how the regular human soldier finds the Draenei too alien to trust, and the night elves show up independently to look at some Highborne stuff.
---
I loved that disconnect between the two, because it made for a really interesting divide between the two cultures. But na, now we have God King Anduin and Human Potential everywhere.
---
The biggest problem with Darnassus as a hangout spot isn't the distance between the bank and the AH, but the lack of a good tavern. Or a bad one. There isn't even a bloody tea room.
---
you must be horde, allies usually avoid confrontation if they are by themselves
---
Alright, awesome, thanks for the info!
---
Capital City Lordaeron, or bust.
---
I'm not really trying to incite a change with layering.
---
Some people in this sub wholly believe that even during P1, layering will destroy the experience.  The post was mostly trying to quell the outrage that spreads unnecessarily.
---
Yeah MD / Ruin was niche... Basically, if you could keep the pet alive it was, in theory, the highest dps because the Succubus gave you a 10% buff and could join in on the attack, and saccing her just gave you a 15% buff, and she did more than 5% of your base damage for sure... it's just any fight with AOE roasted her.
---
(Also it gave threat reduction with the Imp if your tank was crap and Fire resist and Nature resist for having the fel hunter)
---
TL;DR it might be the best in theory if you did everything perfect, but it was very annoying to do so.
---
lol you're right 99% of the time. I love it. You are the exact kind of person who cant think.
---
I quit WoW mid-Cataclysm, not counting a 48-hour attempt during WoD.  In that time I've played many MMO's and frequented their forums and subreddits.  I gotta tell ya, the WoW toxicity is a special kind that I just don't think I've seen anywhere else.  I'm not sure what that means about the community but the bitching (especially about seemingly inconsequential issues) has a very distinct flavor to it.
---
I never knew that!
---
*siiiiiiiiip*
---
Can you explain the loot changes? I only heard about the corpse thing.
---
I think that was after taxes and other costs like paying a distributor and whatnot.
---
&gt;Vanilla wow more than quadrupled its population over its life
---
This isn't 2004 and this isn't vanilla.
---
I'm actually planning to level slowly and take months to do things. 
---
I know that this is an enjoyable play style for me and have liked doing it on private servers.  Letting the 20-hour-day fanatics level out of the way is a good plan, anyway.  Same with letting impatient newcomers with gogogo ideas about rushing through every dungeon AOEing everything give up after Deadmines.
---
Yeah I was catching up on storyline and the models in cinematics look awful too.

Of course you can, not everyone is going to be gunning for 60 and saving every penny for mounts and those people are banking on selling stuff on the AH for the 60 mount. And that speed leveling group is probably a very small minority of the player base. Most people wont even be at 40 after the first week. I think too many people are underestimating how long it will take to get to 60, especially with how full the servers are so far. If you think about it, the WR for 60 was basically 5 days (4d 20hrs) in game time. So someone playing 8 hours a day at WR pace would take 2 weeks to reach lvl 60. That pace is not going to happen so it's safe to say that most players wont be hitting 40 for a bit and the AH will be already thriving by then.
---
Back then server firsts actually meant more.  People hadn't figured out the raids yet and everything was fresh.  Now?  It's already been done.  There are countless guides telling you exactly how to do it.  There are mods that will literally play the game for you.  Vanilla raiding was a time sink pain in the ass but it wasn't hard, and now it's only easier.
---
Here's what to expect for anyone who didn't actually play classic but is buying into the hype.  Grind to max level.  This will take a lot longer than you think, but you'll probably remain fueled by the excitement that is level 60.  Then get to level 60.  You're still excited.  It's like you've gone back in time before technology existed and people around you are churning butter in world chat spamming LFG for 5 man dungeons or key attunments for UBRS.  The novelty of that is going to wear off real fucking fast.
---
Next thing you're doing is grinding dungeons for blues for hours at a time.  There is an ungodly amount of trash and it takes forever to get through.  Chances are your item doesn't drop.  If it does, chances might be 50/50 that you get it.  Repeat this for a bunch of hours until you've got your full blue set.  
---
You're fully geared, now what?  Warsong Gulch, AB and AV.  That's it.  No arena, and I bet you think classic was full of great world PvP.  Nope, wrong again.  In some places you could find world PvP, but mostly it's just forced in places liked hillsbrad and these encounters quickly turn into giant zergs.  There really aren't many good PvP zones in vanilla.  Felwood is ok to catch tryhards farming tubers, but until Silithus gate opening event happened, world PvP was a chore to find.
---
So now that I've shattered your dreams of any meaningful world PvP, all there is left is raiding.  Can you dedicate 8 hours a day each week, or maybe twice a week, to raiding?  This doesn't include the time to level alts and farm gear, mats and pots for each of them.
---
If you can't afford to grind raids every week in this manner, then everything else gets a whole lot worse for you, too, because the best gear in PvP is raid gear.  You'll get shit stomped on repeat by people with far better gear than you.  Skill won't save you, only better gear will.
---
You also can grind WSG for 10 hours a day every day to hope to attain some epic PvP gear after a few weeks.  It's still not better than raid gear.
---
Sound fun?

Already been answered on their forums for the most part.

1. No

2. Maybe

3. lol releasing info on company practices in 2019

RemindMe! 60 days

was big sad that I was unable to snag the name trash each time I moved to a server that opened up. Congrats tho on those names!
---
[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/) has quite bit of useful advice.
---
Fuck Jannies 😎

As I recall unbreakable the shaman was server first with Hand of rag due to our MC loot luck being absolute dog shite. We farmed mc for the majority of vanilla before getting a thunderfury... which went to the ball of stew.

No offense intended, but people could easily see the answers about layering in the pinned post with the AMA. An entirely new post wasn’t necessary.
---
Good intentions, though.
---
Curious, what other companies? Square already rebooted FF Online. EverQuest next is DOA. What am I missing?
---
We didn't understand that back then but it was clearly vision of future. We are standing in middle of burning BfA and watching towards green old times of Classic.. and we are so f\*cking ready to hit that Enter World button!
---
Nobody would bother tabbing out to use a site.
---
It's not written by kargoz.
---
Now while I didn't play during classic I did still play pre cata and looked up several quick leveling guides in order to get to max level as quick as possible and kinda regret it. I didn't take time to enjoy the world around me and when it was wiped away forever I felt kinda bad I never really explored. This time around I'm gonna go at my own pace, go to the zones I want to, and enjoy myself
---
I remember thinking Blaumeux had a sexy ass voice back in Wrath.
---
Your jealousy is showing
---
If that is true I am seriously reconsidering my career choices /s
---
You are the reason why a lot of people roll their eyes at the Classic fandom. 
---
Hell, I'm looking forward to playing Classic, and I'm doing rolling my eyes at this post right now.
---
Well i can live with that :&gt; 
---
But still, we will try, there‘s nothing to loose.
---
Yeah it's 2019 when games are all shit. You act like things have gotten better. Then why are you on wow classic forums waiting for the vanilla hookup? Shouldn't you be playing whatever great mmo is so much better?
---
check out [4th comment from the top](https://www.reddit.com/user/AncientInfluence/comments/)
---
wowhead devided the gear in phases but might be wrong since they dont know which item is supposed to be in what phase.
---
according to the blizzard ama mc/ony loot for example is the 1.12 version and is droping like the 1.09 loottable till phase 5 after that the 1.12 applies.
---
wowhead did a good job at predicting what item drops when but can be wrong. they might be wrong about that band too.
---
nobody knows for sure since blizz also said "some suprise should be kept"
---
Retail bad
---
Classic good
---
Honestly addons "breaking" classic was(and still is) my biggest worry ever since classic was annouced in the  first place. Some of the things just werent possible to do back then with addons and if we brought full power of modern wow addons it would make the game much diffrent.
---
It looks like they are adding new servers 1-2 at a time as they fill up.
---
From the wording, PvE servers are nowhere near as crowded.
---
It’s fairly easy to get! Besides, it’s mostly for bragging rights. It’s only extremely marginally better than the Barbarous Blade/Bloodseeker (AV quest crossbow) combo, due to Bloodseeker having a better speed.
---
I'm a big thinker.  I see the lines
---
Yeah, I figured that as a Warrior it's best to pickup First Aid, Fishing and Cooking so that I have an arsenal of things to heal when out of combat. What helps even more is I've decided to go Carebear in Vanilla and roll on a PvE server (haven't decided on which one yet) so I don't need to worry too much about getting ganked. I am thinking of doing mining/engineering since I know how hot Eng was in the Classic Beta from what I saw in all the videos from different streamers. 
---
Thanks again for the helpful advice my man! Definitely owe you big time.
---
Jealous that I can look things up and you cba? That must be it.
---
WHAMMIE
---
Kiwi here, it will be 10am here so alot of kiwis wont be on. I'd say the queue time will be like 30 mins max.
---
You know, I take it a step further.
---
Yes, this is exactly what it is - a chance to go home again, except with the knowlede of your past mistakes.
---
When I played the first time through, I was 19 years old.  Handed the game for a Christmas gift and never had experienced anything quite like it.  It was a way to bond with my older brother, something that didn't happen a great deal growing up.  I was angsty, dealing with college, a really rough break-up, losing friends over depression, and all-in-all, WoW was the only thing in my life that brought me joy.
---
Now I'm going back.  I have rekindled relationships with some of those old friends.  My brother and I are going to be leveling together some, raiding together even more.  I'm in a GREAT place in life, both mentally and physically.  Now I get to go back with a positive outlook and experience it the way it was meant to be played.
---
&gt;Med and up
---
Just to clarify,  it's **above** medium,  not including it.
---
Problem is the name. Nobody wants that server name.
---
this is some form of satire right? Bro you made this in paint, why are you talking about selling prints
---
Damn right.
---
Retail shit
---
Classic neat
---
What you mean tank? TF is hunter loot
---
Yeah you have a big ego because that's just super smart
---
Yep totally. You will be behind the curve, but there will be so many players, it literally won’t matter. Just see how you feel a month in. Raiding might be hard tho.
---
Ooo now your pettiness
---
I scheduled the week off over a year ago. Been warning my co-workers for the last month. "Don't call me, I'll be in Azeroth"
---
&gt; Blizzard are now saying that a full realm in original would only rank as 'Low' in Classic. This seems to suggest server caps are at least 12k, probably more.
---
Imagine the price of Devilsaur leather. The spawns are restricted and that stuff is expensive even on normal population servers.
---
See you next Tuesday!
---
As a newer player I thank you for this. I plan on taking my leveling experience casually, and stuff like this helps out a ton.
---
Classic+ is the only right direction.
---
I had one of those, I threw it out after the outer paint wore off and the metal paint underneath gave me a rash
---
It’s a little of column A, and a little of column B.
---
Skeletons *are* getting removed, because they’re only allowing one player to leave one skeleton, ever.
---
It’s dumb, and a really stupid excuse as to the *why*, and I hope they change it.
---
It was awful. I did it on the stress test and it was literally like 10 guys standing around waiting for an item to repop and be the first to ninja it.
---
We've had queues in retail.  It'll even out after a while.
---
But low-pop servers are really bad., ask any person who was on one.  I would really think twice about taking a medium pop now just to not have queues in the short run.
---
This guy is really overblowing druid difficulty. Cat, bear and moonkin have a total of like 4 abilities each. The difficulty will be getting her to set up good keybinds so she can say, leave a form and cast roots or a heal easily.
---
Still, leveling double druid would be fun, not a bad idea.
---
If a player is found to be scamming, a GM can recoup your items and ban them but it'd have to be guaranteed. If you need something enchanted, use the lowest slot as it doesn't actually get traded. Trading makes it bind on pickup anyway.
---
And it will be the same players that complained about layering, saying that they would rather have queues that lastes for days.
---
Realm mergers &gt; 3 hrs queues
---
I’ll be in my 10 hour queue with the weebs and that hacker named 4chan on WhiteMane :(
---
The name Patchwerk was just taken by a new PVP realm for mainland China server.
---
yeah.... that doesn't matter. 
---
Its old. Most of the world has moved on. Our interest in niche even if its a big  niche.
---
60 warrior by Labor Day hopefully.
---
That’s where your wrong buckaroo my triple screen setup disagrees with you.
---
ever? Like if I die and drop a skeleton, and I die again I do not drop another skeleton while my old one disappears?
---
God ^dammit ^^flight ^^^maste^^^^eeeer
---
The 2000s were an edgy time
---
There aren’t really a whole lot of scams that can’t be countered by *paying attention to what you’re doing*. 
---
I don’t agree with disciplining scamming unless it involves an exploit or removes choice from the purchaser.
---
ty
---
Holy shit yes. Great idea
---
I work in a hospital to pay for university. I worked my ass off the whole of August, so I could take the last week off. So now I’ll have the last shift on Saturday. But I wouldn’t have minded if I had to work. I mean it still takes me a lot of time to hit 60 anyways.
---
Oh man, may need to switch over.
---
Something to doing?
---
It backfired, now people are answering the question in the wrong way.
---
I bet you are fun to hang out with...
---
thx man
---
&gt; I don’t agree with
---
I really don't give a shit. I'm just telling someone the answer to their question.
---
On Pservers we had vQueue, it works just like classicLFG, it’s fucking amazing.
---
All of the retail folks coming in. I heard someone saying they can ban people for corpse camping
---
Hahaha it’s called a PvP server for a reason!
---
Missing some evanescence
---
Someone build me a YouTube playlist of this damnit
---
Probably not, but if you're relying on AoE grinding at launch you'll probably be closer to a semi-casual player speed.
---
AT 1 TIME YOU LEFT A SKELETON EACH TIME YOU DIED, AND THEY PERSISTED FOR SOME TIME.  NOW THEY DON'T PRESISTS.  IT WAS CANGED DURING VANILLA BECAUSE GOLD FARMERS WERE USING SKELETONS TO MAKE ADS FOR THEIR SITE.
---
What I hear you saying is that you're a Rogue looking for "Wings for Hector" because that vid turned you on to Tool?
---
Just kidding : ) hope you find it!!
---
The players who stopped playing after TBC or Wrath who are re subbing prove that we do.
---
It would be nice to play Kotor, was too young when that came out
---
The extra elevators are right next to the graveyard at which you will spawn after inevitably falling down the bluff one day.
---
If you die once in a session, that skeleton stays.
---
However, if you die a second time, the original skeleton is removed and a new one placed at the new spot of death.
---
You can also adjust your settings through the Nvidia control panel if you have an nvidia graphics card. (for example Digital Vibrance for more vibrant colours, there's also a lot of performance settings)
---
And for colours you could also change your monitor settings
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search/?q=Macbook%20Air&amp;restrict_sr=1) some info.
---
interesting! souunds a bit niche for a super simple guide like this, but it is good to know that in theory a pet using warlock could compete. 
---
I always thought it was silly that the most demo focused builds didnt use a pet!
---
Why are you providing misinformation to new players though?
---
Demons drop Felcloth, the most valuable cloth of all, you fool!
---
Tauren is the only one I really dislike... Its "bounciness" and the silliness of its speech animations really don't match the the voice acting from the emotes.
---
This is one of the things I've been really wondering about.  At what population does supply run out and prices sky-rocket for just normal resources?
---
I'm quite surprised at the size of the population cap, albeit we don't have a solid number on that.  How many players can Azeroth truly hold before its being picked clean?
---
Best comment on this thread lmao
---
I've been maining Ret/Prot pally since vanilla, but my RL friends are pushing for Horde (filthy savages). I'm thinking undead Rogue, combat swords, mining/skinning to level and then drop skinning (after making bank on devilsaur hide) for engineer. The ability to lockpick, pick my fights in the world, be a solid addition to any pvp team, and have the potential to get close to the top of the raid charts (something I never did as a pally) are all appealing to me. I'm afraid of being locked as a dps (no way around this), class abundance making it harder to get a spot anywhere outside my group of friends, severe gear competition, and the cost of having to respec every time I switch from PvE to PvP (if I want to pull my weight). I'm not much of an alt guy so this is kind of the big decision. Can any former vanilla rogues weigh in on the difficulty?
---
You know wows numbers kept climbing in tbc.  By your logic that makes tbc better than vanilla.  Do you agree with that assessment?
---
We really can’t answer that because of screen settings can be different. 
---
That’s something you’ll have to do.  I suggest finding your screen calibration settings, which won’t be perfect. It will be much closer than factory.
---
Then follow any gamma or brightness settings that most games have, which I can’t remember of WoW has.
---
Absolutely no reason to be rude. You must be a fun guy at parties.
---
That's not an MMO, though. You can play it right now as it existed then. And you should. It's excellent.
---
If it looks too old they won't even try it. But you have games like old school runescape that actually have risen back to their peak population. Because guess what game mechanics are the most important thing to longevity
---
You will have massive regrets if you eat like this, you need water and like some fucking carrots man.
---
The amount of misinformation I'm this thread is staggering.
---
Hmmmmmm not sure but it sounds like an old cretan video.
---
Not sure if this is the specific one but here is a link to his more popular video
---
https://youtu.be/dvxVQp2-qCk
---
As a healer I have a macro set up for that. 
---
/yell WAIT!!! Oom, need to drink!
---
Enchants go in the "do not trade" box. There is very little potential for scamming in WoW.
---
Funny how this bashing towards retail players already started before the game was even launched.
---
I quit WoW long ago, soon after the release of Mist, and I'm coming back now for Classic, but I find childish how I see some people labeling themselves as "I'm good because I played or will play classic" while others are "retail babies".
---
I don't know, but when you have the urge to insult someone because they play a different game (and yes, Classic and Retail are different games), I think the real baby is you.
---
Quick, burn it before Blizzard sees it.
---
"albinosmurfs" added to the I told you so list.
---
Where can we find te rest of them ?
---
This kind of information is very specific to your monitor and graphics cards.
---
I think your best bet is to look up your specific monitor for some advice.
---
Most graphics cards made in the last 2 year's also come with software that will help optimise your game for the best balance between graphics and performance. It may also be worth while having a look around for some in game config settings to adjust weather intensity and in game glow and the like. :) good luck.
---
It's rude to suggest that people aren't paying attention when they get scammed. Some people trust people more than others. But again, that's just my *feelings* and I don't expect you to give a shit either.
---
I'm so looking forward to jumping around between the bank and the AH!
---
DPS warriors don't use tier pieces. Maybe half of tier 1. But once a fury war is geared from BWL that's when the needle swings in their favor and become the best single target dps. Warriors scale crazy like.
---
&gt;just dig deeper into the mountain
---
Careful, this is how you unleash the Balrog.
---
I said this right as I read "she don't want to wait me."
---
Sorry OP as I know english is probably your second or third language. I wish I could speak any other language that well.
---
Yep it is a good idea to keep it small. That being said, like the title of the post. Every Server will have a long ass queue. There will be no medium or low servers. Once the inactives resub to play we are going to easily double the amount of accounts.
---
String cheese or babel cheeses, pistachios, apple and peanut butter, celery and ranch or cream cheese, dark chocolate, hummus and wheat chips
---
Or on the less healthy side flavor blasted goldfish, white cheddar cheezits, and spicy nacho doritos. Oh club crackers or ritz and codswald cheese soo good
---
Any chance i could get the link dm'd?
---
On the French side we have Sulfuron vs Auberdine. Guess which one is full.
---
I agree, it's easily reasonable within the 41-42 range. I was just saying that by 45 you are expected to have the money and have the mount.
---
It’s not rude to suggest being vigilant when making a purchase. If that offends you, then you must have really thin skin, as evidenced by your initial reply. 
---
Good day, sir.
---
Depends on how much involvement we're talking about I guess. Since Blizzard is ultimately the one who decides it isn't *too* bad but people that have nothing to lose generally act on bias. As said, who is to say that a name isn't RP if there's a specific reason the name was chosen? At the point of reporting it you're doing it 100% out of your own opinion.
---
There's obviously bad names that can't really be explained and then there's the ones that tread a narrow line and that's more along the lines of the ones I'm talking about.
---
But I generally disagree that a governing body should take direct control over a situation unless in this case they're directly interrupting someone's gameplay (such as people who disrupt RP with mounts and toys). If a community don't want to RP with people that have bad names, then it should be resolved with community means, such as ignoring. And if those players then decide to push it and grief, then they can be reported.
---
-------------------------------
---
Have nothing against RP servers and I'm glad there's the option for those who want it. But as a general rule of thumb I don't like the idea of leaving decisions that have actual implications for your account in the hands of other players.
---
You missed the ratio of growth dawg. Try math ever?
---
I’m sure they’re saving those numbers to WoW us at BlizzCon.
---
Well, we could play around with a delay or a countdown of some sort 🙂
---
oh. Yea I am Ok with that
---
Could i get the link dm'd?
---
So what is the American EST non-PVP server?
---
I know the Brazilians have already decided to go to one of them, right?
---
Tauren was my first and will always be my favorite race.  I'm counting the days til I can go back to my female tauren hunter, running around with a boar pet and fishing at TB.
---
Why must you speak such fake news.
---
Play what xou want 
---
If in a guild there are enough sapper charges anyways.
---
And at least 1 enchanter is needed anyways in a guild
---
Anyone get the link?
---
And then you find out its a shitty remix, badly recorded, or just straight up a virus
---
By the time it wears off you can just taunt again. Two taunt resists in a row is very unlikely. You can do it. I actually DID IT in 2006.

---
My guild rerolled to Blaumeux.  I dont wanna sit in 8 hour queues
---
Am I misreading this comment or are you suggesting that Classic has a cataclysm?
---
10 days for 1.5 levels vs 30-45 days for the same. Memory is off on it but it’s much longer.
---
good luck getting to 60 without a mouse and keyboard lol
---
That's just, not healthy. Get rest, and enjoy the game rested, lol.
---
Zalgradis?
---
That’s a massive stretch there buckaroo
---
Not nearly enough edge. [You need the classic PvP song.](https://youtu.be/atY7ymXAcRQ)
---
You know how in live, when you loot a rare item im a dungeon or raid how the game lets you trade it away with 12-24 hours(I forget the exact time)?
---
That wasn't in classic, ita a minor change meant to cut down om GM time for incorrect loot 
---
Tickets. It's minor though, just a slippery slope.
---
No changes

Don't forget to mow your lawn big boy.

It does both - it can communicate to other users of the add-on behind the scenes.

Your reason for making this post is pretty sad. I’m all for expressing your opinion, but you’re coming off as a douche. What’s your end game? So the game blows up and remains on top for a long time... are you just gonna inject yourself into conversations and link people to this thread to show how smart you are?
---
Or maybe if it stays popular it’s so you can look back and pat yourself on the back knowing know matter how dumb you may feel, you were right about this so you must be smart?
---
There’s really no good reasoning here. You should have stopped at your opinion, and kept the douchey part to yourself.
---
Then if you’re wrong, you just pretend this post never happened and it’s the internet so you’ll never be accountable. So brave!
---
Right or wrong, you’re still a douche.
---
I know you commented elsewhere that you're probably going Night Elf, but if you change your mind and end up going Human, i would recommend that you go to her leveling zone and not the other way around (for the first 10 levels). This just so that she can get important spells like Moonfire and Rejuvenation (level 4), Thorns (level 6) and Entangling Roots (level 8). I recommend this because I'm going to Durotar at level 4 (as a druid) and it's a shitty experience to not have my skill upgrades for 6 levels (I do it for Orgrimmar rep).
---
At level 10 just make sure she does the class quest for bear form where she'll get Teleport: Moonglade and of course Bear Form. After that you guys can level wherever you want, all she has to do is set Hearthstone where you're leveling, Teleport to Moonglade to learn the spells (It doesn't HAVE to be every 2 levels) and then Hearthstone back to the leveling zone.
---
True to an degree...locks will start catching up Phase 4 when ZG hits and will shine Phase 5-6. Locks do a lot more than just compete on DPS meters though so Phases 1-3/4 they're still important just not as OP as Phase 5-6.
---
I personally will be doing what I did during Vanilla.....rolling a Priest main through AQ and having a Lock alt/2nd main for Naxx.
---
Its not always about being fast it's about being efficient, most people miss a lot of quests and quest rewards while leveling their first time
---
Have a parent or significant other to cook you healthy, well-rounded meals and just drink water when you feel like snacking.
---
Depends on wether your making up lies and BS to impress people. If that’s the case then I guess not.
---
I am pretty sure no matter what they do we will have situation where people spend a long time in queue and then a long time doing first quests. Starting from level 1 won't be like people remember it to be with some people hanging around and trying to steal your cactus apples. It will be more like TBC or WotLK launch where there is just chaos at starting zones everyone fighting about quest mobs and items.
---
Mankirk and pagel
---
&gt;that you go to her leveling zone and not the other way around (for the first 10 levels). This just so that she can get important spells like Moonfire and Rejuvenation (level 4), Thorns (level 6) and Entangling Roots (level 8).

---
Wonderful advice, thank you, leaves me another option :)
---
I Scammed someone on a test server once.  It was pretty fucking funny.  I told him I could make an arcanite reaper, and then logged off.  Wasn't even a blacksmith, lol.
---
I genuinely laughed so that my GF asked me what's up.
---
I laughed

Just enjoy it, it's really about the journey here, and it's not super rare like the legendaries were just close!

You could get millions of people to download a free app that makes farting noises. This isn't even apples to oranges. Its apples to llamas.
---
3 or 4 weeks is pretty damn quick. I think I read the average private server play time to 60 was like 8 days. Even at 4 weeks that's 7 hours a day.

This looks like my normal Spotify Mix plus some ... I’m musically stuck in the 90’s

Ungoro is actually the best example of this phenom.

Almost every single quest and chain in that zone is able to be picked up and completed at the same time.

Yea is he coming back?

How will it be the “true” capital again? Aren't there auction houses in all capital cities now? So most likely stormwind.

I remember watching his stuff, but he usually had more pop/punk rock for his videos.  I had a bunch of his old videos downloaded and saved to an old hard drive I found, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't him.  I also watched a ton of Jamaz, but I don't think it was him either...

In this thread; Boomers unite
---
The reason is to challenge peoples thinking. So often we have a mob mentality and whatever is popular is not questioned. It's important to speak out.
---
But yeah I can see how a mind like yours would miss that point.
---
What if I told you your ping won't be dramatically different on dial up compared to fibre, all that really matters is your proximity and the route to the server.
---
this is the comment ive been looking for, good snackage ideas :D
---
To add on to this, as I (apparently rudely) suggested, the vast majority of scamming in WoW relies on the Mark not paying attention to pricing, the amount of zeroes in a number, or, as you’ve stated, where certain items go in the trade window.
---
Vigilance is important. Double check everything and you’ll probably never get scammed.

They are trying to push other spanitards away from Shazz.

Can’t wait to farm Rivendares Deathcharger

That's excellent news, thanks for confirming that.  I plan on going in solo and making all those friends on the inside.  Expecting some queues anyway but hopefully they can start getting it under control by day 2.
---
On PvE servers everyone is in their bubblewrap. You have to automatically turn on your pvp flag everywhere (via /pvp iirc).  
---
Once you do that you're at a disadvantage, as the opposing affection is guaranteed to get the first hit because their pvp flag won't be turned on unless they attack you. Therefore you're safe everywhere.  
---
On PvP servers your pvp flag will be turned on automatically. There is no option to turn it off tho.  
---
On PvE servers you'll be missing out on the thrill this beautiful game offers. On the other hand it might save you some nerves or even your sanity at some times.
---
Not really worth it until you've leveled a bit. It caps at 1.5 levels and that is nothing for the first few.
---
Alliance is listening to Coldplay
---
No your body can only leave one skeleton. Which means skeletons can't pile up anymore. As far as it being a big deal I would say it is. To me if you consider world pvp as a class. They just lost one of their coolest spell animations.
---
There was a special feeling you would reach a zone and see a blanket of skeletons. Them tingles on the back of your neck because you know shits about to go down. Or the feeling of satisfaction after you have a big ass brawl in the world with another faction and the ground is suddenly white. Nothing was cooler then the white sand beaches at nessingways camp lol.

But I've still played WoW before and got a fairly detailed checklist of what I need to do. Do despite some diversions to level my fishing/cooking/first aid, I'm probably still going to be faster than a few people.
---
Is there any example of a game that has had 2 year growth like classic? Where's your example bro. Oh yeah it doesn't exist.
---
You get it!
---
&gt; I don’t agree with disciplining scamming 
---
Typical alliance. No moral compass at all.
---
You gata take this down dude, even 5mg of melatonin can cause seizures in younger kids,  don’t fucking tell people to take drugs if you are not a doctor.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
I’ve never seen one of these mice that wasn’t vaguely yellow
---
My biggest regret about switching to horde is Ironforge. God I'm going to miss that place.
---
100% this
---
Er, well don't follow my channel. Or if by some creepy coincidence you already are, please don't stop.
---
You can't? I played retail.and beta together sometimes
---
I had some friends I played with back in the day. 3 roommates with different schedules. One of them was always on their warrior. Always. Practically never logged out. You could do that it worked super well for them
---
Mike looks exactly like that too before I changed mouse
---
Open Your Eyes was great
---
https://youtu.be/Yry2X-oObds
---
Man, you’re practically Charles Ponzi.
---
Use, reduce, recycle. It's the proper thing to do.
---
I feel like I'm going through a loop.
---
I started up DAoC again a couple months back (still playing) and decided to check GW1 again for nostalgia's sake and now I'm going to be playing classic WoW soon.
---
This is the exact same game path that I took... minus the City of Heroes.
---
I think 8 hours is (hopefully) unrealistic with the modern technology but 4 hours on like Herod or faerlina is probably gonna happen, at least for a few days
---
This as well as the Intelli 3.0 were legendary CS mice. I used mine for years until I finally made the switch to Zowie.
---
In JABs moronic statement, he was basically saying: “you think you want to play it again, but remember how tedious everything was?”. So it can’t get proven wrong until a good amount of people stick through the “tedium” he described. I think they will.  I want Classic subs to surpass retail, but I concede that’s pretty optimistic. 
---
The flooding of interest now shows high initial interest, but the sustained interest is really going to be interesting to see.
---
I see a large amount of pserver players constantly chasing F R E S H servers and I wonder how long they’ll stick around. 
---
We all figure there will be those retailers who show up for the novelty but will quickly leave once they realize the time investment to reward ratio in Classic. These “tourists” will probably be the first to fall out. 
---
But there’s gotta be a sliver of the population who, like me, just wants Vanilla again, because it was the best version of the game. Might be interested in Classic+ at some point, but doesn’t need it, doesn’t need TBC or Wrath. Here for the long haul. Just have no idea what percentage of the population that will be. At least one!
---
That as well :D
---
Im usually traveling light, so not much space for laptop coolers. Ill make my best to make use of the hotel fridge to cool the laptop :D
---
Right!?? The backlash feels so silly and forced! Like, honestly, the new way of doing skeletons makes way more sense, and they're crying over it
---
I miss the simplicity of weapons. Most weapons looking very simple made the epics look badass. Now you typically get an at least blue quality anime sword during the first few quests of each expansion.
---
34 day account. Here’s some Vanilla nostalgia...
---
https://i.gifer.com/2tNl.gif
---
Before WoWs in-game browser became sufficient external sites were the norm, even now they're used as "skill checks" for most hard to PuG content.
---
Openraid, etc were massive before they stopped serving their purpose and in classic they have that purpose again so I find it hard pressed to believe they won't make a comeback.
---
Lol you can challenge people’s thinking without being a douche. Well, at least most non douchey people can.
---
Anyways, a small mind like mine wouldn’t understand anything else you may have to say, so I’ll leave you to keep challenging the worlds thoughts like the great philosodouche you are.
---
Keep on douchin douchebag!
---
On pve servers your pvp flag is always off no matter where in the world you are.
---
Lol
---
Sounds reasonable. Where are the complaints coming from?
---
There was a previous survey that didn't include it either. People pointed it out.
---
With the next one not having it either makes it seem like he actually can't understand the reason for it which is crazy to me.
---
It's ok if you have poor reading comprehension. I didn't really expect more from you.
---
Not this time around but damn this picture is beautiful, my first ever character was a tauren and seeing this takes me all the way back to 2005.
---
I managed to get Gus yesterday. Not everything is taken already.
---
Why would I not? Both are high fantasy (well, not sure what WoW is anymore, but lore up until vanilla WoW is fantastic).
---
I never said it was as good ;)
---
TH4NK Y0U
---
This... is not remotely accurate.
---
hunters have a couple of really good synergies with engineering   
---
You can craft guns and ammo and if your dungeon group is going wipe you can survive with feign death and resurrect the healer is Goblin jumper cables.
---
Yeah, i was exaggerating a bit but hopefully they can all play day 1
---
100%. 
---
10.000 days, and Aenima, the whole Watershed album, and toss in some Ashes of the Wake. That’s undead rogue levelling tunes right there.
---
[seems relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfYJsQAhl0)
---
Alright that sounds perfectly reasonable
---
As an ex frostmane in vanilla.. your guild was annoying as fuck to be on the same server with because the couple times we even tried to get to green dragons or the other world bosses either VC or whatever that top horde guild was would always be there first, literally impossible to get nature res gear.
---
This man fucking snacks
---
That looks more like the face I would make realizing that 100% of US PvP servers are horde majority.
---
Wow a brand new game has higher growth than one with an existing playerbase?  I guess the game with 10 users that grows to 10000 is way more successful than wow LOL.  At this point its clear you're either trolling or well.... have a nice day.  See you again if I remember to mock you
---
there are less skeletons. i want more skeletons.
---
That sounds better than how it was. Why are people complaining?
---
Yeah I bet half the people complaining are just trying to feed the troll fire because this is a nothing issue
---
Then meal prep food this weekend!
---
Or just use Zygors guide. 10 times better than this.
---
You are actually the douche and lack intelligence. Have a nice day douche
---
You are describing LFD, not LFG. This add-on mimics retail's LFG UI. You do not need to whisper the group leader. You just sign up, and the leader can pick players who have signed up to invite. The only difference is that the blizzard UI allows cross realm grouping.
---
The problems with this system are not immediately obvious, but over time has lead to an extreme marginalisation of certain groups. Currently, groups will only accept resto druids as healers most of the time. If you are a holy preist, you are basically locked out of doing M+ in a reasonable timeframe. Because this functionality of the UI has strangled off the less efficient alternatives, it makes this situation impossible to escape.
---
Can we get a non-sewage server name option for West Coast PvP? Not moving from WhitemAne to BlowMe. You want people to move? Make a decent server name... Ashbringer, Mograine, Ragnaros...
---
I honestly think we'll see an even lower success rate of full clears of that stuff just based on the fact that the most hardcore of 12-13 years ago have far less free time to play, and those who never played haven't experienced this kind of grind in their lifetime. lol
---
Like a girlfriend :)
---
Make it 0.01% drop chance and once it has dropped to one player it is removed from loot table.
---
Then how is he keeping the pacifier in?
---
&gt;But yeah I can see how a mind like yours would miss that point.
---
aaannd we've reached full on r/iamverysmart tier.
---
More than one mouse = mice
---
I'm not even sure I understand the OP.
---
I personally don't think the playerbase will drop over 50% if at all. Remember when WoW came out it grew and grew and grew and kept pulling in new people. There's a reason for that. And this is the same game practically. I couldn't believe the 'normal' people that played WoW back in the day. Redneck farmer kids I went to high school with played Vanilla. People are worried that this new generation of gamers (or just post-cata retailers) wont like it but if some random ass farmer kids or people like Henry Cavill can get addicted to it, why can't the under 25 crowd in 2019?
---
&gt; That being said, Attack speed normalization happened sometime after 1.12. I believe Wrath or Cata. Broken Tooth will have a 1.0 attack speed in classic.
---
It was in TBC, patch 2.0.3 to be precise: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.3_(undocumented_changes)
---
Yet another reason why TBC is shit. Shit!!
---
This is a Retribution Paladin
---
Do you think Classic will have fewer players than Nost? XD
---
I only see Shaman and Warrior in your link but I know you've done more o.O
---
Says the person insulting others because they don't share your opinion.
---
My favorite bracket to twink was always 60-60
---
Sure, it's a bit harder to get gear in that bracket, but that is part of the fun.
---
Class quests, man. Can’t wait for those again.
---
yo guyz i jus soloed this dungeon on live wit mah demon hunter and it gonna be ez on classic day2 done.
---
IIRC, Kharazan was planned for Vanilla, as was the Emerald Dream. Perhaps they could lead with one of those?
---
They'd have to keep some servers completely Vanilla though.
---
What Stormwind? It's clearly Boralus now.
---
Can you reduce gnome head size by 26%
---
Just lock the servers?
---
As a warlock. I would find it both humorous and irritating if sometimes my summoning ritual would fail and kill my target party member due to an accidental dismemberment.
---
I can't wait to quest in that awful troll complex in the hinterlands and spam lights and sound by yellowcard again
---
Literally this. The linked thread says that the number of players trying to connect *may be more than can fit into the queue system.*
---
There won't be a queue queue, there will be a message that says the queue is currently full, try again later.
---
I don't think people understand this. Get off Herod if you want to even play this game.
---
So you need rewards to engage in content? WoW is based around ganking alliance scum, end of story.
---
I can't wait to go foraging for rats on the train tracks again. It's gonna make me so nostalgic for my childhood.
---
Just in WoW, of course. Mostly.
---
My list is empty.
---
I remove ppl who havent logged in over a month
---
For leveling just go Shadow and be smart with your spare points. You’ll have no problem healing all the way up to basically BRS.
---
Yes questing as Holy (or Disc imo) really does suck so prepare to do a lot of dungeoning and gathering before you respec.
---
Ion was behind some of the best raid encounters in wow though...
---
As a designer actually working on stuff, he was great. As a lead game designer he's awful.
---
I guess we'll find out. And I'll msg you with a link to this post when I'm right. "Flowerpower9000"
---
The quest reward wand? If so I'd check what level you can pick up the quest!
---
Because people like to complain. I mean, i dont if i get downvoted, but its the truth. People want something to yell about and the flavor they chose this 24 hours is this. A couple days ago it was layers, today its skeletons, in a couple days it will be login issues, a month from now it will be the game is too hard.
---
Ok, thank you! I must have played briefly on a PvP server and gotten confused.
---
Ok, that makes sense! Thank you!
---
I didn’t donate money but I have Twitch primed to him a few months as a thank you.  I’m not sure how I feel about this change of plans.  But, if the guys gotta make s living he’s gotta do what he’s gotta do.
---
Me too! I had a razer mouse of some sort and switched back to an OG mouse. It has a much better feel. You couldn’t put any weight on your fingers without clicking randomly
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Have some more gold. People like you say the things people like me can’t, for whatever reason.
---
I just wanna play and have some fun.
---
TBH they could do it. Already have the ability to add skills through item progression. You could do BC-CATA style expacs through ilvl, quest, and smart gearing alone.
---
I don't know if they'll do that....but it's an interesting thought.
---
Right and we got HK &amp; DKs at the same time. 
---
THAT'S IT!!  Wow!  That opening scene he's got Lawbringer, but it was the tauren with the Quel'Serrar.  This video is giving me the most hardcore nostalgia feeling of all time.  Thank you so much!  I know it's ridiculous, but this meant a lot to me!
---
Upping their consumable game is why they require it in the first place, there's nothing more powerful to a raid team than 20-30 people rocking charges.
---
Well, fine, but I think people are going to struggle with believing this now that this alternate scenario has been proposed. Log in and do a video of '/played' and maybe that will give us more information / grounds? You should have at least tens of hours logged.
---
The coincidence extends beyond the name, it's the name-race-class tripartite that has us gaping.
---
Yet you came here to insult me. If you wanna spit fire expect it back bro. You can't be an ass and then acuse others of being an ass to make a point. You do it and embrace it or you are just dumb.
---
That bug seems to be happening for some people, last thread some said it was something to do with mobile? ill try completely remaking the imgur album next time, see if it fixes it.
---
I think people also are too hooked on this concept of "dying servers"  - Since when has Medium ever meant "risk of dying?" I played on Medium servers for a lot of WoW and it was never really a problem. I feel like Medium is the sweet spot, not high.

Seems it'll be Horde favored like the rest yeah.
---
This is very solid advise. I did the same thing in college studying for finals. It works like a charm,
---
Mages are s tier in pvp
---
Haha, thought it might be you. Where are you gonna play in Classic?
---
Personally had over 7,000 DK’s on my rogue, was very sad when they disappeared
---
Arugal ftw, we dem oceanic boiz
---
Thats where i was born, seattle. I dont see it tbh but glad you do.
---
Will it though? maybe a lot of people don't know better. 
---
And I've always wondered why ? Why was this the capital.. is there really a reason? 
---
I did play vanilla and was in ironforge all the time. But I don't know why.
---
Sounds extremely reasonable
---
 WoW is the game to thank for me wanting to get into game dev in the first place. I have *miles* to go before making a proper game, but at least I can make props and environments now. That's a hell of a lot further than I was say, 5 weeks ago.
---
Because imagine the shit storm when anyone who didn't sub extra early suddenly doesn't get to play on the same server as their friends.
---
My Paladin.
---
Who will be healing...
---
It’s going to be interesting to say the least.
---
Holy crap your right! I never noticed they only had 4 fingers a hand :O
---
DKs were a change. Don't add in DK's. No changes.
---
inteli 3.0, when shit got real!
---
Both of you truly just don’t get it. It’s about slurs. It’s about being in a group with people who are constantly saying homophobic slurs. It’s common, it’s literally in every video game. I’m glad you group with adults who don’t do that, but I have in every game I have every played including WoW/private servers. It’s not a one time thing, it happens daily. It’s not about shouting IM GAY in trade chat, it’s about not being made to feel less than by some straight pride rally dude from Mississippi.
---
Great guide, your dot run videos in particular are excellent! Do you have any experience on leveling a warrior? Do you think a warrior should grind a bit more and try to be slightly overleveled compared to the suggested level on the guide?
---
Playing currently on a MacBook Pro. Damn does it get hot.
---
I name all of my WoW characters after song titles.  Most of my vanilla characters were named after Porcupine Tree songs, including my main in every xpac I've played.  Only 1 person in the history of the time I played WoW ever whispered to ask if that's where it was from.
---
Dont you guys have ManaPots/NDB/Runes?
---
Could try to remote into your home PC to queue yourself up. Using chrome remote desktop or sth, might even be able to pull it off from your phone if your job doesn't give you access to a pc. Just a thought.

Carnage, blood... umn nessing camp stv. Oh oh and running into elites without noticing it. Like the big dino's that roam ungoro, man! So many ways to die! &lt;3

I remember doing the paladin quest for the two handed mace for the very first time. It was such a good feeling getting that badass weapon, I felt so powerful lol.

Many of the versions out there have copyright strikes against the Beatles "Yesterday" intro, and have had it replaced by generic, free music. Others yet decided that the "Scatman" track was lame, and admitted to replacing it with what they thought was cool, entirely bastardizing history.  
---
This video is one that I believe is relatively intact, grainy footage and all.

Yep he's been back since around 2010

Fewer? Probably not. **Sixteen times** the player count? Fuck no.

No you are right.
---
I picture a big hulking orc hunched over with a little pencil in hand carefully bubbling in his answers, then finally on one question, he pokes the pencil thru the paper and gives a little orc grunt.

Needs more movement in the portal instance. Really good design!

You heard it hear first folks, u/EhhRicky decides what matters to everyone!

Be safe tho

If blizzard decides to shoot themselves in the foot and put a critical wound in the game by adding DKs, double that up to 14,000 in protest.
---
Have you tried the Logitech g600?  I also have man hands and it's been my favorite mouse by far.  Plus it has all those buttons for delicious macros.
---
We had dks in 1.12, classic is a recreation of 1.12, no changes
---
I could remote in, I might just wait though. I have the rest of the week off so i'm not in *that* much of a rush.
---
You'll be banned if you write the N word and other extremely offensive slur. It's not possible to name yourself to the most offensive names and the others will get a name change. So no they don't have to stop those two things

Wait, there are Shadow Priests that don't spec into imp mana burn!? How!? What else do you need the points for!?
---
Hell yea.
---
Yea, I'm EST and working Monday. Plan is to sleep after work and get up around 1 or 2 to play. Hopefully the more casual crowd will have headed out.
---
Oh my gosh!!! Thank you!!
---
only when I wear underwear.
---
I'm talking about the guilds that don't even check for flasks yet demand players at peak performance do everything.
---
&gt; Which means anything under High or Full will be a dead server.
---
Rather, it means High and Full realms could have severe queues when layering is removed. Layering is definitely going to be removed before Phase 2, and since all realms will go to Phase 2 at the same time, it's not going to stay on for any significant amount of time on any particular realms.
---
Have you made, or do you know of, one of these that is for a MM build? Love the look of the cheat sheets that you’ve made all the same, great work!
---
Titan lore pretty much ended with Legion, unless if there's some massive ret-con coming up, which I wouldn't put it pass them.
---
I finally retired mine a couple years ago.  It still worked fine mechanically, but I couldn't find any win10 compatible software for it so I couldn't reprogram any of the buttons.  That thing was so awesome for WoW though.  I might have to break it back out.
---
Dad here too.. would be great to join ya
---
They decided to take out corpse skeletons in fear that people would write naughty messages with them...
---
It was a pretty ridiculous decision to most people, especially considering there are a few ways to combat people doing what they fear.
---
can cross that cloak enchant off, needs 3 nexus crystals which means 3 epics need to be DE'd for it, not only that but it requires rep with cenarion hold that won't be in initially
---
Not really into art, are you? This is an incredible piece. The MS Paint looks are absolutely intentional and capture the simplicity and innocence the artist felt 15 years ago. Notice how it’s the Undead starting area? Starting to draw some lines?
---
No lighting or shadows? Again, capturing the simplicity of the time. 
---
The jagged edges bring a clear sense of frustration the artist captured in early leveling. Confusion clearly by the vast, unexplored world and swelling emotions of the experience.
---
This is the piece of our generation. I’m sure a philistine like yourself would haves referred to Van Gogh’s work similarly in his time.
---
Upvote the hell outta this and hopefully Blizzard can see it.
---
Stop hand-holding and catering to the weak and easily offended to the detriment of others.
---
Let them choose it, like the profanity filter, exactly.
---
This is such a clean meme.
---
I would also be 100% ready to main lock if it werent for shadow bolt spam
---
REP it. my fam
---
Are there no skeletons because of layering?
---
Glad I could help, enjoy :)
---
Is that budget RDJ?
---
I've been banned from the Blizz forums since ICC.
---
I thought it had somthing to do with them being unable to link instances on diffirent continents like they would of needed to.
---
Can somebody explain why?
---
I can't wait to be a multi-colored undead corpse running around with that silly leveling gear
---
APC was my go to for our ventrilo group in Shadowbane, but wow was mostly in game music for a long time. Right as I got tired of some zone music I'd be leveling in a new zone. In PvP it was mostly laughing with friends while ganking people or autistic screeching in when we were getting ganked.
---
We were that group of rogues in AV that would either back cap or forward cap constantly.
---
Bob Ross would be proud, look at those little happy trees
---
I think you perhaps too readily use green for good. If you were to add them all up from all classes I think over half of your ratings are green. Appreciate the effort tho ☺️
---
I didn’t take 6 days off work for nothing. I’m leveling as high as I can within those 6 days. 16+ hour days I anticipate.
---
But everyone knows that the female night elf is probably a guy, but a female dwarf, more likely to be a woman.
---
.......I'll allow it.
---
Thank you
---
I got a hyacinth macaw drop from a troll in STV, absolutely princely sum was gained that day
---
Maybe they can release these expansions as separate servers where you can copy your Classic character to (once per character). That way you'll always have Classic to go back to.
---
Lame
---
&gt;They should do a lvl squish and make all other expansions nearly obsolete.
---
Theyre already halfway there when releasing a new expansion. Legion stuff is just as useless as Burning Crusade stuff
---
I always die like a million times on the run. The straight run wouldn't be bad

Mental note, don't be a hunter or warlock.

That's why I always made Night Elves. I didn't have to grind the Darnassus rep

I was new to WoW. Maybe level 10. I was a human, and took the Deeprun Tram to Ironforge and was going to fly back. I talked to the flight master and selected Stormwind. This was my first time talking to a dwarf, and my first time using a flight path.

Most my friends haven't subbed yet. 1 sub saves 3 names so you don't need to have everyone sub early

If we can hand pick what are changes and what aren't, then I can see that argument being logical.

For me rushing to level to 60 won't be a thing. Just wanna enjoy leveling and have fun. You don't need to be 60 in 5 days played to have fun in this amazing game as stated in the other comments before me.

Yeah, good 'ol times - but even though IF was the main hub, Stormwind was still busy, and so was Darnassus even (although less then SW) now they are just graveyards, SW only because the portal room is there so people just pop out to the AH as well.
---
Azeroth's gonna be born into a beautiful strong independent female titan before WoW is over.

Just learned about this! Definitely going to do this next time. I guess I could always have someone summon me to Deadmines too

Actually, mount collecting was one of my favorite past times in WoW when I played (around cata), because it was fun to be able to ride all of these different creatures, and you got a mount for every milestone when you collected them. That being said, the cool factor completely dissapears when everyone including a level 20 is able to ride Netherwing Drakes
---
lol this is me too just try not to log on to change it and say fuck it because at the end of the day youll be happy with any of the options you picked.
---
Was also thinking about Denmark. Astralis just had the most dominating era ever in CS:GO history. And so many danish players currently on top teams in League. (Capz, Broxah, Jensen, Bjergsen etc.)

Hes super good numbers wise, but that doesnt translate into lead developer.  I'm honestly surprised he was chosen as lead over Kaplan or Chilton.

Heck yes. See you and your (lack of) skeletons there!

I'm gonna wait, servers will be so loaded the first week I feel like I'd be wasting the week of time. I know I wont get a name I want on existing servers and I'd really like to see faction balances before I roll x faction on an opposite faction dominated server :l I know it's a bleak outlook on it, but I feel like its moderately realistic.

Really seems like a non-issue, like lots of stuff that is whined about here.

While raiding? priest, hunter, mage. 
---
On a side note, which fingers is the dull pain/numbness in? I suffered from RSI for 3-4 years prior to becoming a software engineer and have more or less solved it. 
---
Regardless I would strongly recommend reading the book 'The Mind Body Prescription' by John E. Sarno. After struggling for years  with pain and numbness I read that book and within literally hours I could feel a significant difference. A month or two later my symptoms have greatly subsided. I'm on a PC 16 hours a day now between 8.5hour/day workdays programming and gaming the rest.
---
Yeah, no, the buyout was start of WotLK, that's why soooooo many homogenization changes and severely dumbing the game down happened then.
---
Too late to reroll now
---
Can you also give Affliction neutral rating (for pvp)? You never go full Affliction. Shadow Mastery at most.
---
Also, technically all specs are must have the same rating in raiding since all raiding specs are hybrid/mixed specs.
---
Yeah all abilities is the way to go, you can always make more gold and abilities can’t be that expensive in the long run
---
I'm main'ing mage when playing alone, for the farming and decent defense in world PvP that frost grants. The AoE farming should allow me to fund the next character well, but when my friend I've known since 7th grade is on with his warrior main, I'm going to log off of the mage and play resto shaman to support him. Eventually, I'd like a mage (dps), shaman (healer), and warrior (tank), so I can fill all three roles.
---
I know it's unpopular to like anything from retail WoW here, but yeah, transmog is probably one of the best things in modern WoW. The incredible amount of customization of your appearance was really damn nice.

Back in vanilla, your pet kept certain stats.  This one had the fastest attack speed of any pet in the game.

This sound - leveling as a priest - always have men hardpress the "R" button (shield)
---
In the stress test I was slightly ashamed to get so excited over a world drop chestpiece with +2 int and +2 spirit.
---
I also crafted myself a belt with no stats except armour and some 6 slot bags and I felt a real sense of achievement.  I can't remember the last time in retail that I actually used any crafted gear.
---
We would MC opposing players out of the WSG exit gate mid-game until it was banned.

There was always a delay even in vanilla. I remember it clearly.

classic is Vanilla WoW, before any of the expansions.
---
It bugs me that they named a server Blaumeux before making a Feugen server. Like you already have Stalagg smh. A lot of people are ripping on the Blaumeux name because very few people in NA would even know how to pronounce it properly. Just a straight up bad choice imo, Feugen was a gimme.
---
I'm just happy that there won't be Heirloom gear. It removes any bar of equality and destroys the leveling experience. Nothing is more fun than getting ganked by an unkillable enemy in gear that's well above it's rational power level. It's one reason I never returned to WoW retail. It took the MMO experience away for me personally and took away my ability to feel like I'm part of a big vast world. Glad all the check list task will be gone too. I'm looking forward for adventure!!!! 
---
Only thing I wished they added was the barber shop and Draenei and Blood Elves. I know that stuff was added in Wrath and BC respectively, but I don't see it hurting the Classic experience. Though the racial could shake up the formula, and the Draenei need to be given something else to replace the Jewel crafting racial buff, but I'm not against WoW classic getting expanded on and taking a new path from retail. I'd love to see some of that scrapped content like Vaults of Storm wind get released.
---
&gt; He just didn't make the route
---
So that thing that takes up 90% of any guide?
---
Sure, I wont deny that. But there have been a plethora of other suggested fixes that would be easier to implement and solve the problem on all fronts.
---
Things like slight randomization of body position or rotation
---
Thanks so much!
---
Ahahaha just perfect (:
---
&gt;they shoulda made stormwind even MORE destroyed... ... and deathwing claims it as his lair, having it be like a "trophy" claimed by him.
---
I wish they'd have done something similar with Orgrimmar too. Moved the capital elsewhere for a bit
---
Yeah, dead on. Guilds who could field a 40 man raid were the exception. As much as I enjoy the haphazard glory of having been part of the right thing at the right time, the humbler side of me thinks it's a good development that more WoW players got to complete the raid content in later versions of the game. When Blizzard started introducing multiple difficulty tiers so that top guilds were challenges and given the opportunity to excel, that was a positive development. I really liked WotLK and Cataclysm -- especially the latter for the simple fact of Deathwing being our server's namesake! :)
---
Its a false equivalence because you are saying that a single person whose changed his mind about work hes put 1000s of hours of his spare time into is the same thing as a very large multinational megacorporation changing its tune with 5 days notice which is completely unprecedented and might be illegal under some countries trading standard laws as false advertising.
---
Not even remotely the same thing and u know it.
---
Me and 4 friends havent subbed yet and are waiting until next week
---
Well the game isn't even out yet. I'm sure once it's released everyone will be making the rest of their alts and the names will get taken quick

---
Damn. Nice 👌
---
It seems Blizzard is just pulling a marketing stunt at this point seeing as how badly they are handling the amount of servers and seemingly underestimating the hype. 
---
'WoW Classic needed to open five servers at launch because of the hype'' I'm not the only one who can see this headline coming up, free marketing. 
---
They said there will be queues for realms that are medium or higher, yet if you are a EU player u cant escape it right now. even the RP-PVP and RP realms are medium, there is nowhere to migrate too, and there are no more PVP or PVE servers either. 
---
But fuck it right, just open up a couple more servers last second, giving people no time to get all their guildies/friends time to switch around, and ditch the names they paid to reserve on other servers.
---
Back in the day what they would do is make like 20 trial accounts and mutlibox them all to a capital city. Then spell their stupid shit not in skeletons, but in corpses - just logout when you die and it would stay there. There are no more trial accounts I don’t think, so I don’t get what the issue supposedly is.
---
I tried to share a Tribute video i made, but downvote brigade hit it pretty quick. I  Tried man. &lt;3
---
I hope so. That was the whole point of classic to begin with. Not to go on to tbc or wrath. Not to get classic+. It was to play wow as closely as possible to the state it was in vanilla. If they ever do implement classic+ or add in xpacs, i will definitely be moving back to private servers, which is what the goal of classic is, to eliminate the need for private servers.
---
it was announced in May
---
You call that game breaking some people call a shit ton of vanilla specs being functionally useless game breaking.
---
Sub numbers climbed all through tbc.
---
still , being targeted by diapers adds , right when classic is about to be released.
---
I dont have kids
---
They should have added a grouping function into classic anyway. It’s not like there is summoning stones, cross server players or instant ports to dungeons. 
---
Something to make a group that means you didn’t have to be in the capital city wouldn’t have broken anything and as we see, there is just going to be add ons that do it anyway, may as well have had a genuine blizzard group finder.
---

Yep! I think I got that when the Naga failed, but I didn't like the main button shape/placement, too tall and thin overall. I replaced it days later with a Cyborg RAT9. Now *that* was a great mouse (flat pinky rest!!), but the batteries didn't last and eventually became unusable. Should've got the cabled version. A quick Google says the brand is back from the dead, kinda wish I had've known that earlier!

Of course it's subjective. Don't let it bother you.

---
The conditions in which Classic is launching are different than original vanilla.
---
First vanilla had an upfront box cost on top of the sub that Classic doesn't have, that alone may have worked as a filter. You hardly pay 60$ just to see what all the fuss is about a game because if you don't like it you'll waste that money.
---
15$ is much more affordable and if you don't like it you have the option of trying retail. All retail players can play Classic basically "for free".
---
There are also big streamers with hordes of mobs that follow them, they'll have a huge impact an launch and on dropping the realms population not much later when they'll move to the next big thing.
---

The problem is, that a subscription is inherently a slightly predatory model. Espeically, when the subscription is fully digital. It's easy to forget you have this subscription and continue to pay it for months or years, even when you aren't using it. Especially for something as obscure as a guide, which really never should be a subscription service in the first place.

I feel like worst part is people saying “I might play classic now” - if you want those heavy quality of life changes that what the hell even is classic? Just retail with a level cap and old quests.

Gonna be rolling Bluethex to avoid queues

He never asked, but to my coworkers who did I told them what's up. No need to be ashamed, just do you, man :)

---
Right on, was the alliance guild Trouble?  I was in Oni (clan) for most of vanilla and remember us hunting them down often.

The queue has to do with the authentication/login server, Not the game server it self

Honestly a lot of fights in vanilla are somewhat gear checks. Most raids also had a handful of people who were constantly lagging and most of the raid was playing with awful framerates as well. Some fights are still going to be roadblocks I think more than people might think, not because they are hard, but because you simply need gear to take them down, which takes time to accumulate. That being said more people use world buffs and consumables than back then so it might even out a bit more.
---
Oups.. I was listening to that the whole years long :S
---
I had this mouse also! It used to shock me after Everytime I got up from my computer. Good times raiding!

I've had the conversation with my wife too and shes totaly not into gaming at all t(he best i could ever do is to convince her  to play mario karts with me... ). And after i told her about classic and all she just replied: ok so how much is gonna cost us and how long will you not be present. Shes the best xD. Not that i have time to nolife it  with my work and family but i guess casually getting to lvl 60 after half or one year is cool too! I only started halfway in TBC back in the day and always wanted to expirience the leveling in classic

You will for sure meet people like that, but I believe that majority of the playerbase will be very friendly and helpful, people will buff each other on the road, helping and teaching new players in dungeon groups.

---
Why highest possible level quests? Quests give 100% exp down to -5 levels. Mobs give approximately -20% exp per each level lower but are easier/faster to kill.
---
Not every change after 1.0 was good for the game. I'm handpicking one of the single biggest mistakes in world of warcraft history to not be reimplemented into the game.
---

---
My friend and I were leveling on the beta. 
---
To start my story: You can't loot chests in combat in Classic.
---
So we come along a chest with only 1 mob next to it. We both didnt want to tag the mob otherwise the other player would take the chest, resulting in a 10 minute standoff.
---
which means:
---
1. every realm will have queues
---
2. people with a job (that cant justify vacation for a computer game since their wifes will kill them) cant play after they get home
---
Holy shit I can not thank you enough for pointing this out. &lt;3
---
Oh, Son of Arugal.  He wandered up and got me for the first time in like 2007 and TO THIS DAY I use his name to curse any situation that turns suddenly much more difficult than expected.

Grats, you backstab now crits for 400 rather than 350.
---
World first has been done in vanilla, not classic but yeah
---
Was about to ask same. I neeeeeed this.
---
Ahh gotcha! Thank you! FYI these are freaking awesome!
---
Think I’d rather do it manually to prevent weird angles if levelling up happens in front if a wall or in a tight space for example :)
---
They are moving, Firemaw is medium, which means there will be a queue timer and as Blizzard said even low population is bigger then the most populated Vanilla realms. And if they add at launch that will be way to late. No guild is going to move to another server the day of, no one is gonna tell their friends "hey bob i know u actually got in, but get out since i cant log in i'm going roll on the Ebonroc server!' 
---
The day off is way too late for friends/guilds to organize and actually inform everyone on time.
---
*NO CHANGES*
---
Let's boycot this addon. 
---
It is up to us - if we don't whant to use it, we will.
---
:p
---
But I will still mind control you (as a Priest) and run you through as many mobs as I can!
---
Here we go
---
there's one other unknown that could throw off these calculations a lot, and that's how many players have multiple accounts. just from the name trading alone, it seems to be a lot more than i originally expected.
---
I do think twin emps were one of the best encounters in vanilla.
---
No, as in besides the edgy kids who thought it was cool to throw racial and homophobic slurs the majority of the community didn't and I took it as apparently the WoW community over time got more intollerant of people to the point where people felt the need to roll on one server. I am lamenting the need for such a thing, not that I am inraged that ita happening.
---
Blizzard doesn't give a fuck about us, apparently.
---
Master!
---
G502
---
"MutedKiwi" added to the I told u so list. Also give it 6 months for the power of superior game mechanics to take hold. Or at least until halfway thought phase 2 so we can see if they had to split servers to remove layering.
---
Good thing you don't need full T3, just the shoulders, helmet, chest, and legs. If you wear a tabard, the chest is optional.

This list is missing the new servers FYI

My wife and I are both ostrovegan, and though 99.9% of what we eat is plant-based, that doesn't stop me from occasionally eating a box of vegan chocolate chip cookies, vegan Ben and Jerry's pints, a pizza from Mellow Mushroom, etc. It's entirely possible to be a vegan and still be a fatty by eating delicious snack foods, even if it is more difficult.   
---
Speaking of plant-based, I'm just going to down Huel between game sessions. I've been consuming the chocolate flavored one for months, now, and I like it. I blend the two scoops of it into almond milk, maybe add some powdered peanut butter, coconut oil, etc. into it, and I'm good for about four hours.
---
Mage is great solo. Also the boring pve rotation is made up for with exciting pvp. You're only in a raid environment for a few hours a week.
---
I had a 29 hunter twink with  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6315/steelarrow-crossbow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6315/steelarrow-crossbow) , this was before the attackspeed normalisation so aimedshot and multishot hit like trucks. Had darn good time in that bracket at the time.
---
I too liked Destruction in PvP.
---
I will admit I also used Soul Link in raiding for a good while because I was a PvPer. I placated my raid by filling my inventory with shards, summoning like a madman and handing out lots of healthstones.
---
I still felt a bit shameful.

Take a look at the meme. All of the High/Full servers change to medium and the Low/Medium servers don't change.

I feel like expecting enough players to A) hear about this post and B) react to it is naive on Blizzards part. It's weird that they actually allow people to continue rolling on a realm that is so crowded, the queue itself will be full at launch. They should probably have reacted a while back by locking character creation on Shazz and Golmagg.
---
Where is there to move? All servers are medium or higher on EU and as Blizzard said even low pop servers will still be bigger then the highest populated server in Vanilla. And we are also told that medium realms will have a queue timer. So there is nowhere to move, unless they want people to just go to the German realm that's low and make it a unofficial English speaking server

40 man raids, yes you can grab some pugs, but only if you have a solid base in place you can trust - like 15-20 people minimum. Pugs will be people that would need to apply for a spot, get trialed and only if ok, can have a "permanent" place as a non-guildy, so a pug but not a pug as today in retail.
---
I think the issue here is not that MC is so difficult, as the bosses/mechanics are not but the logistics around it are going to be a time-swallowing pain not just the organising/raidleading, but also the preparations in mats and stuff you'd need. And that gets underestimated.

Anyway this poll is useless without options for joining new servers in the future or only medium/high population at launch, switching servers if there are long queues, or if you're still waiting for launch day to sub.
---
Mage of lock for a boosted casual?
---
How stupid are you? The plan is to literally fill up the current servers before creating new ones.
---
correct

No one cares about EU servers.

Gehennas if you want higher pop, Firemaw if you want pop on the lower side compared to all others at the moment. Language-wise it doesn't really matter.

Hi. How talkative czech people in english generally? Looks like we will play together, I am hungarian. I am aware that czech people have their own server in retail and had their own private server as well.
---
Kinda cool tbh
---
Only takes 1 bomb. :P
---
This add-on is not in any way against the spirit of Vanilla. Add-ons like this have been possible all along and similar ones existed. It only supports you in finding people who are interested in joining your group. This has no negative effect on the social aspect of the game, it's fundamentally different from LFD - it's more like the looking for group system they had during TBC. 
---
None of the reasons why LFD destroyed the community apply here, and I say this as someone who views LFD as one of the biggest design failures in the history of WoW.
---
I got to the first boss In deadmines as a priest and very almost beat him
---
Are they? That's great! My eyes are old and mostly useless, looking for new ones. But I thought I read that they are removing persistent corpses, and that you will not have a battlefield full of skeletons after a big pvp battle.  Glad I was wrong about that though. I also was aware of a lot of changes Blizzard made to the Hearthstone cards as a result of not being able to market it in certain countries. Thank you for for your clarification in this matter sir.

Yeeee, fellow bartender hype!

Yes this. I feel like everyone whinged about getting classic wow and now we got it people are whinging about when will bc and wotlk drop / will this be included in classic.
---
I'm still pretty peeved there is battle masters and cross realm bgs but is what it is.
---
I'm gonna probably go alchemy I hope you're wrong cuz ima need dem blacksmith weapons and whatnot

If you think it's worth the money, buy it. If not, don't use it.

But all the people here trying to justify pirating/stealing/leaking the guide by making some kind of moral argument disguised as business advice can fuck right off.

Shazzrah 60/40 now lol

hmm i last played in wod, and it was on a ssd, i think the last time i was on a hdd was wrath and it was alright
---
That would not be classic then. For example you can check where you have lower chances to get ganked. It’s like a maphack.
---
I'm looking forward to running Deadmines a dozen times in a row and fighting the legit Van Cleef and getting gangbanged by pirates anda legion of mcaws.

yea but will also lower your mana if a caster/hunter

Deliberate gameplay sabotage = against ToS and absolutely forbidden behavior.
---
Ya, I don't really mind the launch chaos.  Or even sitting in a que that much.  I worry more about another D3 kind of mess that will drive players away.  Hopefully they have it in hand, they have been great so far with the re-building of the game...just iching for it to be a success more than anything.
---
It takes a shitloaf of effort to write with skeletons. 
---
It will be pretty much illegible, and whoever made the swastica will probably get banned or no one will see it except reddit (until it’s removed by a mod). 
---
People will still scream nonsensical hate in a variety of chats, so I sincerely believe the skeleton thing is a non issue for blizzard. 
---
Personally I’d love to see someone spell out Always Coca Cola or with skeletons.
---
Not when you compare any top sensors today, no.
---
I've been using a Mionix Castor for the last six months and it's been pretty solid. My personal favorite has to be the Logitech G203. It's a nice option if you're looking to spend less than 50 bucks. I used one for twoish years and it held up great, you just gotta keep up on cleaning the scroll wheel or the grooves will get all gunked up after awhile, as with any mouse with that type of scroll wheel. I've never been a fan of any of the MMO specific mice. I keep pressing buttons by accident, it's just really annoying for me.
---
Your insight is very American, and I accept it - for the American servers. Europe is completely different than the USA.
---
Here in Europe, we will use both English and our mothertongue ingame. We will join communities from **our country**, despite all being able to speak English. A proper analogy would be old US cities where each ethnic group had their own town within the same city; Italians would move to the Italian part of the town, the Chinese to the China Town, et cetera. And that's why it's important for Europeans to know the country of origin, so they can join their "own place".
---
Please, for version 4, do include "Country of Origin". Atleast for European servers.
---
Yes it's actually a very common trick for minmaxers.
---
I personally used it for farming black lotus on my troll mage, I had a set with -25 stamina, gave me a fat berserker.
---
Yes sir:)

---
Lol expect all the players that have friends or guildies here but didn't reserve a name yet to roll there at launch, the population will likely double.
---
Rank 14 Thunderfury riding a Black Qiraji Battle Tank. Or, more likely, in an insane asylum.
---
A lot of the people answering polls nowtend to min/maxers or the more serious players likely at launch you will get more casuals and that would likely broaden out the professions people choose. Or maybe i am wrong
---
They could just add a Tbc server option too I would pay extra for all tree versions
---
There is a game that has new features added onto the vanilla experience! Go ahead and play it, u even get to play it for free with a Classic WoW sub.
---
Ok, blizzard already ruined all macro and addons authentic experience, they ruined brm skeletons, layering, name reserve, they added Russian serves with godless Russian localization and cyrillic names. They messed up with itemization, talents, click retort, loot trading. 
---
All this changes are very very impacful for game experience. 
---
So don't use simple #nochanges hash tag, try to explain yours point please.
---
I hope so
---
If you Put in the effort anyways, are you going top Share your Playlist Name/Link? Would bei great
---
Holy cow I didn't realise it was that late into the game. I expected it to be like the first patch
---
I feel like I’m in the minority, but I’d be okay with quite a few QOL changes especially if it improves server stability.
---
I think people who are stubbornly against every single change are scared they won’t have as much fun with these changes as they did when they were younger, so they hold onto every single aspect of the game being the exact same, when in reality they won’t ever get that experience back because they’ve changed as people.
---
I think wow classic is going to be great and have a ton of great things to offer and hopefully shows the industry that games like wow classic still have appeal and don’t need to be these streamlined dumbed down games everyone seems to be pushing. However, that doesn’t mean things like improved graphics, tracking multiple gathering professions, reducing skeleton count for good reasons, or even layering when necessary should be ruled out.
---
Lol he mentions that in the post. But did you lnow he can skin beasts?

No, the one on the picture is one of the first optical intelli, the one you're refering to was IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0. Which was battling with MX510/518 about being the best mouse, and it was kind of just down to preferences.
---
And no, no one ever use that mouse today. They might use the modern version with 1000x higher DPI and better both hardware and software. But not the old Intelli. The old MX518 is still popular though, loved through the ages.

I click these every time just to make sure. Always disappointed though.
---
Combining paid service (name reserve) and only 2 servers at start wasn't such a  good idea.
---
Human's are boring and have garbage animations, go gnome!
---
Yeah, definitely. I spent hours doing nothing but battling Southshore Alliance in beta. My leveling and gearing was motivated primarily by the open world PvP. When launch happened there was a lot of heated conflict everywhere as people leveled, moreso than I've ever seen in an expansion. Unlike my experiences in latter day WoW, back then it seemed that everyone was primed for a fight and nobody expected different. If you saw red you knew some stuff was about to go down -- especially if it faded into thin air!

Our guild got server first 25m hm Lich King, and I won the roll for Invincible the 2nd week we cleared it.  It's hard to explain, but knowing that it shared the same model as the Celestial Steed took away so much of the prestige that Invincible should have had.  It's Arthas fucking Menethil's horse, a horse that has more backstory than probably any other mount in the game, and they couldn't even give it a unique model.  Not just that, but it was shared with a mount you could buy for real money.
---
I get why they'd do that from a business perspective, but from a player's perspective that really enjoyed Warcraft lore up to that point, it really cheapened the whole thing.
---
You're asking male or female, but why not shemale of some variety? #LGBTQ #SarcasmBecauseReasons

Why use something so pedestrian? Steam has a streaming app for your phone so if you grab a bluetooth keyboard and mouse you can play WoW from your phone anywhere you have good internet. I played all of the WoW stress tests at work like this.
---
Most raiders will go engineering, and I guess pvpers come to think of it. Guilds only need one good alchemist or enchanter or whatnot with top recipes.
---
So I reckon the actual useful for more than one person crafting professions; alch, bs, lw and ench, will balance out amongst the populace.
---
Skeletons  in STV are part of the artstyle at this point

where are you seeing this stats

The average raiding guilds, on private servers, were still struggling in BWL until ZG patch.

You most definitely don’t do even *close* to half the damage of a priest in an 1v1, due to how rage interacts (or rather, doesn’t) with interrupts. And when Shadow Priests are, between Inner Fire and Shadowform basically wearing plate, warriors get melted.

the server demographics sticky at the top of this subreddit
---
I grouped a lot in STV so it was too bad because of that but it wasn't easy still.
---
It wasn't till I came to this subreddit did I realise people were that stupid that a thing as simple as layering was a difficult concept.
---
They really should open more servers and should have had more servers from the beginning.
---
&gt; oh and one of the famous developers badly wanted naga in the game playable , in the end they decided it would look trash with their tail clipping through everything (but they were also running out of time and needed to cut stuff)

That was Metzen, I believe.

Yep this is why simply waiting until they get full isn’t a perfect strategy either.
---
No shit sherlock
---
&gt; Sub numbers climbed all through tbc.
---
The thing is that TBC was otherwise AWESOME. It was incredibly atmospheric. I mostly *loved* playing it, and I played it 16 hours a day. But organizing raids was a nightmare.
---
They DID nerf the trash in SSC, TK and Karazhan somewhat, and they did increase the respawn timer from 45 minutes to two hours.
---
But they only did that after ALL major raiding guild on my server had broken apart, and the 2 hour trash respawns were still idiotic. Another thing is that TBC had *extremely* rigid class requirements, particularly centered around warlocks. Warlocks were the only viable AoE class in TBC, and that meant that if you didn't have enough warlocks in your raid, then several progression encounters were IMPOSSIBLE. I was the GM of a hardcore raiding guild, and I had to organize this shit. The same applies for the long raid quest attunement chains for BT and MH. There were always some people on different parts of some attunement quest and had to go to SSC and/or TK and so we lacked the 25th person to go to BT or MH. Fucking retarded.
---
This is another headache that got removed - EVENTUALLY - but only after I had to deal with it for a year.
---
Having short trash respawns and warlocks as the ONLY AoE class add nothing to the game, and is only frustrating and stupid.
---
TBC could have been the best expansion, if not for this retarded shit.
---
I hope they won't repeat it.
---
i cant see the survey results? where are people seeing these results
---
Shazzrah it is

Which server do you plan to play on, or timezone if you aren’t decided?

I min/maxed then and kinda plan too  this time around as well. That being said, I always buff, heal, help lower players. Especially if they are Druids!
---
Damn I literally just did this today and I have most of those artists on mine too
---
The only thing I'd be ok with is better character model graphics. And only if it has a toggle. So everyone can play with models they want. So it only impacts my view.
---
I don't want any changes that impact game play.
---
The inflation in mounts in modern WoW really reduces the fun of it somehow. So many mounts and pets and toys. I think I have hundreds of each. At the end of the day, I ride two different mounts per character. Most of my mounts never see the light of day.
---
Which classes have good and nad rewards for rank11+ (compared to each other)?
---
What were mount prices in 1.12? 900g for epic?
---
I never grind stuff on a rogue for money.  I've done grinds for leather to use, but not just as a money maker.  Mostly I just PVPed on people.

You just changed the game here.. Can we have a vegan class too?!
---
It's cute how you think you're some sort of authority on warlock PvP because you got 80% into rank 10 15 years ago.
---
I employ Blizzard, yes.
---
Destruction is god tier in all kinds of PvP because you can one shot most classes with decent gear.
---
Everyone on the internet works for Blizzard yes. It is a wildly unprofitable venture for them.
---
Oh man your spell placement has 15 year old me screaming, all my spells were grouped by type so like it started off with all the melee then all the ranged then all the traps and so on till I had no more bar space.
---
Ganondwarf
---
&gt; Yeah but I'm not going to spend the original x amount of hours I did as in my youth because I'm a different person with different tastes and different responsibilities and priorities now.

There's way more people of the age you were when WoW came out with computers and internet access these days.
---
I leveled a shaman in vanilla. It’s easy AF to heal dungeons as enhancement spec. Definitely have yourself a nice little intel shield / caster one hand for it. Even if it’s some crappy quest green. If you can scrounge it up carry a few bootleg offspec pieces to equip inndungeons. It’s by no means required but it does help. Otherwise just know how to downrank your heal skills appropriately and you’re good to go, super easy.
---
Blizzard should give me moniez, but they don't.

I had theese exact same thoughts yesterday. Decided to roll both, will be leveling my warrior when my shaman friend is online.

yea after 1 month its still the older members that get it before you cuz u bet they too stacked the dkp

and if its not a dkp system its still likely at least for the bis items to go to the old core members

check my latest post

Cool, hbu? Wanna adventure with me?

This happened even before trial accounts were in the game (2011?), what they did was use a stolen credit card(s) to create accounts. Doesn't matter if the account was banned in a few days or a week, they got their gold selling spam advertising out.
---
Thunder fury didn’t just go to tanks, I remember our guild getting it for our fury warrior
---
Because in Vanilla the social aspect of mmorpg was crucial, MC is not hard or difficult because of the Bosses/Mechanics but because of logistics, coordination and preparation for a 40 man group. Once you had gone through that and sorted it out, in BWL and onward you could concentrate on the next like BWL, AQ and Naxx where these issues were still present but which added complexity to the fights.
---
There might be some guilds that will manage to go through MC quickly, but the majority - especially if they dont have 40 people but need to invite pugs/other groups will have a lot more difficulty to go through. Even if they start successfully, loot dramas might kill such raid groups.
---
Dear boss, I will be sick for 6 days next week.
---
Big thing people forget is you typically have at least one affliction warlock for dots in raid. The rest are hybrids. I was that warlock back then.
---
I think a lot of people will just move server once the game actually launches, I’ve made a char on shaz but will likely just roll on any server that will let me in. Cba logging in to make another character right now.

Keto class when

If you want be a damage dealer and play mostly solo the choose warlock or hunter.
---
Just a few words about the "frostbolt spam" thing, I watched a lot of video about classes and leveling guides and as I saw every class have "boring" rotation(I never played endgame vanilla, it's just my opinion based on what I saw. Pls don't hate). For example hunters spamming 2 buttons, paladins just basic attacking and cast 1 buff before the fight, priest cast shield and dot then wanding, rogues spam backstab or sinister strike then eviscerate. So I think you should choose based on the class lore, for example if you like mage and you like to feel like a powerful person who cast big ice shards from nothing and freez thier enemys to death you won't mind the spamming part.
---
can't wait to read all the moaning about insane queues

Yes we are all blizz employees and we just had a shareholder meeting and think you should sit this one out .

The idea of classic has this absurdism to it because it simtaneously asks for the game to revert to an old patch while wanting more content.

Literally high point in vanilla for me was getting ZG tiger mount on my tauren shaman. THATS RIGHT BOYS. BIG BULL ON A LITTLE KITTY.

Of course once raids hit and I rolled other classes I had shit like ctrl-shift-F and alt-Q rolling in... Simplicity was magical once eh
---
I agree , my retail main is Druid and I leveled as healer with friends , Everyone loves a healer , makes for non stop leveling. As long as they don’t mind me having a sit down every few packs in the early levels.
---
Warrior at 60 is pretty good. Just don't run into enemy mages, priests, warlocks, druids, hunters, shaman, paladins or other warriors and you're golden.
---
Alliance are the bad guys, always go horde. :)

Dungeon leveling guilds/groups is a thing. Look at subreddits for your realm and guild recruitment threads to find people.
---
Queues are for servers above medium. Not medium and higher.
---
There are way more games, even game genres, and alternative gaming platforms these days. Can't hold these things in a vacuum.
---
And friend systems are also integrated with battle.net, and color blind settings are still here, and various glitches are fixed,
---
This was never supposed to be vanilla. It's supposed to be classic
---
Never seen that combo before. Usually the TF people were MT that didn't really pvp.

Yet, blizzard still haven't locked character creation on these realms which is the logical 1st fucking step.

It's like they want this to fail.

So we've gone from shitting on parts of WoW that got worse to just shitting on everything added that wasn't in classic.

Horde are anti-heroes like the Punisher. Alliance are ass-wipes. It doesn't matter which one you pick, both are viable and fun to play. Alliance have better quest design and better zones to level in. Horde have a much better community.

calm the fuck down.
---
Then play a tauren. Their starting zone will get you hooked in seconds, its amazing.
---
Thanks man.  I'm finally settling on Lock, I think this post was the tipping point!
---
Should work. It will tire ur mac though. U can test it on a p server i guess :)

He has some similar ones which are also very good.
---
hmm I got the numbers from [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level)
---
I honestly would be ok with server merges rather than needing to transfer off later. Also why aren't they just straight locking realms? They should have done it when it hit high.

3 veeeeeeeeeeery long days to go

Omg the duel from dual one always annoys me something fierce.

Hard disagree. I wish we’d get toggleable modern models.

That's still a far cry from claiming to reserve the week off since last year

You will run it just fine. A fricken potato could run WoW Classic since the engine is so scalable.

---
How do you get to this overview to see the characters on your account ? :)
---
Unlikely.
---
This is a line many people will draw in the sand as a very negative change to retail wow, meaning the community will generally be against something like purchasing leveling boosts.
---
Nobody knows the future, but introducing a cash shop in classic is probably right up there with LFG in terms of things people would quit over.

There’s a /reset instance command that will work

---
It was a good post until the last paragraph. Little preachy at that point
---
I think mages and rogues hold their own  very well in dungeon gear. Not going to be super easy to gear one, just takes time. Might still put shaman on the list as they dont use 100% melee stat priority.
---
I would also like to know
---
This makes me HAVE SEX
---
WoW. What a dick
---
It’s like the satisfaction of taking weeks to put together a really epic model.
---
Yeah I'm playing on EU but live in Perth. I'll enjoy a lie in and start playing a few hours after launch, all being well
---
Sorry I don't poop in my socks
---
Almost right, you dont wanna kick anyone. Instead just reset the instance on your alt
---
You're right, but it's still true.
---
The problem is that talent trees in Vanilla work a bit differently than TBC onwards. Even if you put 31 talents into a single tree, you've still got 20 more to distribute - you can functionally go much deeper into other specs than in the later expansions. Many 31 point talents are also not worth taking, so you often end up with hybrid specs that don't fit into OP's infographics.
---
For instance, the raiding part of this infographic would need to evaluate individual talents to be truthful (For example - Ruin=essential, Shadow Mastery=good, Demonic Sacrifice=great).
---
I love Sunday! No post on Sunday!
---
Hope this is the last version needed, don't really want to keep filling out a slightly different version of the survey each time.

Imagine results won't be fairly represented if people share my view.

Nine classes clashing next? :)

So I wanna play an undead warlock but I want to the the troll/orcs quests. My question is can I do the imp and voidwalker quest there or I will have to go back and to them in eastern kingdoms?
---
You can get the Chinese to level your account for you, you will prob 100% get banned tho.
---
My guild struggled with Razorgore for a month or so(hunters sucked at kiting) then we finished BWL in 2 weeks after finding a strat that worked for us on Razorgore(Kill everything)
---
Gotta be nine classes clashing bud, it works so perfectly :)
---
The controls are the worst thing, its a lot better now than two or so years ago and its not 'real' 3D but goddamn does it look cool.
---
Can't open twitch from work, but I'd like something to read. Any chance you could actually link the list? I support Swifty by watching his stream at home though ;-) Thanks!
---
You do understand that the queue is to access the server not the data on the server. Your suggestion would make sense if you sat in queue after picking a character not before. Also what do you do about pve servers where you can have both?
---
Now play Orc fury warrior and shred the dps charts
---
Just use the latest release. If I remember correctly it was working in the beta.
---
Weird, who are they?
---
I'm Xavias, not the only RCW in this thread... And I've never heard of Raiding Rainbow (Although they have a really cool name). Do we have the same server in mind?
---
If they firsted Naxx I wouldn't know about it since I wasn't playing. But no, it was us and PPP in the running for BWL firsts and we eeked that out.
---
There was a week a while back where the left binding was dropping for everyone that did MC. Was a glorious week for us in the 1 binding club. Especially those with the right.
---
You're absolutely right in that cleave is not the highest rage/damage ability, that spot goes to sunder armor for obvious reasons. The final thing to consider in how efficient an ability is, which I hinted at but purposely didn't point out to encourage readers to think through this for themselves, is time to kill. What makes cleave efficient is its ability to speed up how quickly you kill things. It's a lot more difficult to quantify cleave's effectiveness because it depends on a large set of random variables like time spent traveling and rage decay, various combat mechanics such as misses, dodges and glancing blows etc.
---
I intentionally left some parts out to encourage readers to sit down and think about this for themselves.
---
Top reference good sir
---
Extremely
---
Dont choose a full realm
---
The game itself does an awful job explaining the lore of the game, everything is found in”in game books” and actual novels that you can buy on amazon.
---
No, see if you take the number of the days left, and subtract today which is already basically over I mean let’s be real we are already awake and talking...and then launch day itself waiting for the release hour won’t be SO bad because hype will be off the roof and shot will be nuts and awesome and then before you know it 3 short days have passed by and you are in a 28876 queue.
---
Stop buying macs, they're all overpriced pieces of shit.

No, thats the Zoomers

And if you keep talking english then noone would know there were scandinavians there either so what difference does it make to you?

I wouldn't mind if this happened. Half of me says, "Horde players pay the same subscription price as Alliance players." but the other half wants world PvP to be competitive and population-balanced. It would be boring if roving gangs of Horde just went around steam-rolling all Alliance in sight.
---
*I’m naked in the dark*
---
Thanks dad
---
shhh don't tell anyone...
---
Man I can't believe we are getting WoW classic and a new Tool album at roughly the same time.
---
Plus you can have "twelve profiting professions" (adding the three secondary professions).
---
when I got my razer naga.. I cant think when. was my first bit of nerdy tech and omg it was a dream come true. still to this day do I use it. tempted to get a molten one to celebrate classic.

Are you supposed to use guidelime with questie? I haven’t tried guidelime, but on the screenshots it looks like it has its own minimap icons etc.

Im gonna blast Tool with media player using the Half-Life 2 skin.
---
This. I can't wait to see someone in full raid tier gear and actually be impressed again.
---
AV 1.0 that you have to walk out to queue for.
---
You're being overly dramatic
---
All they’ve said is it’s not certain, not soon, and they’ll gauge community interest. Can’t remember where I saw it but it was fairly recent
---
1 month old account, sounds about right.
---
Nine classes clashing!
---
And that's a good thing to be honest. I recently played on a pserver that was rolling out "patches" like back in the day. Before the "patch" that fixed Lupos literally EVERY hunter had to have it. Duskwood was a pain to level in because level 40+ hunters would camp the spawn and sporadically gank people leveling in the area, and the general chat was filled with "IS LUPOS SPAWN???"
---
I decided to not get Lupos for my hunter because jesus christ heck that noise and regularly got comments like "lmao where lupos". There was an increased diversity of hunter pets as soon as the change went through.
---
Time install Limewire! Why not download Jackass.exe as well bacause my mom wouldn’t let me rent it.
---
His voice is just the best, and he knows what he's talking about.
---
Yea sure I will pick one of the low population ones.... oh wait they dont exist and medium/high servers will have queues already

Just saw a car at my work today with this sticker!

In 3 days it's Sunday
---
I am new to WoW and will join a PvP server with some colleague (though I will focus on casual PvE). Based purely on looks I have decided to roll a Gnome, but am torn between Warlock and Warrior.
---
\- Warrior was my initial choice: I played tanks often in previous games, the thought of a gnome with big armor and melee weapons is hilarious, but reading the class guides I have read make it seem that Warriors are not extremely newbie-friendly. Slow leveling and being very gear-dependent might not be ideal for a casual like me. My party also has a confirmed tank already, and another Warrior player (flex).
---
\- Warlocks also seem like a bunch of fun, and I like classes that can summon. It also makes more sense for my party to have one, instead of yet another Warrior. I don't necessarily like the way they look, though, all edgelord-like.
---
Would love to hear some insights :) I could just make whatever I don't pick my smurf, if I have time for one.
---
There's no chance in Hell. You'll have to level up the old fashioned way.
---
Man APC and Tool carried me through college!
---
And many dungeons, too....
---
Corsair scimitar as many have mentioned
---
No fight. They are one of the best horde model. Good animations, look fit and proportionate, no missing or broken pieces (troll, undead). Ugly face and hair, but a helmet fix that.
---
If you can only speak Spanish then you can’t read his survey you dingus. Why don’t you just add nationality to the next one bud
---
*Looking at album covers*
---
Where's Korn? I don't see Korn.
---
*scrolls a bit more left*
---
Oh there it is. This checks out.
---
Transmog. The best feature WoW ever got. And maybe group finder, the one that is bulletin board.
---
On naughty servs, I had mount money at 40 on both a warrior, rogue and hunter. 
---
When I was a dumb kid during live vanilla... well, atleast warlocks got a free mount, or I’d have been well into the 50’ies before I got it.
---
i'd say go for it, there's nothing wrong with shamans in pvp.
---
You can wait in a queue, you can switch to a newly-released realm with lower queue time, or you can wait a week or two for things to settle down. Plenty of options. 
---
What you can't do is come home after work on release day and immediately log into the server EVERYONE wants to play on. For good reason.
---
I could live with many things but if they put transmog in (ofc they won't) I think I would legit skip playing the game.
---
In Vanilla, you gauge your opponent's strength by looking at their silhouette and when they get closer, their gear. If people were to be allowed to transmog freely, this would all turn to shit.
---
Also I just hate it in general because I like that you have to consider both looks and stats when choosing your gear (sorta, there's room for it at least).
---
I mean doesn't everyone do this? Who goes about just typing in their native language when addressing to the whole community? People do realize that only a fraction will understand them, right?
---
It’s so dead that no one except raiders care about guilds so chances are there was no one in his guild to say anything.
---
Indeed
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctt61h/phase_2_in_a_nutshell/exneq44/
---
The whole point is to rather release fewer servers than necessary (and build up the numbers if needed) than go over the top and have dead servers after a few months.
---
Man, I'm glad people like you do not work for Blizzard.
---
I honestly never stopped listening to these bands lol.

&gt;Every update to Overwatch makes the game the best that it has ever been.
---
I love Jeff but the addition of Brigitte says otherwise.
---
Take it easy on the bootlicker.
---
I would just do the opposite. Level with feral talents and use healing gear when in dungeons. At least this is what I'm told is the most viable solution (without going full feral)
---
Yeah. I answered English even tho I'll probably be talking mostly Swedish in gchat etc. I know a lot of people answered Scandinavian even tho they'll 100% not talk their language in world or random gruop chats.
---
Nah vanilla mac client doesn't work and windows client needs Wine or some other way to run .exe files which can affect the performance.
---
Haha. It's decent in the sense that only people who know wow get it
---
When I first started Vanilla (1.5) I made an Undead Priest and walked to Durotar. No NPCs had exclamation points. I had to go back to Tirisfal glades and do a dozen quests to get my rep with the horde from yellow to green and bingo, NPCs in Durotar offered quests.
---
Someone is going to have to link to a video of someone in the WoW Classic beta running a fresh Undead to Durotar or Mulgore and showing if quests are offered. If I were you, I would play it safe and get that rep bar to green. It doesn't take very much time at all.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
I managed to buy one, once it arrived I had a quick look through and seriously it may be the best £10 I’ve spent. Every single NPC is listed and gridded to perfection, so it’s going to be a very valuable tool to have when navigating around Azeroth for the first time!
---
Then dont comment
---
I was thinking combined with leveling, to assure having 100g for the mount.
---
Epic ring at least.
---
Where do you have this info from? I doubt there are queues on "High" servers.
---
Same deal with undead warlock vs. orc warlock, undead wins with racials, but orc is usually considered the best overall warlock on horde vs. all the other classes.
---
That being said I'm going to be undead warlock.
---
Jokes on you. I stand in fire to get more rage to do max deeps.
---
If my friends Franken computer built from the corpses of several early 2000s PCs can run it. A mac might struggle to load in.

In all seriousness, probably.

Damn what's it like playing on a 75/25 server as the 75%? Is it super busy or are there other issues? Looking at Pyrewood Village (EU).

Instant flashbacks to trolling the shit out people in STV.

Yeah because they are very empty ATM.

I was thinking of getting teamviewer?

This mouse was great but I was all about the v3.0. The first amazing ergo shape mouse!

both a destruction speccs with afflicition or demo as support
---
&gt; Sell bathwater
---
So many thirsty neckbeards out there, epics mounts now without the mounting.
---
Incorrect. 2019 Medium is *more* than 2006 full. From bluepost:
---
" All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full. "
---
No thanks, I'd rather let it be known what you are. Keep up the good work.
---
shamans are not particularly control oriented, but they are certainly supportive. when you pvp you will optimally rock 30/0/21 which will have high burst and the potential to heal, but you dont have much control outside of slows and purges.
---
if you're looking for control based healer perhaps a priest would suit more since you actually have a CC (fear) as well as mind control, mana burn and dispel.
---
I think the careful approach to server openings is the right decision. Yes, we all know it's going to be busy on the first few days, but after that initial hype it's going to calm down. At launch you're going to have people who've booked time off work, people who are staying up really late to cram as much time as possible etc etc. Give it a couple of days and people's schedules will have to go back to normal - back to jobs, not staying up all night etc. At that point, the queue times are going to drop right down.
---
I'd rather we have a few busy, populated servers than spread everyone out across many. It will be easier to find people to play with, the auction house economy will be healthier, and it will give the game the sense of scale and community that it desperately needs.
---
You caught us, we're all Jeff Kaplan's bots.
---
Yeah lets hope we dont need to change again...
---
Chrome remote desktop is much easier to use, just set your computer to never sleep and you access it any time with 1 button, tap PLAY on your [battle.net](https://battle.net) to login and you're in que.
---
I have 3 eyes in my bank... on my rogue. I got 3 eyes before i got both thunderfury bindings :D
---
You don't want to cast Shadow bolt in leveling, ever. And with low gear, destruction tree is underwhelming. 
---
On the other hand a deep investment in demo is a huge advantage in pvp server. Having 2 voidwalker shields at your disposal is a pretty big deal in STV.
---
So... much... runecloth
---
if you need to do it like this (not with a command) then just one leaves grp, walks without a group back in the dungeon then invites everyone else after they’ve left the original grp.

You’re level 80?

60 / 40 is actually good...

Where's that. Gif when you need it. Stop slacking memers

How do I set it to never sleep? In the power options?

you mean signatures spells like.... shadow bolt?

Pong was THE game back in the day.  It gets pretty boring after about 10 minutes.
---
Same can be said for PAC-Man or Space Invaders.

Mario World is amazing; I haven’t made it more than halfway through that game since before Warcraft’s beta.
---
Come to think of it, Warcraft: Orcs v Humans was groundbreaking in its day.  I’ve installed it like 4 times and haven’t made it past the 4th or 5th level.
---
Even though I've been correct in every prediction leading up to Classic launch ... totally not an insider. ;)
---
After installing WoW Classic and trying to launch it I got an error that says “Your 3D Excelerator card is not supported by World of Warcraft. Please install a 3D Excelerator card with dual-TMU support.”

At this point, they should just split Shazzrah and Golemag and be like "The servers will dissapear, choose any of these instead"

And for everyone who got their precious name "Legolas" and "Achilles" anyone who previously had a character created on Shazzrah or golemag will have 1 hour before others to reserve their names"

The wording is off. Instead of asking for what language you will be typing/speaking you should ask for nationality. As a Norwegian I will still type and speak in English but I feel I still should choose Scandinavian in order for the spreadsheet to show the proper values.

Yeah you're going to be absolutely fine.

I'm not changing servers because I believe every single server will be full come launch day.
---
Also, I already have guild and leveling groups planned on Shazzrah.
---
While leveling, nobody expects their healers to be healing spec.  That would be miserable.  Hell, you can even heal level 60 dungeons without the proper spec.  As long as you have a “healing” set and are mindful that your not going to be quite as efficient, you’ll do fine.
---
Being an experienced healer will be far more of a benefit for you than being spec’d into resto.

If someone is unable to communicate in English they aren't going to be browsing r/classiccwow. Nor will they fill out an English survey.

Are you subscribed? Classic is playable if you're subscribed to retail wow
---
I am the senate!
---
I think it would be great if they released BC, and WotLK, and then did an alternate universe when Deathwing didn't fuck everything up. This would obviously be in at least a few years if Classic lasts that long.
---
mage and druid are perfectly capable of solo leveling
---
I'm not sure but maybe you need to sub first?

Just play retail ffs

Yes in the power options, youll want to download the Chrome Remote Desktop app on both your phone and PC.

I always asked myself, "why am not just flying straight!?". Little did I know, it was one of the best parts of wow.
---
I mean.... I you are playing on PvE realm, you are missing like 50% of the game literally while leveling. And while leveling is like 8 days played for average player, you will miss a lot. But I understand that people want to avoid ganking. But most people want to relive the vanilla days with everything in it. And WPvP is a biiiiiig part of vanilla experience.

I didn't play in Vanilla ( from TBC onwards) whilst I do have memories of IF being more populated the majority of my WoW years for the Alliance Stormwind was always the place to be. Why in Vanilla was IF the better city? Was it just because of the location or did people genuinely just like the city better?
---
good video but he is not playing sm/ruin, he is playind deep destruction for conflag.
---
you think Blizzard has 200k employes? They just laid off everybody ain't no company got money for that lmao :D
---
As much as I totally agree that IF is the much busier main city and its closer to everything and when I played vanilla I was in I.F all the way what about the rallying cry buffs as they only effect those in SW right? I am trying to decide where to set my HS and I keep getting tempted to go SW for the buff chances at random.
---
This is great, but I don't want this subreddit becoming R/Wow
---
&gt; you have to consider both looks and stats when choosing your gear (sorta, there's room for it at least).
---
Here is how it is considered by people: 0.00000000000000000000001% more output (dps, hps, tps, you name it) - time to switch gear.
---
&gt; you gauge your opponent's strength by looking at their silhouette and when they get closer, their gear

Yeah, yeah. That system can be tricked turning off helmet and gearing not the best shoulders.

To everyone asking about the level 80: The GM is level 80. GMs can be any level they want, up to level 255. They didn't have to be in WotLK to be 80.

If you want to play PvP, BT or one of the ZG Bats are your best bets. In PvE the attack speed doesn't really matter, except you?re playing Beastmaster, because of the talent that when your pet crits it gets faster attack speed. Faster attack speed = More chances to crit.

I just wish they'd allow a transfer over to a new realm from Shaz for the first 24 hours, so you could guarantee you get your name. Then open it up for everyone. I get some people don't give a shit about a name, but obviously a lot of people do.

No they are right :( I’m level 80 in this screenshot, didn’t even check it as it’s in my vanilla folder for my old website, guessing as it was on vanilla content not taken in vanilla :(

Honestly I cannot remember how long it takes to level pets that are massively underleveled, 2-3 levels was fast enough but if you by chance come across him you'd do well to tame him if only because this asshole is not only a good hunter pet but a quest mob that is always getting his face shoved in.

I think this site may have the info you're looking for and if not their forums should. https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/

I dont really know how healing is in WoW so I can't say for sure if I like it. I've always been a dps kind of dude in any other games. But I like the idea of a support frontliner in pvp, keeping my warrior friend topped off while he goes ham. Since horde is the majority in my server, i wanna take advantage of the alliance exclusive class because I heard paladins were good in pvp. But I wanna get an insight of how the class performs elsewhere to see if it's worth dealing with.

I would like to play a druid casually. My goal is to tank in endgame dungeons, not raids. But also I wanna have cat gear so I can solo grind efficiently. My question is, if I have cat gear, will I be able to tank level 60 dungeons? Or I must get gear specifically for Bear?

I was doing it on my pc.

Yeas. Really. Best feature. It helps creating unique character that is trully yours.

Can you please explain it?

Think that's great - they reserved them and they should be able to use or not use them :)

Shazzrah I understand as they've mentioned that continuously but Golemagg has half the number of responses than all of the other EU PVP realms on the latest demographics survey. I realise this isn't the whole picture but seems strange that Golemagg is now suddenly massively overpopulated too.

Fair points I suppose. In the end though...

If you have you work on them they are still overpriced? I don't see the difference.
---
you can't do that on stuff like sinister strike, always auto selects the highest rank (since the cost stays the same over the ranks). just fyi
---
It’s not really being “soft” to enforce a rule for literal basic civility.
---
I'm sure they'll add more servers on launch day. I'll just sub and join a new server then, it will probably fill up like crazy anyway.
---
Especially when people notice that they won't be able to play with their friends because of a 4 hour queue.
---
How did you ever go back?

This could be the new loading screen art for eastern kingdoms it’s so good.

My bad. I didn't look at your character's level at all. Whoops.

The amount of money they will make on subs alone in the first week will double the money they put into servers and developing classic
---
Yep. Even a 45:55 split can be miserable if the pop is high enough. Anything worse than that is a hell no.
---
Yep .. and i fear it reflects on the players there. Makes me wanna avoid that server.
---
And demographics doesn't mean shit if everyone speaks english

With warrior you better have a pocket healer for PvP but rogues don't need that jazz.

Isn't Dwarf the most popular Ally race for rogues who only want to focus on pvp? Humans are of course popular for pve, but I would expect a lot of people would want to roll a dwarf.

The funny thing being the garbage players who do stuff like this are the kind that would play on a PVE server and take advantage of flagging mechanics to score free kills.
---
I laughed plenty playing on pvp servers back in the day.  Outplaying chumps like this (and you) is always a good time.  You should pick a PVE server to play on.  /spit

“Your information is wrong and inaccurate” is literal feedback. Sounds like you don’t know how to process feedback in general.
---
Healer can run dungeon earlier than tank and dps because they don't suffer the increased miss chance from hitting higher level mobs.
---
That being said, BFD is an easy dungeon. If you ran a DM/WC at lvl +-17 and got some loot (from quest and drop) you'd be able to heal BFD at lvl 18.
---
If RNGesus wasn't on your side and you don't have more than 2-3 greens, you should probably wait until lvl 20.
---
Don’t do it! Just sleep, it will be better in the long run.

It's interesting hearing different views on whether or not Lupos added diversity in pets or not. I often see people argue that a unique effect like his was important to keep pets interesting but my actual experience in WoW (and every other game with an obvious best option) was that everybody had the same "best" pets.
---
He’s also gonna get 10% durability lost. (:
---
Which one is in more demand for endgame PvE ? Paladin or alliance warlock ?
---
Damn I thought YTMND was closed? Someone buy it?
---
Hardest part is keeping so many people happy when gearing goes so slow. Some items (like ringd/amulets and in some cases weapons) could be bis for half your raid. Since you need reserves as well, you are looking at 20 25 people who all want to have bis gear and want that same item that isn't even a guaranteed drop.
---
The weekly loot amount is pretty much the same as now, but to be divided by alot more people.
---
Fatigue tends to set in when character progress is too slow compared to invested effort. And that balance is way different in Vanilla than in retail.
---
Wasnt the t0.5 the upgrade to the piece you already had? So you dont need a second one but just the one you use?
---
you're camping cheetah a LOT once you get it, so you essentially waste 5 talent points whenever you're not in hawk. your pet can always use more hp
---
You can still download and launch the application without a sub though.

Actually since AV isn't out phase 1 isn't Rhok what we rush for.

Blizz stated they will have queues about 8 hours or so ago. Medium does not mean "everyone with a character can play at once" it just means the queues will be way shorter than full servers.

Imagine being condescending over people who care about things.

The names I reserved aren't popular or awesome. I hope to have all three of them at level 60 before CyberPunk 2077 comes out and I take a long break from WoW.

You're right, it's only movement speed that was changed

You don't need to sub, only update your Launcher to the latest version.

You can also thanks prismatia https://youtu.be/J1rroXX_P5M they were 3 years earlier than nostalrius and scripted 80% of the quest because back in the day nostalrius was an instant 55 with 10 players average and Feenix just a pvp server instant 60. Btw only viper was a developer in nostalrius team and Treemo for prismatia in 2012. Before that in early 2012 or was a team on mangos zero who made it possible in the first place.

This is why alts are important, soon as you sense you’ll be getting ganked, switch toons and level peacefully.

But the number of people per server - meaning the number of ppl who compete for any given name - is MUCH higher.

those people are in minority

And if I'm in a none English guild, but will speak English anywhere els, what do I pick?

English to show everyone that I won't speak a language they can't understand in world chat, or Scandinavian to show other scandi what server they are most likely to find guilds that speak their languages?

You play the patch, acquire new gear and it becomes obsolete the next patch lol, sometimes you can keep it for one more patch cycle.

I honestly can't see how people are motivated to keep playing retail now, gearing (one of the most interesting aspects in a MMO imo) is a shitty rng-fest and boring, all while keeping it's value for 90 days max.

I think it some LGBT haters have trolled the forums and asked for this kind of 'unofficial server'. There is seriously no point in bringing up LGBT matters in a game, so only trolls will do that just to reinforce the stigma.

Stop trolling. They were there for longer than they weren't. And they were added with bgs lol. No changes.

I live in the UK so the launch is something like 11pm! So I won’t get to play until the following evening.

There will likely be plenty of world PvP going on in Phase 1 as well. People are perfectly happy knowing their opponent is another player and is eating dirt even when not given points for it.

You don't need to sub to download classic. It looks to me like your [b.net](https://b.net) needs updating, check the green banner across the bottom of the window

Lots of baseball happened that year. Also, I can’t believe we got WoW in Europe in 2005! I don’t remember waiting a year for wow because I remember I played the open us beta!
---
Great choice! Though do be sure to get some advice from someone who actually raided during vanilla about what talent specs to go for... As I understand, Warlocks are hamstrung somewhat by two things:
---
-The debuff limit on enemy mobs makes affliction nonviable, meaning you have to spec away from DoTs and into demonology/destruction
---
-...but destruction is gimped somewhat by early raids having a lot of fire resistant enemies. So you're going to have to investigate a hybrid build taking some of the (non-fire related) bonuses from destruction alongside Dark Pact (Affliction) or Demonology (Sacrifice).
---
It's really not my area but I do understand that, as you gear and move on from the early raids, you'll finally start to compete directly with mages and beat down the hunters!
---
Me!!! Less is more!!!
---
Sharding will eliminate this.
---
For reference, they said that 2006 "FULL" servers would be low today.

Thanks. Haven't used the launcher in a looooong time. That could be it!

I don't know why but I'm just looking forward to seeing mages selling portals again. Like you say it's such a big part of class identity. Retail classes just don't seem to feel any different from one another
---
Maybe I got confused. I thought the playlist was supposed to be matching the time frame. I’m guessing now that it’s just what they listened to when they played.
---
I meant those that are going to EU, its around 1k people. Most are staying on russian servers ofc
---
The stair even is nerfed somewhat in 1.12, though, IIRC. But still a fun dungeon.
---
porn.
---
On a second note, any reason they havent just stopped people creating on full realms?
---
This post gave me aids. The things you're asking for are the start of the slippery slope that gave us the garbage that is retail. Achievments, item level, group finder etc etc... all cancer to the community. 
---
Ain't got an achievment? Guess who isnt getting a spot in the raid.
---
ilvl not high enough? Guess who definitely isnt getting a spot in the raid. 
---
Group finder? Never need to speak to anyone ever again...
---
The community is one of the main things that make classic so great. Everyone just wants to have a good time. Sure, there's the hardcore players but they make up less than 1% of the population. You can see how experienced somebody is by how they play and what they're wearing. And honestly, I'd rather take a down to earth, nice guy that knows the basics than some jumped up, snotty elitist that won't talk to you unless you're holding thunderfury.
---
It's just two, mythic corresponds to normal of the next tier, same for heroic and LFR, so they only jump 15 ilvls twice per tier.
---
Some Pservers will allow for one to drop, and then remove it from the loot tables immediately afterwards.
---
Shattered ankle is 3 months off at least
---
You need to either learn to read or listen proper. It was stated "several" hours, not 8 and it was only on the most popular servers like faerlina, harod and shazzrah. Medium pop servers will have no queue.

Do you plan on implementing a check box system so you can tick off what you've done and maybe save your progress that way?

That's Agamaggan's petrified schlong.

No, they wouldn't. If Blizzard tried this in court I promise you, they would have been able to shut it down. They just don't care that they break ToS.

---
Lmfao learn to hear
---
What jabrahamcollins forgot to mention is that Horde are edgelords. Most of them anyways. Alliance certainly have the more medieval european setting, prettier dwellings and better music. And we're cuter, so that's that.
---
For the Alliance!
---
Hard choice since each style is different but I'll try to help.
---
Since you're into pvp the first thing you need to decide is whether you prefer wpvp over premade bg, since there are no arenas in classic you will almost certainly gravitate towards one more than the other, even if you end up doing both.
---
If you somehow think you will attempt to get a high rank in bgs then I suggest staying away from rogues, although they are exceptional in the open world , their place and use in bgs is limited, aside from ghosting bases and ninja capping, most of your time will be spent away from fights, as you probably already know, rogues rely heavily on openers and restealthing, which is incredibly hard to do in random bgs without cloak of shadows, 1 dot on you pretty much guarantees your death within 30 secs.
---
Not to mention ,the particular playstyle usually warrants only 1 spot in dedicated premades and although I'm sure you can find one , hunters and mages are usually brought more often , increasing your odds of finding a good premade.
---
Now as for hunters and mages, they are both incredibly strong in both wpvp and bgs, mages being the most popular one for sure, though being the most popular also means there will be an abundance of mages roaming around everywhere, so it is up to you to decide whether you want to compete with them all for spots.
---
Hunters are often misunderstood in classic, they are a powerhouse if used correctly. Their pve dps is also often misused as most hunters did not use the class' full kit and proper rotation, there's a reason so few hunters are good, it's much harder to be a good hunter than a good mage, and even though their dps does fallout in later patches, they are however relatively strong in the first patches of the game and their dps can contest other classes.
---
It is also safe to assume that unless one is not playing in a hardcore guild, players will often not pull off their A game in terms of dps, meaning you could compete as pretty much any of the dps classes for top spot, if you're dedicated / good enough.
---
Finally, I must say that although raids are often referred to for endgame, they are usually not going to be the place you spend most of your time in classic, many often forget to consider that with relatively faster clears, less raiding days are needed and if that is the case it means a hardcore player who plays everyday will often raid 1-2 days a week, so the rest of the week will be spent in the open world or in bgs/dungeons, in such a case you can see how the relative benefit of a class shifts dramatically under such circumstances.
---
I might not have given you the answers your seek, but hope to have addressed some of the most relevant questions about classic which might ultimately help you decide on what to play.
---
Best of luck.
---
My plan is to go to sleep at 6am. Then wake up at 9am

So before tbc meeting(summoning) stones and all innkeepers had dialogue option that will try to set group, but really not many people used this thing because mostly party looks like 5 rogues, in tbc meeting stones became summoning stones.
---
What's a good class for a 5 year old that is actually pretty good at Overwatch?
---
Why are you trying to do guides if you haven't played the class or dont have a lot of knowledge about them? Not a very valuable guide if you dont have the knowledge.
---
I think most people who are coming back will hang around - WoW has been around for a while, and everyone knows what the game is going to be like.  Everyone expects the launch to be hectic - if anything people who see the queues will get the idea that its going to be super popular, they just might have to come back in a few days.
---
If there are consistently long queues over a period of weeks then people might give up at that point.
---
I think they're trying to counter player drop-off by filling up these servers.  They're focused on servers being populated from the outset, which is a positive thing.
---
You would be correct.
---
I am torn betweet 3 classes too. In the end I decided that I will level the three of them and see which one is my fav one they get to sixty, that'll be my main.
---
Classic is not going anywhere, there's time to try everything! Probably it will be even eqsier to get gear once you get to sixty after some weeks
---
This poll does not measure that.
---
unorthodox idea yea, not very christian. but in the end she had fun, the dude had fun, and she got the mount after she got mounted. so a total win - stahp hatin'
---
I hope they wind a way to bring back the skeleton but make it so that lower levels don’t leave a skeleton? Makes it harder for hate speech or advertising. (I doubt someone would level to 10 just to kill them selves to form a swastika.)
---
Also how did they kill themselves on command?

I'm having the same struggle between these two classes and, while your response was very imformative and well though out, I still have absolutely no idea which class to choose!
---
Yeah I know this kind of question is way too early but Im just curious. And pass the time for waiting the launch.
---
How do Blizzard know how many people are waiting for launch day to subscribe?
---
Because if the servers are going to have hours-long queues just from retail/name reserve players, then come three hours before launch the population numbers are going to be crazy.
---
If you disconnect, you will have to enter a queue if there is one.
---
My 5 week vacation started this week so I'm set for another 4 weeks of just classic. But oh man am I pissed that Blizz after 15 years of WoW still do midnight releases for Europe. Servers will open at 00:00 for my region.
---
That would be child abuse.
---
Well, you'll have to be "into it" if you want to enter Naxx. You can't just skip tiers at your leisure. Doesn't exactly show commitment to you guild if you want to skip a chunk of it for aesthetic reasons.
---
oh boy, the launch is going to be such a shitshow.
---
After a lot of thinking i decided to play a mage as main char at launch however i still have a few things which are unclear to me. I have no vanilla experience and some of the sources present conflicting or insufficient info about these:
---
1. Should i spec in the tree completely for single target (frostbite also) , go aoe (no frostbite, improved blizz etc) or try something in between.
---
2. Ideally i would want a combination of professions that are good money makers as well as being useful once ranked to 300. Tail/Ench or Herb/Alchemy ?
---
Regarding 1. i know i won't be able to really aoe level but a few people claimed that even doing just a 4 pull is better than killing one mob at a time. On the other hand i will be on a hugely populated pvp realm which maybe means being full single target might aid me a lot in contested zones + if i only get to tag one mob at a time because everyone is doing the same zones being full single target spec might aid me in going faster.
---
For my second question it is very important to know that i estimate my weekly playtime to be around \~15-20 hours. I would love to go ench/tail however a lot of resources say that ench is ideal if you play a lot (rep grind farm etc.) . Is enchanting that bad of an earner with my expected playtime ?
---
My Mionix lasted a year but then the scroll wheel was pretty much useless, cleaned it a few times but nothing helped. 
---
The mouse was great though.
---
Best way to choose is just to look at them, and ask yourself "will I still like this in 6 moths?"
---
The  best advice I can give a new player is just enjoy your experience friend.
---
whatever he/she finds appealing, i'd probably say a hunter.
---
I feel like this guy deserves some more views, great little montage.
---
I have it macro'd to every healing spell.
---
This playlist is gold make a SoundCloud play list pls pls pls pls pls
---
Hunter
---
That’s actually perfect. Start the queue, go to class, come home and play. 
---
kidding^not kidding^sob
---
I know right?! Everyone is acting like they've cleared the content, yet the game doesn't even come out for another 4 days! Who the hell do they think they are?! Time Travelers?! Impossible!
---
I did play on Lights Hope about a half a year ago, and I also played the tail end of Legion and BFA. I quit BFA before the first raid even came out. I wish i could find those videos i have of me doing SSC on my paladin and Ragnaros on my 60 gnome mage in vanilla.
---
yes you can tank dungeons while leveling as arms, to level as prot would be very slow and unnecessary.
---
It’s not about the execution but the sheer effort involved.
---
God damn murlocs.
---
Op as fuck in the early levels.
---
True, can't denie that.
---
i think the thing you have to do is logout on an alt, and invite him to group, convert to raid and then make him lead. Then everybody except the alt logs out and he writes /camp ? then leaves the group when everybody logs back in they should be at the instance entrance i guess.
---
You’ll never get just one either
---
A wand will not be that price and sell within hours... people will be wasting their money trying to sell at that price with the AH deposits.
---
I expect you'll pick up a wand for 10silver at least until a week or so in when people have money.
---
Ofc, people used to retail economy will put things up for dumb prices, again, they'll be wasting their time and money.
---
Probably that weird French guy “BlowMe”
---
missing soilwork and inflames
---
You think you do...
---
Ehh not sure, we all wanted Blizzard to make official servers because of the issues we had.
---
Mobs glitching out, mechanics not working 1:1, gold RMT (often with the help of a GM), faction collusion, R14 boosting, exploits and bugs.
---
The population was so insane that they reduced the draw distance to about 10 yards infront of your character, and all your abilities had a 1-2 second lag on use during primetime (13k+ people online)
---
Fun fact: Ragnaros was bugged the first weeks of MC, so he just froze and didn't attack people if the tank died. The first ever Ragnaros kill on Nostalrius was done by just having the tank die and then using ranged to take him down.
---
I remember we were collectively shaking our head thinking that the server was too poorly scripted for us to enjoy, luckily they sorted out most of these things in the end.
---
There were only queues on a few servers in their peak of wotlk, if there are queue times for maybe a million people then they arent taking it serious or trying to spend as little money on it as possible
---
Those are the only fun classes in tbc imo
---
Only 2500 spots with no layering means the 15,000 player 3 hour queues come back, and then players are forced to choose between rerolling on a lowpop and ditching their geared 60 and their guild/friends or just quitting the game outright.
---
The correct answer was faster server spinups in the early days.
---
Absolutely no guild ia committed to a server at this point. Not a single character hslas been rolled. As soon as Classic goes live the players are locked and many would ratger quit completely over changing servers.
---
Same, i really don't try to recreate truly vanilla experience, i don't want to play museum game - no way to do it, world changed, we changed. 
---
I want just to play game, good game with my old friends, there was many good changes in next expansions, but was bad also, so bad that they ruined  all gameplay.
---
\&gt;Sound fun?
---
Yes
---
They're not going to fill. You underestimate how much people attach themselves to a server. This has happened before.
---
Then take into account the vanilla+ bunch and how this opens the door to Blizz to add such functionality or "improving" it. 
---
It's a step closer to the actual focus of the hate, the LFD system. Next step will be asking back for it, leaving us haters in the dust again.
---
Argument could be made that most people haven't even made characters yet and we're all rearranging chairs on the Titanic.
---
We're ALL going to be in queue, because Classic wasn't supposed to be this big.
---
when you consider that nearly all of quest items until about level 10 are white when you start to get actual stats on items in RFC or WC its feels like you just got a game changing item getting that 2 extra int as a mage
---
you could just advertise the original vanilla experience. I logged in, saw queue, took a nap, woke up and played back then
---
These people ruined retail why do they need to try ruining this?
---
Good luck, hope you get the time off. Don't forget to stock up on your favourite snacks, cant have a hardcore session without munchies!
---
Water pls.
---
I’d agree on the floor and ceiling thing, but you honestly cheapen the experience when you add different difficulties to the same thing.
---
How is that dramatic?  It's the first change they've decided to make that I feel isn't warranted.  I don't give a shit if you don't believe I hold that opinion lol
---
If they'll have queues, they'll be a lot smaller.  
---
What do you think blizz is supposed to do? Release massive amounts of servers just to shut them down after a month and merge which is a terrible experience for everyone?
---
Sorry, i meant to write; I Can play healer, i dont mind that.
---
With the two PVP servers at launch, id say people reserved names on both. Might affect the results a bit... i know i have 4-5 names on shazz, 4 in gehannas, 1 in golemagg and 5 in firemaw. Or something like that. Obviously i will just play on ONE of those servers (but keep my main char name reserved in all 4 until end of time).
---
And yes, im going to do multiboxing, so i didnt get 5 accounts because of names.

Don't play warrior if you're going to be casual. You'll most likely just end up quitting or starting a new character.

Ive put 3 days in at work, im going to blast for 16 hours a day while my wife looks after the kids, its like a lads holiday but in the house.
---
Imagine finally being able to play classic wow and then complaining about “muh skeletons are gone :(“ 
---
Such a trivial issue you all whinge and complain about.
---
Haha.  Ol girl Blizzard got your dollar again.  Baaaahh!
---
Or another Ragnaros (since he is the wow version of said monster)
---
Make your own guide oh that takes work my bad ;)
---
Ahh, nostalgia when you see that house again. This really brings back the memories, the world is so mesmerizing!

You mean like american news? Dude, you're just full of shit. Even if what you're saying is true - which I simply don't know - it doesn't hold ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER in the matter I've commented on.
---
So begone
---
Looks like a good time to MC Saurfang.
---
"mana" means the healer is full on mana and you are free to pull more mobs.
---
I have no idea. It was literally a funny that just popped into my head as I was looking at the pic. If it references something else then that was coincidental. :)
---
This. Many people haven't even made characters yet. "medium" realms right now will be FULL in 4-5 days.
---
Smash
---
Depends. The sword skil lracial only matters when you fight mobs 3 levels above. And it matters just exactly in that spot. 
---
1-2 levels above (0.5% hit per level and slight glancing blow reduction) or 4 or more levels above (1% hit per lvl and glancing blows deal more dmg), you don't get too much benefit out of the weapon skill. 
---
So, while leveling it plays only a very small role. Feel free to use the axe, as it's the best of the weapons.
---
It's the same principle as vqueue on private server, it's a chat parser ... i'm ok with it since on very populated server the chat will be spam for group search.
---
Too late. The casuals are here and ruined this sub already. Thanks Blizzard marketing...
---
I’m feeling the same way with rogue and mage. It’s killing me.
---
Ah that sucks, I really didnt know what I was getting myself into with Mionix, only that people seem to like their products so I went for it. Guess we'll see how it holds up by the end of the year.
---
yea you pull one mele and you somehow pull 2 mele and 3 casters
---
I have two Microsoft Trackball Explorers I use and have repaired one with parts from the other one for the last 15 years.
---
Thanks, thats exactly what i was looking for if there really is no ingame Display
---
I bounced around between mage, warlock, rogue, back to mage.
---
Mage just looks so damn fun. Powerful in PvP and PvE, summoning consumables, making some cash by portaling people around, AoE grinding, etc. I look forward to many hours of hanging around cities, talking to people, handing out complimentary water and bread, etc.
---
Yea we are in the "what if argument, but the best way to even out servers would have been to cap them so groups of friends and guilds late to the party would have had to pick/switch to a non-Full server.
---
Go aoe grind somewhere else
---
Why is that?

You seem so triggered.

Toxicity is so freakin good
---
For the purposes of a group finder, which was not available in vanilla and is not in keeping with what classic is supposed to be. LFG is available in that shitshow you call retail.
---
Grind linen cloth, trade to guildie tailor, they get skillups you get bags, both save money.
---
My friend list is just people from hearthstone who added me after a match (probably to shittalk to me) but i only accept the invite the next day and they never say anything.
---
Yup, it is what you make of it really.
---
2 1/2 inches
---
Big if true.
---
What?
---
And take the resurrection sickness? Absolutely barbaric!
---
Play CS 1.6 on the lan party while we wait in the queue
---
I am! I want to be immersed in the game again. It doesn't work when they just keep adding more and more outrageous mounts and gear.
---
With 8 hour queues you'll have plenty of time to sleep.
---
*spams jump while stationary on a mechanostrider at you*
---
Time yes, skill? No way. FFXI was my intro to mmorpg's but the grind was unreal. I made it to lvl 63 on my Dark Knight before I quit and the only reason I played as long as I did was because of the social aspect of it. You could essentially do nothing by yourself.
---
Lol why are you so defensive? I didn't argue against queues whatsoever, of course we need them, I just said expect them on **every** current realm. Those medium pop ones now are gonna be high either before launch or very shortly after.
---
Unbuffed.
---
I created a Nightelf warrior called Kimahri (FFX). Will be at level 1 for a while.
---
i mean, you can just.........wait a second or two between gcds *shrug*
---
Oh wew counter strike.. Will be huge fun in militia and dust 👌.
---
What time you Will be ready for wow though?
---
They really need to remove transmog restrictions and re-add the vanilla content to retail via a Chromie NPC. It would be so easy to do. It's such a dumb waste that Naxx 40 transmog is unavailable to people outside of stupid black market auction house gold sinks for people who work the AH. They already did the work for classic (bringing old data into the modern codebase).
---
Really? My feeling is that Metzen obviously plays horde.
---
I enjoy the company of fellow edgelords.
---
Thank you his channel is great I think I've found the video I might use.
---
Yes you can do any of the warlock quests as any race I tested it in stress test
---
Man that's a classic I haven't seen that since I was a teenager.
---
In last expac they weren't. I didn't bother because it looked initially and turned out to be dog shit.
---
I leveled two characters to 60 on Lights Hope. I did some Pre-bis gearing as a priest and mage. Then i actually got to raiding, and I again realized how much fucking drama there is. I just quit playing the game and hopped onto the BFA hype train. I want to play Classic, but I'm afraid I wont have time, and I'll just get detrimentally addicted to it, again. I'll have alot of fun just following the streamers as they slog their way to 60.
---
CotBD on rogue is super iconic.
---
Problem with this is a lot of bad tanks aren't even reading the chat and by the time I'm done typing they're already face deep in two more mob groups and I have to catch up and pop CDs to keep everyone up.
---
I hope to god classic is not like this.
---
Not as rich. I am using vortex core
---
well, this only shows how liked the spanish players are. Not like anyone has a experience with playing with them, right?
---
For once for this format its honestly a great middle ground to exist in
---
Lol these are actually pretty entertaining I might watch them myself even though I'm already set on playing a warlock.
---
your mount will go back to being a meaningful tool instead of a collectors item
---
If you listen to the naysayers, you're going to hate layering. If you just play the game, you wont
---
These polls just exacerbate the problem imo
---
girls have asses too you know.
---
Just buy a proper keyboard when you play instead of gimping yourself.
---
To be fair, I have spent a lot of time on pservers leveling pretty slowly and doing strange things (same thing I did on stress tests, just testing weird leveling theories that I have).
---
And I run 2 accounts, so yeah, I'll burst my Priest up to 60 pretty damn fast (again, planning on group leveling, does go faster than solo if you know what you're doing).  Then I'll just hop on my mage while my priest is sitting in Org waiting for things to happen, and pick flowers or something, and see the sights.
---
Thanks a lot for that. I've been looking for Spotify techno playlists for a long time now and yours just perfectly fits what I wanted.
---
Both really. To gain knowledge of the game in order to physically navigate and play with him. We have always talked about him wanting show me the ropes so we could play together, but right now our schedules are opposite with me working a lot of nights and sleeping during the day. There is a lot of downtime on my graveyard though, so I thought it would be cool to teach myself as much as I could with the time I have. He games during this time so it would be perfect!
---
TFW people are stupid enough to try and log on at midnight (EU) and waste a lot of time to get in. And when they get in, they can't leave the starting zone for hours because they can't get tags. When they could just GO TO BED early in the evening and get up fresh at 06 or something like that and instant log in and get a much better xp gain per time spent.  
---
/facepalm
---
thanks for including a completely unrelated discord message by me in the picture kek
---
You can try it yourself if you want. It will only take you 30 minutes :P
---
yeah yeah words hurt.  I like how someone calls me retarded and you're grilling me on civility lol.
---
FOR KHAAAZ MODAAAN!!!
---
Yeah, but isn't it taking quite a bit out of classic to be paired with "different" people on every login? Since you get (maybe/always?) in a different layer?
---
Honestly your Rng is bad because youre a gnome. Fuckin gnomes
---
Priests will be needed a lot so if you realy want to heal go for it.
---
103 patrons...
---
I'll be lugging around two gearsets from level 20 or so, then three after forty, so I'm just feeling very paranoid about where I'll find the space.
---
Nah, I will not enjoy myself anymore after hours of play. I have a few weeks off and will play for 2h, do other stuff for 1h, play for 2h etc etc. Keeps me fresh.
---
Will probably head to bed at 2AM after leaving starter zone, get a good night's rest and binge some in the morning.
---
Does it include that shady Staind song with the random car honk in the middle of it?
---
You forgot Evanescence... did you even play classic ?
---
Is Omen still the threatmeter to use or are there better alternatives for classic?
---
ty very much!
---
I think it's just playing the game.
---
Very informative! I will definitely research that, thanks!
---
The thing i fear most is, that all the bosses are probably balanced for 1.12, so they will be a lot easier now. Together with the better items dropping from the start, cassic will be alot easier then vanilla. Also there are tons of guides for all the bosses now.

---
Is there a battlenet update pending? A friend of mine had the same issue until she updated Bnet.
---
Yes, if you don't even critters will one shot you.
---
We'll start logging in around 27-28 minutes before the official live time as someone suggested that we will be able to sit on char screen for no longer than 30 minutes before being afk kicked.
---
I have exactly the same problem. Around 15% priests in polls seems crazy to me. Private servers had around 9% iirc
---
it was, providing you run in a straight line now you dont need to jump, back in vanilla if you didnt jump you fell, and it was a lot long run back then as well before they removed half the dungeon
---
Awesome, thanks you! Hope you and your brother have a blast
---
HYUK HYUK, DAE mid 2000s metal?!? MEMES
---
my ears will never forgive you. holy shit i thought my headset might literally break themselves.

This was an efficient way to level on p servers.
---
Not only was this not the ONLY way to level (just more efficient), it also doesnt work on classic.

---
Have to work the day after. Might try an hour before and see where it gets me.
---
i googled it and couldnt find what it is :/
---
great idea!
---
They're releasing a save progress feature before launch apparently
---
Great songs!  Thanks for sharing.
---
Mage obviously, best utility, always needed for groups because of CC and damage, 3 specs for DPS so you never get bored and you can make cash selling portals.
---
The real problem is all my friends want to go Horde while I'm an Alliance fanboy.
---
I didn't know they added new German servers until now :&gt;
---
I'm assuming you mean to multi-role dungeons? Why lug them around everywhere..? Stick 'em in the bank. You don't even really *need* different gear sets for tanking and DPS while levelling to be honest, just an int/SP set for heals.
---
Using a sock or something as an rest for your wrist is cheap, and can help straighten out that wrists if you can't afford an proper wristpad
---
&gt;As I see it currently it's an overall negative for the community in general but positive for the player as an individual. 
---
Kinda is this point isn't it?     
---
I mean, doesn't it have multiple influences on the game in general which might not be noticeable directly by players?
---
Upvoted for your kindness! :D thanks, appreciate the extra effort!

What's the logic with not casting shadowbolt?
---
i like details personally, it has a very easy to use interface which allows you to easily find out what caused the most damage/healing in a given fight. but most people use recount.
---
I used to run a guild webstation. I'd stream stuff via winamp so other people could listen to it, take requests etc. You should do this too.
---
I'm surprised an 11 year old laptop even works. It'll run WoW but man, start saving for an upgrade, you ~~need~~ should really get one.

---
Ah yes. The mating call of the long haired mulocuous cowardicus sadisticus.
---
They've been restoring the servers and so far the actual older ytmnds are back up, but it seems the main site where you can see comments and site profiles etc is either still down or gone.
---
Slayer for AB.
---
Fuck this brings back memories
---
This is a shit painting. But i like it.
---
It's crazy even all the mediocre helmets you get from level 1-60 look great on an orc female.
---
I will log in 8hs after launch, once the no life try harder are going to bed.
---
The only downside I could see to that is from 6am to 9am other people might be getting ahead of you and then all of them will band together in one group and dedicate the rest of their play solely to ganking you, so you probably should just keep playing and never sleep.  Just my $.02
---
And balls.

It's just not mana efficient. You want to put dot and then use your wand.

Is Demonology that bad in Classic i was going to level as one?
---
every class has its consumables... poisons are nothing compared to major mana potions that mana users need..  Thisttle tea is very cheap and you can get poison reagents by pickpocket
---
I just hate this place, I hated it then and hate it now. I dont know what it is but I cant stand the place!
---
Those hot bars though. Surprised it's not at the point where it's just 3 abilities and an ultimate.
---
Just because one big group of Spaniards is currently choosing to roll on Shaz/Pyrewood doesn't mean there won't be Spanish people on every single EU server. 
---
There's no point in trying to figure out where APES are until launch, they're "confirmed" every server and people still buy it hook, line and sinker.
---
\*mice
---
Tis just a flesh wound!
---
Risky, but the fact is once they are done ganking him they will need to sleep and he can surpass them and then gank in return.
---
I expect them. But it's silly to claim that they will be equally large on all the servers.

I have the same concerns as a father of 2 young girls I don't wanna turn back into the kid I was 14 years ago. I'm Gunna hit it hard the first two weeks and then try to ease it right off. If I or my wife don't think it's working then I guess I'll just quit haha. Wow is a slippery slope for me I have no intention of raiding I just wanna get the dungeon set and do some pvp.

\&gt; People so salty over this new addon don't realize addons like these existed in Vanilla 
---
True, but many/most people who played Vanilla didn't realize that they existed, either.  
---
I think the only addon I used in Vanilla was recount and decursive. Maybe some kind of raid warning addon, not sure.  
---
And auctioneer. But I levelled up completely without ANY addons.
---
That's some bullshit, but I'm pretty sure it's got nothing to do with race...
---
Sadly no more mass skeletons around Nessingwary's camp:(
---
Yeah, but Paladins are healbots or meme specs. Let them chortle all they want.

Is there a way to convert this to an amazon music playlist?

Haha nice one used it from the kovie too😂😂
---
&gt; If you are playing on PvE realm, you are missing like 50% of the game literally while leveling.
---
If you are playing on a PvE realm, you're not that interested in PvP so you're missing like the bad 50% of the game literally while levelling.
---
But thanks for gatekeeping other peoples' preferences, we're not sure where we'd be without you.
---
Hope you’re rolling pve server.
---
EU (Any realm) (Any faction) Looking for guild with early weekend raid schedule, preferably during the day.
---
Lots of experience from both original Vanilla (Up to 4HM in Naxx 40) and up to C'thun on private servers.
---
Not looking to raid hardcore but semi-hardcore or casual.
---
Looking to roll either Shaman or Warrior / Paladin or Warrior. Drop me a PM!
---
Well, there already is. And it works.
---
wpvp is a hoot. I did quite a bit of it on private server. I also did alot of it in Legion/BFA after the warmode update.
---
There was a time during classic where goldsellers would abuse this to spell out URL's to their websites. The skeleton duration was lowered shortly after. Also there were things like Swastika's and other things being spelled out by... 'Creative' people..  
---
This was a widespread problem that made visiting any hub-city annoying (since it also often meant when they were in the process of making such a 'sign' that there were loads of bots running around). I fully agree with the dev's decision to make it this way. Even though I do also agree with your statement as well, having a feeling that the zone is being played in adds to the experience. Especially seeing a lot of skeletons at a difficult mob, knowing that your challenge ahead will be hard. The pro's don't outweigh the cons in my personal opinion.
---
Thats smart.. But launch magic though... XD
---
It was up when they opened the 40-45 beta after the stress test.
---
just looking forward to playing classic again. Played on various private servers a couple years ago but stopped once Blizzard announced classic. Can't wait to get back in.
---

this is literally the playlist for my local "rock and metal" club EVERY\_SINGLE\_WEEK\_FOREVER and i hate it with a burning fiery passion.
---
there is so much more out there OP!  even if you're just going for WoW nostalgia
---
After almost a decade of not playing wow all this is still burned into my mind.
---
Not as much emo as just the genre back then in my opinion but I agree they are on my ipod also haha.
---
I cant leave cause I have my names on shazzrah but I cant get them on the new realms.
---
Good point.
---
Ugh...
---
Still grinding for rank 14.
---
Let's get this straight tho. When original Vanilla released you had mIRC and Quakenet, and you had gamer forums as well where people coordinated and planned out WoW. It's not like this is a new thing, all though it's much more scaled up.   
---
No, you don't need Discord to find friends, enjoy the game and do it like you want to.   
---
I personally feel the common vibe is some sort of a passive-aggressive anger towards those who wants to have guild sorted out, and wants to level quickly. So many "omg all these tryhards are doing X, can I play wow if im not like that?" posts the past weeks.
---
Does details have a threat option? Didn't even know because threat is not an issue since WoD LEL.
---
Probably because Ebola\_Burrito expects to be looking down at both of you from his dreadsteed at 40, given that, yes, they really can "be that expensive in the long run", and a server that is brand-ass new is a server where people can't afford to play the auction house right away.
---
Oh god, why is that run animation cycle so bouncy and obnoxious?!?
---
The John Dear made it hahaha
---
I'll be honest, this is what my memory told me. I will admit I have been wrong about it. Think I still have private server / lightshope server memories mixed with my original classic ones. My bad.
---
Same here friend. See you there!

I mean if Ringo Starr can, why can't you?

Im talking about PvP, this would still be cheating if you got an active Radar for Players.

Dont mind the NPC and Mobs though
---
You need at least windows 7 and a 64 bit system or else you won't even be able to download the newest version of the battle net client.
---
I have a great memory of this. Back in classic I was probably about 11-12 and managed to make my way as a human warlock to stranglethorn. Now I played on an RP server so pvp wasn’t really normal while questing (so that plus my age made me god awful at pvp and the game in general) but I managed to stumble into the arena wondering what it was. I looked down into the middle of the arena and see a ton of skeletons thinking “wow I wonder what happened here.” Of course lil young me jumped in to investigate and proceeded to get murdered by a group of undead rogues. Good times.
---
grow up and just play the game
---
I don't see any Thorium on that. Why will be that rock be harder than others?
---
no idea, doesn't make sense to me.  Firemaw has the best name too.
---
Grandpa&lt;3
---
of course it doesnt, it has everything to do with them refusing to speak english and not troll others. Which is nationality, not race
---
I've got some 9 years on mine and some whos names are now  XXXXX XXXXXX
---
You bet! If I were to offer a class suggestion, Mage would be a good starting one to learn the game, but go with what you think is cool. 
---
Mages do pretty close to optimal damage with 1-3 abilities, but make learning the game a million times easier. I just got my SO into a private server (illegally hosted version) to test what she likes and ran from 1-10 on every class. 
---
That’s what she settled on, and we leveled all the way to 60 with it. Now she’s joining me for classic launch 👍
---
Literally no-one in this thread has claimed that.
---
Nope but either way they wouldn't be doing much playing by the sounds of it
---
That's rough. I obviously don't know your financial situation, but the Logitech M570 dropped to $29 on amazon and has helped me tremendously for my mouse arm (the keyboard arm is the worst offender for me though). Using a ball mouse takes a bit of getting used to (and doesn't really work for fast-paced games), but for non-arena wow it is more than ok for me at least. If you regularly clean the trackball sensors it can last for years too. I've upgraded to the MX Ergo now since I use it for work as well, but the M570 has been great for at least 5 years.
---
even after almost 400 coments darude - sandstorm is missing? how could that happen?!
---
I have a test to see how good these are.
---
If they include Numb by Linking Park then they have it right. This is a good list!
---
The name is nothing special.. Why would you be shocked it wasn't taken?
---
It was the same in the private server world. People are deathly afraid of anything less than like 4000 pop server. Like people would rather play on a 10,000 pop server than a 3000 pop one because the 3000 pop one is "dying"
---
I played on a few servers that got like 1000 pop at peak times, and it was fine. You still did dungeons, raids and all of that.
---
Even with other games people are obsessed with the term "dead game" or whatever. Never bothered me. Who cares if 200 or 20,000 people are playing a game? You can't possibly know them all anyways.
---
Do ibwant to spend all that money on them? Your repair bill is a risk im willing to take *sits down to drink*
---
I would have done it
---
OK, thank you for your feedback, I thought about it, and I think it’s nice to play a class not “everyone” can easily be good at, so will definitely go for hunter and try to get better than the average
---
&gt;it also doesnt work on classic.
---
Yes it does.
---
Only do it if you look forward to carpal tunnel syndrome.
---
Completely agree, I'm kneejerking away from it and dropping the population of Horde. I guess it's like rats leaving a sinking ship haha! Honestly I'm not sure how to help fix the problem so it's easier to just move if I can get the names!
---
Thanks lol
---
Energy Drinks? Ew, no thanks.

---
new players will use this and old players forced to follow in suite i recon.
---
How do you create something like this? How do you have this blueprint? It's amazing!!
---
No GF sculpin ! :(
---
I think it's highly unlikely that that will happen. Hell, on mature servers (where most competent people can't be bothered to make wands and list them on the auction house), GREATER magic wands sell for like 40 silver. 
---
A lesser wand, requiring vastly less skill and one third the mats, with a bunch of people who also want to make a quick buck and some of whom almost certainly have 10 enchanting skill? More like 15 silver is about what I would expect, or possibly significantly less (but it vendors for 5s and change, so don't expect it to be MUCH below 15s). 
---
As for what you can make for it, I honestly don't know. Picking up engineering/mining killing humanoids for linen cloth, and crafting rough dynamite and vendoring it is what I would personally be tempted to do, but it will depend quite a bit on how contested the mining nodes are. You have to actually get rough stone to do this. 
---
But 15 silver is less than 3 stacks of rough stone, 25 linen cloth, and a few minutes of crafting for an engineer, and then getting your greater magic wand should be similarly easy. Then you can either keep engineering, or just abandon it to take your real profession as soon as you are on track for the greater magic wand.  
---
I don't actually feel that skinning is good for your first wand. It's very hard on bag space and mining is actually similar money for less inventory space (23 copper for a rough stone is a lot better than 15 copper for a light leather and 7 for ruined leather scraps). 
---
 Overall, engineering is almost perfectly suited to exactly this... assuming that dynamic respawns on copper nodes mean you can actually mine some of them.
---
Hamstring kiting works on retail. You just have to do it a little bit different
---
Scars was amazing, one of the few albums I still own on CD.
---

---
Yes, you can totally tank 5 mans in Cat gear. You could even tank 5 mans in (non-cloth) healing gear as long as you’re specced deep into Feral, Bears are just this good for a dungeon environment (they’re the best dungeon tanks in Vanilla). Bear specific gear is necessary for raids, not 5 mans.
---
It was still being used in WotLK too.
---
Good retort! Now gimmie your lifes most dedicated work for free or you're a bad guy.
---
I'm...interested in twinking in Classic, yeah...  
---
The phrasing of "come Classic **release**" makes me remember that Warsong Gulch isn't even a thing until Phase 3 or something like that, so...you can probably afford to focus on your main, begin leveling/gearing a twink in Phase 2, and maybe go to a level 18-19 zone to bait players into attacking you for some pre-WSG honor if you want a head start (just be careful of EXP).
---
Well, the bad news is, there's a *lot* to take in and learn.
---
The good news is, you can take your time *and,* besides your SO, you will have hundreds of thousands of people to ask if you ever get lost :)
---
Best of luck!
---
Well you know in the past rouges have ganged fully geared classes. Nude and only daggers
---
Haha I haven't really touched wow since cata. After the talent trees got removed and my paladin got combo points I was like alright I'm done. Good on you for knowing when to call it but!
---
not the 40-60 and im sure the other will be taken down some point
---
What a beautiful story
---
Back in my day (vanilla) alliance was overwhelmingly more popular on all servers, including all but a few exception PvP servers.
---
Cry more.
---
Except that's wrong.
---
1. Since every area will be overcrowded at start, there is no chance to be able to aoe efficiently... so better spec for single target
---
2. Again, since the areas will be heavy crowded, gathering professions will only slow you down.. it will be hard to keep them up to your level.. at least not before you get your mount at 40. I would recommend Tailoring/Skinning. Enchanting is very costly and if you just want it for disenchant, you can have a level 5 alt for this. You Can disenchant all items even with skill 1. Also some recipes in tailoring need leather too, especially bags that will be your No1 gold making at start.
---
3. For enchanting more in depth. There is always 1 enchanter in a guild that gets all recipes. the good enchant recipes are very rare and every guild has 1 enchanter to get them and sell the rest. If you are casual, you wont make any money from enchanting nor you will have the best recipes ever. You will most likely pay others to enchant your gear with the rare enchants. But, if you play a stealth character, it may be profitable to run dungeons (stealth to boss) and disenchant blue drops... (still though, I dont think it really worth it... skinning is good for tailoring. Runecloth bags need rugged leather..)
---
To all the healers that come from retail and plan to heal in classic: Mana is a ressource. Use it wisely. Nobody wants to watch you waste your mana and then drink for 30seconds while flaming the group
---
I honestly don't know how people even keep track any more. The biggest thing stopping me from coming back (I last played seriously in Wrath) is just how much crap has been added and how much you have to go and figure out. Pass.
---
Monday's gonna be fun when no one can get online
---
logitech mx310?
---
What spec do you plan on playing? For Shadow I'd say go Troll for World PvP and UD for Disc or Holy. Can't heal if you're CCed and Shadowguard and Hex of Weakness are great for blackout procs and Shadowguard gives you solid extra dmg against melee classes.
---
OCE here so probably wont have queues because we can barely fill 2 servers but we have 8 on retail
---
That would make your 6slotbags more expensive than the bags from the vendor, which were 5 oder 6 silver.
---
Bagprice should be between 2s (vendorprice) and 5 or 6 silver.
---
Thanks dad love you 2
---
You’re the one who seems to think it’s fine,even though you were the victim. 
---
I’m just pointing out how you’re wrong.

not that kind of orc.

Same. And I even was the type of guy to have old gear sets lying around.
---
Your friends are going to have a boring time, terrible decision.
---
&gt; Solves almost every single problem in WoW.
---
Other than the insane amount of work to do that, as well as continually splitting your population which no game ever wants to do..?
---
I think you only do above level 10.
---
Please don't spread misinformation. They stated anything above Medium will have a que.
---
" Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full. "

they should remake the original but with them playing on horde side this time.
---
Anyone who was old enough to actually play wow at vanilla is also old enough to have a stack of past games and consoles laying around. We've all pulled out the old PS2 and N64s we have stashed away, plugged them in... and promptly forgot about them as they failed to live up to our memories or keep our attention. It's totally natural.
---
I have a strong feeling these posters refusing to accept that a "nostalgia affect" exists are just young and haven't experienced it themselves. And of course there's always going to be that vocal minority who yell and scream that they're still playing *pod racer* or someshit and want everyone to know it.

Wow, wow

None before level 10, then it slowly ramps up to the full 10 minutes.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
I can't decide whether I should play:
---
Druid: I thought I had my mind set on druid, what appealed to me was flag carrying, not dieing and healing. But since bgs wont be until a later phase, and them not being the best/most entertaining healers (or so I've heard) I'm thinking of picking another class. I don't really care for tanking. My friends also prefer horde and I don't want to play tauren. I've played rogue before and feral dps doesnt appeal to me.
---
Priest: Good at healing and can also do damage. My concern is that I wont be able to quickly switch between the two roles in pvp and pve. I've also never played priest and don't know how fun it would be to go healer.
---
Warlock: I really like the concept of dots and the tankier style. I don't really care about the pet. The only negative is that they can't heal others.
---
Mage: The only draw back is that they are squishy and can't heal. I like that they have a lot of cc. I play forst mage in cataclysm and I ernjoyed it a lot.
---
I'll mostly be playing bgs but also some raids. I will level in group, (probably) horde.
---
Don't forget [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zHNfzXSqLQ) esp. if your making a PVP movie
---
I have installed wow on my work pc and am by myself all of next week with little to no work on so I know what I'll be doing 😎
---
Hahahahahhahahahahahhahah that running animation. Who the fuck greenlit that at blizzard.
---
I'm glad you specified to look for classic, because I know that's what his sights will be on for a looong time. He is seriously so excited for it which is another big motivator for me to learn. I actually think learning/ remembering what keys and sequences do what will be my biggest challenge so that is good advice. Thank you again!!

As of writing this,  according to the survey we have on this sub the best interest in PvP never goes higher than than 46.15%. That's the case for only two servers, both PvP, one of which (Venoxis DE) is still at low while the other is at high. The overall primary interest in PvP never goes higher than 40% for any other PvP server. The highest interest in PvP on the PvE servers comes from Razorfen DE, which is just as new as Venoxis, at 13.16%. Every other PvE server is below 6% primary interest in PvP.
---
You can hardly call it 50% of the game if most PvP content isn't even implemented yet. In addition, not even 50% of the population on (any) PvP servers has a primary interest in PvP. Theres also a respectable amount of players who only play PvP because of the rewards, just as there are those who only play PvE for it.
---
Meanwhile there are a fuckton more replies from people on PvP servers in the survey, so it skews everything. PvP players are also far more active here than PvE players, yet on EU and NA most servers, PVE and PVP are at equal population.
---
And what kind of name is “tips out” anyway? So fucking annoying when he calls himself “tips out baby!”
---
its wishful thinking: blizzard want classic to be a flash in a pan so they can get back to retail and silence any complaints with "you think you do but you dont".
---
Ok, now try it again without the condecending tone
---
The netherwing dragon was realy cool back then. It took me quite some time to get it, back then this felt like a huge achievement as it was realy rare.
---
Get new friends.  You'll make plenty in game on a pvp server.
---
I second that. Add troggs to the list!
---
Wtf is this a copy paste or did you actually..??
---
It's in Classic. It was added in patch 1.11 alongside Naxxramas, as part of the LHC overhaul.
---
Same. Used this for a good ten years. Served me well.
---
**this is terribly brilliant and i hope you make a lot more**
---
no that isn't really worth considering when it doesn't effect combat for pve or pvp
---
My Logitech Ultra x keyboard ensured reduced keyboard movement, and my routine of doing pushups or other exercises to burn off energy between wipes really kept my wrists alive. I think I did over a 100 pushups during a nefarian progression raid. Also helps reduce nerves and keep you calm for the actual raiding!
---
In Ulduar I had a macro to roll 1-10 and do a listed exercise during breaks. Some did it, some didn't - but it's a great micro break :)
---
Ikr. Douche 100%
---
Honestly, no. If you are worried about it, just find a friend and start sharing aggro on mobs to build rage, and standing next to each other to dump rage while stationary.
---
It is the premier way to solo level, because leaving like 30% plus damage mitigation for 10 rage is a big loss. But as soon as you have to worry about multiple people and multiple mobs all being in range of each other at the exact right time so cleave actually connects on what it's supposed to? It stops mattering nearly so much.
---
Honestly? Me too. It sucks but everyone is doing it.

I'm sorry my dude, but better you hear it now rather than after you grind the rep
---
Indeed, I remember spending months getting all blues before I could *begin* to work on epics. It took me a year to get full Shadowcraft, running UBRS an absurdly large number of times per week.
---
There is a reason why multiple skeletons by one players is cool. It leaves kind of a brief history of what went down recently. If you bloody battles in north, south and east, all locations will have skellies of those who died. With just one skelly, you will only see the last one, and all those will be gone when those players die at the next location. There will be much less skellies, and the history will be VERY brief.
---
Hawk is worth it, if you're sitting in cheetah during combat you're gonna lose out on a lot of DPS.
---
I'm going to log in, look at the que longingly, and then cry because I have to pack for dragon con. I definitely forgot about the release date when I planned my trip. The wait is going to make me cry ;_;

Big oof my man. Yeah I have wed-fri off but had to come in Tues (morning after UK release) due to contractors having to have someone on site. Means I can sit in my office and play while they work!

Baine is pretty famous.

Its subjective. The name is special to him and as Baine is the current tauren leader I xan imagine many tauren players will be fond of it.

Excellent advice (:  I do love exploring so if that's a component I will probably love it
---
thanks for worrying about me &lt;3
---
mods gonna have to work overtime. Honestly just look at how people reacting in the first stress test thread when things didnt work for a few hours
---
There are a lot of players who quit wow before the launch of tbc after finding out that their gear would become obsolete. The longer you keep your gear, the more it is worth to you. Even though it is a greeny. 
---
Currently retail is all about being the first to clear something. Gear means nothing and is just a placeholder with stats. It makes the game competitive instead of being fun. Who cares that hardcore raiders get a world first kill? You are the one that you should care about.
---
I think they look better as long as they're not fighting. 
---
Onehanded/Dual wield/Two-Handed all look better on Male IMO
---
you can but prot can do it better and easier. Best find a friend to level with and level as prot :P you will benefit from him on questing, he will benefit from you for fast dungeon groups..
---
They did say it was the hardest part.
---
I guess he could have edited the comment but that's not all what he wrote. Even though I think it's almost easier to do it on the classic client.
---
Oh I feel ya bro... :(
---
Yeah the loot is amazing for low levels but it is a long long run to it and having to go through the bottleneck at the  hilsbrad border can be tough with horde
---
yeah, not sure what the other replier is talkin bout... I've levelled many hunters and I have no idea why you would be using cheetah in combat unless you need to kite.
---
* Destro sucks at leveling
---
* The two most common raid and dungeon specs have more points in Affliction and Demonology respectively
---
* Destruction is actually the spec good players prefer while pvping
---
Only people who have dedicated guilds are probably attached to a realm. Everyone else is probably gonna filter down till every realm is full
---
why are you in cheetah during combat (unless you're kiting)?
---
I was totally thinking that the other day. Winamp was my shit back then.
---
Druids scale very well with gear as the game progresses, the biggest issue is simply that the gear itself for Feral/Balance is scarce. As for gearing, Druids are the class who gears the fastest in the whole game in raids as for their tier sets, especially Horde side . You should also note that rogues need good weapons for their DPS, whereas weapons aren’t anywhere as important for Druids, no matter the spec, and weapons also have a lot of competition.
---
There are over twice more spots for rogues in raids in general though. However, it’s still easier to get gear as Druid, because rogues compete against this many other rogues. The fact rogues gear more slowly in PvE means they’re also bound to do the same raids more often (outside of what a guild would already normally demand from them) to get all the loot they need. Also, Druids have less pressure on them than rogues in raids, as they’re expected to underperform comparatively to other healers anyway.
---
I played warrior and really enjoyed it. It's not fast or easy, but I enjoyed it. Also being able to tank was HUGE. I think it won't be as big of a deal this time because more people seem to be planning on playing warrior, but still not a bad option to have. 
---
If you have a consistent group to play with, I would highly recommend warrior. It is a good time and your friends will enjoy having you around! 
---
I am actually playing warlock as my main but if new friends start and I wanna fuck around with them, I will be making a warrior for sure!

There is no way they're doing this, from the prestige of having it from vanilla and the amount of gold people have spent on it @ BMAH.
---
If they were to just be availible from a vendor, all of that prestige is lost instantly.
---
Found the video but what’s the story?
---
Certainly makes it easier but never say never. Still possible to react too quickly, or spend so long staring at where their cast bar should be that you lose focus elsewhere.

Either way, install it and don't worry.

Yes, I'm playing a PvE server but will be levelling whilst flagged

At least one 24hr-session shouldn't be a problem. I plan on sleeping 6hrs/day until I'm 60, but I'm not sure yet when I start sleeping. I'll try to play at least 30hrs before I go to sleep.
---
Every clip of gameplay brought me back. I could tell exactly where they were in each part, down to which bend in the road and what quest they were on. I realized that I know every inch of Azeroth in a way I don't even know my own hometown. When they said classic is a chance to go home, it really hit me in the feels.
---
I don't think an expansion can fix retail. too many changes that broke down the pillars wow was build on. they should consider a reset. a completely new game. take the old vanilla formula and the new engine/looks. if classic is successful enough they might go for something like this.

Mark Kern is a piece of shit snake oil salesmen and no matter what this sub says it wont change the reality of what he is.

I feel like people have forgotten what a pain in the ass it could be to get 40 people together and organised for a certain time. There will be plenty of guilds recruiting.
---
The OCE Classic disc took a census. The results are currently sitting at about **52.5% horde / 47.5% Alliance*.
---
This is a pretty good spread considering the more hardcore players are typically horde (this is an opinion I see thrown around a lot).
---
Hopefully this will tilt it toward thst sweet 50/50 mark come launch!
---
I don´t like the business model. I would prefer paying 20 dollars for a login, and pay that extra in case updates come. 
---
Heck i owuld even pay more, as long as it was a single payment. 
---
But no matter what i will purchase this, because i love his guide and he put in the work which i am thankful for.
---
It’s a leveling guide not a corvette there’s no additional features.
---
What does you being Spanish have to do with Russian pvp servers?
---
Similarly, the Horde only had one AH (in Orgrimmar) until patch 1.9 where all cities got AHs.
---
&gt; I’ll be going pve again as I want to avoid all the kids that will log in just to grief farming areas on pvp servers.
---
Adults who are married, have ajob, family and kids also enjoy ganking and pvping, it's just one of the play styles that the game provides players, calling them kids make you look like a carebear tbh.
---
I still have no idea what the title is supposed to mean
---
I had this mouse. It was perfect.
---
Says 2 dwarves levelling in Westfall...
---
Foobar2000 or bust
---
&gt; I have ZERO motivation to raid in Classic but it's insanely nostalgic. 
---
Same here. We cleared some stuff ahead of anyone else on our (German RP) server or were at least close second to a very skilled Alliance raid group who had much more players availabe through to the Alliance heavy server population.
---
It was a constant grind and was only manageable because of the time and effort we invested. 
---
It was fun while it lasted, but I will definitely not repeat it.
---
Just make sure you visit /r/HydroHomies every now and again for effective reminders.
---
Since when does the pet do most of the dps?
---
Logitech MX 518 or nothing
---
I feel like there's a distinct difference between having an advantage in pve to having an advantage in PvP.
---
Imagine if you could have an add-on that told you were all enemy players were on the map in a BG.  Firstly, using that add-on removes part of the tactical play from the game, and secondly, anyone who doesn't use it is at a considerable disadvantage.
---
As I said earlier, it's the equivalent to having aim support addons in an fps
---
I still use Winamp on a daily basis
---
No!!  You run back and use that time to think about what you did that got us all killed!
---
Sounds like you legit got catfished hahaha
---
It's not stopped that by the way, even people that play Counter-strike play with fake female profiles. It's so peculiar.
---
He said it helped him buy a BMW and the deposit for his house (?).. That was over 10 years ago. He talked about it on the first countdown to classic episode he featured
---
Well so is voice communication then? And debuff add ons, swing timers etc,  Bkizz allowed add ons to cater for all styles and tastes.
---
Glad I’m not the only one... lol :( what does your feeling say?
---
Right!  I’m not even expecting to be playing that much for the first week so I didn’t bother taking time off. But when I do play im going to use my phone to remote connect to my PC and queue myself up hours before I get off work so by the time I get home it shouldn’t be that long of a wait.
---
&gt; complain that Blizzard is not rolling out new servers
---
Thing is I'd rather just deal with queues and/or play something else for a few days than they roll out servers that later have a poor population. The game will still be there in a week. And the queues will die off quick enough once everyone isn't wanting to play and at the same time.
---

Hows warcry? Me and my mates play mordheim and necromunda.
---
See my challenge is gonna be tricking my partner into thinking I've come to bed, and if I can acquire a 6'2 mannequin and a tape recorder I may just pull it off. Record a fart mixtape and put it on loop, slide the mannequin in next to her with one of his hands on a boob....she won't know the difference!
---
This triggered my PTSD.

Anyone from retail who does high M+ keys knows this.

You're doing all the whining for them.

Looks like barrens

That's why I have that helmet in my bedroom.
---
lol i like how this has only 70% likes. I imagine the 30% being like fuck you I will destroy my physical and mental health for this game
---
I could totally get behind that. I just couldn't care less for people judging you for not having x amount of achievement points
---
wailing caverns GOAT dungeon
---
I dunno, weren't druids rocking 1m hp in late tbc? Considering tanks are hitting what, 10k in Classic, that seems a bit extreme.
---
What! That was mostly in pvp!
---
For Nightwish, definitely Wishmaster.
---
you never know, it could be a retail pandaren player.
---
Yeah. I think it's a mistake for it to be a subscription model...
---
If he asked me for $20 or $30 once, I'd be happy to shell out... but the guide doesn't generate more value over time... It'll be honed, no doubt, but not at a rate that is going to be worth $5 a month.
---
I think he's concerned about generating some recurring income so he can keep working on WoW full-time, but tbh 5000 sales (and I'm low-balling here) @ $30 is $150,000. I don't know about your lifestyle, but that'd do me for a while.
---
Thats my trigger!
---
Edit: to have bad rng, not getting fucked by thunderfury

oh shit. gotta redownload my kazaa

Anyone can give me an update on the population on Firemaw? I am afraid if I'll play on Firemaw it might up into a dead server within a few months.

Have played priest since BC, quit after hitting 110 in Legion. Was sure fire set to play priest in Classic. Now I'm having a stroke trying to decide between lock and priest.
---
Voice comm isn't an add-on.
---
Debuff add-ons only work with your own debuffs. They don't tell you how long the enemy has a buff for.
---
Same for swing timers.
---
If a debuff add-on told us how long enemy buffs last, it would give you a clear advantage over healers. Especially Paladins.
---
Only the coolest 12 year olds in my school listener to Linkin Park
---
Later on down the line, you'll be feared and a force to be reckoned with if you roll Shadow priest or Lock.
---
Come join my guild and you can be Pepper Jack's best ho'.
---
I'm in the same boat as you but once people are playing the game the way they want to then more power to 'em
---
Barrens chat in mountain form
---
Yes. Exactly.
---
Yes, it was a large gap and afterwards it was more of a crack. I remember when the changed happened and loving it, because so many people would fuck it up and ruin a run.
---
This changes everything..
---
What I have taken from OP and his/her responses. You cannot spell to save your life, and you want to skip raids because it seems hard, then you watched videos that it is not a good raid. The most millenial shit I have seen on this subreddit yet. Makes me wonder how some get through life like this, good lord cowboy the fuck up.
---
Hmm, but my question is how strong are those classes in world pvp and duels?
---
The first half of naxx is much easier than the second half of aq40, afaik the entire spider wing is easier than even the first few aq40 bosses. Once your guild has bwl cleared and on farm they should be moving into aq40 and naxx simultaenously. You could absolutely skip aq40 entirely as well but it wouldnt make much sense because a lot of bis gear drops from aq40. Some bis items even drop in bwl or mc already for some specs, you cant fully gear out an alt just from naxx alone.
---
I never took enough screenshots, and the few I had somehow got lost somewhere over the years. This time I'm definitely keeping an album, no matter how silly and insignificant the pics might be after a while!
---
Well dude don't use them then! Problem solved that's like people moaning about Questie.
---
&gt; How do Blizzard know how many people are waiting for launch day to subscribe?
---
Something as simple as unique hits (over the past 1-3 months) for the official WoW Classic forums or information pages should give them an idea.  There can't be that many people who haven't clicked through to a Blizzard owned page who are planning on joining the release.  It's not going to be perfect but given how many other big releases they've had that should give them a solid indicator on the relative interest in the game.
---
Do you remember how you would have to install add-ons back then?  It wasn't simple at all.
---
RemindMe! 4 days
---
this. im sick of seeing all the weird gimmicky crap in retail... been craving clean/minimal WoW for years.
---
You can mine the nodes at the bottom and get pee ore.
---
Agreed. Arms and prot? Dress up in plate all the way while wielding your huge two handed axe or your sword and board.
---
dual wielding weapons with fury? Class identity wise I’d think you want to match that with light gear, agile while still offering protection to survive a few blows. Leather and mail all the way
---
Playing till you feel drunk is the only way to play classic
---
Boomer? Is this a joke I’m too Generation Y to understand.
---
Yes, download, unzip, copy into interface folder in the game files, or have the curse client to do it for you.
---
Nicely done! Thanks

They literally said in this post that youre replying on that low severs now already exceed vanilla pop cap. So I don't know why you're comparing it to retail.

Lucky you

r/mildlypenis
---
Are you telling that sometime in the future it will be only three days left? Hype!!
---
I hope so. My husband and I aren't subbing until Sunday or Monday. We have no desire to sit in queues or play on overcrowded servers where we can't get anything done regardless of phasing/sharding/whatever it's called.
---
Same, ZT is still at Medium. Which is perfect. Might go to high at release. But we'll see about that.
---
that dude is only about business
---
As of now i think rogue
---
When i eventually hit 60 i’d want to raid and dungeon more than pvp but i’d still like to dabble in some sort of pvp
---
as i have read rogues are good in wpvp for their stealth but don’t offer too much in bgs and that is fine with me as i probably won’t be doing much organized battlegrounds,maybe a few but i’d totally be interested in wpvp,infiltrating enemy cities,trolling.Also rogues have a rotation of 3-4 abilities which is quite nice!
---
Mage on the other hand is great at organized bgs and all but has an uninteresting rotation in raids *casts frostbolt* what makes mage stand out is gold farm/utility which is quite something but i don’t think that mage utility vs rogue shenanigans will entice me enough to stick with a mage
---
rogue will be loot challanged by almost everyone tho while mages won’t be as much 
---
Rogue also relies on having reagants for abilities and you would have to refill them n all but i think that i would get more pleasure out of refilling a reagant rather than casting water for someone
---
i’d like to hear your opinions about these classes
---
If only trolls had an option to wear boots...
---
Kinda wish it stayed like this, make forsaken super strong against most things but excessively vulnerable to priests and paladin.
---
Just sit her down in character select, and let her pick a class. Maybe describe some of them or just let her read the descriptions on her own. Don't helicopter her, don't tell her what to do, or where to go. Perhaps state that the game is experienced through quests so she understands that that's what she should be doing but if she wants to just roam around that's fine. Answer questions but try to avoid commands and shit. Let her discover the magic on her own and if she likes it she likes it.
---
or human wins due to automatically getting the opener for free with perception

Preach it brother!

Don’t disrespect stormwind like that homie
---
Locking character creation is a bad way to go. I have a active subscription since I play retail, so I reserved names on lucifron and took vacation days for the release. But I got at least 2 of my friends w/o active subscription who I want to play with. They got no vacation days left for this year. If blizzard would lock character creation on servers I would have to wait till they get off work and we could figure out on which server we all can roll.
---
been watching got to pass the time?
---
And my axe!
---
&gt;Not cranking up in-game music to 100%
---
Most of you didn't even experience the true horror of murlocs. 
---
See, some graphic cards (like mine) had a bug that caused murlocs - and only murlocs! - to shoot out beams of light from their model, making the whole screen light up like a fucking techno party, and making you unable to see anything, while the murgle-murgle got closer, and you were finally met with the sweet embrace of death. 
---
Murlocs were terrifying.
---
There is always the approach Shorty from scary movies used...
---
Kargoz states that the order was dependent on the server. Classic doesn’t have the insane clearcast server proc where this guide is counting on.
---
So this is wrong. As kargoz stated on such servers you start of in frost.
---
Yet it still has a healthy population equivalent to a high pop server back in the day. Within hours, and before it even launches.
---
&gt; In my experience STV had occasional/frequent world PvP and eventhough it was known as one of the most dangerous zones in the game, it wasn't anywhere as bad as all the posts make it out to have been.
---
It seems to be a pirate server meme, and they had massively un-Blizzlike populations. Cram 15000 people into a space meant for 3000 and of course places like Hillsbrad and STV will turn into war zones.
---
With Blizzlike populations it should be much less of a drama.
---
why even bother binding backwards walking
---
There's an addon that auto takes screen shots everytime you level. Memorium, or something like that. I would link it but I can't find the addon link myself, lol.
---
I plan on trading cloth and my tanking services as a trade ;)
---
Are you fucking high? Our server names are INCREDIBLE
---
I wanted to mention the last part but then I thought to myself: This must be a troll, no one would compare an addon that shows you the castbar to a tool that basically turns you into a god in an FPS game.
---
I’ve decided to go pala if we go alli and sham if we go horde.
---
Btw can you download addons to classic through the twitch client yet? Or do i need to get them from elsewhere?
---
i Remember hunting some murlocs during wotlk while questing. Could only kill like 1 at the time, but pulling aggro on others was so easy. damn i used to hate that sound.
---
I finally convinced wife to give WoW a try.  As a non-gamer she was settling in nicely questing around Goldshire.   Then it happened, the Murlocs.  She absolutely hated their sounds and how often they killed her back in TBC expansion.  That poor priest around level 8 never moved again, they had ended her WoW career.
---
Would be nice to see Zandalari tribe related to Zul'gurub with all the cool models.
---
I uh... dont know how to set my own thingy to class and faction... how do it? :)
---
yeah unfortunately people are children and even the smallest of loot and raid spot arguments get blown out of proportion a lot. So many people don't understand that if you keep showing up you'll get your loot, or spot, or whatever it is, unless the guild is really draconian.
---
Hmm.. Doing  aq40 and naxx simultaenously sounds nice. That way I could enjoy Naxxramas theme and doing same time AQ which I belive at this moment I' dont enjoy so much, because the bug theme and its visual.
---
I dunno if I agree with that. Mage only requires pressing frostbolt, polymorph, and blizzard to be effective/mana efficient until BRD where all you have to do is add arcane explosion into the mix. 
---
Healing requires a lot more focus and understanding on mana consumption, down ranking, not overhealing etc. (plus my wife found it boring as shit) 
---
Could try both and see which ya like 👍
---
help me pick a class pls.
---
i want to be a snowflake. I kind of want to tank but realistically I probably don't have enough time to put in to the game to maintank or anything. I am mostly interested in WPvP . I want to be a snowflake . i like druid hunter warrior - im just a bit concerned about druids. about the amount of gearing they take. same with warriors. but then hunters , i like them alot, but they cant tank. i like to be helpful thats my favourite, and being a snowflake. help
---
You’re surprisingly chatty for being so dense. Thanks for your input, have a good one.
---
Great answer, thanks! Would you have any tip for farming as Druid+Warlock?
---
Humans have 5% increased willpower though, which benefits priests a LOT through talents: 15% continued manaregen while casting and 25% their total willpower as additional +spelldamage/heal.
---
not sure, i dont think that key would be comfortable for anything else and since its rarely used i just kept it
---
I was going to say how the fuck are they doing anything without Wayne but I guess they're working with things he recorded before passing.
---
Phew I thought I was the only one who noticed that!
---
He is worth it!  We balance each other out and embrace each other's many differences.
---
He doesn't complain about my weird true crime podcasts I constantly have on and I love waking up to him into his fantasy/ role-playing games. I enjoy being outside and he joins me out there at some point everyday, whether we are exploring or just throwing a frisbee for a few. I am excited to be a part of his computer world more than just supporting from the sidelines and asking dumb questions :\]
---
Slippery slope is a fallacious argument - the loot change is fine and therefore it is fine.  If a future change is proposed that is not fine, then that one is not fine, but has no bearing on the suitability of this specific perfectly fine change.
---
I'm a lady who didn't use my sex to my advantage...... but now I got a second chance!
---
Small bags... storing literally everything in your limited containers (reagents, mounts). Walking everywhere because I'm broke and the flight master is trying to rip me off xD Being broke all the time was a way of life, you learn that spell ranks are overrated when you are trying to save for your first mount, haha.
---
To be fair, those medium servers will fill up really quick once people that don't care about names sub
---
people reserving 3 names are idiots. i reserved the same name on 3 servers to make sure i will be able to play
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with what I said in how to get the data to judge interest.  Even though their pre-release strategy would indicate they don't have this data and that they're retarded I think it's a lot more complex an issue whether it's an interesting marketing strategy, internal politics or ulterior motives.
---
Paladins T3 looks like a bit of a letdown from T2 though. Every other T3 looks great.
---
Tauren racial suck? You are crazy.
---
This is totally not the case.
---
Oh that’s neat! Do you have to enter this each time or only once?
---
&gt;If they remember that for the next WoW expansion, it might actually turn out good.  
---
Legion was good, I'll defend that to the grave.
---
&gt; which was not available in vanilla 
---
Sure it was. Look at vQueue, which works on 1.12 clients.
---
I find it really odd how much backlash there was against players' concerns about the skeleton changes, which will slightly affect the world experience, meanwhile people are outraged by a harmless addon that you don't have to use.
---
I see lots of tips here so dont really have anything to add other than that its heartwarming to see you doing this. Its a great game and I hope you and your S.O have lots of fun together!
---
The data for unique hits wouldn't be reliable at all. To know it was a unique hit per device they would have to track some kind of a device id which eu customers have to give their consent explicitly. Other than that, if you check the website from work, home and mobile you would probably register as 3 different users.
---
Unfortunately no, just making crappy memes whilst trying to work. That's a solid idea for the weekend though 👌🏼
---
Why not follow through with soundproofing, and try keep it down a tiny bit?
---
I'm Swedish and I intend to play on Shazzrah.
---
At this point I'd rather play with spaniards than the dumpster fire that is the "nordic coalition"
---
It's actually what he looks like.
---
I could see you being able to do the DME farm too perhaps, last boss hits kinda hard but something like using void walker into a well timed sacrifice would do.
---
I'll have 2-3 weeks to only play wow.  
---
Eventually I want to end up playing a Warrior, but I also want to be a part of the race to 60 (not server first or anything, i just want to do it quick). 
---
It feels like picking warrior at launch eliminates me from using the advantage of having lots of time. I fear I will get stuck, fall behind and won't be able to get ahead of the curve. So right now it looks like I'm going mage and rerolling Warr later on.
---
Any thoughts on my reasoning?
---
&gt; It literally isn't though?
---
That is just flat out wrong.
---
If you start at 9, good for you. Don't assume that just because you do something, that defines what is normal for everyone. I can assure you, getting up at 6 is perfectly normal. A lot of businesses just can't wait until 8 or 9 to begin daily operations.
---
Exactly, we all foresaw this. But now is it our fault for not moving and not blizzards for providing more than 2 EU English PVP servers at the start.
---
We need a pic of Thex standing on top of it.
---
Why would anyone create seven Soul Stones?
---
So you're saying because add ons weren't readily available, because a community site hadn't yet been set up to easily and safely distribute them wasn't there from day one they shouldn't be used? By your logic we also shouldn't read up guides we find on places like mmo champion or icy veins to better how we play because that's not how most people played back then.
---
You don't really have the means of escape that you do in retail.  Even a frost mage will find that the rogue's 4-6 interrupts are a bit much for you to avoid.
---
What about this: talk to the guy. Tell him youre planing it, buy him earplugs. He sounds like a douche, but kill it(him) with kindness
---
Voice comm you had to use an entirely different software program.! So if some add ons are cheating then that definitely should be according to your logic!
---
Wrong about swing timers they do work for enemy swings.
---
And tanks use to use debuff add ons for tank swapping so depends where your line is?
---
Half of the whining on this post could be circumvented by blizzard pointing out that they intentionally launched with too few servers to prevent dead servers when all the tourists leave, I don't know how people still don't understand this.
---
This is such an awesome answer. Thank you.
---
Could I ask how would you rate them from best to worse *in your opinion*?
---
And even if it does, dont worry you get to run the same instance again next tier to hunt for the same titanforge weee.
---
Druid is your answer, ultimate snowflake, tanks well with minimal gearing, great in WPvP
---
Yes we can. I'm particularly salty because they're barring me from having a gnome mage called Gnomedalf.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write all this! It was very interesting to read!
---
Preeeeetty sure retail is "Is the item level higher? Alright it's better."  
---
Classic is "What is this upgrading? Am I losing valuable stats? Is this directly better or do I need another upgrade to cover what I'm losing to MAKE this a true upgrade?"  
---
Hit, Crit, Stam, Attack Power, Resistances; they all make a difference and it's important to understand what you need vs what looks very good right now.
---
Its the inside of RileyReid
---
Most of this list is good but missing the harder stuff. This made me download some greatest hits albums to put on my phone though!
---
Wont happen
---
Thank god my guild moved to firemaw, I honestly don't understand why anyone would ever want to play on one of these colossal megaservers.
---
Or ask him to join you in your adventure maybe he is just jealous of you all having fun.
---
Don't throw the party. You're absolutely going to get complained about for two days straight, the landlord's going to get involved and it's going to ruin your whole experience.
---
Just play together at your houses and chat over Discord, then meet up for drinks later so you can all talk about it over some beers. It's not worth ruining your launch experience just to be in the same room as other people when you're gonna be staring at a screen 90% of the time anyway.
---
Go knock on his door and let him know your plans - be mature about it., who knows - he might have similar plans? 
---
Do not do the dodgey with this bloke, your mate has to live next door to him. 
---
Remember that launch is during the week and old mate will probably have work the next day so don’t be total douchebags. 
---
Enjoy launch lads - see you in there.
---
Yeah. I realise now that the question was misplaced.  I'm remembering a product of the time, rather than a feature of the game.
---
Oh well, it's been interesting hearing people's ideas of what classic will be like. #noregrets
---
There will be no server transfers at start.
---
From PvE to PvP will never be an option.
---
From Rp-PvP to PvP no idea if this was a  option before.
---
Classic is still casual af tho
---
Mages can reset a fight more than a rogue can.
---
Just once I believe
---
Just don't talk loud and don't be assholes.
---
I think we've just peaked, if I'm honest. People are just coming to terms with the bullshit side of Vanilla, and people are now realising it's not fair, not easy, and barely even rewarding. Everyone is excited to play it but everyone's neglecting the fact that Vanilla is full of bullshit. But that's how it was. It's a remake, not a remaster, if people wanna hate on it then let them, because at the end of the day it's not going to affect anything.
---
I would guess druids are easier to gear, and can be world PvP gods (because you can run away forever).
---
So is it pvp or pve your complaining about?
---
Nah, she only needs one epic mount so the whole clan can pitch in.
---
Make a tailoring friend. Wife is going mining and engineering and I'm going tailoring and enchanting. She gives me cloth etc I'll make her bags. She will help me on alt which will have mining and engineering aswell 😁
---
Wow lots of replies, I think I'll get a sub, for both of us and hopefully if our 6 month old allows us we will start to play. We both love pvp alot and wow is easier to stop playing than other games if something comes up irl. Was it undead or night elf priest racials that were op? I honestly cant remember it's been so long.

I played Ultima Online tho, it's more brutal than WoW, lost everything on death (probably the same as EVE)
---
Do you have any imgur album or so with all the pictures? :)
---
The severs open at 1am for me, so I will probably just go early to bed and wake up early and then play the whole day.
---
Does anyone have a list of pre-bis list for Warlocks specifically that does not containt 4/9 +shadow dmg BOE's? Can't seem to find anything that I can use to gear my lock without spending huge amounts of gold/ time into it.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Also taking week off to play with friends
---
MoP had the best original world building and lore up until SoO.  That place was fucking magical.
---
Project Lore was so good. Sad they stopped.
---
This information is so useful to me. Thank you so much! I wish I could upvote a thousand times :)
---
I mean they can mention w/e they want, every xpack has made the game feel worse to me.
---
I love this game to death, but it’s come to a point where I can barely recognize it. I thought Legion was a step in the right direction after 3 mediocre xpacks and did the entirety of Suramar like 10 times, but they’ve since taken 10 steps back with BfA.
---
That’s why I’m so hyped for Classic: if they don’t touch it, they can’t break it.
---
I dont see it?
---
HPS was never at any point an indicator who is the better healer
---
I won't be doing any hard core raiding or anything. Just want to be needed and have fun.
---
MoP was the best class design wise.  Pruning started in WoD
---
Gl learning to use outlook lol
---
Molten core is out at the start, if you have 3 weeks dedicated to play, you can be in MC by week 2. If you can do that, I think starting warrior is fine because gear is the only time gated content. Warriors can duo a ton of content for gold like farming righteous orbs, you just have to be social.
---
I would only roll mage as an alt for long term profits, not farming at the start (unless you have a second account, sit the mage in a city and sell portals/water). With Dire Maul not being out, mages are IMO worse than many other classes.
---
The romanian community plays mostly on Golemagg &amp; Shazzrah.
---
Romanian official wow classic discord for proof: [https://discord.gg/kKRC9XE](https://discord.gg/kKRC9XE)
---
when you sing it like that its just weird bro.
---
&gt; i was playing holy priest on Legion and BFA and there you could see whos the better healer by watching healing meter(SKADA)
---
No you couldn't, you could see who healed for more, that's so far from the same thing it's not even funny.
---
i will play feral tank and iirc he can tank but aq40 and naxx fully, few fight in naxx he can do because for his higher health pool. druid has advantage in heavy magical fights.
---
Viable, yes. Preferred, No.
---
Maybe for off tanking, but warriors will most certainly be the go to main tank.
---
I know Leeroy, but people from BFA might not know lol.
---
I would be somewhat sad if long lasting skellies don't get implemented one way or another.  
---
The screenshots I saw looked really flavourful. In addition skeletons can warn of possible ambushes or just tell a story of what happened.
---
I don't want to wait!
---
Am I the only one\* who thought it was hot garbage? It was nothing but the old and tired "lol nerds have no life" joke but more obnoxious because it's South Park. It didn't even have the Horde.
---
\*It's a figure of speech.
---
Yeah there’s plenty of that, I just want to see more stv memes 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah eve has also the "u lose it when u die" thing.. And stuff like carebear and "dont judge the playstyle" are daily business in EVE or r/eve :D
---
Yeah talking to him just isn't an option like I am exactly the type of person to go knock the door with a giftcard or a bottle of whiskey or something and say hey man look sorry about this but we having a party and heres something to say sorry but this dude is militant and he wont have it. Effectively we would be tipping him off to the party before hand and then he could warn the landlord. The air bnb is something we considered but my friend wont move his desktop its to valuable he just put a 2080ti in it and is totally against moving it. :(
---
" see whos the better healer by watching healing meter(SKADA) "
---
This is not how healing works in classic.   
---
Topping the healing monitor most probably means you've been overhealing, and wasting mana.
---
Thinking you're a better healer because you're higher on the meter is a misconception.
---
Unless you know exactly how you're going to become that person, you're not that person.
---
I might misunderstand the previous comment, but for me the top mounts still don't stick out even if they're really hard to get. They just blur out in everyone elses mega-rare-cool mount. Which makes it kind of lame.
---
Like the dude said. Attempt to kill him with kindness. Also speaking to the landlord is a potential move? Music will be quiet enough you can all still talk to eachother
---
That's superb. The psychological angles are well explained, and neatly goes to show how Retail is basically a single-player game, because your reality is merely cohabiting with others' realities instead of being one reality.
---
This might sound dumb to suggest, but I was taught this exercise as a kid when I first got into games some 15-20 years back... by some kind stranger who's Quake clan I was trying to join...
---
So you log into the game.  You put your left hand over WASD keys, that's your move Forward &amp; Backward and sidestep Left &amp; Right.  When you hold right click on your mouse, it will let you turn around using the mouse.
---
Here's a little exercise for you :) Pick a focal point in the game.  Maybe it's a stump in the ground.  Or an in-game monster.  Or a quest giver, etc.  You want to be able to walk around this thing in a circle, while still facing it.  So you face it... Hold D to sidestep Right, and use your mouse to turn.  At first... it's a bit like rubbing your tummy while patting your head.  Once you master that, go the other way by holding A side stepping the other way.
---
I swear - it sounds so dumb and pointless - but once you master that level of control, of using both hands at the same time to control your character... the rest becomes so, so easy.  That's my advice to somebody new to keyboards.  It's not failed me yet!
---
You can measure the healing, yes, but it doesn't necessarily tell you who is a better healing, just who has healed more lol.
---
Not sure what Hardcore raiding is but this time around guilds can get away with raiding twice a week and be considered "Hardcore" in classic. 
---
MC is going to be cleared while in blues/greens. 
---
BWL will be cleared the first day it releases. 
---
Most guilds will clear AQ/Naxx within 2 raid days and leave Sunday to do Only/MC/BWL all within 3 hours. 
---
Back in the day we were just had a lack of knowledge and weak understanding of so many consumables. 
---
Anyone who can commit 2 days a week to raiding will be very geared. The problem with classic is the extended time you'll be raiding for. Months on End is what it takes. So twice a week for a year 1/2. 
---
Personally, looking forward to it as I spend that time playing random games as of right now.
---
Blizzard screwed up here doing a actual lunch of wow vanilla back in the day but then blizzard didnt expect so many people to play the game, but for classic they knew that alot of people would hop on for the release and created a issue where there were only 2 pvp realms where they should have had 4 or 5 to spilt the players evenly in pop, of course more will play on pvp realms especially if content creators play on a pvp server.
---
That plus the abysmal track record of WoD. People gotta remember that before Nost launched, which was just after WoDlost a fuckton of the 10 million subs it had at the launch, there was no real mega server in the p-server community. So, any statistics or similar was usually pretty fractured just as the p-server community. In addition to that WoW was still doing reasonable well before the WoD disaster, even though subs went down to around 7 million by the end of MoP. That's still 7 million subs interested in the retail version of the game. 
---
I guess the corporate decision was already made when Nost got the C&amp;D, since at that point sub numbers were already at their [lowest point](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6995089/world_of_warcraft_subs.0.jpg), in addition to Nost doing so well and finally giving Blizzard relatively accurate numbers. Otherwise there would have also been no use in inviting the team to the Blizzard HQ for a presentation.
---
I hope the retards on shazzrah will enjoy their 5h queues because they were too dumb to just swap server
---
If its so easy to kick someone with an enemy cast bar why do people get kicked in retail and why is faking casts a thing.
---
Also id rather cast for a few seconds and cancel rather then silenced completely in that spell catagory for twice as long.
---
What about class choice?
---
Without a lie I recovered a old hard drive with Winamp and a wow playlist I had terrible taste of skins....
---
You have my HoT anyday...
---
Tells us how to tank, prehots everyone before trash pull.
---
If only my friends would play on rp-pvp
---
No job atm but I’ll be driving a family member to the airport around launch time. So I’ll be stuck in lovely Los Angeles traffic for a few hours, but I can at least log in remotely on my phone to try to beat the queue
---
Actually it's now just entirely gone! I wonder what I can get off for that
---
overhealing does not count into the meter, only actual healing
---
I think the combination of how crowded it'll be, and people struggling with pacing their combat and pulls properly means this will be a real struggle for this to be a realistic goal.
---
Don't you think it's time for the little shitter to grow up and learn how to play real games tho? ;) ;) ;)
---
&gt;Sad I had to scroll this far to see someone mention Chevelle.
---
wonder what's next is in the op you dork
---
Classic lore is like one of those book series where they have multiple authors writing in the same universe....there's really no main story until you get into raid content, which is universal both factions doing the same stuff stuff.
---
in-game economy would become massively inflated if you had 50k players all doing quests and dumping multiple times the usual amount of gold into it
---
I have an i7-8550u in my laptop and the game is not playable and I'm not just talking "10 fps not playable" I'm talking 5+ second frametimes.
---
First of all, your art is amazing.
---
Second, I'm currently working on an updated version that people can use as a phone background. :D Here's the progress so far: [https://i.gyazo.com/9373f5b42479939a5200218e35a7b343.png](https://i.gyazo.com/9373f5b42479939a5200218e35a7b343.png)
---
I already know most of it as it's a requirement of my job(state worker). In highschool I took Office training classes and got certified for everything minus Outlook because I had 0 need for it and it wasn't required for MOUS Master certification. Im mainly taking the class to get out of work for the day. Normally work until 4:30 but the class gets out at 3:30.
---
The only server where my name was available was Herod. I'm not going to be playing on Herod, but I'm not giving up the name :P
---
You can't jo pigeon-hole her into playing a healer cause she's a girl! This is 2019 buddy!!1!11
---
Long term yes, but immediately there's very little gratification.
---
Is there any troll version?
---
Aw man that is an awesome playlist! Thanks for sharing!
---
I bet they won't simply because they use simple feature like reading chat or whisper a player which many addons actully does. 
---
This addon is legit but people are just ignorant about what it does.
---
I still have Howling Fjords music on my playlist.  Hands down some of the best music ever created.  Grizzly hills had the best atmosphere with music and zone, but HF's music is second to none.
---
Biggest reasons on top of my head are:
---
Names
---
Economy
---
Horde/ally balance
---
I think you're massively underestimating the difficulty of Naxx if you think "Most guilds" will clear AQ and Naxx within 2 days...
---
Yes, we're better, but that shit's still HARD.
---
Shhhhh, we don't want them rolling over here when they can't get on.
---
how do you separate the gear then? we always had one main healer that was good and got the better stuff because he was just good
---
Who decides who gets to keep their names?
---
Farming silver before 60 is never worth it.
---
From what Ive hears and read it happened and every time it had a disastrous fallout for the communities. You. loose your server name/server pride. You get a bunch of people that you havent seen before and your server reputation goes to shit just to name a few.
---
heal meters don't include overhealing in the healing stat.
---
This is the most ridiculous concern. What curve are you going to fall behind? Even in the hardest of hardcore guilds, people are going to have like a single piece of MC gear at most.
---
Wait... What did frost mages do before ice lance?
---
While I also plan on using macros extensively on my classic warrior come launch, I'm a little bit worried about the potential loss of information "at a glance" that comes with combining two or more abilities into modifier macros like in your examples.
---
For instance, you might be interested in knowing the cooldown of e.g. Disarm or Whirlwind while you are in Battle Stance. With your example, this information is hidden to you unless you a) place the Whirlwind ability (or a macro with the relevant #showtooltip for the purpose) on an action button that is viewable from all of your stances (sort of defeats the purpose), b) press-and-hold the correct modifier to update the tooltip of your macro so that it displays the Whirlwind ability (which is sort of tedious to do mid-combat in my opinion), or c) get an addon which tracks your ability (and maybe item) cooldowns and displays these in another place than your action buttons.
---
For this reason, I generally go with more simple (no modifiers) - but highly useful - warrior macros like e.g. (I forget if "nostance:1" is the correct syntax - but you get the idea hopefully):
---
    #showtooltip Charge
---
    /cancelaura Bloodrage
---
    /use [nostance:1]Battle Stance
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,stance:1][harm,stance:1]Charge
---
    #showtooltip Intercept
---
    /use [nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,stance:3][harm,stance:3]Intercept
---
Obviously, this will use two action buttons (as well as two hotkeys), but with this approach you will be able to see the cooldowns from any stance, so long as the buttons are visible from all stances (I usually put macros like these either on the same hotkey across all stance bars or on a bar that is static across each of the different stances).
---
Do you feel like my point is a non-issue, or do you solve it in another clever way? Or maybe you don't feel like it's an issue having to press-and-hold a button to view different cooldowns. I haven't tried your approach (yet), but in the heat of combat, I imagine that having all of your relevant cooldowns visible at all times will be significantly beneficial.
---
My method is definitely not perfect, and it does come with some issues - especially for Defensive Stance I've had trouble mapping out all of my abilities so that I have everything available to me at all times. The issue (I think) with Defensive Stance is that depending on whether I am PvP'ing or tanking, I have very different needs when it comes to my action buttons in this stance. Perhaps I will attempt to combine my own approach with yours for some of the abilities that cause trouble in my Defensive Stance.
---
In any case, thank you very much for your effort! Your work provides an awesome place to lookup classic wow macro syntax (you can learn a lot by attempting to understand how your macros work). It is also serves as inspiration for creating your own personalized setup. :)
---
This! Epic drops, or even highly anticipated rares from 5mans are so satisfying.
---
&gt; they are queuing you against people from other servers when needed 
---
Is this really true? This wasn't the case in vanilla.
---
So let the spanish decide themselves instead of trying to move them to another server lol, you think firemaw players will appreciate them more?
---
*whispers*
---
^^^^If it's invincible then why can I see it
---
This is an awesome Cheetos napkin, the dust is the same color and would give it texture

I played vanilla for a while and got a hunter to 42. I was in STV and realized I didnt like hunter, got frustrated and deleted the character. I started a mage and got to my 50s when TBC released. I got heavy into raiding once I hit 70 but realized after that I never got to raid in vanilla which is why I am so excited for classic.
---
If I could go back I would probably have never played hunter, it just doesnt fit my playstyle and I realized it way too late.
---
not gonna lie, this set up is making it really hard for me to want to roll something other than warrior
---
Hilarious. Still fired though.
---
I mean WPvP while leveling. Not talking about ranking, thats whole different story. I mean Tarren mill vs Hillsbrad battle etc. Big fights in STV. most people are leveling in dps spec and its fun to sometimes switch from pure leveling to do some wpvp action. I am not against PvP server. The whole idea is that people will rather join PvP for that leveling mess and then goes pure PvE at level 60 - like myself.
---
If you're not on Gehennas can you send it me? Then we won't clash? ;)
---
I also NEED the week off, but my boss gave me influenza a month ago and i had to use all of my leave to cover the time off. I thought i was okay with it, but i realised today that i’m really salty that i cant take next week off.
---
Carefully. Hes a hero.
---
Ah yes, the dream of many a WoW player.
---
Wonder if those are still up for sale anywhere 🤔
---
Watching the "Healing Meter" to See who is the better healer is the worst thing i read in a while.. retail or not 
---
If u Take "overheal and dispell meter"into consideration we can Talk about "better healer" but you cant read the heal Meter Like the dps meter
---
Name reservation is a big one, in a game that is largely about community your name and being recognised is a big thing, as for economics imagine being a miner, herbalist, skinner in this situation, you've benefited from having very little competition on a low pop server when gathering the mats, then you merge to high pop where demand for these materials is high so they benefit again.
---
Ofc its the pve faction, every pve server is ally favored
---
Talking to the landlord unfortunately is not possible this situation is murder as there are bits I can't fully reveal but essentially the landlord should be considered hostile. Being quiet atleast for the first night may be our only option.
---
Hello fellow bartender.  
---
My work gave me tues-sat off... it's like they knew :D
---
Give them their long queues. They will soon adapt.
---
Same about 10 people too, launch will be an experience lol
---
Isn't dire maul out till phase 2?
---
There is absolutely no way they are doing another one. I would stake my life on it.
---
My brain is so cursed. I literally have this with any new game that i enjoy on start.
---
Blizzard and refusing to properly launch a game. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Number of deaths is the quantifier or healing quality, not HPS or total healed.
---
Just a small tip: tauren have longer reach because of their size so they are great as warriors. They are also the only race for Horde that can play druid (though I would not go druid as a beginner tbh). Shaman can also be daunting as they have a very specific type of spells called "totems" (of which they have 25 or so). Hunter is great for leveling but can be a bit hard to get good at and their pet takes a lot of maintenance to keep happy.
---
Retail still has stat weights, and some specs certain secondaries are just dead stats or so far behind you really don't want them rolled on anything. I've played Afflic during a point where if gear didn't have haste it was dead unless like 45ilvl difference, same for Frost and crit.
---
It's the same for classic and retail, BiS isn't simply the highest ilvl gear you can get, it's itemized and optimized for the specc.
---
So I have to like everything in WoW? I don't follow.

All dungeons up to and including brd can be completely solo cleared by several classes and builds. I have solo'ed all except 3 bosses (thaurissan, flamelash, 7dwarves) in brd myself as a rogue back in vanilla and have seen others with better gear clear it completely, but it took hours and was in no way "worth" it for monetary gains (waiting for all cd's before every trashpack to clear out rooms or boss adds and then vanish and wait for cd's again to fight the boss alone, ect...).
---
Fully t2+ geared &amp; with consumables, war tanks can even solo some parts of stratholme (only melee mobs), as at some point with the right gear they eventually dont even take any damage from those mobs anymore, and can even sort of aoe-grind there with tf and that engineering shield. But thats also extremely slow and not really worth the time and effort for the money.
---
The only common and popular solo dungeon farms with good income are dmn/dme (farming non-elite trashpacks for random drops, vendor junk and skinning the hounds) and maraudon (you dont actually farm mara for the items to vendor or de, you "sell" those runs to other players which pay you either per run or once their desired items drop, i.e. blackstone ring). And once naxx is out, hunters and mages can actually solo farm some trashpacks in there (ghouls and slimes) by kiting them around the entrance area for some bis-drops, which on pservers sell for up to \~300-400g per drop.
---
I dont know how you can say MoP was mediocre.  Class design peaked in that expansion, and the best original story they've come up with until SoO.  The consensus is wotlk good, cata mediocre and just repeat.  The game needs a new lead developer.  Ghostcrawler had passion for WoW, Ion looks like a soulless body.
---
L2p
---
Yes, all the diremaul methods are of course not possible before phase 2.

Enjoy classic mate.
---
They were, we've posted in numerous places in this thread that they're going to Atiesh and it's not changed.
---
But doesn’t the proximity of horde characters give you more of an excitement? I remember being lvl 20 and some dudes dragged some fuckin sorceress or some shit thru the gates of storm wind and the most massive battle erupted on the bridge. My lvl 20 ass died 1000 times just watching
---
OMG Whitemane is Kathleen Kennedy of warcraft! No wonder the scarlet crusade are a bunch of self righteous, virtue signaling snowlfakes!
---
So not happening, it doesn't fit their process at all.
---
I was gonna play a healer in classic, but down ranking spells sounds annoying af
---
"Don't get me wrong" ... nobody was getting you wrong. Why is it always so cringy when people say this? Probably just a pet peeve of mine but whenever someone says "dont get me wroooong tho" I'm always internally screaming "I WASNT GETTING YOU WRONG IN THE FIRST PLACE, Y U SAY THIS"
---
I'm looking to a world where everything is actually attainable and nothing has been removed for some bullshit reason.

Exactly why my wife and I haven't had kids yet. We decided to live our lives before getting locked down. Currently 31/29, waiting until she's 36 to start the family.

Ol' Reliable

Get an energy counter addon and max out improved gouge
---
Sky is falling, sky is falling!
---
You won't need that until you're pvping and that won't be until level 30+ really, unless you plan on doing the 10-19 bracket, I suppose.
---
As with wow, stop after just about the first 6 years of content.
---
Once you hit 40 as well, unless you become a no-lifer the level gains slow down so dramatically, and then once you hit 50 the Quests dry up so aggressively you have to do grinding. That's going to take out an absolute ton of people.
---
There’s less Druids in the Horde than in the Alliance. Simply put, Night Elves aesthetics are more popular than Taurens’.
---
Generally, Druids represent ~8% of the population at 60 on Pservers. However if you rearrange that statistic with respect to faction, you see that on the Horde, Druids represent about ~6% of players, whereas on the Alliance it’s around ~9%.
---
That may not look like much, but in reality it means that there’s good 40-50% more Druids on the Alliance than on the Horde side. Hence less competition for gear on the Horde. Then again, these numbers may vary a little bit from server to server, but you can be certain to see more NE Druids than Tauren Druids anywhere.
---
That’s next level, I do all my crafting right next to the craft supplier usually
---
Then somehow get in to Esc -&gt; Logout -&gt; character select screen -&gt; Delete Character -&gt; Type delete -&gt; then you wake up and your lvl 11 Night Elf druid named Melfurion is gone.

More exposure so Blizzard takes action to destroy it.

You'll fail. Wrong selfish retail mentality for healing. It's a group game there is no better or worse. Just cos you overheal the raid means fuck all if no one dies.
---
I did this dungeon yesterday, and forgot to pick up one of the gems that drop from the bosses.
---
LOOT THE BOSS FOR THE QUEST ITEM, because doing this a second time is a pain in the ass.
---
I think this will be completely different. The scale difference alone is. There's going to be millions of people on launch playing this. But it seems everyone that will be interested will play the first few months and either like it and continue till they run out of content or not and go back to other games or retail wow.
---
There's very few players that will stick around a game that isn't getting new content regularly. Blizz is right here.
---
Very true! And this was written before the announcement of "replaying quests" and "scaling characters for lower levels" in 8.2.5, completely ruining any semblance of world coherency. That specifically is what made me uninstall retail.

So many alliance warlocks :o

Nice ty for the info!!

 *Lok*'*tar Ogar* !
---
don't think of it as merging numbers and instead think of it as merging communities of people.
---
Each realm will have multiple instances of itself to try and carry the huge amount of players.
---
So Firemaw will have basically have several other ‘Firemaw’ layers. The entire world is a layer not specific zones.
---
This is being removed in phase 2 so there will only be one ‘layer’ of Firemaw eventually.
---
I snooped around in retail, and that fucking spider is next-level disgusting. I dont think anything in wow has made me feel like that ever. Good job on them

How the life, the life of the players and gaming culture changed since 2006, I think there are couple of good jokes yet.

Gear distribution is different between guilds, dkp, loot Council, some will still use a roll system, giving gear to the best performance (which will often be the best geared in the first place) doesn't seem to me like the best way to distribute loot, you'll end up with gear being filtered to the same player all the time, then when they have all they want and they stop getting loot this person has the option to be selfless and stay while others get loot or (seen this happen alot) stop playing/jump ship to another guild

Missed it on the way in, missed getting off on the other side. Total time taken: 7 billion minutes in my head
---
Missed opportunity for murder-murgle.
---
This makes me want to reroll to horde. Damn guild wanting holy paladins.
---
Why are you so obsessed with "better". Stop that selfish mentality.
---
Np.  For curiosity I tried to find a flash app online that showed what I meant, but couldn't :( But the control system is very very similar in every FPS game, and every 3rd person shooter game.  So you could try it out on an offline game (minecraft, etc) before hand if you wanted :)
---
By that logic newer servers will have a truer classic experience. Vanilla didn't have pre-awareness and that turned out just fine. I suppose it all falls down to nostalgia vs gameplay.
---
I got no idea about who or what this is, but I’m still excited
---
Holy fk thats top page quality idea. That way people could move and keep their names, which is major concern for some
---
Imagine virtual realms inside of a normal realm and that’s a layer, each layer will have around 3-5k players. It exists because there aren’t that many servers to they had to implement this solution.
---
I honestly doubt any of the servers are going to be in risk of dying. But yes I can agree that the current servers are probably gonna be more "hardcore". But there is a lot of players that doesn't want to sub for naming rights and that will play whatever server they can access with no intention to quit the game any time soon.
---
Strive all you want, but no one wants to deal with that shit when things go wrong. You'll be first on the cutting board.
---
I'm saving this image for... Future operations.
---
Lmao that edit. What a prick.
---
Crowded isn't a factor, dynamic respawn times are insane in 1-6 zones and then layering kicks in - but yes, people expecting BFA style leveling will still be in for a shock.
---
Hah, "the average player pays attention". Funny.
---
No we did, it’s just not funny.
---
yeah, well. We're all about nostalgia here arent we?
---
Hmm, I just checked out a bunch of random "Asmongold plays wow classic beta" to understand all the wailing and gnashing of teeth surrounding this guy... I clicked around to various points in the videos but never saw more than 3 or 4 other players on the screen with him. Where is this massive legion of followers, economy killers and resource monopolizers everyone is cowering from?
---
 If he really is going to have the impact that so many are afraid of Id like to avoid him like the plague, but Im more inclined to believe its just a lot of over hyped sensationalism and his server will actually be under the radar-sneaky good
---
Please help me make the correct server choice
---
Night elf. Female.
---
They just posted their opinion on a message board. You are the only one whining here.
---
What's that damn LED in the sky?
---
I think that if you have to reroll later, you will even further "behind". But you might as well level a hunter first, so you have a toon to farm, and the warrior when you feel like it.
---
i just leveled from level 85-&gt;110 in a day. rested bonus, stacked heirlooms, warmode, garrison then champion hall xp bonuses, invasions.
---
facerolled everything. used 3-4 buttons for 99% of the time. face pulled elites without a hiccup.
---
hunter must be the most brain dead of the brain dead classes nowadays. i weep, because hunter was one of the most interesting and technically challenge classes in Vanilla... yes leveling was easier, but the stuff you could do at 60 -- so much utility.
---
For sure!
---
* servers today hold more people than in 2006 (tech improved)
---
* people in the same server are distributed through layers, otherwise it would be completely unplayable (for ex.: no boars to kill)
---
* if you are in the same server, same location as one of your friends, you might not seem him as you might be in a different layer (even though the same server). If you invite him, he will move to your layer and only then you will see him.
---
From the developers perspective it makes sense to use this, but from a players perspective it's weird.
---
The number of layers will decrease in time as it is expected that a part of the population will abandon the game eventually
---
Good to know :o
---
Agreed, this time around though we will see a lot more PUG MC/BWL/ONY groups on off raid days.
---
Love it.  Thank you for the memories!  So excited!
---
I will wake up at 5 AM 3 hours before work to play then play as much as i can till i pass out! This way i wont get frustrated at launch when all the issues and whatsoever will be happening
---
Wait i thought it launched at noon on 27th
---
same thing happens with layers, it just happens to everybody instead of only a few people like merging affects
---
The whole point of there being, for the majority, less than 40% interest  in PvP as the primary activity also includes world pvp.  I wonder what the numbers would be like if they were to ask how many people there are who only join on PvP server because of their friends or because of a PvE guild. I for example am only gonna play on the PvP servers because my friends want to play on one. I am not gonna participate in world pvp and am gonna leave every single alliance player alone so long they don't attack me.
---
Also, as someone else already said in a different reply to you, your attitude fits on /r/gatekeeping. People are only gonna miss the content if they actually have interest in in but decided not to do it. Someone who has no interest in (world) PvP is not gonna miss anything.
---
Snowflake? Then druid, or ret paladin.
---
Most of the shitty specs have people doing their absolute best to theorycraft and minmax the ever living shit out of them.
---
Unfortunately as a consequence you have to be pretty bad at theorycrafting to theorycraft stuff like ret paladin, because if you were any good, you would realize it is hopeless.

---
I’m waiting. Dont really care about name or server (as long as it is PvP). Gonna sub one day in advance just to be on the safe side.

I think this might be the only option but its just a bit sad because we can do that from home you know. But yeah this is looking like the best thing we can do.
---
I installed it last night, and every time someone shot a mob I'd pulled it was winding me up, then they'd go loot it!
---
But the sparkles remained, so I got loot, then thought "This is a bit shit, I have no reason to even talk to these people, which is lucky because I'm in Starter and can't".
---
What do you mean under "doesn't fit their process"?
---
Warrior is hella slow at leveling, super reliant on gear. The upside is that you'll be in demand for instances and can almost go to one whenever you want, unlike the classes who can't tank or heal.
---
Also, what /u/glemnar said. Vanilla is not something to rush, it's all about the journey.  Rushing won't get you anywhere, and you certainly won't get "behind the curve". I raided MC in a top guild for *months* and didn't see a single piece of tier 1, because it just never dropped. Just take it easy and enjoy the game, seriously.
---
Because it's a change based upon political correctness...

This as fuck

Hopefully classic is a huge success so maybe they will make some trailers for the later phases.

You won't be too loud man trust. Laughing maybe but he can't complain about music. Have it more as background and ambient? Either that or have a good night sleep like me and go hard next day? That way it's day time so no complaints

Priest: You're right, not a high chance of you getting a raid spot as shadow. Not impossible tho. I found it surprisingly fun to play, but unless your primary focus in endgame is PvP, I wouldn't recommend it. Priests are expected to heal at some point.
---
Warlock: It's not as popular class as you think, I wouldn't worry about competition.
---
Mage: It's the best leveler along with a hunter. Doesn't have any downside, except that some find it a bit boring/repetitive to play.
---
Drood (balance): Good for PvP if you know what you're doing, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
---
All in all, if mage is in your consideration, just pick that. It's great at every aspect of the game. But if you really like more passive gameplay with pets and dots, then pick warlock.

wow this is so fucking awful behaviour, thank fuck i left Shazz, feels like a kindergarten of a server.
---
Um...  When the guild I was in first broke into MC zero prophecy pieces dropped for so long that by the time it did.  No one could roll against me for the whole set.  I went from 0-8/8 in one run.   We used DKP and you had to have 10% of the highest interested members DKP to roll against them.  It took months, tho I did get Anethema before that....
---
No there wouldn't
---
Bro I saw a ton of ads in late vanilla early BC. People would spell out gold buying websites or nazi symbols. With that being said, BRING BACK SKELETONS!
---
&gt; dead realms afte
---
   
---
Since I don't know all implications of layering yet, I would rather go with dead realms.
---
People making forums and stuff for guilds that they plan on making after launch, and getting people to apply for raiding and shit, even though its months away, and this was going on months before launch,
---
Ive thought about going and trying to namesnipe some of them just to mess with them
---
My phone is ready for that sick call the next day of release &lt;3
---
Did anyone play Tauren without loving the toon/animation, only to actually adapt and start liking it? It’s just so different than the human/nelf ive played before but I really digg the Tauren nature vibe and stuff. Also I’m going shaman.
---
With the attitude of retail players, this will happen on a constant basis haha
---
No one actually believes this is going to go into a raid. What he and a lot of us mean is just open world content. There will be tons of open world things happening either PvE or PvP and it could be fun to roll meme specs or even super meme specs. It's just all in fun, so you guys can quit belittling everyone who even mentions doing anything other than spamming Sinister Strike or Frostbolt.
---
Back on topic, this is cool! I can't wait to get into Classic and just kinda try random stuff and see what I think. I want to see what everyone can come up with and how the community as a whole ends up perceiving it. The fact is, we have no idea what raiding will be like in Classic. Some of us have a rough idea, but we were wrong about a lot of things so far. We MIGHT actually see some meme specs come out into the sun for a bit and compete.
---
Wish they would hire hurricane for this
---
You should only go tailoring if you intend to craft the Truefaith Vestments healing robe. Otherwise it is a waste since the other items are mostly BoE, unless you just want to make Mooncloth on cd and maybe sell bags.
---
Enchanting is the same, not worth using really unless you intend to sell a lot of enchants (only feral tanks need enchanting).
---
Engineering is the only profession you need for pvp.
---
BS is also good if you want a 30 sec fear immunity trinket but kinda much effort to get it when you don't benefit that much from it.
---
Classique
---
Ya I have been on this sub for a long time now and recently the reposts are starting to pop up everywhere
---
Since all servers have a discord you can organize World PvP on them. We intend to have raids fighting it out at Tarren Mill.

You get the Menethil FP, then start swimming.

---
I assume so?
---
You spelled it wrong. It's "mrglllmrgmgllllmrgl". ;)
---
&gt; streamers organising events over time and bringing players back will do wonders for retention on the servers they're on
---
For how long though?
---
Don't forget for the most popular streamers it's actually a job, some of them may honestly love the game but their job will require they will jump on the next big game when it comes out, and probably most of their followers will follow them into their new "endeavors".
---
Don't get me wrong, I never cared about streamers and what they do doesn't affect me in the least (mostly because I'm EU and we don't have anyone so popular to make an impact), but I can understand:
---
  * Blizzard being conservative in opening new servers, considering that, for reasons I don't get, they are so adamant in never wanting to merge servers ever.  
---
  * people worrying about being left in a desolate land when big streamers and their hordes will leave.
---
&gt; they said, multiple times, and in multiple occasions, that they can have a slightly higher cap than Vanilla, or they said that layers will be dynamically modified up and down in capacity, or what about saying that they can host more CCU than Vanilla.
---
Of course they have the technology to do so... but can you link one of your multiple sources that indicates the concurrent cap will be higher than it was in vanilla **AFTER** layering is removed?

Checking in from Asia. Server launch is 7am Tuesday.
---
Leveling to 60 weeds out the weak and powerless. 1-120 on retail takes a day or 2 even for a casual. 60 in Classic will take hardcore a week(not playing 24hr a day) and casuals a couple months. A co-worker is hyped for Classic but knows he can only play a couple hours a night at most so he is prepared for a couple month grind.
---
Threat is not a hard mechanic to understand, it's just particularly compelling to me as a tank.
---
Come on, EVE: Online isn't *that* dead. It still has basic organic functions!
---
It probably won't be quite this bad come launch (or at least won't stay this bad for long if it is) but I can guarantee you will always see more than 3-4 other players with him.

At first I was thinking how can Swolemagg not have an "ouch" tanktop. Then I started thinking where is the boulge in the pants...  
---
Then I realized, Swolemagg is the bouldge himself.
---
Not that you are wrong on the actual volume of spells. The difference is the amount of them you actually use once in a lifetime.
---
For single target charge (1), Colossus Smash (4), Overpower (5), MS (6), Slam (7), Execute (8) and the essence on the far right. Add  heroic leap (first action on the top left) for leap charging as well, which gives a lot of rage over the course of a fight, That's 8 abilities an arms warrior uses regularly in their rotation, of which two are mutually exclusive (MS and Execute), so it's only 7 in practice. I don't know how it is currently, but at one point during early BFA you also used Bladestorm (6th action on the top left bar) for single target.
---
Meanwhile on Classic you have the bars full with often times useless stuff. Speaking purely from a DPS standpoint with **no** need to off-tank anything, you have BT, WW and heroic strike/cleave in raid spec. Recklessness is on a 30 minute CD but I'll add it to that list. Also, Execute. Out of their abilities 2 are mututally exclusive, cleave and HS. That's 5 abilities used at best, one of which you won't be able to use on the majority of bosses in a raid due to the 30 minute CD.
---
While I do agree that things like stances should make a comback as well as certain abilities, although not many from Vanilla (I miss the MoP banners), anyone claiming retail WoW rotational gameplay is like playing league while not even mentioning Classic rotations is a hypocrite.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant :)
---
If you don’t click your abilities I think you can do fine with a mouse like that.

You foresaw this and yet you scrambled to get set up on the first server that went up?
---
Yeah. There's a monk in my guild who "does a lot of healing" in raids but trying to run a M+ dungeon with him is nearly impossible because he is constantly out of mana and using his CDs when it's completely unnecessary
---
I started on the tail end of vanilla and I was using threat addons. I never understood threat or why I would occasionally steal it until I died one too many times and downloaded Omen. Many more quality of life addons followed after...cast bars, OneBag, Recount, etc.
---
I don't understand why you're considering a mouse that you read is shit for gaming.  no one uses that in dota or cs if that helps you.
---
thanks
---
Thank you for the answer.
---
So for spec it's clear now from your answer and the answer Aticus gave me that i should go single target. It should also be pretty potent in the contested zones. 
---
For professions i a still a bit in doubt. I was going to start as herb/skinning either way. From what i read herb/alchemy should be a good earner even as a casual. Does tail/skinning provide a close enough profit margin and if not do the benefits from the tailoring crafts do enough to offset this loss in profit ?
---
thanks :)
---
I never knew how they ran gnomes to orgrimmar and float their bodies in the air to create words vertically. But they should lower the skeletons for lower lvl to 1 at a time and make them disappear faster and give lvl15+ the normal vanilla value of skeletons.
---
Blizzard have created more servers, players simply refuse to play on them. They could add 10 more servers and the problem would be exactly the same.
---
Let them learn the hard way.
---
I can't wait, its like I'm 7 years old and it's Christmas is 5 days
---
For raiding the amount of debuff slots is problematic. As there are just 16 debuffs possible at the same time, warlocks normally had to reduce there debuffs to just the one that provides more shadow damage.
---
In dungeons those 16 debuff slots are not as problematic, but trashmobs die way too fast, so you have no use of your dots. For bosses affli can be fine, but normally you wouldn't deal any damage. 
---
The other problem would be aggro. As a tank you normally focus your aggro on the main targets. An affli lock wants to dot everything, but normally the yank just wants to have more threat than his healer. Being forced to produce more threat on second targets means a loss on aggro on the main target, which results in a problematic situation for other DDs, who only deal singletarget damage.
---
Hahahahahahha. 😁😁😁😁

Just had a look on google and found this, so i guess not - probably some third party website will do it

50 levels in 3 weeks xD Amateurs

Short answer: no
---
Long answer: noooooooooooooooooooooo
---
There is a cost to making enough servers? Lol. Blizzard makes enough money, £10/month subscription fees from millions of players, that's not an excuse.
---
I understand about people leaving and not wanting empty servers.
---
not undead though? shiggy diggy
---
Ah, OK, are they worth taking at the beginning to get myself some early wands, do you think? Or should I just hope to pick one up somewhere down the line and take engi and something else?
---
Don't follow mediocre guides anyway. Goto wow-pro and get the original Jame's Leveling Guide. Free &amp; much better.
---
why dont they just fucking Locked the Full Servers, this is beyond stupid now
---
Mine too! Actually I was just hanging out in Orgrimmar (about lvl 20 troll hunter with a basic raptor pet) when a dude walks to me, says that he knows a spawn point for a cool pet and if I had time he'd take me there. I was a bit suspicious and said that I'm honestly a very casual player and he shouldn't bother but he insisted it was no trouble. So I stable my pet and off we went to Ratchett and started walking, all the time he says that it is a really rare spawn and most likely won't be there and that I should just camp there. We get to the tree and... there he was. No other players in sight, all free to the taming. Damn it was cool, and many thanks to the player. Wish I remembered their name! You and other players like you made this game great.
---
People like Asmon sure aren't going to be jumping onto the next game, but for many thats a fair point. I think a lot of the more dedicated players would be still be playing on and off after the first 3-6 months anyway, especially if they can run events and such.
---
I think big big streamers leaving causing population issues is probably the most serious concern regarding them, so I agree with you on pretty much everything there.
---
LOL IT LOOK LIKE A BENIS :DDD AND DESTICLE :D
---
Yeah. I also used threat meters and dbm during the last month or so of vanilla.

Then something is very wrong somewhere. I was fine in the stress test with a i5-8350u w/ integrated graphics, 8GB RAM &amp; SSD. 
---
This was in the starter areas with about a bazillion other players, steady &gt;50fps throughout.
---
I had some issue with it, too. Since the taurens are so big, and their steps are wider, they seem, slower somehow. However I got used to it in a few hours. But this is completely subjective, your best bet is to try it out!

I’m literally waiting for this nightmare to happen, and then be called a shit healer.
---
Forgive me for being dumb, but people do raids just like in the other servers, right? I am thinking about playing in rppvp
---
Wowhead has guides for the Classic dungeons. I'll keep the Sunken Temple map open on the 2nd monitor, despite having tanked all my (WoW-)life. That place was confusing as hell.

&gt;All the dad gamers who have reserved names on the Full servers will during the first week change server in rage because they havent even made into the game.

Lol. All the old farts are USED to waiting. We live that shit every day. Lets see the younger genration handle a 6 hour que. You can live on instagram posts of you rig and snacks for the launch only for some time. You know others are having fun, posting pics of their levelup. And you are missing out. 
---
Dad gamers rememer, this is vanilla like. The younglings need to tell others that they are so happy to play on the new server, how its sooo much better. And everyone not making the move are idiots.

eh, you know berserker rage breaks it and if he is ??? he will surely see you in stealth and charge you
---
We don't have Zg at launch though.
---
(wake me up inside)
---
Conversely, I'm 30 this year and have the goddamn wisdom to not underestimate the shortened attention span and burnout that is the reason why a game like WoW even dwindled in the first place - the dedication taken to succeed in this game just is a bar too high for most players these days.
---
If you can't see this, you're just not a realist.
---
I can get off for that.
---
You don't stop leveling for PvP.
---
PvP is omnipresent
---
You'd get weird scaling if you just keep progressing gear without level. Unless you're just piling on base stats, people are gonna get crit capped after 1 or 2 more tiers of content
---
You had to cc and go slow with cata heroic dungeons on launch. Deadmines was a bitch. In mop challenge modes same thing.
---
People that are good and care about optimizing their play will adjust and people that don't won't. Same as classic I'm sure.
---
I wonder if they're counting all the created characters or only 1 per account. You can't really play all the 3 characters you created at the same time.
---
Nah it's in from day 1 mate. Gonna be day 1 level 60 rogue can't wait 👌
---
Np ! My worry is that rp-pvp server eventually gets low pop, it would be Nice to be able to transfer to a more populated pvp realm.
---
Oh god, the pushback must have gotten to ya.
---
My man!
---
They can revamp the entire game in an expansion, like they did in cataclysm. But instead of destroying the game they can restore it.
---
Give back talents and all the other RPG aspects they've removed. Have 1 difficulty for raids. Open up new servers without LFR and LFG and phasing for us that want to actually play an MMO and it could be good.
---
If I don't have to queue on launch day they have broken their "no changes" promise.  As we say in gaming now, it's not broken, it's a feature.
---
Source please?
---
I'd genuinely be interested to know what percentage (of people who know about and understand the topic) are bothered about this.
---
No shit, the point is that shaman and other classes lost the ability to do this type of stuff early on while mages could still  benefit from each others' spell effects well into wrath and maybe Cata too

This problem might correct itself. The people who can move will in order to get on faster. The people who have guilds will either move on masse or solo/friends will just move together.
---
It's only a name. If you can't log in to one server, just go to another. Chances are you'll still get your name there. Unless it's 'John' or something. Ain't nobody want 15 servers at launch with 10 of them dead.
---
On second though, I expect heartbreak at not being to play the first day. I made 1 character on lowest pop servers just to have options.
---
That's always been the logical explanation to me as well. I'm sure there will be demand for BC, and probably Wrath, but I honestly doubt they'd get enough interest in Cata and beyond to do those.

The fact that all but a few are either full or high flies in the face of your claim. At this point almost every server has a queue, including some that people were encouraged to switch to. They need more servers.
---
&gt; one does literally 20-30% healing more than the others, you can te
---
What does that number tell you about: 
---
* Damage done
---
* Damage prevented
---
* Dispells
---
* Tank healing
---
* Priority target healing
---
* Target selection in general
---
* Spell selection
---
* Mana consumption
---
Those are the very basic things you need to look at when judging a healers performance and literally all of them will result in making the number you're using to judge performance smaller.
---
Nice fake news, what is wrong with this world and people just making up random things.

He made over 1 million $ off his original vanilla guide.

"Hate Speech" is really just a silly excuse. How many times have you seen proper "hate speech" spelled with out skeletons?   
---
It's so rare that it could be taken care of by a GM.
---
This is a solution to a non-existent problem.
---
The other argument is gold farmers use it for advertisements.  
---
So? Just because some chinese farmers do bad things you want to remove an awesome feature almost entirely? Punish the entire player base that isn't at fault?  
---
Goldfarmers used to use corpses for advertisements too, and removing skeletons doesn't solve this problem at all. If anything it gets reinforced. (they use stolen credit card information for their throw-away accounts)

This is another step in the wrong direction. Hopefully WoW will not suffer from another death by a thousand cuts.

Different albums remind me of different things. I was listening to Say Anything "is a real boy" my first trip through AQ40.

Well shit it's stuck in my head now you've said that
---
And if the tank pulls more mobs than he can tank vs. incoming heal-threat, then he messed up and should've marked for CC.
---
Blacksmithing's good recipes are bind on equip, you can just buy them. There's no class where leatherworking or blacksmithing are "required", unlike tailoring that has minmax bind on pickup craftables that required you to have tailoring.
---
So it basically comes down to do you want more money from herbing/alch (it's unofficially considered the most lucrative gathering profession imo) or the convenience of blacksmithing?
---
Not too keen on the Warlock T3 either, compared to their T1 and T2. The rest of the T3s do look great though.
---
Songs for the deaf ooOo0
---
No they should not lock character creation, since people still have friends who will join them. They should however have started with more than 2 English PVP realms for EU. We all knew it would be too few. And at the very least opened up new servers before both reached full.. This is so badly handled by Blizzard.
---
And I bet this non-issue will have a face-off with the Streisand effect

Hell I got an epic on a LEVEL 15 character in retail the other day. One of the quests in the starter zone got a random "Epic Upgrade".

I was like really?! They're handing out epics to lowbies these days?! FROM QUESTS?!
---
I am the tank.
---
Does anyone have anything similar to this for undercity?
---
I remember feeling dirty on Legion launch for just running around tagging SW:P on everything and letting other people burst it for me. It felt like I was cheating and griefing others.
---
Then I realized it was the only way I actually could do it because anything would be dead by the time I finished casting one spell.

Lots to love on there, but it's all about Cake for me.  +1 for The Hives.

They'd be better off doing an episode on Fortnite or something more mainstream to illustrate 2019 game culture.
---
Also, I highly doubt they're the sort of people to make an episode based on a petition.
---
I expect ZT to become at least high before lunch. It has been medium for some time now. Then cheap bastard like me will create a char 24h before launch and the population will just explode.
---
But will it feel like home, or will it be empty because of layering? That's the question.

People seem to have this notion that they're going to make money from their professions. You won't. Tailoring is a money pit, either go two gathering or mining to supplement your engineering. That's the only chance you have at saving yourself from being a broke ass bitch while trying to level engi.

Saved, thanks mate. :)
---
I can only give some advice on priest since that's the only class I've mained. Usually good healers are in shortage and you'll be expected to heal. If you play shadow priest, you can still do a good job in dungeons, but healing talents and gears are required in raids because healers are the most important members other than MT. I don't know about horde, but in the alliance's side we had several paladins and a druid for MT while priests are assigned to keep the rest of the group alive. Raiding is pretty tedious in vanilla, I'd say. If you like PvP and there's no or little BG queuing time, go shadow and join a premade group for PvP. Shadow priest is serious badass. But you'd better get a Benediction/Anathema before you quit raiding and focus on PvP.

Well firstly, having 0 professions whilst levelling is just wasted. If you take Skinning at level 5 and vendor the skins you receive it's gonna give you a big money jump for your mount at level 40.

There's people riding motorcyckles in the starting area in Teldrassil😒

Yeah, we do everything in RPPVP servers...we mostly just type complete sentences while doing it....the most casual RP is just writing "Anyone else need to kill Hogger?" in say instead of "LF 1 HOGGER DPS NEDZ HEAL OR TANK"
---
You're going to find a more mature crowed on RP servers...we probably won't make any world first clears but your actual enjoyment of the game will be far greater because of the community.
---
How long, as in levels, can a shaman heal dungeons if going ele talents? And how long can heal if going enhance?
---
In Vanilla it took 1 minute to craft the thing, retail it happened instantly lol
---
It is kinda amazing how Paladins never had a better looking armour after the Judgement set.
---
Well, at least it's better than T2.5, these sets were horrible in everyway and not top of it being a copy/paste for classes sharing armor types. It always seemd to me that devs had no time for some reasons and just made these sets as the last time ditch effort.
---
Plagueheart looks like it was supposed to be in AQ, i mean look at the eyes on shoulders, feels like they just recolored it to gave it a "toxic/plague" look.
---
Hmm... maybe I'm mistaken and it's only BC... but iirc I've literally made an autoloot addon myself as a simple example when I was learning how to make addons, and used it on the original 1.12 client on a private server.
---
so you make the Warrior use Berserker Rage while forcing yourself to exit the game, seems worth it, lol

Im still bad at typing.

Pre and post cata has had good players who can adapt to the game. Dungeons in Vanilla are about 200x easier than M+, where you also chain pull. Get over yourself.
---
Ironically less so when you make Azeroth an actual titan character
---
Yup, that’s my concern also. But I think I will like it more than the orc hunchback
---
I'm not in a rush to level my main. I will start by leveling up my alt to 5. After that level up a paladin bank alt to 5. Tested it out during stress test and my bank alt had 4s when I hit level 5 since I only bought one skill. 
---
Main will have skinning. By level 8 or so I should have enough silver to buy a couple of stacks of linen from the AH. People will see it dirt cheap. Then just create bags via my alt. Also since I will have played 3 characters at least a couple of 4 slot bags should have dropped for me.

You are not too old, you are just plain annoying. Dude gives you a reasonable advice and you put on a show, you big drama queen.

How is it not game changing?
---
It's okay to remove things if it's just little by little? How about they remove the chat, because it can be used for profanity and hate speech. Why even let you choose your own name? You could offend someone with it.
---
My guess is you play PvE and don't care either way, but on PvP servers it's a big part of the atmosphere.
---
Whoosh a little!
---
Arcanite will be most in demand through out the content. Its used in so many fucking things. Cured rugged hide, well you want to have healer cloak (Dire Maul, phase 2) and then you \~dont need it until NAXX tier items (and tbh, plenty of time to get these done, you need like 15 for full set on most classes that use them).
---
Mooncloth, not sure if this is even worth it. 4d CD and the only thing you would want to make is 18 slot bags. 12 cloths per bag. Thats 1.5 month worth of CD's. Expensive materials. But since you cannot do 5 onyxias per reset, maybe its worth for getting 4 bags for your main. Bagspace in naxx... jeesus fucking christ.

Given your stated goals, I can't fault either. Go with shaman :)

---
I really wonder what names they refuse to give up, they most be both extremely creative and witty, while also being super obvious! :P
---
Stubborn people on the full servers that want to both eat and keep their percieved virtual cake will rage come launch...
---
Check out r/grobbulus!
---
i know but the image wasnt made by me
---
Laughs in Rallying Cry of the Dragon Slayer and Spirit of Zandalar
---
if this is the only issue I’ll be glad and I’m sure I’ll have a lot of fun with it
---
It also depends on your raidcomp, gear, skill of players at avoiding damage, healers sniping eachother, popping cds when its not needed to increase hps.
---
Doing 20-30% more healing doesn't mean shit when you are the guy spamming his spells and going oom trying to top the meter.
---
3pm should be fine. You won't log on at launch, but you still get to play all Monday night when you get home. There's no point in taking off Monday during the day just to sit around until 3pm
---
Yet if you want to rush to 60 that will be a huge drawback.
---
If you don't want to level proffesions while rushing to level up, you should always take atleast enchanting for the disenchanting option imho.
---
The only issue with that though is layering but suppose that will be out by phase 2
---
If you play casual play whatever you think is the most fun. Nothing needs a lot of set up, sure mages with food and portals are great but you are able to buy food and you are able to do first aid for heal. Hunter is good for solo and great in PvP also the first tiers he has a hight output which get worse in later tiers. So hunter would fit fine. If you like pets warlock is alright too and a not often played class. For PvP I would always recommand rogue because he is the one and only for my opinion.
---
Do you have a shortcut for that? I mean for copying from Spotify to Apple Music?
---
Not at first it wasn’t, you’re right.
---
You call people idiots yet make no attempt at explaining why their complaints are unwarranted.
---
You do understand that dead bodies are a sign of war? The game is called World of **War**craft. Get the hint?
---
Removing a great and amazing feature for a very bad reason is stupid.
---
Mage &gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter in terms of PvE ranged damage. Warlock is primarily held back by the debuff cap, otherwise it would be very competitive with the mage if not stronger in some cases (at least on drawn out fights, their DPS ramps up and is weaker on trash as a result). I would say "any class is good so long as he's not being lulled into playing an unpopular off spec".
---
That said, druid is actually a pretty smooth leveling experience. I wouldn't shy away from the class if that's actually what you're worrying about. All healers level in a dps spec, their healing is good enough for dungeon content so long as they pick what level they go into it appropriately.
---
I don't understand what you mean 'restored'. Why had they gone from your friends list?
---
I'm not the one downvoting you here, if you don't believe me or any of the guides out there, you'll just have to try it yourself.
---
Another thing, if you cast direct damaging spells, you'll take aggro from your pet too fast. Have fun casting Shadow bolt at mobs hitting you.
---
No, you’re right, that’s fair and given the reaction I agree. If the only response to asking a question to a community is being told to leave it then I don’t really want to be a part of it. I also note that no one actually answered the questions I asked.
---
What? You can put ZERO effort in and will have the gold by 42-43 the issue is that you sometimes won’t have it right at 40
---
This is just plain wrong
---

Looking at the numbers, even if 2/3rds of what will be at launch quits, we will still have way more players than Retail. Even that Talliesin Retail ass-kisser character is admitting it.

Majority of game guides in print cost upwards of $20 - if not more. And those guides are static.

there are no dying servers, you're dillusional
---
I've been on Moonguard (rp pve retail realm) forever and my very casual guild raids every tier. We dont touch Mythic and we're like 20th best guild on the server but hey people still raid
---
As an 18 year old I feel very out of place but when I played on private servers people never seemed to care I was half their age lol.
---
Because they expect large proportions of those players to be tourists or blinded by nostalgia and who will only play for a short period before going back to or to Retail or quitting entirely.
---
They believe the current player count is massively inflated with people who are not going to be around long.
---
7-18 the population is **way** more spread out than 1-6 and layering will have taken effect properly. I played the last stress test at launch, instant queues because it was so busy, but after the first hour there was no problem doing anything. It's not gonna be hard to get 20 in a day if you have the time.
---
Ah ok, I’ll have to look i to it. It was a couple years ago now for me.
---
Well it's a drawback from 1-40 yes but I'd argue the biggest drawback you could ever have is the lack of a mount at level 40+. Invest some time early and you'll likely save more time in the long-run, especially seen as the 55-60 grind is disgusting

Engineering is rarely a great idea, but I liked it on my hunter. Feign death and use goblin jumper cables to res the healer. Saving the entire raid a corpserun hails you as a hero.
---
6am here and nothing to do that day. can play while everyone has to go work and class ;D
---
In a way I kinda hope it is. I'll probably have more free time 15 years from now.
---
And then when you somehow managed to kill 2 and about to finish the last one, it runs away and calls for a backup.
---
So the overflow from Shazzrah and Gollemag goes to firemaw and that makes all 3 unplayable not 2, just open 1 more PvP server and people will move.
---
How can you possibly know this? People on retail don't talk to each other!! I call bullshit! /s
---
I like this playlist very much because you weren't afraid to put in all those "questionable" pop songs (unlike other wow playlists that are mostly made up from metal, rock and hip hop stuff). 
---
I can't wait to level up my gnome while shamelessly rocking to "Hung Up" by Madonna. I know no shame!
---
Warlock also...going Tailoring/Herbalism...gonna make my BiS Robes myself then switch to Herb/Alch for flasks and hope I make enough by ZG to just buy the next BIS set.
---
I'd say warlock and hunter are probably the two best options for you. Ultimately though anything will work that catches your fancy if you avoid offspecs and warriors. Both of those would require more time than you have in order to make them work.
---
Why not try a rogue for pvp shenanigans? They're a little harder to get into pve groups due to loot competition but the playstyle is pretty unique and a blast in pvp I've heard.
---
Hopefully it won't feel empty on launch day once you've spent four hours trying to kill 6 bandits.
---
This is a great answer. Do you think mage or hunter is better for this purpose? Also, what about warlock?
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
It's fine. I'll just tickle him with my daggers. I'm sure he'll get annoyed eventually.
---
Spaniards tend to be extremely annoying, they almost never speak english even in /general and /trade and they form this kind of a clique and fail to communicate with the rest of the server. The majority of them is also extremely toxic and salty. 
---
About the APES, their reputation precedes them. They will ruin the realm they pick just as they did in LH. Terrible faction balance favoring Alliance. Horde’s numbers will be ridiculously low 2 months after launch on their server.
---
With the relatively low amount of realms, I wouldn't be too concerned about that. 
---
Also, I'd much rather be on a short(er) queue initially and transfer later on if - against my belief - Firemaw should become empty-ish.
---
Not really. T3s rarity in vanilla was mostly because of timing. It wasn't out long enough before BC for many guilds to clear it that would have if given more time. If we can farm it this time around, we will.
---
SM/Ruin is optimal spec for everything except pure singe target boss damage (where it will be 5% behind DS/Ruin).
---
If they're smart they can wait for 2 sunders.and then go bat shit crazy.  There are too many dumbasses though that just think tanks have some aoe ability that'll gain all threat like magic...  That's far from the case.  Threat must be established on every individual target.  There are a few aoe tricks but that involves a little bit of stance dancing and a few seconds for the tank to be alone with all targets.
---
Based on current rumors that might be the case. 
---
So everything up to BFA might be encapsulated at level 60 or so (you still progress as normal through expansions while leveling, its just the level and XP values being adjusted) and new expansion content might be something along 5-10 levels. 
---
Of course from what I gather it's just a rumor and even if they are working towards it the numbers aren't set in stone, but the idea is that an overall "level squish" might be in the cards for the next expansion.
---
Problem for a bear tank is holding enough threat
---
See, I would have guessed the current servers are full of retail subs and reddit users.
---
This will be very interesting with dynamic respawns.
---
Are you a team or solo player?
---
In PvP at least, you'll often find yourself being borderline useless in group fights, because you'll essentially be a melee class without the survivability to be on the frontlines, so your only choice is to be very lucky in taking out stragglers. And you provide little to none in terms of buffs, CC, healing or utility.
---
But it's great solo, as stealth essentially makes you non-reliant on groups and can pick your fights.
---
If you like the escape option of vanish, it's often paired with the dwarven racial to make it far more reliable.
---
Your recollection is 100% wrong.
---
Seems a lot of people have the same experience, such a great dungeon
---
I was nearly puking butterflies out of excitement when it  was minutes before name reservation. Actual release will be insane!
---
Ah, I must have remembered wrong because I initially thought it came during Vanilla. Guess not then :)
---
https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
Uhhh nah this is the one benefit I get from early raiding.
---
Oh man I forgot how thicc femdwarves were.
---
Is leveling in vanilla really challenging to you? I did play on nostalrius which supposedly had even harder hitting mobs than the actual classic, and it was super easy, just had to lose time to drink mana every now and then as mage. Raiding is also 10000x easier than in retail.
---
Why not just take it slow and steady and play without a guide? Much more enjoyable imho.
---
All I hear is a lot if unnecessary QQing.
---
If you intentionally wait in a 6 hour queue when there are other options, you're just an idiot.
---
I already do that normally.
---
In addition to the 11 months since the last armory logout (that OP now ruined by logging into the character), when first I accessed the wowprogress page last night it said last updated 24 days ago, which at the time put it at 1-2 days before the original post by u/literalllyablackbear, and name changes don't dynamically update like that on wowprogress, it needs an active update initiated by a person to update.
---
You can try to run, but we all know those frost bolts will screw you over
---
No. Druid was THE worst class in vanilla. They can do a bit of everything, yet they're not good at anything, hence the "hybrid tax". Their only use is mana battery and battle rez for priests. That's why they became so IMBA in TBC, which was a reparation for their awful design in vanilla.
---
there should be a better cloak with spell power
---
Rolling the right random mod on Archivist Cloak is too unreliable, have to be lucky.
---
Cast bar addons were very common for people doing any amount of pvp or duels.
---
Same with stun timers.
---
Kind of wondering about this as well, although I'm a priest. I was thinking I'd take Skinning and Tailoring for leveling and swap Skinning for Engineering at 60 - how useful is engineering for leveling?
---
Engi is a great idea, it's hands down the best prof in vanilla. By far.
---
No grace period.  They don't want 500,000+ people trying to sit in character select starting Monday morning.
---
The login server boss and queues can't be beaten.
---
Herbalism / Alchemy is a very good choice. I just think that it would be difficult to keep up with your level on a fresh realm when zones will be overcrowded and everyone will level their professions.. but if you really want it, go for it :P Elixirs are OP :P you will get more intellect from an elixir in level up than all your gear together, at least for levels 1-40...
---
Tailoring is very good to, since cloths come natural from killing mobs. You can make good armor to wear plus bags for you and your alts. At max level, you will be able to craft Robe of the Archmage which is best in slot even in BWL... although the recipe is very rare and expensive. Also you will get the set bonus from zul gurub bloodvine set when it releases.
---
In general, tailoring have some benefits you cannot buy from others, while Alchemy not.. you can always level alchemy to an alt though. 
---
herbalism is very profitable but, herbs will be heavily farmed by guilds at 60 and black lotus will be camped by bots/gold farmers. I cant really tell which one will be more profitable, cause it all depends on how lucky you are to find herb spawns at 60 (Dreamfoil especially).
---
Why are 15 year old raids that people have optimized to death somehow outside of "just for fun"? Like, it's still just a game, people are so intense about raids, with 40 people you can clearly bring a "fun spec"... The police won't come for you if you enter a raid with Ret talents lol
---
Well I had to warn the first few groups I was still figuring out all the new priest spells.  Didn’t want any raging nine year olds losing their minds since I haven’t played since 2012 or so
---
is it still not known hwo clearcast will proc in classic wow?  
---
its either per cast or per enemy hit.. that would be important  
---
HELP plx
---
I've had a mouse [like this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00BIFNTMC/ref=sr_1_32?keywords=natural+wrist+position+mouse&amp;qid=1566472756&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-32) for a few years and it really helps.
---
Do you want some of the sweetest casting animations in the game or look like you've shat yourself when running?
---
You have problems getting slice and dice rolling so there is no chance for control in dungeons. It takes too much time to build cp
---
Found the zoomer
---
Played some to try to tide me over, I hot an epic for a lvl 10 quest reward. *seriously?*
---
You better be talking about for melee. If you're a caster and you don't have the long braids that whip around when you cast, do you even dwarf?
---
Holy paladins are good for sure. At the time having to rebuff the raid midfight (friend played while it was 5 min only), looking like a banana in T1, and my horribly inefficient leveling was off-putting for me. Played correctly they're quite good.
---
Spell batching.
---
And if you're a clothie you don't even need the legs! =)
---
And I have to disagree with you. If Classic WoW is still the top MMO after 30 years it IS a very sad state of things.
---
It was a hyperbolic joke about YouTube videos. Calm down and dont be so defensive.
---
No, had it in 2005 when I was 16 (I saw your whiny edit). Why would it be cheating.
---
Skeram Heram checking in.
---
They could kill the mind control boss.  That's it.
---
Utilize the time you have now. During the larval stage they just piss, shit, eat and sleep. You don't have demands for you to play with them all the time. You don't have to wait till they go to bed and then figure out how you're going to function the next day on no sleep. Now is the perfect time to play.
---
As a Grobb player, I feel you man.
---
there is easily more than 100 words on that post, your answer "No" is so basic, it hurts me.
---
I don't even understand why people buy Store Mounts. New player, maybe? But If you already have 200+ mounts, then who really cares about paying for a couple more?
---
There is one vertical gaming mouse a dota2 team uses, and its pretty cheap https://www.trust.com/en/product/22991-gxt-144-rexx-vertical-gaming-mouse
---
I hate transmog.
---
If you're so insistent on being a min-maxer you deserve to look like an alien unicorn wearing shorts because you traded it in for your 0.05% worse gear that made you look like Thrall.
---
&gt;If you just buy nothing and vendor everything 1-40 as well as skip every useless spell and useless rank, you will have your mount by 40.
---
How reliably, though? I understand you're talking from the perspective of a hardcore player who wants to hit 60 ASAP, but I'm not that person so I'm curious as to how reliably I would be able to get my mount gold prior to level 40 without skinning.
---
&gt;Leveling non gathering prof before 60 is a complete waste of time
---
Couldn't agree more, I like to think this much is obvious but I'm sure there will be people focusing on it at level 10 :P
---
Man I cannot disagree with you more, at least in the 5man context. Threat is the single greatest mechanic ever invented. A proper game design is one such that you won't always be able to maintain threat on every single target. This means that while you're doing your best, mobs are going to go after other members of the group. This then means everybody is now forced to use their various abilities to survive. Where the very linear mechanics of modern WoW dungeons lead to identical solutions for each group which usually involves either dancing around positionally or popping your defensive cool downs at the right time, threat is a simple mechanic that allows for emergent gameplay making every group composition feel very different.
---
I played mage in classic. It's not a hard time levelling at all, especially as frost - survivability just gets better, you have so many tricks up your sleeve. AOE grinding if you can borrow a healer for a couple of hours at a time can make you (and them) a ton of exp very quickly.
---
stunlock is your only option I guess.
---
Do I need to retype this command every time I log in or it stays forever? Thanks for the info btw!
---
:D I am not telling everyone what to play ffs. I am telling there should be **MORE** PvP realms than PvE, 2 times at minimum. Its the whole point lmao. If there are 2 PvE realms, there should be 4 PvP or more from the start! And you said the ONE particular reason for it yourself too - friends want to pvp, so you are going with them on PvP realm, while you are not pvping at all.
---
Yes! I spent so long getting my NE exalted with SW to be able to ride a damn horse!
---
Stalagg is looking good from this data.
---
I hope they open more servers today so population doesn’t get crazy (crazier?) on some of these servers though.
---
dagger specs are fun in theory but in practice, they aren't so much. Fairly gear dependent as well.
---
Sorry I don’t know what you mean by second and third levels of my favorite city
---
Murloc Agro sound was my notification sound for years, time to bring it back!
---
Am fellow CS graduate with a job who just wants to play Classic, can confirm am jealous.
---
I booked next week off but after that's over it's 10 hours of Classic per week for me.
---
Gnoll and Murloc sounds are permanently etched into my brain.
---
&gt;would it be possible to spec paladin to be a hybrid between healer and tank
---
Considering paladins already lack taunts and cc, probably not. Honestly though, you'd want to be leveling in a DPS spec anyway just for convenience. Found a guide that suggests there's a leveling spec that's capable of tanking for classic pally.
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/paladin/leveling-1-60/
---
Most healers lvl in dps and just heal with what their class offers, this guide suggests once you hit 40 as a paladin you'll be capable of healing with that.
---
In that spec it looks more like you wouldn't really be able to do enough heals to be a healer though.
---
I don't know how many times people need to note that it isn't just technological limitations that cause queues. It's a clean way to have population control to ensure removing layers is as smooth as possible.  
---
Queues now &gt; Dead servers later
---
No. Just dont pre hot ;)
---
Very good point! Thank you for being honest, and still providing me with great feedback &amp; help man!!
---
So I’m more or less a lone wolf. Do you know classicast? A guest talked about a certain personality test, which could potentially pick a fitting class for you. I scored individualist, meaning rogue was my top choice. I’m also super minimalistic, which seem to fit a rogue just fine (considering the skills and all).
---
I’ll be playing with a group of friends, though I prefer to play alone. I was thinking that if I group up with them, I could sneak around and stun their healer and grenade one of the other backliners. 
---
Mage seems amazing for grouping though. Intellect buff, conjuring, teleporting... slow fall... defending flag carrier... 
---
But then again, a rogue can defend as well
---
Rank 11+ gear is kinda unrealistic. It takes an extremely long time to get that. I’d aim for the blue PvP set which starts around rank 5 and ends at rank 10. 
---
Off the top of my head, warrior and hunter PvP sets are amazing. You can even raid while wearing some pieces of them because they’re that good and the set bonus is good too. That’s all I can remember. Just google “Which PvP tier sets are best in vanilla” and you should find some answers
---
Tbf, VLC is one of the best pieces of software ever made. It's just not exactly filled with features for music-playback
---
You can't even read the dps meter like the dps meter in classic. It's the toughest boss in the game and will wipe you orders of magnitude more times than any other boss.
---
T. H. I. S.
---
It's not like EU has many big streamers. And those that do go on the EU servers and will stream are pretty spread out - Pilav on golemagg, AnnieFuchsia on Shazzrah, Nixxiom on Zandalar Tribe and last I heard Preach was going on Gehennas. I don't really know any other 'known' streamers on EU side.
---
As a lock when I do that, I always appreciate but am not expecting a heal. Often you have more food than drink so you'd rather life tap than eat. Or you have bandages so you can tap and bandage. Or you're okay starting a fight at low hp since you can just siphon and drain life on the next pull.
---
Vitas - Seventh Element on repeat. Only song you need.
---
I read literally 4 of them to know that it's a "No".
---
These open letters to retail players are so cringe
---
weed? wat
---
Hah you assume I will get past the queue in the first week
---
&gt; Should I roll horde to have the queue pop up more often?
---
Battlegrounds are going to be shared between servers, on nearly every pvp server that answered the poll horde are more populated (probably a relic of retail being horde tilted).
---
I'd roll alliance if that's your main concern, with admittedly incomplete info.
---
Jokes on you, I'll be the one tanking AND the one that's OOM
---
Just to clarify, since this uses the /who query, it only shows the top *online* player right?
---
Get your neckbeard out of here
---
About the same if you played on the west coast plus a time difference from some of the player base
---
&gt; I mean.... If you are playing on PvE realm, you are missing like 50% of the game literally while leveling. And while leveling is like 8 days played for average player, you will miss a lot.
---
Again. Anyone who has no interest in PvP whatsoever will not miss anything, yet your post **implies** it to essentially be the only way to play the game, even if the intention of it is not that.
---
Question is... did you get the name Thex?
---
Plenty of people with that attitude made it to UBRS on pservers, and plenty of them will make it in classic too
---
It's a reference to the song Smoke Two Joints by the Toyes
---
This has never been claimed by anyone.
---
Do you live in Arkansas
---
the quote is a parody of smoke two joints
---
It's a mmorpg the games built around playing with other people. You can lvl to 60 solo but you'll find you might have a hard time. As a rogue at Max lvl you'll be one of the classes that does the best damage for raiding and pvp. In pvp you'll be especially deadly as you can stealth and hide from people trying to go you or you can get someone in a 10 second stunlock and kill them.
---
15th of October, I'll take that. Better than I'd initially calculated!
---
Somehow got the first binding in the guild as some noob rogue because nobody wanted to waste their DKPs at the beginning of MC. I naively farmed all my arcanite bars swiftly... and the second binding never dropped for the rest of vanilla (something like a year and a half?) and then well into TBC (I kept going most weeks). I still get triggered just thinking about it!
---
Thank you for the reply! That sounds absolutely amazing lol.
---
How would a rogue earn their salary? They don’t seem the type to AoE farm
---
You will have some good laughs.....
---
That mouse started the Black Plague.
---
Gonna play the druid of druids
---
11/19/21 spec baby!
---
It is kinda funny I thought for a second Anduin had voice actor? He is just generic little boy modul and realized he probably grown up in retail wow.
---
Best reply so far, ty
---
The blue bar is a dungeon timer, the lower it gets the faster you have to go to finish the dungeon on time.
---
Eh both the original joke and the response were pretty funny.
---
oh I didn't know that, thank you!
---
I thought it was just too offensive because of the dwarf killing
---
Man, look...Blizzard was 100% convinced that Classic will FLOP. Now, Classic is a monster. Really. A Low Pop now is a Full in 2006. A full was 12-13k total players. Run the numbers with Medium being twice as big as low, and Full twice as big as Medium, with High being 1.5 x Medium.
---
Just the people who reserved names are over 1.5 million on NA+EU+China ... TODAY. 
---
Blizzard is basically in overdrive mode now, unable to understand what is happening...and the problem is that they STILL think that Classic will flop, because they believe that people are flocking on HYPE and NOSTALGIA.
---
Blizzard is so unprepared for this, and all because they think they know better.
---
Fun but a bit inaccurate (from my own personal experience) might be more accurate for others.
---
This whining is a joke. Get over it and changer servers or deal with the queues.
---
I got January 2020. RIP.
---
Monday 6 January 2020
---
Wow, you played a harder game, I'm so impressed, doesn't change the fact that retail leveling is a button masher and a time sink designed to get you to buy level boosts. And no one claims that vanilla raiding is going to be more difficult, luckily the rest of the end game is not yet ruined in vanilla. Raiding and mythics are ALL that BFA has going for it, everything else is filler and timegating to keep you logging in every day.
---
I think the proto-drakes in WotLK did this best because there was a different version depending on which activity you were dedicated to. If you were a pvp player, a dungeon guy, a raid god, etc. Different colors for each was cool because it was a nice identifier.
---
Touche
---
... through trees, walls and rocks even across great distances ....
---
Oooooh, sorry, it's a bit late and I haven't had much sleep
---
I'm starting to feel like this in comparison to my friends. I've played on private servers since 2011 and am very familiar with vanilla/BC/WotLK. I've got a group of friends/guildies who I've moved from private server to private server with over the past few years.   
---
We've all applied and been accepted into a guild which turns out to be way more hardcore than I had thought. They're a long time vanilla private server guild and seem to be going for Oceanic #1 or close to it. Mandatory engineering for every raider, optimal consumes, optimal specs, be 60 and ready to raid within a month, yadda yadda.  
---
It's not that I can't do it or don't have the time, but god it's starting to seem like less of something I want to do and more of an obligation. Everyone else is *super hyped* to grind out those levels, 4 hours sleep a night, optimize their route! And I'm just here feeling like I'd enjoy myself more chilling on a PvE server...
---
If you’re into the lore and story of WoW, I’d recommend them. They aren’t amazingly written, but they expand the world, which is fun.
---
Cured Rugged Hides aren't used for much in phase 1. Devilsaur Leggings is for sure one, some Shamans/Paladins/Druids are probably going to want the Corehound Belt, and some hunters/shamans might want some Black Dragonscale pieces - but they only take 1 each. The big uses for it are mostly Hide of the Wild (phase 2) and the Primal Batskin pieces from ZG rep (phase 4) and Frost resist gear later on (phase 6)
---
Yes they can, but some people prefere other zones.
---
ok
---
All I want are slow dead horsey and fast dead horsey.
---
While I finally grinders out my netherwing I just spent hours flying around the Outlands. It was like a childhood dream come true to finally be able to fly a dragon in a game.
---
my favorite stories are the one where someone misses 1 week because of a funeral out of state or something and the piece drops lol.  just pure fucking salt
---
Same as me :) 70hours a week lvl 60 in 21 days tues 17 sep:)
---
Now this is shitposting
---
Is there a level req for expert and artisan prof skills? Or could you potentially fuel a tailoring alt indefinitely?
---
Your post history shows over 100 posts a day. Get a life!
---
Global release, has always been advertised on the 26th for US
---
Varies a bit.  As a holy priest, I can heal most Legion/BfA content without needing to take a drink.  Unless the tank is below-average (or the group is) and stands in bad / pulls too fast / runs ahead.
---
There were definitely some times during leveling where I was drinking on every 3rd to 5th pull.
---
Best rogue class for pvp and pve is pretty close between human and gnome, both have very good racials but gnomes lean more towards better for pvp.
---
Best priest race in all of classic is dwarf because they get a dwarf priest racial that is a fear ward you can cast on others and it’s extremely useful
---
Doesn't matter to some uncultered ppl
---
Demo leveling is superior to destro. Destro leveling is extremely bad.
---
Demo raiding is the best (assuming you go for demonic sac)
---
Demo dungeon is the + (demon sac)
---
Destro battleground is better than demo, should get a plus
---
Destro wpvp is probably the best out of all specs, atleast a plus
---
This list is very poor, Im sorry.
---
Don't do it. And if you do make sure you tell your guild so that they know why you aren't performing. No need to drag other players down with you.
---
“Trigger” didn’t exist bruh- use the proper term. “Rage” /“troll” the trigger baby came later from
---
These two terms.

---
You can't do the math? It's simple subtraction.
---
# MOVEMENT:  
---
WASD are your movement keys. W is forward, S is backward, A and D rotate your character. You can also use your mouse to help you move. If you hold left click and drag around it pans the camera around. If you hold right click and drag it does the same thing but also rotates your character. Your mousewheel can be used to zoom in and out from your character. Lots of people play zoomed out all the way, but just do whatever feels comfortable to you.  
---
# INTERACTING:  
---
Move up to an NPC (Non-Playable Character) and right click on them to talk to them. This is how you'll pick up quests and open dialog options. Left clicking makes their portrait appear next to your in the top left. When you right click on another player's portrait you can interact with them. If you right click an enemy players model you begin to:  
---
# ATTACK:  
---
Once you right click an enemy, no matter how far away it is, you'll see your character go into an attack-mode animation. Once you move into melee range you'll begin swinging your weapon, or if you have a bow/gun you'll begin shooting them when in the appropriate range.  
---
# SPELLS:  
---
Your number row is your spell row. By default spells will be placed on 1, then 2, etc. Pressing these keys while in range of an enemy (also known as a "mob" from here on out) will begin your spellcast. You'll see a progress bar pop up in the bottom-middle of your screen. When it finishes you'll see your spell fire out from your character and hit the mob! If you don't like how your spells are placed on your spellbar you can hold Shift and then left click the spells and drag them to different spots.  
---
# KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:  
---
There are a good amount of menus in the game that will be very useful for you as you adventure. Here are a few of the more important ones:  
---
* C - Opens up your Character tab where you can see your gear, stats, etc.  
---
* P - Opens up your spell book where you can drag newly learned spells onto your spellbar.  
---
* B - Opens up your bags, or inventory. Anything you loot from mobs goes in here.
---
* ESC - Opens up the options menu to change your system settings.
---
# GETTING STARTED:  
---
Pick a server... whatever your fiance has chosen. Pick a faction... again, just play whatever your fiance has chosen. Pick a class: there are brief summaries on the right side of the character creation screen. Just pick whatever sounds most fun to you. Each class has its own role to fill in the game and the most important thing is that you're having fun with the class that you're playing.
---
Once you enter the game and watch the intro cinematic it's time to begin playing. Move your character to the NPC that has a "!" over its head. The "!" denotes that this NPC has a quest to give you. Read it over and go complete your quest. When you've done the objective you'll see that the "!" has turned into a "?" This means that the quest is complete and ready to turn in for some juicy experience points. 
---
Speaking of Experience ponits (XP), there is a long horizontal bar on the very bottom of your UI. That is your level progress. Fill it up and you'll gain a level!
---
Continue talking to NPCs to gather quests and complete them to continue your adventure.

While adventuring around, make sure to try and find your Class Trainer. They are the ones that will teach you new spells and ranks of spells.  
---

---
That's enough to get your feet wet and get you able to move around and interact with your world. There is a TON more to learn, such as Professions, Dungeons, PvP, etc... but once you get into the game and start playing you'll organically encounter of all of those. I hope this helps!!  
---
Sorry if it was a bit long lol... I'm bored at work and have nothing but Classic on the mind :) Enjoy your new adventure!
---
Tuesday 10 September, doubt I'll be that fast though lol
---
Yes, exactly. Go away with that "waahh muh circlejerk" crap please.
---
Seriously this is insane.
---
Middle school was the glory days...kissed a girl for the first time in middle school too lol :D
---
Ah yes, you definitely didn't post this an excuse to show off the sign
---
The tank gearing requirements were a pretty big wall to many guilds making it past Patchwerk.
---
Yeah exactly.
---
I hope it stays like that years later also!
---
This is probably the most solid advice in the thread. Movement controls will make or break your experience. I almost forgot about that, then added it to my list of tips.
---
nope! lol
---
&gt;A wise man knows that he does not know
---
I read that in a Tauren voice, made me smile.
---
I thought this would help him understand that he can still technically PvP on a PVE realm.
---
It’s the original realm description from the original manual that came in the Vanilla WoW box in 2004.
---
That's just the best place to take the photos in our office :D
---
It is a massive problem. NA servers have been warned that so many players will be logging in at the same time they won't even be able to join the queue, they will just get an error. They really think they will be dropping down to 3500ish concurrent players at a time? I don't agree with the theory that blizzard WANTS classic to fail but it feels like they are trying to push new players away and setting the scene for a shitshow.
---
I feel like it would be a better move for the game to make too many servers and consolidate as needed but instead we have added more benches to make people wait instead of playing. Multiple hour long queues are predicted for the NA est normal servers and it boggles my fucking mind that we don't have another opened yet. Demand is there. Throw one up there or else the population limits on the handful of servers we have will be a self fulfilling prophecy for long term population. 
---
Everyone thinks layering will push people back to pservers but I'm pretty sure it is going to be sitting in queue for two hours a night when you only have 3 hours to play before bed.
---
If I didn't experience a queue, if feel bad. I want the longest waits possible. The longer the queues, the better.
---
Sunday 12 December...2021
---
I dont even... 
---
do we tell him?
---
For most players coming from retail, who haven't experienced classic, those first 20 levels are going to be so much more gratifying. 
---
On retail, I can log on, equip my heirlooms (which I bought instead of earned) one shot 10 mobs and be level 10. 
---
Classic, you have to work for every level, you have to earn money for your skills, you have to read the quests, and you have to find the monsters based on directions without a giant yellow blip on the map. That gratification for hard work is there from the get-go.
---
Only one way to find out dude!
---
Leveling up a character is just such a bizarre, disjointed experience at this point.
---
I don't really see the problem. This helps people finding groups by not requiring them to be in certain zones to do so. You will still have community, because you will still know the people, there won't be anonymity and there won't be cross-realm functionality. You won't teleport to a dungeon either. It's not modern LFG at all.
---
My patcher had to update. Thanks.
---
So fuckin hype
---
Works flawlessly with lutris for me
---
Hey, fuck you.
---
That crowd is still here eating popcorn.
---
I'm loving the meltdowns.
---
I wish you luck!
---
Very well said, this always meant a lot to me
---
Always! See you on the other side! LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
By reading their Blue Posts, AMAs, and counting the realms. It's not really hard to see that either : 
---
\-Blizzard are a bunch of idiots
---
or
---
\-Blizzard believed that Classic will flop, they see that Classic is already, with reserve names only, bigger than BfA, and they are in panic mode.
---
Doesn't matter if Blizzard makes a load of money from Classic. They didn't PLANNED for this to happen. They actually PLANNED (and they still are) for Classic to flop, and they PLANNED a certain expenses, on a certaim time frame.
---
Now, all their plans are gone to the shitter...UNLESS they intentionally sabotage Classic. The Classic team WANTS Classic to succeed...but JAB and suits and Activision REALLY don't.
---
And guess WHO is actually in charge of servers? The Classic team, or the suits? Well, it is the suits.
---
The main feedback I would give is it doesn't make much sense to break down the builds into the three talent trees. I'm really not sure what demonology warlock means in this context. Is it DS/Ruin or SL/NF? One of this builds is good at PVE and bad at PVP the other is good at PVP and bad at PVE but both are demonology specs.
---
Sad but true
---
Tbf, you did get rekt
---
Lmfao “quite amazed”
---
Fuck you
---
Okay this feels so weird seeing him all grown up and so expressive.
---
ahh some nice pre-launch drama. love it
---
Fuck you too
---
casual gaming, 12h/week, warrior = Mid March
---
I'm so looking forward to this :)
---
Are you really paying for 5 accounts? :D
---
warlocks can already beat other casters while rogue is the counter to warlocks especially UD rogue. i played an alliance warlock and very rarely did breaking a fear win or lose a fight for me (lock trinket also breaks fear btw).  
---
Having a rogue second guess his stunlock on you is the best racial by far. and just the thought of resisting a 5 point kidney shot makes me very happy. also consider other classes that dont have control a rogue does. if you resist a warriors intercept stun and he failed to hamstring you then you can kite him till he is dead. resisting a paladins stun could be an instant fight winner as they usually stun before a heal. i can just see alot more situations that stun resist will help compared to WOTF given alliance locks are already an underplayed class combination.
---
What could potentially change that would unable hunters to do tribute runs?
---
Just do it in one big sleep.
---
Just follow the quests. I mean you will lose your thread if you randomly pick up and move to another zone, but it isn't a walkthrough like the Witcher games.
---
You are not prepared.
---
1,000/900g if you were honored with the faction I believe.
---
This. As long as your GPU supports Vulkan for dxvk
---
So you can store soulshards in them then just put the bag away in the bank? Damn thats a helpful tip.
---
There's no official support, but as far as I know WoW should be able to run under Linux through Wine. It has gotten harder since they dropped OpenGL and exclusively support DirectX, though.
---
Something like [https://www.maketecheasier.com/play-world-of-warcraft-ubuntu/](https://www.maketecheasier.com/play-world-of-warcraft-ubuntu/) should help. There's a bunch of guides on Google.
---
This guy is so mad
---
Yeah, no shit. No one likes waiting in line.
---
Jesus fucking christ can these people get a life
---
Yeah, a lot of the rigidness of the old animations was just how basic and old they are. In Warcraft 3 characters bounced a shit ton.
---
I much prefer my tauren to be a bit bouncier, even if it looks a bit off, rather than run like a robot dressed in cardboard cutout.
---
Allegedly a lot of the animation staff worked on Wildstar, so I admit that might be a factor.
---
Tuesday* 
---
Rise up, Euro bros!
---
Well you can properly play with Wine on a Linux OS.
---
Ahhhh! That’s super difficult hahahaha. I think that’s where my problem lies 😂
---
I actually loves threat - having to pace DPS in BWL on Vael was one of my absolute favorite constructs introduced into raiding. 
---
It’s literally a DPS race where you need to pace.

Good suggestion! The clunkiness can be annyoing. Especially when I'm used to jumping around doing front-flips when walking. I will check out the fem version.

Watchmen.

I see this all the time, heal meters do not show you who is better. Same with healing parses, if you perform very high your raid sucks.

In uk too, luckily (I guess) I've just fractured my hand so I'll be off work next week, mouse fingers are a bit saw but I'll soldier it for wow.

Blizzard needs to tell us the amount of player in each server, telling people to move is not as easy as it seems guilds have planned stuff, formed alliances and whatnots.
---
Blizzards needs to release the following information for the Full servers:
---
* How many player are on each server
---
* How many chars players have on just one server
---
* How many players have a char on 3 servers (like me Golemagg, Zandalar Tribe and Gehennas)
---
* What was the percentage of player that choose their first char on the full Server, that still have that char there
---
For the Love of Elune, lock the full server already, i was still have to create a char today in Shazzhra to test it before reverting to my 3 above
---
This would help guilds officers make a proper overview of players mindsets. and what games some of them are playing
---
Oh boy, that didn't take long.

31 October...
---
...2020. 
---
Kids, job etc. Not put off - still really excited to play.
---
Might be the only way Asmongold can win a mount competition
---
sounds nice, bfa to me just feels like one big chain of quests. getting to the next area feels almost not rewarding at all and ou just rush through areas without even exploring them properly.
---
That gave a good laugh =D
---
Yup, they did, but that doesn't mean increasing amounts of cartoonishness are good.
---
It's like the cataclysm quests.  WC3 and early WoW always had movie references and a bit of silliness, so they thought 'surely if we crank it up to 11 with Harrison Jones it will fit!'
---
It's a balance, someone is just saying they think the balance fell a bit too far on the side of cartoony.
---
I laughed way to hard (and long) 
---
Kudos!
---
The skill cap in ffxi was high for endgame. You can level all day with mush in your brain.
---
A lot of people voice their concern about this scenario, but what makes you think Gehennas will become empty when all the tourists quit? If anything, I think most of the tourists are going to Shazzrah, so what if Shazzrah becomes empty instead of Gehennas?
---
As the others have said, there's probably 4-5 times the amount of people on both of these realms than there were on Vanilla realms. Even if 80% of the people quit, you'll still have a well populated realm!
---
Ahh vanish cloak sprint wotf if applicable.
---
I wanted to level race but honestly I’m just going to stop giving a shit about it and play when I can with a friend. Try to be efficient when I’m on but I don’t see the point of beelining 60 (though others might enjoy the challenge) when exploring is one of the strengths of Classic’s more substantial levelling experience.
---
Everyone who logs in on day 1, will not be playing wow classic in 20 years. All are tourists.
---
You can't have more than 10 layers, and that is for 90% drop-off. So, the theoretical maximum number of layers is 10. The actual number of layers is smaller, probably 7, maybe 8.
---
And 8 layers is 24k-30k people. Anything above that goes into queue.
---
That's sweet. If I gear for elemental (int, spell power, what not), wouldnt that be the same as gear for when I am healing? Implying I dont have carry extra if I focus on ele?

In about 6 months I got. 1 Eye of Sulphuras. Both bindings of the windseeker. Ashes of Al'ar and Onyxian Drake. 
---
On my hunter.
---
I made Thunderfury tho.
---
Honestly the old models moved like robots. The new ones look too lively by comparison but frankly I prefer them over BEEP BOOP I AM A TAUREN.

Will just have to fly her out there and kill her. RIP gramgram :(
---
Warlock has a little more to it than mage to be honest, levelling is much more fun as you have a bit more of a rotation. You have lots of viable specs in PVP and a few different viable specs in PVE, though most likely you'll be speccing Demo/Destro hybrid for shadowbolt spam at first. 
---
In PVE endgame, both unfortunately tend to be one button (shadowbolt or frostbolt). You both have good CC. Warlock comes with free class mount which is nice, summons, soulstone and healthstone. Mage with water and portals.
---
Honestly, it's a close toss up, but I'd go warlock as I think it's more interesting/fun, and also one of the best classes to level in the game.
---
Sadly, it only has the graphics built into the Gen 2 i3 thats in it. Guess im stuck to my desk then.
---
I keep starting the client to look at the realm list and my characters, and then I close it again. That's when I stare at my empty screen for the rest of the night contemplating my life.
---
who's gonna sit on it all day?
---
Wait, I didn’t know Valve still developed games. If that’s the case I’ll take one Portal 3, please. Or Portal 2: Episode 2.
---
Even if you don't rp it's fun to see. Nice to see people standing in circles facing each other or walking together following roads.
---
I think I’ve just made up my mind!
---
Sweet reddit name.
---
Come roll horde on Grobbie (RP-PVP), give into the fun side.
---
From what I have gathered over at the mage discord it seems that 3/3 blizz is the way to go
---
Retail quests are a dull rollercoaster. You're sheparded from zone to zone and can rarely even finish each zones story before being told to move on. It's awful. In Classic a lot of the quests are way more memorable because there's so few of them that when you get a really long one it feels truly epic. 
---
Do yourself a favour and look up what you have to do if you want to be a Scarab Lord.
---
Blizzard's denomination of characters actually means players. Players do not enter the game...characters do.
---
Has nothing to so with What I Said...?!
---
When you watch oldschool pvp videos, it's actually not all that common at all...  World of Roguecraft, Drakedog, Grim...  None of these used enemy castbars.
---
Haha me too. New year's day 2020
---
&gt; Change my mind! 
---
No reason. The best server for you is shazzrah.
---
Thank you so much for this. Aux was easily my favorite vanilla/pserver addon, I'm looking forward to using it in classic!

Being a priest and getting wrecked by melee while I’m just trying to heal my bros in bgs.

that the spirit of classic what are u talking about ??
---
i will use this addon and still contact people to join a group ....
---
Ffuuck every time that I see the old models I think that return to classic will be hard.
---
No worries, my wife will make sure I keep my playtime tight /sigh
---
giggdy!
---
Right. But it's also art.  And created before the black morass dungeon was ever created. So the artist might not have known exactly what it looked like.  They just told the them " make it look like azeroth in there "
---
This is the only answer worth its salt imo.
---
I got no idea what this is but once again, I’m hyped!!!
---
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard had to roll thru town the 2nd day of classic launch. I had to get tickets as I’m sure it will be a rare show but I’m going to be itching to play!
---
I'm going to murder death kill them all.
---
Is slavery a thing in the Warcraft world? I dont remember it ever being mentioned, except Thralls name being based on a different word for it.
---
faaaaalse false false.

&gt;last I heard Preach was going on Gehennas.

Preach is going on Shazzrah along with Bellular and Bay

What’s the best way to search for guilds ? Specially if an new to t wow . Looks like most websites for guild search are not updated

We'll see how hard you laugh this Sunday, when Firemaw hits Full...

---
hahaha same how stressful is it.
---
[Don't forget this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJRfamtVJ1U)
---
They could have been running several side PUG or alt groups once they moved past MC as main raid nights.
---
But there are more than 400 mounts now. Seems a bit over saturated to me. More mounts was added in BFA than the last two expansions together, and it has only been out for a year. And a lot of these mounts has nothing to do with achieving anything. You can buy them for irl money.
---
But if you like that, it's cool. I just don't like it personally. Even though they might look cool, they lose all their prestige and "wow" factor. No one cares that you have X mount anymore.
---
Doesn't really make sense to base it off /played time, especially when there's stuff like afk in cities.
---
Wonder what the death toll will be from classic wow
---
A well timed kick is kicking just before the spell goes off, to get the extra \~2 seconds of their time wasted.
---
Based off what I’ve found, people can perform exceptionally well, WOW raids are cake compared to current ffxiv savage, I’ll be absolutely fine with a controller. Bye elitist piece of crap.

---
I absolutely love your art style, but your evaluations of classes has always been off. This one takes it to a new level, I don't think you get a single thing right. 
---
Seriously though, the art is god-damn amazing.
---
good for you, congrats
---
I used that ponytail on 1.12. private servers.
---
Check out discords for your server, many are looking for players
---
This is my thought exactly! I'll gladly RP lightly if I'm greeted on the road or something, but it wouldn't be my passion or anything. But I think RPers add so much to a server, immersion-wise, that I'm always happy to see any kind of RP community.
---
Well... maybe not the E kind.
---
Ruined by the hunched over posture.
---
Has anybody changed their response to Spanish Shazzrah after that?
---
Don't break my heart.
---
Pickpocketing BRD is fairly viable, so is soloing low level dungeons for chests, BoEs and just loot to sell. 
---
Other than that, they have access to all the regular farming methods: main professions, cooking and fishing, grinding particular mobs for rare drops or recipes... The list is quasi endless.
---
what's sex?

You can ez google warlock specs. But there what i have got from wow wiki https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock_builds/Level_60

---
I'm torn between Restau Shaman, and Mage.
---
RSham is pretty much my first choice, I healed throughout most of my wow experience, but I am very worried that the simplistic healing mechanics in classic could bore me...
---
Given that most, if not all, healing classes don't have a viable dps spec in pve, should I take this risk?
---
Is there really no place for either enh or ele shamans in classic? If so can I hope to be decent?
---
Let’s see the hunter! :P
---
It goes like this I'm pretty sure, double-check me with google though
---
level 5=75
---
level 10=150
---
level 20=225
---
level 35=300
---
Can’t take a boat? I remember there being a boat
---
assuming the DPS are not idiotic and decide to pull for you because they dont understand the delay. cant wait to not touch the mob i dont pull and watch it sail on by to 1shot someone
---
I mean...I would prob look for the quest for whoever goes down on that thing.
---
Cause that shit costs money.  One thing to take a guess and say "let's have all this spare stuff fired up and on stand-by 'just in case'".  It's another when that "just in-case" is costing you a large chunk of money every day.
---
I think Druids are able to solo the last boss in Mara aswell.
---
I don't have to imagine...
---
That was like the standard raid tank weapon on our server I wouldn't worry too much
---
So happy you made the warlock a gnome. Been following these for weeks. Great work!
---
Can’t really comment on the type of lore experience you’re speaking to but being a Druid and having the whole emerald dream lore feels really cool. Not that I’d necessarily recommend hybrid classes but Druids are very, very special.
---
for sure... luckily shamans are plenty and probably the best to bring along to WC... tremor totem and earth shock clutch through the whole instance.
---
What is layering? I am dumb.
---
He put it behind a paywall a couple days ago
---
Wowlive has a skip where you run to barrens, die in the hills, and res in westfall.
---
Looking at this makes my peepee tingle
---
Yes, I got that. If you end up being ahead of the pack and aoe leveling becomes a possibility then by all means respec and stay ahead of the pack by aoe leveling. But for 99% of the people rolling on launch they will be single target leveling.
---
Shoo flea
---
Idk I've mained tauren since vanilla. I like the new models a lot. Only complaint I have is females mouth breathing while idle but that's it.
---
They bounce a bit but so does every race, that's just the style they went with. And I prefer it over the robotic animatronic run that tauren used to have.
---
Can we get an RP tag added to the type of content?
---
Blizzard just said that even a "low" server now equals a "high-full" server in vanilla. So far only the hardcore people who knew about/cared about reservation has even made their chars. Gehennas will be full with hour long queues like the other servers come launch and afterwards.
---
Another post the last few days told we could get to around \~4/21k revered with every darnassus and alliance spillover quest, that would be without the human racial, which would put another \~2.4k on top. The missing reputation needs to be farmed with morrowgrain or runecloth. 
---
I'm doing it myself as a gnome and I don't expect to have a saber before 60, maybe I will get my mechanostrider first and have it as a longtime goal as I don't want to farm it on a slow mount. Depends on how long I need to farm and how expensive runecloth will be at the time.
---
LFG Stone Tower Temple
---
This was my thought process as well. I expected the initial servers to have an unusual mix of BFA people, and hardcore people.
---
why don't you read talents and decide what YOU need atm?
---
Guess playing games by yourself is long gone
---
I think a lot of returning players having this thinking...
---
Not looking forward to gear that doesn't match unless you wear full tier
---
No cloak in classic. :P
---
I was personally invested in early 2000s Eurodance during my Vanilla time. Good list nonetheless!
---
There is also a website called canyourunit.com i believe (otherwise google the phrase) that runs a little program to see if your PC is up to the task.
---
Uhm because it did....in like 2 levels?
---
No need to equip the bag first, you can store them like any other item in your bank.
---
I’m wondering what class to play, was hoping someone can help out! So my problem is an injury in my hand that limits my ability to spam buttons. I want to raid casually once lvl 60 and I want a flexible class that will enable me to heal/tank in 5 mans for gear. So which class will have least spammy rotations / require least button pressing/movements incl. WASD. I want to enjoy all PVE content without having pains in my hand after raiding for hours. What do u suggest, I’m also considering pure dps class like I played back in the days.
---
But they could be used to spell out gold seller websites. Gee, I sure hope there aren't any chat channels that are abused in an easier manner...
---
You don't need to reset the fight. As soon as you are opened on, you get one chance to cast polymorph before you die. If it fails, you're not going to have time for another.
---
I work/live in Japan so I'll miss launch... plus I have to go out of town the first weekend after launch. Pretty much the worst. Just started a new job 3 weeks ago or I would have used PTO &gt;&lt;
---
in the sidebar you can edit your flair
---
May I have a dm to the link too please?
---
This is brilliant, cheers!
---
Generally speaking, WoW runs flawlessly on Linux with WINE and recent enough drivers (Vulkan/DXVK), Lutris helps a ton in setting the game extremely easily.
---
Debian though (stable) has usually too old libs that can give you serious headaches. I tried LMDE (it's based on Debian stable) and I couldn't make it work.
---
I had no problems before with Xubuntu (for a couple of years) then a few weeks ago I switched to Solus and I'm very happy with it. I'm playing retail ofc, but there's no reason why Classic shouldn't run as well, maybe even better.
---
You need some Ill Niño in there to make it 10x better.
---
Thrall’s balls!
---
taking anything in destruction wont help you leveling. Ive sunk much time into lock and love playing destro but for leveling its much better to just pop points into demo. Using SB will leave you with no mana while dots+wand is easy 2-3 targets finishing with almost full. mana and hp
---
Blizzard has stated that they aren't doing this for the money, although I'm sure they will recoup the costs of production (at least) - they are primarily doing this for the community that has been passionate for it at a level that's probably unprecedented for a video game.
---
Ok, quick tip for my working brethren:. 
---
Install teamviewer on your pc and phone. Boot up your computer in the morning before leaving for work.  
---
When you're 2 hours from being home, log in through your phone, starting the queue. So you can be logged in when you finally arrive.  
---
And if you end up logged in advance just jump around to not be DC'd so you can play straight away when arriving.
---
Gonna be playing a troll priest as main. Couple of questions.
---
1. What professions should I take while leveling? I probably want to end up with Tailoring and Engineering - is it fine to go mining + engi while leveling, and does it benefit low levels, or is it better just going skinning + tailoring?
---
2. I'll be probably playing this entirely holy spec at 60 - what would you suggest is the best farmer as an alt? Mage?
---
Thanks for the info. And yes, Ive read that on here. I figure ill just stay a level or two longer in a zone before advancing if things get too rough. Gives me more time to enjoy the story anyways.
---
Thinking the same thing
---
Vanilla WoW, to put it bluntly, is a much more naive project. Blizzard was making their first MMO that was also much different than many that came before. It's far from perfect, but they tried to make a fun well rounded game in hope that something would stick and that it wouldn't be a complete failure. Modern Blizzard didn't make WoW into what it is because they're dumb, but because they are smart and know how to get most money out of people with the least amount of effort. Numbers add up for them, and they don't mind that 40% of the playbase leaves as long as the rest ends up paying twice as much. What Vanilla has to offer is the end of those mind games and psychology algebra to figure out if going through the money and/or padding is going to be worth the fun somewhere in the future. If I want to have fun in Vanilla, I pull three murlocks instead of two and see if I can take them. In BFA I know I can, and I don't care, they are just 3/12 murlocks I need to get for 1/4 quests I need for rep cache which gives me 200/20k rep I need to unlock 1/8 allied races. The challenge isn't the fight, it's pushing through the gruelling timesink. I'd prefer even the type of grind that's just killing the same mob over and over again, because that's at least something you can push through, while logging in every day to do 4 slightly different quests is like Chinese water torture.
---
I mean it helps when the game doesnt require new development aside from getting it to work on live servers.  It's almost free money for them.  I am glad that they aren't charging sub fee if I play retail and classic.
---
&gt;A warlock is a medium-fast leveling class. If you are playing an average of 46 hours per week and your leveling speed is fast you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...  Friday 27 September 2019
---
So about 7.666 (repeating of course) days of /played... not too far off reality I feel.
---
Well in PvP could be a good flex.
---
Well, you apparently care enough to post on reddit.
---
Gear is of very little importance for race leveling, mostly just avoiding sleep for 6 days...
---
Let's pretend they did that for a moment. What I see happening in this scenario: someone attempting to join a server a day after launch to join their friends, but they can't because the server is full. So, they're forced to join another server and tell their friends that they need to move to the low pop server he joined. Some of his friends are not happy with that, because a) the high/full server they were able to join (which, remember, won't quite have the ridiculous queues it currently does because of the instituted pop cap) is sure to have more going on and therefore provide a reasonably better experience than a low pop server, and b) some of those people have already invested time into their characters, and are unwilling to move. These people will then complain, "Why not just let people sign up on whatever server they want, and just us deal with the queues? Over time the queues will lessen, and people will be able to play with their friends on whatever server they choose! Waiting is certainly better than locking people out and forcing friends to move if they want to play with each other!"
---
To be honest, I prefer dealing with the queues. The queues, though annoying, won't be a problem for long, because historically they never have been.
---
No longer shall we dally with the exploits of Chuck Norris, Barrens chat will thunder with the clashing of the SJWs and the MAGAtards. Glorious battle awaits.
---
I see! Thanks :)
---
I was just looking over the talents and thinking about how that could work. I'm pretty dead set on Paladin, but I could play a Hunter.
---
Must be nice being that lucky, I'm at 40 runs and no dice. :)
---
I plan to nap right before release because it is at 1am here, but I think I will be too excited for that.

---
i don't recommend feral to a new vanilla player at all, but you do you
---
Targeted ads, someone's been looking it up themselves....
---
Typically you respec after leveling to 60.
---
I won't even be asleep at that time.
---
Orc rogue here. See you on the ships.
---
From a pure xp/hr perspective sword spec is slightly quicker. 
---
My bias-Sword spec is crap. Combat is crap. It’s the most boring way to play a rogue and you may as well go fury.
---
Dagger leveling was a thing back then and it was effective enough that no one cared. I think you are not working hard enough if you can’t get value out of nearly one shotting a mob with an ambush crit in 5 mans. If you pvp while leveling there’s even more reason to avoid sword spec.
---
This has been the longest week I’ve ever experienced...
---
My feelings exactly.
---
Maybe in retail, but in classic threat generation is better. The downside was survivabilty (no defensive CDs, crushing blows...). That was still perfectly viable as an off tank. Not sure as a main tank.
---
There is a dungeon called “Slave Pens”.
---
My money is on yes.
---
Looks barren.
---
All the PvE servers are Alliance dominated and the PvP servers Horde dominated. Need some Horde from Mankrik and Alliance from Pagle to swap places.
---
That's gonna be a big smack in the face, even for me. I remember serious group CC plans in BC heroics (what was that nightmare one? Mana Tombs?) and we still wiped half the time. It'll be really interesting to see these mechanics again with a playerbase that's 15 years older with a decade+ of game experience under their belts. Tougher mechanics vs more experienced players. I genuinely don't know how that will shake out.
---
Saw that too.  Did you see how expensive it was?  They’re absolutely ridiculous and would be lucky to sell a few.
---
My laptop has a gen 2 i3 and integrated graphics, which does clear the minimum specs but not the recommended ones. Guess I'm stuck to my desk.
---
I'm excited about not having RNG in my RNG.  If I get an item, it is what it fucking is, and that's all that it is.  I don't have to farm it hundreds of times to get a chance at a slightly better version of the same item.
---
And what's the benefit of SW rep in early game? If there is more fun at elven forest and west fall, why not starting with human instead of NE?
---
as a french canadian, I lul'd hard at that
---
Dick move
---
Lmao I was sitting here trying to figure out how they changed his name for actually going into the game and I couldn't figure it out.
---
I'd say the *greater* wand isn't worth it. There is other wands around that level that are similar, for example there's a blue level 15 wand in wailing caverns for example (although it's a drop chance from a rare boss so maybe not that viable).
---
The lesser wand is much better as it'll be the first one you get. You can try the whole tailoring for green robes and disenchant but by the time you get there you probably can buy a wand from someone else for a decent amount of silver.
---
"Your acrobatics skill increased to 100"
---
I think it's about how many new players joins for IF to become capital again, since AH are in all cities now.
---
As a healer it's also your responsibility to make sure you are drinking (if required) immediately after exiting combat and if need be continue drinking into combat before anyone needs to be healed. 
---
People like to complain about tanks being too fast but also stand around after combat looting and running around aimlessly. It's a two way street. - healer since BC. Just my thoughts on the matter :)
---
I’m the opposite. I’m only going to play at work. Based on how much work I actually do, I should have a solid 5-6 hours every day to play wow. 
---
Once I get home I have adult responsibilities: wife, family, friends, etc.
---
As a suggestion, Hunter, Warlock, Priest for a newbie.
---
My friend's mom starting playing WoW back in 2005, prior to that she hadn't really played a "real" computer game. She knew how to type, she was about 45-50 years of age at the time.
---
She played a warlock upto 60 and even raided MC. You got this! I suggest a warlock / hunter because of the pet mechanics, its like always having a 2nd player with you. Also each of these classes has a way to clear combat.   
---
If not I suggest priest, it is the easiest and most effective of all healers. It is middle of the road when it comes to leveling but you will be able to save yourself with heals, and shields.
---
You don't need to buy BFA to play classic. 
---
All you need is a starter edition with a subscription.
---
There are plenty of things, in my opinion, that are good in retail that aren't in classic. Transmog is not one of them.
---
Why the fuck would I pay for classic when I already paid for classic?
---
Yeah, I usually roll a gnome too, but this time I want to be a human because gear looks better and I don't have to look at a gnome the whole time.
---
Plus like i said before, I had too many situations where I couldn't cast spells over a hill or rock because of how short gnomes were to line of site over that.
---
Why do you care how many servers there are, or that there are some low pop ones because the others are full? Having additional servers would be a solution to a problem, not a problem itself.
---
Also, "Ain't nobody"... Wtf is that? This is 2019.
---
I remember thinking, at first, that the male tauren's walked funny. But as I played, I started to enjoy it pretty quickly. There's just something very calming about their gait. I second the suggestion about the female taurens. They might be easier to get used to, and still have that unique gallop lol 
---
It might be better to try one out on an alt. If you end up liking it, great, if not, no big. You should be able to tell by level 10 whether their movement will grate on you or not, or if there's any other race/gender specific quirks that'll bug you (casting/attacking animations, the voice, etc).
---
oh man the colors changed??? damn rough life
---
Are you me?
---
Maybe?  But isn’t the deeprun team in its own instance anyway?  You gotta take a dungeon portal in and out
---
I suppose you're not wrong, sadly x)
---
Just a little climb to the tip.
---
Why tho ? So people hare them even more than before bc they charge extra for old content ? (There are even now people saying they charge for classic which they don’t it’s a free extra to retail)
---
I just enjoy such comments while making a dungeon here and there. I just realized that the gear wont be that important as a healer doing mostly no high end raids. So Ill just look where it takes me and smile when those post vanilla guys cry cuz they dont even have full t1 in a reasonable amount of time.
---
No it wasn't the was wowinterface and one other I think.

Walking into a zone like Hillsbrad and seeing a hundred skeletons after a huge wpvp battle was really cool. Too bad people ruined skeletons for us. I’d rather people just get banned for ‘writing’ with the skeletons instead of taking them away entirely.
---
Every pserver project stands on the shoulders of any project that came before them, especially ones who open-sourced their code so that others could continue to build &amp; learn from it. Nostalrius was organized to a level beyond anyone else, and they managed to grow a passionate community who understood they weren't in it for profit or other similar motivations.
---
DAE BFA bad??
---
Nobody is going to have thunderfury in phase 2.
---
I raided as Ret in TBC. I bombarded my raid leader with math to convince him to take me over a rogue and the only reason he agreed was to stop me from bugging him, and in the end Ret wasn't great. Most fights I was just auto-attacking with Rank 1 SoC for a third of it because I went OOM so fast when I actually used my rotation.

I should really copy and paste an answer to this.

Layers aren’t infinite. They can only increase the amount of people by like 3-5x before each available layer is full and the queue ensues.
---
I’m having this printed. Gold for your work.
---
If you don’t want queues, wait until the day it’s launched when they add 5-8 brand new servers because 2 million people are trying to play on 5 servers
---
I can't fall asleep knowing servers have launched.

Frankly, this shouldn’t pose much issue on a rogue. The nice thing about the class is energy ticks are totally reliable. So, if you get in to a rhythm you know in advance what keys you’ll need to press. In other words, crappy keyboards and set ups aren’t so bad when you play proactively, which is the type of playstyle that most benefits rogues.
---
As a tank this is the most annoying. Waiting for heals to be back up and DPS pulls. I usually sit out of combat for as long as possible to let heaps and myself regen. In a perfect world, the DPS that pulled dies and we finish off the rest.
---
20 min short sleep tactics make it possible 
---
To get first level 60 just like the grand marshal thing later on you’ll need to be ready to break the tos and disregard for your health

I just got the ad for the first time just seconds ago on a punkrat video and Ive never shown any interest towards RMT fwiw

What's the best level for me to get to Ironforge? I'm assuming like lvl 15 because that's when you can run deadmines? As a druid I plan to have my hearth set for ironforge (the true capial), and my moonglade spell depending on which zone I need to be in.
---
I like tier 5 and the challenge mode set
---
If you sit out AQ your guild will replace you and your raid spot and DKP will be in short supply during Naxx. Vanilla is a team game, 90% of raids you will gain nothing. Does that mean you can skip it, well no cause you have others on your team that will see gains.
---
New players rolling hunters/warlocks: If you're jumping down somewhere, say, off a ledge onto a lower part of the dungeon, dismiss your pet first.
---
Precisely.
---
 You could also go with something like a Razer Tartarus.
---
Mikscrollingcombattext. I added a stonecold Steve Austin file so whenever I kill someone he goes "Austin 3:16 says I just whooped your ass'.  Another one of him saying "OH HELL YEAH" when Bloodfury finishes cool down.
---
Subscription I get, servers have costs.
---
If this is the way you handle a joke you must be real fun to hang out with.
---
Yes, I'm genuinely curious. I didn't play classic, I'm just going off what the devs have said. If you want to play with people you know, you can easily. You can still be known in the server through the chat. If not bumping into the same guy today as you did yesterday while leveling through the barrebs or something is that big a deal, then maybe this is a big deal for you.. But by the end of p1 layering will be gone. It's more likely people would quit because they have to wait hours to complete a quest because the world is too populated than people will quit because you don't bump into the same people as much while leveling (although you still can if you want to).

Many of the rogue abilities are usefull, but you can certainly skip some, especially when you don't use daggers. There are A LOT of money to save on eg. ambush and backstab. These 2 abilities will make you save almost 30 gold alone.

people also need to take in to account some dungeons are going to take a long time to complete, i'm talking dungeons runs of 1-2 hours to get everything done, set time aside dont join WC when you only have 20 mins as you will no finish it like you do on retail, remember as well there are no time limits in dungeons, unless you are doing strat baron run to free the prisoner which is 30min.
---
dont rush your tank or healer because you didn't realise you was joining a long instance and then tank has no need to rush the instance, unless they are just a dick.

Don't you have a phone?

When you go back to the Murlock camps a few levels higher "  I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM."
---
Boths classes will be needed the same, i guess. In a dungeon setup, the DPS is basically the same, the utility they bring is considerable... If I had to pick, I'd base my choice on the playstyle : which one would you enjoy play more, gameplay wise ?
---
never be mean to a tank because they're all special snowflakes that will leave the group on first complaint/critique
---
I haven't created a character yet because I want to wait what's going to happen at launch. If the other 2 servers are still low pop and the waiting time on the full server is bearable, then I will pick the full server. 
---
Because we can expect a player drop off after the initial 1-2 months and I don't want to end up on a dead server. I rather wait 2 hours in a queue but get a server that is full and will have a healthy population for a long time.
---
But with that being said, I do expect the other 2 servers to increase in population at release, because of people switching over when they see queue times and because many haven't even created a character yet (like myself) or won't bother with classic at all until it's actually released.

In younger days of the web, it wasn't that bad. And ad here, an ad there. No big deal. Then, some sites started coming up with new ways to push more ads and generate even more money, by using pop-ups, animations, you name it. There were even sites that would force-download and install adware on a person's computer simply by visiting their site. Shit got ridiculous, because now we're in the realm of security and privacy issues, and that's why ad-blockers and script blockers became a thing (and why browsers like Firefox and Chrome overtook Explorer as the most popular browser). Trust was lost between the site and the site visitor, and reasonably so.

Let's have a chat about pre-60 tanking as a Warrior! I'm looking for some input. 
---
What specs did leveling warriors use, considering they're expected to tank every dungeon? Did they just go for it with their regular damage specs, same weapon, or did they at least put on a shield? I wouldn't mind tanking leveling dungeons, but I don't think it's wise to spec tank purely for that occasional dungeon.

Yo, what server are you playing on. Asking for a friend... whose a tank...
---
You didn't have to reply too a post he didn't have to make
---
nobody gives a shit about a name
---
Imo professions are never critical while leveling. Sure sometimes they're useful but if you pick mining say you're going to have to put in extra time before you leave some zones to catch your mining level up. Skinning of course doesn't have this issue, but since you're vendoring everything it doesn't make a ton of money either.
---
I'm personally going skinning/tailoring for convenience. I won't be able to level engineering with tailoring specced, and while leveling I'd rather have access to my own bag crafting than to the minor benefits my engineering would have at the time.
---
I don't think it's a huge deal if you wanted to do mining/eng instead though.
---
It's their game
---
The fact you ignored my examples proves you k ow your wrong. Does someone own a DPS rotation? Or a BiS gear load out because they did it first?
---
Imagine Thottbot charging 5 dollars a month to use it. That's stupid if you would, because the info is free in game. They get money through ads.
---
&gt;Why do you think everything someone else provides should be done for you for free anyway?
---
I didnt say everything. In this case hes charging for free available info which Blizzard said is ToS
---
Lmfao
---
Thanks for the offer. I'll keep it in mind if I decide to swap servers.
---
First off, I'm not talking about M+ because I have no experience with M+ because I'm unwilling to wade through the shitiness of the rest of the game to get there. By all accounts M+ is one of the best things Blizz has done lately. However people act as if M+ justifies the absolute shitshow that is everything preceding it.
---
That being said, you couldn't be more wrong about old threat. Old threat is actually more skill/knowledge dependent because it forces all players to leverage their toolkit rather than just focus on dps. You have the "rotation" obsession that most live players seem to have. If that's the gameplay you like go for it, but modern WoW's rotations are about as linear of gameplay as you can get. Your statement about gear differences is exactly the point that I was making. Threat as a mechanic makes your group fights different. If I have a group where the tank overhears the dps, then maybe as a tank I push my dps more. If I have a group where the dps overhears the tank, maybe they mix up their skills a bit more to deal with pulling too much threat. Having the exact same gameplay in all situations is exactly what I mean by linear.
---
I knew at least this subreddit would appreciate it
---
Stiff competition for mobs to pull?
---
I’ve thought about getting Naga actually. I was also thinking perhaps mage or lock, I was warlock during vanilla and yeah, basically dot up and shadow bolt. But I remember how hard it was to find healers or tanks for 5mans back in the days and I think having an off spec tank/healer was so smooth to gather gear for the main dps spec when I was pala and dk during wotlk.
---

I need a pace calculator. Like I want to be 60 by X date and what pace per day/week do I need to hit that.  This one just seemingly arbitrarily assigns a date.
---
I find it odd, that the server with highest amount of submits is Firemaw, which has the lowest population...
---
Dunno how that's related to my comment but i'll play along : 
---
I wouldn't say it's 'biting them in the ass' as it would have happened nonetheless. 
---
Only difference i see is that players are aware they'll face hours long queues on launch day and may change their mind before launch, instead of just blindly trying your Luck at launch.

To be fair, even the BfA raid finder stuff is way harder than a lot of the raid content in WoW Classic. Late AQ40 and Naxx are probably getting too hard to beat for a group on that level.

Tho, 5 maning a dungeon is ... not exactly hard. It just takes ages. Good thing you can just zerg it with 10.
---
I find it a bit hard to give any specific tips. But when my girlfriend and i started gaming together she had basically no experience either. The first game we played together was WoW, and from what i can remember the hardest thing for her was the controls. Keeping track of both hands at the same time took a good while to learn (moving the camera with the mouse and the character with w, a, s, d) and she only really got it down once she started playing Overwatch. So if you have a lot of trouble with that, i'd suggest maybe playing some FPS (first person shooter) games too, since they kind of force you to get better controlling the mouse and movement is usually very important in games like that.

Anyone remember calling healthstones cookies?

That is exactly Guild Wars 2's model and while it can be fun if done right, it's definitely a different overall feeling.

Identity Theft is not a joke Jim
---
Yep, you pick up Nightfall (and Siphon Life + Curse of Exhaustion!) on the way to Shadow Mastery.   It's one of the few specs that is good/great in both PVE and PVP, so no need for re-specs.
---
It definitely existed in classic. I couldn’t kill one of them so a hunter friend did for me. Got that bow and staff.

I already quit my job few weeks ago

Imagine thinking your'e so impactful you will get the majority of a population to switch server. News flash kid, nobody gives a shit about you. All the Spanish guilds have decided where they're going already, and new players aren't going to be checking a census.
---
Shot weaving, melee weaving, kiting, pet management, and then upkeep like food and ammo which isn't hard but you need to stay on it.
---
Not necessarily. First of all you won’t be under constant attack and second of all you have your fellow faction members to rely on. 
---
If you feel like you would rather not worry about it at all then maybe go for PvE. You might miss it later though :)
---
Well done sherlock well done
---
Well regardless if you like it or not, tweaks has happened and classic is not and will never be what it was. And if this is one of those tweaks through this addon then I'm happy for it.
---
Bindings were always drops from MC though. Whether you had people collecting them in case they became useful in 1.6 is a different story though.
---
Devs confirmed Classic will behave the same, Bindings dropping from MC right away but no TF until P3.
---
the starting zone actually helps with it as well. it's very laid back, big open plains, so they just feel more 'normal', and then you get used to it. But different strokes, so only time will tell. Best of luck!
---
You're right, how can you have a community or world if you are made to feel like the one.

That's what I'm trying to get across here though. It's not the LGBTQI community that is segregating themselves, they've been ostracised by the rest of us and are looking for a place where they will feel more welcome.
---
Their sexuality is equated with 'bad' on a near constant basis in gaming communities, you'd tire of it eventually too, and would have more fun if it were less likely to happen. So I really meant what I said, if you are concerned about us all dividing into smaller and more homogenous communities, you need to have zero tolerance for small minded bigots who make anyone slightly different from themselves feel unwelcome.
---
I've kicked people from groups, agreed to open UBRS then refused after I joined the group and found out some hateful child was in it, and I made it clear that was why. I have agreed to tank runs then declined on the same basis, and forced my guild leadership group to choose between keeping me and keeping some edgelord. If you're ruining the game for someone else, I'm ruining it for you, and I'm going to keep doing it until you literally quit the server. Done it before, multiple times, and will do it again. Also will go out of my way to drop everything and help you anytime if I find out you are actively trying to make the community more welcoming to everyone.
---
I'm gonna be levelling an alt with a pair of NB friends a few weeks after launch, and I'm already concerned about what they'll have to deal with.
---
.ff
---
Yeah, but my queue will be even longer
---
Quality &gt; Quantity
---
People just need to understand that clearing most of MC is much easier than farming some of these 'pre-raid' items let alone a full pre-raid set , anyone dedicated to farming shit like HoJ will likely be clearing most of MC way before it drops. 
---
These lists are more of "things to farm if X item from MC/Ony refuses to drop".
---
fun fact there is method in the source code "HasIgnoreMessageTag". If a chat search has "#noclassiclfg" in it this addon will ignore it.
---
40/60 isn't bad at all.
---
You're screwed more because the queue times are going to be outrageous and no-one wants to move. If you're not tied to a guild on Herod, *move*.
---
Oof, broaden your keybind horizon my friend.

Penis!
---
Hm, I only remember doing it with 15 ever.
---
Well, in straight up /duel - the rogue will win assuming equal gear and skill 
---
In open world in a 1v1 scenario - hunters are pretty godly. If a hunter gets the jump on the rogue - it’s pretty much over. 
---
Both classes have high skill ceilings while also being pretty easy to pick up and do well with. 
---
Rogues scale better the longer the game goes on but it’s not as noticeable in PvP like it is in the PvE area of the game. 
---
If you’re going to play more casually you can never go wrong with hunter!
---
In one of the other comments I admitted I forgot. This was not a well thought out post
---
Dis gon be gud

Yeah the advice is pretty good, and it really shows how much you care about your partner, it's lovely to see this :)

Probably buy a 6 slot bag if nobody can help out very early on. And then take my linen to a tailor and give him a lap /dance for the trouble.
---
It's a popular quote from RPG developers.. It's never true though. To an extend, perhaps. But not at all completely so.
---
Or if you're lazy "Nu Metal Generation" and "00s Metal Classics" will do.
---
I doubt more than 10 percent of guilds will even think that way, the min/maxers will be an extreme minority.
---
It just wouldn't be classic without the autistic man children. Thank you for being here.
---
nah i'm dead set on shaman
---
So much this...
---
Keep refreshing, It been happening through out the day. It usually sorts itself out after 2 attempts.
---
And I still don't know what I'll main
---
Just got a new hunter pet that stealths in the current game, and it startles me everytime haha, I  only play occasionally so I'm not used to that type of thing. I always do a look around jic.
---
Layers are per server, names are per server. One server. One name. Multiple layers. Once layers are removed, you are still left with one server, one name.
---
Herod will have Herod Layer 1, Herod Layer 2, Herod Layer 3. Grobbulus will have Grob Layer 1, Grob Layer 2, Grob Layer 3. You can have the character MageGirl on the Herod server. Someone else took MageGirl on Grobbulus. You can be on Herod Layer 2 and that other Grobbulus player decides they want just a PvP server and so attempt to create MageGirl on Herod. They haven't even logged a character in yet, and so are not assigned a Herod Layer. It doesn't matter that Herod Layer 1 and Herod Layer 3 don't have a MageGirl on it, because they haven't reached the layering point yet. They're still on Herod server's character creation screen, and you have MageGirl on Herod already, so they will get a 'That name is unavailable' message. They create MageGirlxXx and are on Herod Layer 3. Now layers are being removed. Herod-MageGirl from Layer 2 remains on Herod as Herod Layer 1, Herod Layer 2 and Herod Layer 3 all become just Herod. It also has MageGirlxXx. Meanwhile Grob Layer 1, Grob Layer 2 and Grob Layer 3 all collapse into simply Grobbulus, with one MageGirl on it from the other player. Grobbulus-MageGirl is not related to Herod-MageGirl, nor do the names interfere with each other.
---
Yes, layering handles the unique names on the server just fine.
---

Deadzone management, pet management and aspect managemt are the top factors.

Then you have ammo, food, trap heartbeats to handle.

We're only raiding two nights a week. The guilds who think they're going to need 4 nights to clear anything except maybe Naxx are completely delusional, and someone in your position probably won't be going to Naxx anyway. 
---
Join us, enjoy the ride.
---
Tiny mobs at the start of the game have proportionately giant aggro radii so it's really difficult to predict. Even for very experienced players. Pulling mobs becomes so much easier at higher levels not just because of experience, but because the aggro radius is so much smaller relative to the size of the mob.
---
Most serious pvpers practice on the generic client because you can’t use addons in the WoW tournament realms, I.e. practice with addons to memorize timers then play without to make it second nature :D
---
I feel like i'm arguing with a trailer park boy

Similar here, although I am pretty sure it took me a year to ding 60 the first time around and I had tons of time...

What file? Where do you find it and how do you know which one works? How do you sort the malware from the addons? Where do you go to learn how to actually use the add-on?  What file do you drop it into, and why is there a ziplock icon next to it?

 When you're done being an ass you might realise that besides the vocal minority in this thread, most kids don't know what they're doing.

the offical WoW forums are actually really good for finding classic guilds. so many posts that are specific (times, what classes theyre looking for, hardcore/casual, expectations with consumables etc).

So far, I'm supposed to roll alliance on Heroc but if that's fact I can see us switching servers before it's too late. Herod Horde might need to go alliance here to save the server

Initially I had it redirect to rare, but then I realized, lets make this compattble for classic+.
---
&gt; if anything add more difficulty like long distance quests, rare gathering quests, key attunements.
---
That doesn't sound like "difficulty", it sounds like a drag.
---
I feel like I'm talking to a mental handicap
---
Better. Keep trying. Unlike you, I have to go to work now. No protesting capitalism or getting my mom to drop me off at Gloom Lake for the raid like you sparkles. You're trying so hard to be clever, you're just not good at it. I would feel bad for you but it's just funny that some kid called me a kid. That's your first move always I'm sure. I bet you also make fun of people that spell words wrong in chat. Wait, now I get it, you're angry because you've got to wait a few more days to troll people at the crossroads. Think bigger. You can do it. If you try to hard, I'm sure your mom is on standby with a clean diaper. Later on sparkles, I have to go be an adult now. Just Google adult, there's a good definition out there.

Shit, I can't remember mate. Ummm... Honor Bars? Crap. I lost my Wtf folder when I changed rigs so it's back to square one for me.

Don't ruin their illusion that all retail players are mouthbreathing morons. They don't seem to do content beyond queueing a few heroics when they resub so why would anyone else?
---
I'm gonna be mage and roll tailoring.
---
I'm kind of amused at the thought of all the oldies coming back for Classic, and since you get both Classic and retail for one subscription, decide to check out retail and are just... baffled.
---
I'll be playing both, but I can understand people who only like one or the other because they are just so different now. In Classic, you need to know how to reach hit cap, and in retail you need to know the affixes in your Mythic plus, neither of which mean anything to the other game.
---
Maybe you should do some math, 2.2% of 2356 responses for Firemaw were Spanish. That is 50 responses, some of those are going to be legitimate Spanish players choosing Firemaw. The Shazzrah discord will shortly be in contact with Vladimir Putin as we are clearly the masterminds of corrupting survey data.
---
Not sure TBC is all that different from Classic.
---
I mean, half of levelling happens on contested zones, and vanilla really doesn't have much endgame content worth caring about until maybe AQ and definitely Naxx. 
---
I thought I'd hate PvP servers when I first started so I rolled on a normal server. I gave PvP servers a try in WOTLK when I joined a new guild and seriously would never consider going back to a normal realm.
---
What's the point in factions at all if you're totally harmless to each other? Nothing breaks immersion faster.
---
Yea lmao a guy in the guild I'm in says hes planning to get 2 60s in the first week. Laughed at him and told him I'd bet any amount of money he wont do it. The world record is what? Over 4 days/played for a 60? But you'll get 2 in the first week? Right.
---
Screwed? Soldier, only thing screwed is your head, and it's not on straight. 
---
Look out across this battlefield? What do you see? A bunch a Horde? You ain't lookin right. What I see is so. much. goddamn. Honor Points.

You lookin for an even fight? Then start recruiting for the Horde, cause those sonsabitches need double their numbers before I might consider us evenly matched.

Why do people keep posting this crap?

Or the reverse for that sweet tiger rep as a human. mmm

Slippery slope is not fallacious dispite what a wikipedia article might tell you. Companies progressively wearing down consumers to accept their final goals is real, look at modern wow's cash shop with level boosts and mounts galore. Do you remember the dust up over the first mount? The sparkle pony? Imagine if that all came at one instead of piecemeal. The skeleton retention in vanilla was core to the game for many players.
---
can u explain why specifically this spec was so much fun? I thought the biggest advantage of this spec was that it could be used for everything (pve,pvp=
---
Are you talking about PvP or PvE? 
---
If you are asking about PvP i'd say managing your pet so it does not break your traps or scatter. You can make macros that state "when using freezin trap then stop attack pet" or something along the line. Those might help but I would recommend just keybinding the "stop" command for your pet and apply it yourself. Hightens the control and your skill aswell. 
---
Furthermore I'd say kiting properly and not being put in the dead zone by skilled players. 
---
TL;DR: Hunter is mostly about casting the correct spells at the right times. Hope this helped?
---
Delete this nephew. Before blizzard removes this as well.
---
Mankrik 70% horde and Pagle 80% ally. Yup saw that coming lol.
---
Im only aiming to be lv60 once the gong is boomed so I can participate in the opening.
---
Horde have the easier time with PVP so all the tough guys who want to pwn ally noobs usually go there because deep down the are pussies.
---
See you in STV, EZ mode nubs.
---
You are overestimating how hard Naxx actually is. Most bosses are relatively simple
---
&gt; If the tank runs off, let them die. If DPS pull, let them die. It's not complicated.

On Nostalrius i farmed a fortune with my Hunter.

Hunter: Maraudon (\~30g/hour) + Dire Maul North (\~50-80g/hour) 
---
Maraudon:

Pro: You can do it with preraid Equipment
---
Con: - Unique Items from the Princess, Croc and Tinker
---
Dire Maul North:
---
Pro: 3-5 Major Mana Potions each run, Class Books + Forors, Sell the Tarnish Elven Ring for 20-30g each to Rogues and Ferals, DM Buffs and a Vendor inside the Instance
---
Con: Enigneering required (Seaforium Charge) and lesser invisible Potions needed

Medium pop servers should expect queues as well?
---
What? What is the point if changing your metric for what low, medium and high pop servers if the actual capacity stays the same or similar enough that a server that isn't even listed as high pop experiences queues?
---
"Which Server Are You Playing On?" - Whichever one is not full at launch. I assume new servers will go up in the final hours of waiting and first hours of playing.
---
No you just combine browser metrics to create a "fingerprint" and then track that fingerprint by accumulating data.
---
For example, if you use firefox version XYZ on windows XYZ in city XYZ on internet provider XYZ with XYZ ram at XYZ resolution, even if you switch to Internet EXplorer or whatever I still have all those data points I can reasonably assign to just be one user. Maybe your work computer is different, but it's an estimate not a precise count.

Battleground ques are cross-server, so there is absolutely no reason to switch from the high-populated faction on a PVE server, besides altruism

Thank you for your input, this answers my question.  I have been considering switching to due to que times as well
---
Awesome! I participated in something bigger than myself for classic launch! I look forward to this post every day. It has been a blast to keep ones hype real.

So what? Every spec has own videos. It doesn't make them good. And who cares about original WPvP legends? It's just funny clips, ppl play better today.

People can't pronounce "melee", and you expect them to pronounce "Blaumeux"?  Good luck.

No point in doing that; you'd still have to run through a level 20 zone (Ashenvale) to get there. Much easier and faster to just take the boat to Menethil and then swim down to Dun Morough.
---
Meanwhile, they probably *haven't* done anything to address the imbalance that PvP servers run into once one side starts winning the war of attrition.
---
The population caps on PvP servers should be per-faction so that as soon as one side hits 50% of the total target population they start competing for queue slots.

I carry a few mounts in my bag. At least one epic and one normal. That lets me auto run with somebody at 60% without constantly needing to adjust to stay with them.

someone should make a playlist of all these old songs!

What the fuck they better sell that box or ill be pissed
---
No problem. Honestly, if you can't afford your mount at 40 and you just keep going, you'll get it eventually. Even if you end up at 45 or so before you can afford it, you're still levelling more efficiently than trying to grind for gold instead.
---
I'm still having trouble between mage and lock. 
---
I work full time and I'm a dad so the QoL of a mage sounds great but I'll likely never get beyond frost bolt spam levels of raiding.
---
SM/Ruin seems like it would be more interesting and useful in open world and dungeons, plus the utility of health stones and summoning party members to help save dungeon runs.
---
Most of my experience comes from WOTLK and after. Classes I've played were Ret and Arcane/Fire until MoP then DK, the Rogue since Legion was announced.

Then you pull another 6 while looting them

Damn still so epic

What they should do is introduce mount equipment that makes ANY mount into your lowbie mount, at chauffeur mount speed.

That would be a perfect use of that system. They did it to prevent everyone using the striders to walk on water, they should do it prevent everyone belching smoke from level 1-20.

October 4th. Just in time for a weekend of dungeon running for gear. Not to shabby.

---
But it is wasted time and money.   Within the first month the population is going to nose dive once the majority of people figure out they don't have the time or desire to grind through the classic experience.   Then they're just left with a bunch of half-dead servers they now have to worry about merging.  Which causes establish players to force name change.  
---
Also, I'm not sure if you've worked in a larger company or not but generally projects and departments don't get to say "LOL the company made X last year, we can do whatever we want"
---
LOL.
---
Pro-tip folks: this subreddit is primarily English-language. We had tons of people wanting this survey (multiple times really, hence v3), but the truth is, asking about "what language will you speak" to an audience that's primarily English-speaking is almost assuredly going to be misrepresentative of the actual population on many European realms.
---
So, regardless of whether a Discord tried to influence the survey or not, it's probably not highly reliable when you're looking at the language portions of the results.
---
I need a better sales pitch then that.
---
Play a mage, buy a rune, cast Teleport: Darnassus.
---
I dont know if blizzard even realises, that a lot of people (me included) dont care about name reservations.  
---
==&gt; I will start my sub when classic is released. 5+ people i know and will play with do the same thing. Only one of my friends is still subbed to WoW because of retail.  
---
So my guess is blizzard should take in consideration How many people installed classic and the region they are from. These are data that they have anyways, so why not just use them?
---
See now that's an example of the healer taking it too far, though.
---
The problem is that blizzard wont lock servers so people cant make characters on that server at least for a little bit. Because if they do guilds and friends will get separated. However this is essentially selling tickets to a concert that has limited seating and they are selling as many tickets as they can even though 3/4s of the concert goers are gonna be in line during the entire show. And it's not like you can give priority to who reserved their tickets first because that would make way to much sense.
---
Noticed Death cab for Cutie from the cover art. A friend of mine back then introduced me to the band and I use to listen to them a lot back then. They were also in a lot of the teen shows back back then - The O.C, One Tree Hill etc. Really enjoyed listening to them. Still try and throw out that album once every year or so. 
---
3 Doors Down was another on near constant repeat.
---
Male Tauren, Female Gnome, and Male Night Elf got kind of fucked by the character remodels. Actually, Male Night Elf got a lot fucked.

Best armour set in WoW.
---
This is not what that says. "Any realm that is listed ABOVE medium should expect queues"
---
They are not saying medium will have queues, above medium will.
---
So by saying you have a few weeks off to play at the start, and are considering making an alt before your main, I assume you are going at it hard core.
---
Week 1, 14 hour days is about 100 hours playtime will put you in the mid 50s (assuming you want time to eat, shower, stretch and 6 hours or so of sleep, but there will be people that go above the 14 hours). The attunement isn't very long for MC, and the quest to quench the runes isn't very long, so maybe half a day for those. So that leaves 4 days to grind gear, consumables, etc and you should be at around 60 and the last day before raid should get you to 60.
---
It will be very hard, but it is reasonable on a PVE server, and if dungeons are the best ways to level like many are saying, it is going to be reasonable on PVP servers as well.
---
There are some people talking about getting it week 1, but I don't think it's possible without having nearly perfect RNG on everything or sharing accounts

That's true, it's just I was wondering if I'll get more worth out of crafting bags and leveling cloth gear with tailoring and selling skins through skinning, or through mining and leveling engineering for equipment and trinkets for world pvp (I'm on a PVP server).
---
Will piss off people more if they tell the people that haven't joined that they can't join their friends on the server they rolled on than if they just give queues and let people transfer off later.
---
Thanks. Ill be sure to remember that next time you miss the point.

Y'all are seriously reddit mad for no reason and being stupid AF. All addons are supposed to be UI adjustments and on your personal computer. This adds an entire communication interface for people without the addon can't access.

You wherent playing correctly then. Ret normal rotation was pretty easy on mana with SoC+Judge+Cstrike. The mana dump was max rank Consecration or Exorcism if the mob was undead or demon. Ret play style was balance your mana pool between Potion and Dark Rune timers by down ranking Consecration as necessary. You wouldn't be the #1 DPS but you added so much bonus damage via auras and judgements it was worth bringing.

Basically. It's what time zone the server will be on. Pacific time or eastern time.

---
It boils down to the lack of "world cohesion", defined loosely as the continuity between one player's actions on the world and a different player's perception of that action.  Features introduced after vanilla, such as auto-scaling, individual loot, and phasing, all exacerbate the departure from world cohesion.  The author raises a valid point, but game mechanics that most MMORPGs have adopted - go here, kill X blarbs, click a few items, and come back to do it again somewhere else - are fundamentally failing world cohesion to begin with.

I'm a new player, can someone please explain why do so many people prefer Horde on PvP servers?
---
Do this, as long as the criticism is reasonable.  You must be able to accept that you can always be better, its really that simple.
---
Dark Portal has always been in the Black Morass near of Stormwind, even before world of warcraft
---
Alternatively, you can ask a friendly mage in your guild to open a portal for you, or ask two people to summon you using the Deadmines meeting stone (I believe it should work above level 15).

ime lock is more interesting in general, plus you get a cheap/free 40 mount. from what I've heard, mages were more op in vanilla than in later expansions, so it may be fun to run one again to see the difference. but I'd recommend lock, mostly because you haven't done it yet. afflic locks are a little trickier to get into raids (there's a debuff limit, so usually raids only go with one), but I really enjoyed the class. more than I ever liked mage, at least. leveling is a blast.

"relevant" is a strong word.
---
You're missing the fact that you're still leaving a skeleton behind if you die. 
---
The actual change is that you don't leave behind multiple skeleton**s**.

Maybe I’m biased because my friend was a much better hunter than I was a rogue. Lol
---
Yes, people have been saying Rag will be downed within the first week, let alone a week and a half.
---
I assumed people would do it like the game it was based on, but ok.
---
imagine looking this far into e celebrities shooting the shit.
---
im planning to play healer main and warlock alt so hopefully i wont be one of those
---
Almost 2200 responders and the balance is much more even, better than 2 other servers and in-line with the remaining by 2%.
---
Can we drop this doom and gloom crap?
---
We're going home brother!
---
What is your goal for the game. Unless you are going full min-max try hard, you will not be excluded from anything.
---
Also, your class will not determine if you make friends, its your own personality. 
---
For leveling, Hunter is one of the easiest to solo level due to having your own personal tank. Rogues are one of the hardest due to a combo of squishy + no self heals.
---
They are both good in PvP and PvE. In PvE hunters may lag behind rogues which are top tier DPS but they have their use. In 5/10 mans hunters have traps that can be used for CC. Just be careful about your pets not pulling unwanted aggro.
---
For PvP they have their specialties. Rogues are single target assassins which a skilled rogue can nearly 1v1 every class in the game if they get their opener. On the other hand, a skilled hunter can kite a rogue if they know its there. Its about personal skill more so than anything else.
---
In the end, go with what you think you want to play. If you really have trouble, do you want a pet and attack from range or do you want to be up close and stealthed.
---
I played a ton of rogue from Vanilla to WoTLK so feel free to ask questions if you have.
---
When a guy like that complains, he wont be taken seriously. Just go nuts. As long as you dont have loud music running etc, he wont be able to do anything. Contact your rental place and let them know how he is

---
wait...what?! HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO START DEEPSING NOW?!
---
omg blizz plz
---
Let me know what you come up with.
---
Your 100% right, warlock just is very hybridy and doesnt fit particuarly well into this format. Ideally people would use this as a quick kinda glance thing to help pick their class initially, and then deep dive into a far more comprehensive warlock guide later!

I'll take "Things I'll never be caught dead wearing" for 1000 Alex
---
Possible, yes. Probable, no. Should be interesting to see how many guilds kill rag in the first 2 weeks.
---
No it isnt. The information on the site is valuable.
---
I've been sticking it out with Herod hoping enough people will jump ship to ease the ques, now the horde ratio has me second guessing. fuck.
---
Need the polearm too for your pvp "jousting" kit.
---
The argument was invalid from the beginning, because you're still leaving a skeleton behind if you die.
---
9/6 is what, second week? third week?
---
Id say 2nd week is hard to guess, but 3rd week is doable if they have experience from p servers etc and a whole guild to farm stuff like consumables etc for them.
---
Its gonna be one hell of a marathon, but yeah, id say doable.
---
If its 2nd week though, thats gonna be much tougher, purely because the time constraints are much tighter. Hard to guess. Id say no. But i could be wrong.

I’m very excited to not see loads of crazy celestial/divine/draconic mounts with loads of glow effects and particles. Leave that to paladins and warlocks

Also because the Servers worked properly, you'd meet people in Dungeons levelling up in your 20s, and see them again in your 40s and 50s.

---
Ugh, the sound murlocs make triggers me so much.
---
I'm not considering PVE servers, so haven't looked

It means there are more options than there were originally. They still use the same models and textures but it still looks a little better in the new client.

Agreed, world content is way too easy and non-threatening. I was playing the other day after not touching the game for a year. I'm at like 380 ilvl blasting through current content like I'm the chosen one.
---
I enjoyed classic because the difficulty of enemies made it engaging. Most battles that were greater than 1 on 1 required cooldowns, and 3 on 1? You're unquestionably going to die.

You get a separate skill to shoot your wand, its called shoot :) so you have shoot and auto attack.

I remember grinding for ages to get the high warlord crossbow, got it few months before TBC and replaced it with a blue quest reward, i believe already in hellfire... Worst feeling..

oh god, 2 months (28th Oct)..... wait up guys
---
I think tauren has one of the better animations in classic. Male humans probably worst with their embarrassing run.
---
I was in college playing probably 40+ hours a week, got it in about a month. now I have a job, a wife, and a kid due in December so I'll be lucky to get an hour or two a day.
---
The number of realms at name reserve was clearly less than half than the demand. And, without exaggerating, we will need to start the launch with AT LEAST 3 times the realms we had on 12th.
---
Every Region would need 30+ realms at launch...and that JUST for those 30 realms to be High and Full.
---
This comment just level boosted my hype to 120.
---
im getting that thunderfury
---
For tanking nonraid content you probably want [Unholy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16248) over the others mentioned here. 1h agility was considered the top raiding tank enchant. Unholy should function as a 210 ap reduction (-15 flat damage) per target proc. If you want more aoe threat get the [fiery blaze enchant](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5421) from badlands.
---
Feels like they have an aggro radius of half the zone.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
I think that's right but I think a lot of people are in for quite a big shock compared to what they're actually going to get.
---
It’s in Kalimdor. It’s definitely wild.
---
Uhg. I probably won't PuG heal very often. Keep it in the guild and people you know. It's generally not worth the time in vanilla. The runs take too long as it is plus travel time and all of the group logistics like making sure there's not 3 rogue DPS, etc.   Having some clown ruin a run is bad enough, but when that clown is the tank it's absolutely horrid.  Sometimes you have to roll the dice on a PuG but you can usually tell pretty quickly if it's going to be a shit show or not.
---
That's my Thunderfury!
---
Edit: I'm a hunter
---
well im glad you like the art! Im gona have to disagree though about not getting a single thing right, I specifically followed several various guides for research and consulted a player who i happened to know who played warlock in classic. 
---
The problem is warlock barely can fit this particular format,  as they are very hybridy compared to other classes, but I certainly did the best i think is possible! (short of destro being off for pvp/leveling, as seems to be the thread consensus)
---
They are going to spin up a few more servers in each region inevitably to deal with the flood of players.
---
Or they can go to a different realm
---
Well, seems like OP tried to make a new race for each class and UD was already used for rogue (quite fitting as well). I think gnome was a great choice, the artwork is great for this and there is enough undead warlock artwork out there already.
---
It is possible to remove mechanostrider noises by adding custom sound files to the WoW directory. It's very simple and Blizzard doesn't ban for it. It's totally safe and doesn't involve modifying any game files.
---
I know how to create the modified sound files that remove the mount noise but I need some help, I don't know the internal file names of the mechanostrider sound files and I can't look it up on the web because I'm at work.
---
If someone could get me those names I can have a modification ready within a few minutes as it's a very simple fix.
---
Cool spells, great armor, and the best level 20 class quest ever.

What some people find boring and a drag, others find immersive. It all depends on how it is built. You can either do a point A to B or you can add more to it.

This is just wrong. Destro is awful for levelling and great for PvP because of the Conflag burst
---
No one mentioned toxicity.  Why does someone wanting to play with a streamer make them an idiot?  I personally won't be rolling on a streamer server, but I'm not going to judge people and call them idiots because they want to.
---
this subreddit hosts weekly post about guilds looking for people or people looking for guilds. Found my guild there.
---
Haha
---
Yeah you’re a patronizing asshole for no reason. 
---
I’m not worried about any of those things, it’s genuinely not difficult once you get the timer addon. What’s more difficult is stance dancing/kiting in PvP. That’s where a hunter is truly looking good, not in that basic ass rotation.
---
I annoyed anyone in listening distance during the stress test with /silly but my troll refused to do that one emote. It made me sad.
---
It sends out LFG messages just like you would normally search for a group. At most it adds a visual UI to the process. It doesnt not auto form groups of people, it does not teleport you to the dungeon, it nicely lists groups searching for more, instead of personally having to parse LFG as people spam over and over.
---
You still have to message the group leader, still have to group up and meet at the dungeon, this does almost nothing.
---
If you ban the addon, everyone will just use a discord plugin....you can not stop people from using technology to make it simpler. Might as well keep it within the game.
---
You can not tell other people how to have fun.
---
Shaman: fun because totem quests and chain heal/lightning
---
Lock: fun because pet quests and free mount
---
Priest: fun because Benediction quest
---
I would be happy with either of these 3 for different reasons.
---
I can 100% see them putting queues in place to handle Layering. Sure, the servers can handle 10k people, but the *game* cannot. Old Azeroth isn’t built to handle megaserver populations, and many private servers, while fun, we’re evidence to why 10k pops are extremely unhealthy for the game.
---
This addon needs to be broken
---
Don't like a fact? Congrats, now its fake news.
---
Has more to do with Chinese advertising than hate speech. So: still China
---
but they are a warlock so they could accidentally hit 28 on day one
---
I'm basically the same way. Just laughing at this cosmic prank
---
it's not that big a deal. i can play for an hour before i have to leave and i'll be back in the afternoon (it launches 6am tuesday for me)
---
Except the AMA and blue posts literally said multiple hour queues on full servers but sure, nobody except some devs said it. 
---
I'm not jumping to a conclusion I am reading blue posts.
---
And how much do you expect long queues to push that drop off before P2? Having limited access on this few servers leaves no choice but a huge drop off in population when people can't play. If we had more servers there would be more simultaneously active players to get more people interested and attached to the game/their characters.
---
It's the complete opposite for me. I've a lot of free time on my hands for a while after launch, but my friends might or might not have to deal with real life. It's kind of frustrating because I'm aiming to level relatively fast but also don't want to level without them.
---
Anyone who says you need a pocket healer to level a warrior should be ashamed and seriously consider not having children so as to not weaken the gene pool. In short, go for it. The lock will make things v easy with cc, voidwalker and ranged attacks. You can just concentrate on whacking things to death.
---

I am going Tailoring. And will be making free bags your mats in Brill on Stalagg
---
This guy RP’s
---
I did enjoy seeing the piles of skeletons omw to UBRS/MC but it really isn't a turn off that it won't be in the game because there are more pros than cons to remove it but the idea to make it a system setting is not a bad idea if it was actually able to be done which I just don't see how they'll do it.
---
Nah. Thousands of players will genocide them. They will be dangerous later, when locations are empty and you're alone.
---
Not hard, just slow.

Will I need to add /startattack to the end of my spell macros to start shooting and will /startattack call auto-attack/shoot based on range appropriately?
---
It's funny, because sulfuras is actually pretty bad for raiding guilds, because warriors tend to dual wield at that point and enhancement and retribution are terrible dps specs. So a guild might actually give it to a shaman who wants to have some fun.
---
I don't know much about PvP healing on a shaman in vanilla, but anyone who does heal in battlegrounds is a god among men.
---
The dps requirements for Patchwerk were stiffer than the tank gearing requirements in my experience.
---
Over 9000!!!!

---
What will you roll on launch?
---
There are three main reasons that I am aware of. The Horde racials lend themselves to PVP moreso than Alliance racials. It's a guess but the kind of people that enjoy PVP might be drawn to the Horde aesthetic. Lastly, I remember joining WoW during Vanilla and even though PVP servers were waaay overpopulated with Horde, the vast majority of players across all realms were Alliance. That population difference meant delicious, instant BG queues when Battlegrounds were released. Alliance on our server waited anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours for BGs depending on the map.
---
At least for me, as soon as I saw what was coming I rerolled on the Horde side for easier queues, faster honor, and to be around like minded people. What's happening now? I can only speculate but I'm thinking of bailing and going Alliance for a PVP quality of life boost.
---
Gnomes and Dwarves can ride all mounts. Humans and Night Elves can't ride mechanostriders. 
---
Not sure for Horde, I believe Trolls and Undead can ride all, Orcs can't ride horses, and tauren can't ride horses or dinos
---
scare beasts works on other hunters?
---
Many things are worth the lolz
---
It’s cross realm BGs anyway so they shouldn’t be too bad for either faction
---
My bad, misunderstood
---
Used Reshade for years, including in vanilla (it was called something else back then), never had any trouble.
---
Yes, which is why they downgraded it to 25 people and way less needed preparation with BC and Wotlk. In my opinion raiding was way more fun in BC because you could concentrate more on the actual fun parts.
---
Yeah, but people complaining about not being able to play with friends on huge realms, is far less worse than megaqueues on all realms, massive populations on certain realms, extended Phase 1, queues on Phase 2 and 3...
---
I mean, locking Full realms the moment they are Full is the least worse solution. Now, we are at overcrowding on ALL damn realms.
---
If the servers are deleted, they aren’t full anymore! Big brain plays
---
When I was 14, my first character was alliance an alliance NE hunter. 
---
Luckily my friends were all Horde and stopped me from making that terrible terrible mistake. Only leveled him to 10 before switching.
---
Horde 100% of the way. Also try Warcraft 3. It holds up and pretty much lets you know whats going on.
---
Absolutely NO warlock spec was really "bad" in classic for leveling, as warlocks innately were great levelers (their only real downside is no innate mobility). 
---
Ultimately though i think noobies in particular should expriment while leveling with talents, rather than follow any guide, as ultimately for most players it doesn't matter when you hit 60, youll get there eventually!
---
Damn lol. Nice.
---
A happy person wouldn't say what? That it must be awful being that much of a loser? I don't have a care in the world dude and that is genuinely how I feel. I sympathize with people like that because of how awful their real lives must be to do something like that. Having that opinion doesn't make me an unhappy person and i'm sure most of the people in this subreddit would agree.

Ffs I want an ultrawide

If my memory holds, you get a 1 time use consumable at revered, which one person could in theory run back and forth from azshara and MC 8 times to dose each rune. At exalted you get the permanent douser, which has an hour cooldown.

I don't mind playing resto at all, it's sort of my plan to "main" resto and just respec ele for pvp or even try out to heal in BGs.

Artstation is your best bet. Use it to find artists, then find their official websites. If they sell artwork, it would be there.
---
Where did you buy those? They seem to be selling used ones on Amazon Germany.
---
If they are shielded and full health, I'm not opening on them at all... Why would any rogue pick the worst time to open in a mage?

I might if I had just seen them use blink, but that's it.

*I did bind one of the thumb stick directions to autorun. Might get more creative with trinket binds, but I haven’t needed it yet.

One nice result for me, is that I now tend to mentally group spells by their modifier key. I use alt- for heals, ctrl- for buffs, etc. YMMV.

Question about the add-on: will it only show groups forming in my zone, or is it across the entire world? Because that shifts the balance such that the add-on basically becomes mandatory if it works across the entire world.

haha give us graves!

I havent read Lord of the Clans in a long time, but that does feel correct.

Yeah it's almost as if it's not black and white

ALARMISM. There may be login queues. Not world server queues.

This is fear mongering.

Relax.

For me it was Rak'Shiri on my Tauren Hunter. I spent a good week camping to get the tame, got sniped by another hunter who was "helping" me (me being a naive 13 year old) once, saw it killed a couple of times, finally got it after waking up at 2 am to try and get it.
---
Right? And there really isn't anything blizzard can do to stop it. Worst case scenario we just move to a website or discord and automate it there...
---
Its just slapping a UI on the regular LFG spam in the general chats. It doesn't do any of the stuff that retail LFG does.
---
I don't remember, do your previous skeleton disappear when you rez? Or do you you just keep creating new ones each time you die on the same toon?

Usopp and Zoro, anyone?
---
It's nonsensical to put it nicely. How are they ever going to remove layering and have a playable game in phase 2 on Herod, for example? A "full" server back in 1.12 would have been 3,000 - we're looking at 3x that or more now. Gameplay isn't designed around the kinds of population numbers Blizz is stuffing into servers, and without layering the experience is going to massively suffer.  So not only are we potentially dealing with multi-hour long queues for months after launch, but Blizz will also have to make a very difficult decision in phase two - whether or not they can actually remove layering as they've been promising the playerbase for months now.
---
It existed in Vanilla [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4020-CallToArmsLFGAddOn.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4020-CallToArmsLFGAddOn.html)   
---
Glad someone is bringing it back, as all those other addons that existed back them. 
---
&gt;So you either want classic or not. 
---
You like Classic?
---
Vanilla also had addons as powerful as bots, that did entire rotations after selecting targets, auto pick most efficient ranks for healing and automated decurse/cleanse sort of spells, you want those back or some tweaks are ok?

No problemo
---
He has a point tho. Usually the people that call others incel, virgin or losers are usually projecting. You never really see any confidant man that has his shit together say stuff like this
---
incel? Where in the image does anyone say they're an incel?
---
Stop throwing around buzzwords, retard.
---
When I think about resto PvP I always end up worried because of lacking hard CC, and "oh shit" CD.
---
The polls from this subreddit also say that over 60% of players will be hardcore but that's definitely not true, the data is damn near useless.
---
The worst as a tank is dying on the first easy pull. Then you start wondering, what can this healer handle.
---
Oh sure let's just create a character on the EU low pop pvp realm..
---
I don't see how that verifies it though, his /played is 1 day and a half or so since its a boosted character I barely played that expansion. Won't really prove much unfortunately.
---
Shit, that sucks, 'helping' is the worst.
---
Also yeah! Rak'shiri! Think I bagged him too eventually at 60. Good Times..
---
The reason peeps keep creating chars on full realms is because that's their nationally picked server, not because that's the server where "all the action is" I think.
---
I also think because of that, population won't change much, long queues are more or less inevitable at this point.
---
I thought u were supposed to skip mindless zombie and rattle the skeletons quests
---
You cant have horde and alliance characters on the same PVP server. SIt makes sense that this limit would also apply to RPPVP servers
---
December 19th 2019 as warrior and 21h per week
---
Firemaw hype!
---
Easily, if his guild neckbeards hard and speed level efficiently without distractions.
---
And they need to add them NOW, and give at least 48 hours notice. We need new realms announced now and open them on Saturday.
---
Uh.. you get to like 60% on every mob, have no regen so have to eat and 3 sometimes even 2 mobs on you is a death sentence.
---
I find happy people tend to lift others up with them, but maybe that’s just my experience.
---
So, you open a thread and call it as discussion. And deliver one single line, where I don't know what you even mean.
---
If you want to start a discussion on how druids progress through the phases, it owuld be a good idea to present your viewpoint.
---
Why hello Satan.
---
Sorry to ask, but mind explaining what the enchant does?
---
The tooltip on your link says it reduces the damage put out by the target, but the comments beneath are talking about shadow damage?
---
I mean.. I didn't immediately realize it, but having looked again it is fairly obvious.
---
I'm still glad he commented it cause I was going to look at these in-game differently, haha
---
Here's my question: why the heck did the OP Photoshop this to begin with?! Lollll
---
Destro stuff seems to be the consesus, and i'll definetly change its ratings for pvp/leveling.
---
However for raiding stuff, they were both VERY hybridy specs, and simply dont fit the format well. I specifically discounted the primary hybrid spec for demo, as 13 of the talents used out of the 21 literally do nothing, and its only taken for DS, which hardly makes it feel like a demo spec from the noobies point of view.
---
Wasn’t there a period of time after they added AH to Stormwind and Darnassus that they weren’t linked? I’m having an grey moment and can’t recall, but I have this feeling there was a time when they existed, but weren’t widely used because they weren’t all linked. This, something put on SW AH could not be purchased in IF and vice versa. Maybe I’m misremembering or confusing it with Gadgetzan, but it feels like that was the case for a short while for capitals too.
---
God damn...!
---
That's what I find the worst about it healing gear and dage gear is separate in vanilla so your healing gear does not work for elemental
---
The fact that you are willing to do this for your SO is huge, so anything you do will be a big step. I think the easiest things you could do in advance would be to watch a bunch of youtube videos about the characters and how they play.
---
WillE has a series titled "was it any good" about all the character classes in vanilla, so you can at least see the basics ABOUT the classes (it won't necessarily help you play), but part of the game is learning which style you like to play. So picking the right character type is important. Once you have a solid grounding on the character types and the ones you like, then you can start youtube'ing specifics about that character, and learn more specifics on how to play it. If you know what your SO is playing, you can pick a complimentary class, but I wouldn't let that be your focus. You should pick something you will enjoy.
---
The basics about how to move, how to attack, what the actions are, will carry over from class to class, so if you learn the basics for one, you will have them for all. Then you can start watching other youtube videos about character guides for your specific character.
---
Another easy thing you can do is go to icy-veins and read up on some guides about wow classic, and you can get a basic understanding of the paths you are going to be using to play. (example casters primarily use wands for basic attacks, melee uses auto attack, etc...)
---
I would also recommend having a basic understanding of a few key mods to help. Specifically, what the mods are doing, possibly how to get them, and knowing that a few key ones will make your gameplay introduction much smoother. A questing Mod like Questie will make many things easier. This is kind of advanced (how to install them, where they go on the computer, etc... but your SO can help with that). However, anything that makes your quality of life better without drastically altering the game means you can save your mental energy for playing the game and getting enjoyment and learning how to be a badass, and not spend time going "where in the literal hell of this shit-ferno of a game is this quest item?"
---
Just my 1.2 cents, after taxes.
---
Warrior/Priest op have fun
---
Depends on the realm. Herod will have queues for a month or longer. I think Blizz is going to be forced to open several new realms between now and September, those realms may have fewer issues with queueing.
---
Nah, the REAL actual answer is the game is about PVE crafting. War. CRAFT. If you're not spending every waking hour crafting Mooncloth Bags then are you even playing the game, bro?? You're literally removing part of the game by focusing on PvP and not spending time farming crafting mats.
---
Spot on
---
The good ol Cee apostrophe D
---
yes guys! Sleep Little. He is completely right :D
---
Thanks for taking care of us! I'm only gonna Play through the first night because I gotta work the next day.. Otherwise I couldn't Play until like 18hours after release and I will not be able to wait that Long... :D
---
I'll be focusing on fishing, cooking, tailoring, and enchanting eaaarrlly.   I'll probably spend more time on that than leveling.
---
it's classic wow there's really no fun in rushing through leveling.  Why so you can get to end game and burnout, then be asking when they're going to do the burning crusade classic....  Been there done that.  for me this time around it's really about experiencing whole game and taking my sweet ass time doing it.
---
You can make decent money fishing and cooking and Leveling crafts and enchanting.
---
I'll probably roll a hunter alt for gathering professions.
---
And once you get a tune high enough to mass clear the lower dungeons you can make decent money just selling all the stuff you get.
---

More than likely, Blizzard is trying to avoid the bad publicity situation of allowing people to write hateful messages that will immediately get picked up by every games journalist on Earth. 
---
The headlines would write themselves:

 Is World of Warcraft grooming young boys into fascism?
---
Outdated MMO provides safe space for Nazis.
---
What MMO would Hitler play?
---
Blizzard the newest company added to the hate map!

People down voted Jesus too, but he told the truth. The models are complete shit. All of them
---
Yea warlocks are very hybridy and dont fit particuarly well into this format, unforunately. However one must make do and I tried my best to make raiding as clear as possible, but i HIGHLY encourage any noobies to go find a far more in depth guide once they have solidily chosen a class :)
---
Most servers have a subreddit (for instance, /r/Grobbulus) and in those subreddits most servers have a community Discord. The sub and the discord are the best place you'll find your guilds.
---
Only that nobody says they feel entitled to it, and a lot of people are saying: "Dude, a subscription is probably a crap idea. You should offer it as a one-time purchase for $30. Makes it way less complicated."

Deja Vu I've just been in this place before.

My very first character was a tauren druid and my first flight was after teleporting to Moonglade back to Thunder Bluff for the bear form quest. Suddenly getting a glimpse of how big and diverse the world was, flying over Darkshore, Ashenvale and Stonetalon was awesome in the true sense of the word.
---
I was leaning that way but then I saw a video of early hunter damage and thought that could speed things up... I never leveled a hunter in Vanilla but did play a friends hunter in ZG raid once.
---
Wipe prevention and even being able to use the mage to port to a city then summon back would be invaluable.
---
! Remindme 4 days
---
A big part of the game is also leveling, getting stronger, discovering new areas, interacting with the world and not being 100% sure where you are going is part of the magic of an MMO. You are basically trying to prevent playing a big part of the game in order to play the end part. I like the end part both PVE and PVP but there is only so much content and rushing through the leveling aspect will just make sure you burn through the content even faster.
---
Hunter, slow, ~12hrs/week = March 2020.
---
That one will have queues too as soon as everyone realizes they can make an alt on that server to play immediately

Every server shows well over 60% as hardcore or "semi-hardcore" which is total nonsense. Also, the servers with the most responses only have 2.2-2.3k while it's estimated that there's somewhere in the range of 40-50k players with names reserved on them, meaning these responses are less than 5% of the population. Even moreso for Thalnos, it's also marked full which seems to mean it's likely somewhere in the range of 30k but has just over 700 responses in the survey, around 2.5% of the population.
---
&gt; on Zandalar Tribe
---
Literally never heard of that server.
---
What do you mean? Never did the quest. What RNG is involved?
---
Yeah, I quit after BC then played for a year of WoD+Legion. Blown away by how easy it was to level, especially after getting heirlooms. Got every class up to 110, except a shaman at 106. 
---
Classic is way more about mains.
---
I'm talking about the general idea of people wanting x or y, not this specific add-on. More to the point, I was answering the poster's sentiment that this was something that he feels prevented him from fully enjoying all that the game had to offer, so he welcomes a built-in fix to it.
---
Why is this always the go-to insult of imbeciles? As if I give a shit what you plebs thought of me...
---
Totally correct and I already had it during Rhapsody time. It is part of my mobile phone contract.
---
Not If they are grey to you, no.
---
That's at the end regardless, no? Unless you're in the military, then dates are written 190822 which gets even more confusing sometimes.
---
&gt; The Joana guide is behind a paywall which is against Blizzard Terms of Service.

No it's not.

Just remember that it's not fair for a boyfriend to spend no time with his girlfriend. Better to just end the relationship now and set her free.
---
Not really unlike in retail not every zone has a single story.  It’s more like you go to a zone and find some camps or villages with their own problems.
---
Occasionally after finishing up they can give you a breadcrumb to another camp, but it’s nothing like in retail.
---
The flow is completely different and the only real guidance is your level v the level of the zones
---
I love UBRS, but I do not see myself running pugs for it anytime soon. It was easily a headache back then, it will be one now. I'll just run it with my guild.

Leveling a warrior solo is cancer. With a lock (or any friend/duo) you'll be fine. With a Priest or other healer, you're one of the best.

What does crusader do for a tank paladin? 5 block value and a minor heal once per minute. That's nearly nothing.
---
You do not get DKs for stomping lowbies, only certain NPCs.
---
Well I can guarantee you they're wrong. There isn't enough micro transactions to cover for 10x the sub count. That would require for each person to spend over $100 per month on micro transactions, and most players spend zero on it. And that's also not even taking into account that WoW during its height of subs (wotlk) also had a bunch of ingame stuff for sale. Mounts, Name change, Faction change, Race change, realm change etc. 
---
I can guarantee you that WoW today doesn't make close to half of what it made during its peak.

Wow, how old are you? Did you take part in 2 world wars?
---
No, I got one too this morning.
---
oh man I cannot wait to gank hunters taming pets. They are going to be so mad!
---
I like your brain thoughts. Stop that.
---
It’s the go to insult for inbred fuckheads who couldn’t understand a joke if a special ed teacher spent 5 years 7 days a week explaining it to you. Someone with your amount of retardation shouldn’t use the word imbecile.
---
Regardless of the launch time, I will be only able to play after work on 27th, and I bet a lot of people here and not in reddit are same as me - have a job.
---
Dying while playing wow is probably the best way I could go. It doesn't really matter if I die. Nobody knows me or cares about me. So everything is on my terms.
---
Is a character name really that important?

New geometry prevents. Been discussed/tried lot of times during the beta.

Why would you do something just to upset someone else that gives you no personal gain, just wondering?

Tank/healer so

Warrior &amp; Priest/Druid/Pally.

Feral druid &amp; Priest/Pally

I guess Prot Pally + Druid/Priest

I'd just be concerned with gear clashes that's all but it should not be too bad. I'd not go 2x a class tho

I'd still say go VW.

Basically. Imagine trying to solo heal the whelp room, or the rooms above it full of dragonkin? Didn't those dragonkin mages throw frostbolts that hit like a truck? No thanks, let's 2-heal it. Priest/Pally for the tank/s, shaman/druid for the group.
---
Remove it, remove everything... cancel the release. This game allows people to paint dangerous political messages on the grounds or advertise shady services. Put this game on a list.
---
Is her name Alexis Jones?
---
Heck, it will take that entire 20 minutes, or more, just to get everyone together at the dungeon entrance.  Good times.
---
I remember one time playing in 20-29 bracket and somehow a level 40 managed to get in so he just ran on his mount with the flag every single time, easiest warsong gulch win ever.
---
cool, thanks.
---
[Archive.org](https://Archive.org) isnt stealing. It was online for free. I just used stuff that was free later when it got a paywall..
---
LFG chat is already global.
---
I disagree, I would say most WoW streamers have great communities. I can only think of 1 or 2 that I would consider toxic.
---
as someone who actually works in this field, the other guy is 100% correct. It's you guys who don't seem to know what you are talking about when it comes to "Throwing numbers into the room". Adblock is really popular among redditors and tech-savvy millenials. Most people still do not know wtf adblock is. Ask your parents if they know what adblock is.
---
Being able to identify how strong a person is or their accomplishments based on a glance at what they're wearing is incredibly underrated, when you're in level 60 greens and you see someone in full T2 it actually creates a feeling (fear if it's the opposing faction) you don't get in a world where everyone is transmogged.
---
This post made me realize that I almost exclusively listen to all of this music today. AOL Xtreme Alt-Radio helped facilitate it, but WoW cemented it into my identity. Looking forward to next week!
---
I've already taken at least the Tuesday off and I already put on my family calendar for Monday night 'Daddies night off, do not disturb!'
---
I haven't tried leveling with Elemental so I can't say about that, but Enhancement is the most common spec for leveling a shaman. Shamans are generally not amazing levelers except early on, but they get the job done since they have good sustain and utility.
---
Shame on you, sir! They're petless and ice trap-less!
---
Does multi boxing requires you to have 5 accs with 5 different subs?
---
I don't understand why everybody attacks Joana. It's not like a bait and switch. Very early on he stated it will be a paid guide. Not to mention there are a lot of quality free guides like classicwow.live/leveling.
---
hopefully someone else will be able to answer more thoroughly. but I'd recommend going paladin. they're boring to solo, similar to wars, but if you're grouping with someone regularly, it'll be much more fun. holy could be good, but you might want to look carefully at the tree to see if there's any particular talents you want that can boost your dps a bit too. pay heed to how often you'll play together, since you may have to level alone. the more time you'll level together, the more holy will work. 
---
I'd personally lean towards a priest with a warrior, since they can do better damage without sacrificing heals, but pala have high survivability, so you two would be very hard to stop. ne priests aren't that bad of a choice, everyone just loves dwarves for their fearward. it's more important that you play a character you like! racials can make a difference, but it's not as big as some people make it out to be. for example, I know gnomes are better mages/warlocks than humans, but I just do not like them for casters, and I don't like their mount. rogues work ok, but if I forced myself to play gnome to min-max it, I'd quit within a week.
---
No honor and no dishonorable kill for killing a player character 10 levels below you. Dishonorable kills are gained by killing some NPC's.
---
I have 2 on Herod and ally alt on Fairbanks, so you might be onto something, though it seems some people reserved all 3 names on the same realm
---
Alright thanks for the answer! I’ll give it a go and see!
---
You can also get the Mindcontroll buff from LBRS which is +83 FR for 60 min.
---
Those mass graves are super creepy looking
---
I'm not one to gloat. Also, all I'm saying is people know a thing will happen but they'll act surprised anyway and complain. That's the irony I'm pointing out.
---
The vast majority of players will quit within a few months, or play only during content droughts on retail. Blizzard expects classic to start huge, then fall off hard, and maintain a modest userbase.
---
What do you think would happen if they made more servers? They'd be ghost towns by end of October. Do you want that?
---
There's still time before launch for people to find their server. You didn't have to pick it immediately. Your friends who are rolling on launch day can follow you wherever.
---
&gt;Its not allowed to sell WoW content without Blizzard permission (he uses Blizzards images, models and map layouts).
---
I'm thinking of playing a tank in classic simply so I can control the situation. I vaguely remember most of the classic encounters (at least the dungeons), so going forward and taking control won't be a problem.
---
I originally thought I might go priest and then I remembered the mentality people will initially have due to the bloated mob-infested instances in retail and they way they're handled. As soon as I remembered that, I was like, "Nope. I need to be in the lead so shit like that doesn't happen."
---
only 3?!
---
There was several people on Shazzrah-EU discord manipulating votes
---
The amount of servers are almost fine for how it is right now, but Blizzard are in for rude awakening come launch day when at least TWICE the amount of people will join.
---
Also the idea that somehow half the people are going to stop playing the greatest game ever created after 3 months is just absurd. Those people have either a: never played vanilla, b: never played on a private server, c: belong in the you think you do but you don't.
---
mmmmm There is a potential for BC to come. And of course if that comes so does the great debate of BC v Vanilla.
---
So your claiming you cannot steal intellectual property?
---
I’d love to see your source on that
---
NH and ABT sets are also dope.
---
Why is noone listening to u/hollysheeto!?
---
His opinion is so important!!!
---
As other people have mentioned this is pretty laughable.  Only takes 16 days of playing 16 hours a day at a fast pace as a warrior to hit 60.  Yes...10.7 days to hit 60 on warrior is clearly accurate.
---
Some servers are missing.
---
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense, I can understand how that would easily become a problem in STV. As a consequence I think the meme will change player behavior on Classic realms as the new norm seems being far more aggressive in STV. That being said, I don't think it is necessarily a problem, it will likely offer guaranteed world PvP for anyone looking.
---
Absolutely going to do this.
---
if you do that it won't remain low pop for long.  
---
you are basically complaining about a possible problem in the future that the community could even easily fix by not being idiots.
---
join a lower population realm now. wait for launch day, play on a decently full realm.  
---
its not that hard to grasp that people will come in once there is an actual launch.  
---
more so, even the now "low" or "medium" realm will get packed to the brim.
---
Its an interesting way to treat it as a completionist tool. However guides would often skip questlines that are long, even if they are fun or unusual to do (or give a cool reward), since they mostly focus on speed and efficiency.
---
But if you enjoyed using a guide, then that's fine, as long as you're having fun :P
---
Except nothing really will happen if they get reported.
---
It's literally impossible to be shit at 1.1 rogues...  People who played them would know that.
---
Yeah, it does but I noticed not long ago I already had 5 accounts. A RaF from way back and like a trial, starter accounts I used to box up to lv 20. I just had to add the subscription to go past 20 but for classic, you need the subscription to play.
---
Wow, getting defensive? You sound personally attacked.
---
With 6222 players claiming Americas East PvP servers:
---
34.8% Herod
---
36.1% Stalagg
---
23.9% Skeram
---
5.2% Other
---
But at the same time, yesterday Blizzard issued ANOTHER statement urging ppl to leave Herod.  I think in reality Herod may still be a bit ahead, but this survey is being taken by ppl who are in the know and heeding the warnings.
---
By September 6th?  Yes, 100% for sure.  I was planning to be 60 at the end of September 2nd.  Giving me 4 days to get rep/grind gear is really nothing.  Bottom line, getting a kill on the 6th is do-able if you have a dedicated group of 40 people.
---
Really, it depends what streamer this is, since you don't seem to name them.  If they have a community of thousands of players, it's going to be easy for them to get the first 40 people that have hit 60 and zone into Molten Core.
---
I even think that you can have Rag dead by the end of 7 calendar days of release. And here's the math to show what you'd have to do...
---
If the whole melee/spell cleave leveling actually works, that's 4 days /played to get people to 60.  7 calendar days is 168 hours.  If the dungeon grind works, with 6 hours of sleep a day (not really that bad) you can get 60 in 5 calendar days.  The dungeon groups will also be geared with dungeon blues, so have a leg up on going into Molten Core.
---
That basically leaves 2 calendar days to farm Hydraxian Rep (get all your human mages to AoE farm rep, if you can get people who have levle 20+ warlocks they can help summon which makes things much faster as well on turn ins.  This part is pretty try hard, but it's not out of the range of do-able. 
---
Just looking at some private server first MC clear videos, took them about 6 hours.  So taking that off your 48 hours of prep.  That gives you 18 hours and 12 hours to wrap up rep grinds, herb farms for fire resist pots, anyone to maybe try thorium rep for resist gear but really you should be OK if you've got some dungeon +fire gear.
---
What can throw a wrench in this is if let's say dungeon grind gives you 5 days played.  So you've effectively cut down on 8 hours to prep for MC/Rag kill.  But these would be your slowest levelers, which probably aren't as intense needed.  Hunters solo can get under 5 days /played solo, same for warlocks.  It's really a matter of getting warriors/druids to be able to tank.
---
So, possible?  Yes.  Very hard and demanding likely requiring multiple accounts or people to sacrifice themselves just to speed up on summons/etc?  Yes.   Will everybody do this?  No.
---
So dumb.
---
The scarabs gave me panic attacks as a kid. Anything sub-dermal.....
---
If you love to place totems every 30 yards then shaman sure
---
Or you know, level in Desolace hahaha. There is that option, its not as pretty as STV but its an option.
---
Once per minute? So reckoning isn't at play or anything for getting more procs?
---
^ this. 
---
Classic is more RPG based so enjoy it. Doing a leveling guide for Skyrim is silly. If you can wait this very long 5 days for it to release.. you can give it time to really enjoy it.
---
The pink one gave it away. Eye of C'thuun is obvious but there's only one pink eye that wasn't caused by a dwarf farting on a pillow. Eye of the Naaru and Storm were half-guesses.
---
Maybe we do maybe we won't. But it's certain that we are going to invade someone!
---
The only problem with this is that the community for this game will be vastly different from the original community. Most players are going to be experienced hardcore veterans.
---
If you take your sweet time leveling on a pvp server, you risk getting mercilessly ganked by week 2 and 3
---
I'm going where my guild is going. We're having a meeting tonight. But we won't go on a RP-PvP

your a ret paladin ?
---
Calm down lol. Like you said, it's just a video game poll, and you're seemingly taking it as seriously as he is.
---
imagine my surprise when I visited Can You Run It and discovered that my perfectly fine PC desktop doesn't have the CPU for recommended.
---
I know vanilla used to run on a potato but classic is a much hungrier beast.
---
Just feign death + eat and drink whenever something goes wrong and relax
---
Except that’s not what I said at all.  Reading comprehension must be hard for a kid.
---
Thank you for updating 7, it was the best option by far
---
personally, warlock. easier leveling, if nothing else.
---
People can tweak small functionalities allowed by the addon API, that's what it's for.
---
&gt;It's a bit disingenuous to somehow believe "this add-on existed in vanilla" justifies people saying they don't mind an lfg functionality, when the large, overwhelming majority of players in this subreddit are of the belief that the lfg/lfr functionality is one of the biggest things that changed wow. 
---
While I agree that LFR and LF**D** had negative impact, this addon don't adds anything near the LFR functionality, so the overwhelming majority of players in this subreddit are actually comparing apples to oranges, and crying rivers of tear over something they don't know what do and how.
---
The dude said in an interview that he has to have some kind of open heart surgery. He is not well. So he is definately going to need more money living in America if he wants to pay his medical bills off....
---
Thanks man
---
Healena.  In case I want to play a priest.
---
Not my finest moments must admit.
---
7 bosses lurking?
---
Well in the end I guess they got what they wanted, less non-4channers playing on their server as a lot more sane people will opt-out from visiting Shazzrah now.
---
I first saw that on a Tauren Warrior during a Southshore pvp battle and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Looks so big on a Tauren.
---
It's called Gen Z. Millenials make up the majority of former players at this point. Not many 10-20 year olds ever played WoW these days.
---
Oh no! He's insulting some idiots who deserve it, how miserable!
---
Sure plenty of words have been around. “Triggering” was not used in this era of WoW on the interweebs my dude.
---
What a bunch of losers
---
Idk, I always found UC even faster to navigate than IF, but the learning curve is just way too steep for memorization.
---
Remember we can all do what we want and if 50% of classic geta burnt out so be it. I will use one to save a little bit of headache and time but im not rushing in anyway.
---
I’m still giggling about all the people thinking they’re getting to 60 in a month. “Casual raid team, raiders have 5-6 weeks from launch to be raid ready”
---
240 hours is roughly the average time to 60. That’s not casual that’s extremely hardcore
---
Like, chill. Leveling is the best part of Vanilla, enjoy it. If you level straight to 60 you just obsoleted most of the game for yourself
---
It's ~7 bucks. I mean, my taco lunch yesterday was $11. Worth it just to hear the login music and get goosebumps.
---
thank you for the relevant info! im still annoyed though
---
Sageblade comes very late and is not that great. Try to pick up at least mageblade form mc by then or better lok'amir from bwl.
---
As far as I know, in classic there will be absolutely nothing functionally different between RP / PVE and RP-PVP / PVP.
---
The "RP" tag is kind of just an identifier - players interested in roleplaying are encouraged to roll their characters on the RP realms to find like-minded players.
---
To be fair it still looks like this lmao
---
? You realize it's pvp right
---
[Like I've said here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ctxebd/for_anyone_saying_blizzard_is_changing_skeletons/exosnm5/) there are many other solutions that'd make the players happy. 
---
I feel like decreasing the despawn timer is just a lazy solution and still enables players to spell out things.
---
Donald's fourth rule of raiding. [http://www.darklegacycomics.com/152](http://www.darklegacycomics.com/152)
---
ah right, great tip. ill keep that in mind! Yes, i have quite a few additional abilities i have to add (could use ctrl+qwert too for the less used stuff). Detect traps, noted!
---
then just switch servers? whats the problem?  
---
once game launches the realms with the lower population will fill up anyways.
---
They are enough though. Classic is going to have massive dropoff after launch and that means that it has to be massively overpopulated AT launch to compensate. It's supposed to look like this.
---
There's no perfect solution when you have such a massive shift in population coming. They're taking the best possible path given the facts, from a risk management perspective.
---
Prepare accordingly.
---
&gt;If you take your sweet time leveling on a pvp server, you risk getting mercilessly ganked by week 2 and 3
---
Then you bring friends. Or make friends. Surely people somehow leveled low level alts even after original WoW release? :p
---
&gt; massive ques
---
It seems like you should care less about languages on your server since you're already speaking Spanish!
---
Tank/Healer is always a safe bet, but throwing in a different option.
---
If you have any interest in hunters/pets, double hunter can be really fun. you can solo a lot of stuff you should be able to by ping ponging aggro and taking advantage of kiting.
---
Ya, actually everything (except first aid) still applies in retail if you're trying to do hard content. The difference is in retail if you are a good player with good gear there is still hard pve content to do.
---
Absolutely agree. Just take it easy. :)
---
"We have designed a new tech, called layers, where we can fit as many people we want on a server to everyone has a smooth launch and starting zone experience.".   
---
Log in server are different then world servers. This is a hardware fact.   
---
There will be a login queue.    
---
There will be no/very little layer/world server queues.    
---
Blizz will not allow it.
---
StalaGang
---
As someone who's played CS and other intense FPS games for the last 15 years, on top of WoW, always stretch.  
---
Stretching helps out so much it's insane.
---
My guilds waiting and we're pretty dedicated
---
Lotta guilds waiting to see where grizzly goes (some waiting for streamers etc) cuz no one wants to play with those doofuses. 
---
I think every fkin server will have queue times, but Herod and Shaz will just be unbelievably packed
---
There's none in mine. 😞️
---
Why? It has nothing to do with the subject
---
&gt; We've seen this play out before COUNTLESS times in the history of WoW
---
But you'll stop it this time, with this one add-on. ^/s
---
I was doing the Wetlands Run from Ironforge when I got munched by a raptor and thought "hey, I'll just rez at the graveyard as a shortcut!" I didn't realise the graveyard was right beside a bloody murloc colony. OMG.
---
I ask this question genuinely, not to belittle or make a point:  
---
Why is the LGBTQ+  community organizing to go to a server together?  It ultimately doesn't matter.  People can do what they want, but I like understanding when I can.
---
Find new guild, they're going to ruin their experience by being afraid of a bit of PVP. If you insist on staying with them, go priest.
---
Absolutely zero need to do that. Arms or fury warriors are just fine for tanking while leveling.
---
You get 51 talent points so none of those was max-level Warlock builds.
---
I'm curious if the old MC bug to force disconnects work. Especially with potential queues being so high. 
---
Not going into details on how its done but I know this was done on my server to guilds raiding and forced nights off or pushed back raids for some guilds.
---
Killing rage week 2 isn't that hard.  Anyone who's taken a week off work will be 60 by the end of 7-8 calendar days.  Even if you didn't take off week 2, you should have more than enough time to farm up rep/items/herbs needed to go in and do a full clear of MC.
---
Week 1 kills are the ones that will be most demanding.  You can do it, but it requires a lot of very dedicated 40+ people to even get there and you need to realistically plan for maybe 80 people to level to 60 as half might not make it in the time you need them to.
---
All very true. A sleep/ working schedual is whats most efficient for sure. Pulling all nighters is not :).
---
I made a bad video with IRL tips on that subject lol.
---
https://youtu.be/EtemiebTToo
---
Go post in that thread then.
---
I have my name reserved on both realms \*shrugs in German\*
---
Thank you. I got juice squirted out my nose all over my office desk.
---
Not even a Gratz in guild. Fuck retail sucks ass
---
So would you suggest to go ahead and create a character to save a name or just wait and see how they handle the realms on launch day? I want to make sure I can play with my friends and not get separated.
---
What about these Guilds that say they are going to down Rag in the first week...
---
LOL private server scrubs.
---
I think we can safely assume the hardcore guilds are min/maxing their race choices.
---
Every raid brings plenty of Shaman. Any 5 man group would be more than happy with a Shaman. You'll be fine.
---
In PvP, ele/resto hybrid is one of the best specs in the game, and one of if not the only actual viable hybrid spec. You'll be 1-2 shotting Alliance scum, and will be more than a competent and competitive healer to boot. Any group would be happy to have you in their BG. (also good for open world content/farming).
---
"I have some old friends from out of town I'm going to see for the first time in a while. So I'm putting in to take that whole week off."
---
awesome, thats really great to know
---
I finally got around to getting Thunderfury on my Warlock the other night.  Had the bindings in my bank for a few months, but couldnt figure out the quest one night (turns out you need them *in* your bags to get the quest, not in your bank).  Forgot about it for a while, but was going through my bank the other night and saw them again.
---
May or may not be currently annoying my guild by linking it...
---
Well, for me that seems like a good opportunity to level the gun skill :-)
---
But i see it's a matter of convenience. Thx for the reply.
---
That's just what's on my forehand.
---
Been practicing leveling on a pserver and have actually liked the feel of the guide. Keeps me moving from zone to zone rather than just getting stagnant and grinding mobs to catch up. I just like efficiency I guess. My first alt will likely be a lot of blind questing though. Reserve it for late night or solo sessions to chill out.
---
Wait and see.
---
Who doesn't want a permanent 'wowgold4u.com' hanging in the air in Orgrimmar?

---
It's just a visual pretty UI that looks at LFG spam messages in global chat. And it spams chat for you occasionally, so people without the addon can still see you are looking for a group

Let's be honest, once she sees the size of his Thunderfury it will all be worth it
---
Well colour me jealous
---
Lol why would that change my opinion ? Just love seeing all you triggered snowflakes cry about him it is funny as someone who doesn’t give a fuck . Keep crying
---
Touché.
---
I remember as a kid, with my trial account, I hit 20 on my mage and just kept grinding sfk and any other dungeon. I had every caster drop for lv 20 when I finally got a subscription lol
---
Will be worth it definitely... Wish me luck and I shall see you on the battlefield lok'tar ogar friend
---
For the alliance!
---
Ok chad no need to make fun of others
---
hm, maybe not quite as good as mages at later levels, since they can't really aoe effectively. but still pretty good. I'd often be killing 3 or so mobs at once, even at low levels, so they're still good at it, not limited like warriors or other classes. Mages are probably the best farmers lol
---
Backpedal is useful for making slight adjustments to very precise jumps, like trying to land on a fence post or something
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/ is what i use
---
not an issue at all
---
DKP works well for a guild that is casual. Anything that wants to clear content most likely will run loot council.
---
sonii is the one doing it, he bet Tim, DrLupo, Jordan Fisher, and Cloakzy.
---
He is rolling a warrior so it is possible
---
but his friends not and then the bitching keeps going.  
---
this is really interesting to observe. I'm really interested in what Blizzard is going to do now.
---
Yeah I don't know where they got that.
---
All the guides I see are the aff/demo hybrids. Only differences in which tree to prioritize.
---
Night elves get Shadow Meld.  Dwarves have Stone Form.
---
The irony of this is that you people are so dumb that you think I'm talking about putting a VENDOR in the game. 
---
Complete lack of reading comprehension and imagination. I thought you vanilla weirdos loved reading quest text.
---
Most of the time as a shaman leveling you'll just go for "of the owl" green gear in leather pre 49 for a healing set. That tends to be the path of least resistance for a healing set early on. That way blues go to main spec casters too. At least that's my experience back in the day as a sham.
---
There's nothing wrong with asking if you're genuinely curious. There's multiple reasons. WoW is a social game where real friendships are made, and some want to play with people they already have some shared life experience with. It's why stoner guilds are a thing
---
Some will also just want to decrease their chances that they'll run into homophobes or transphobes who'll suddenly treat them differently the moment they say "brb my husband is calling me". Is designating a server a surefire way to avoid anti-LGBT sentiment? No, but it helps greatly in finding safe communities.
---
Only 1 pvp server OCE rip
---
Most quests are pretty simplistic: kill X amount of this, retrieve X amounts of that. Its harder to find out where to go and such in Classic WoW though compared to retail due to no arrows pointing the way. You might actually have to read the quest text here and there (something I recommend doing anyway since it lets you immerse yourself more in the game).
---
PvP is relatively common (though because of this layering stuff that wasnt in the original we cant be 100% sure) and some of the earlier zones are safe and you cant be attacked unless you yourself turn on PvP mode. Most areas are "contested" though and there you and everyone else is a target. Some areas will most likely be more active than others (areas with end game dungeons/crafting materials and STV for the most part).
---
Its not easy to change talents sadly so I would recommend either looking through all the talents personally and find a build you want to go for (you get 51 pts in total, 1 per lvl from 10-60) or find a "cookie cutter build" on the internetz.
---
Ah I see now. Misunderstood your first post. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I'm not sure a lot of that's cutting through, I think the general sentiment is 'HYYYYPE IM GONNA BE RAIDING MC IN TWO WEEKS'
---
Aw, oh well. I'll have to find another mount then...was Frostsaber obtainable in Classic? I wanna set a goal for myself.
---
As cool as transmog is there’s something special about equipping a new green or blue that’s extremely ugly but necessary.
---
I mean I'm gonna play a druid but a priest with my gf and I'll level a shaman but I'll go warlock and rogue on a pvp server while tanking endgame on my warrior and farm on my mage and sometimes hunter. But I get how some people might be indecisive. 
---
/S
---
I try not to bring that up, people that haven’t done it don’t like hearing that opinion. 60 is a huge accomplishment in itself and a lot of people brush it off like if they can get to max in retail they can max in Vanilla. 
---
When you have a 6 hour play session and only gain 1 level it starts to come into perspective 😂😂
---
&gt; Now who will play WoW Classic... my parents or me, a gamer? Tough question, I give you that.
---
WoW classic is a 15 year old game... lol. You don't think there are a lot of 25 or even 30+ players? An 18 year old kid today couldn't even read when WoW launched.
---
&gt; (Also my father manages company networks for a living, but good try)
---
Okay, and? So what is that supposed to mean you know about it? And you are basically describing IT infrastructure? What does that have to do with digital advertising or SEO?
---
zero sum DKP, with no handouts or loot counciling, is basically the only way i'll raid.
---
there are several decent mods to manage zero sum, attendance and the like. or you can have a non-raider manage a spreadsheet for it reasonably easy.
---
(handouts == dkp for flasks, consumables, food, showing your boobs to the GM, etc)
---
those players are what I like to call Fresh Meat :)
---
Yes I did!
---
Why don't people like it when blizzard merges realms?
---
Sonii is the streamer doing it, I didn't want the post to come off like an ad.
---
Pfft, they are gonna be lagged so hard I will get home, come on and see level 5 gnomes still trying to kill wolves everywhere whining
---
I think it'll be less of a "drop off" and more likely just half or 1/3rd of people playing concurrently when it's not literally launch day.
---
Uh...hey, Blizz, my dad works at a local newspaper. Can I get one of these so he can ….uh....report on it?
---
Nothing formal has been released from Blizz yet and probably won't until a while after the game is released. They don't want to advertise that info, because then it makes faction balance *worse*. People just start joining the "alliance" server or the "horde" server.
---
However some servers have done their own surveys, which aren't perfect but give you a decent idea. The one I'm on is very close to 50/50; and judging off retail servers will prob stay around equal.
---
Apes will most likely be Alliance because the fact is Horde has majority. So Apes will have more to do and will get faster BG queues.
---
I think that a lot more people will clear BWL than this forum believes. 
---
Once we get to phase 5 and the gates are open, AQ20 and ZG will be sources of gear that let more casual guilds catch up a bit. I don't think many people will even more than a boss (if that) into AQ40, but I think that T2 gear is mostly achievable for your average casual player by the time we reach Naxx.
---
not exactly talking about you not accepting criticism, but if someone posts a genuine reaction like "that's not very good artwork and here's what you could do to improve..." people downvote them to hell. Another problem is I cant really tell a shitpost from someone genuinely attempting to make artwork anymore on this sub. People with 5 minute MS paint pictures get more upvotes than someone who made a brand new animated vanilla login screen.

Mage is better than lock in classic. Hence why there's just a high population of them
---
All I see is some xp walking around and maybe some sweet basilics meat.
---
are you a multiboxer by chance?
---
Yeap.
---
&gt; I followed up with "I'm not familiar with the finer details for Tanking",
---
If you aren't sure, then don't give a suggestion.
---
&gt; Crusader in general as I stated is a good idea for a Melee class that uses STR,
---
Strength is not used by tank paladins at all. If you don't know the basics about prot paladins, don't give advice.
---
&gt; You seem to just be looking to pick an argument with someone.
---
Says the guy, who responds to an answer to his statement with a clearly aggressive comment, designed to rile someone up.
---
&gt; Do you not know what a question and a statement are?
---
This clearly was a question towards you, because you suggested crusader is good. But, well, we've already established you have trouble understanding context. Have you never heard the expression where person A makes a statement and person b responds by "how does that statement make sense?" and then explains what's wrong with it?
---
Neh. Fiery/lifesteal/agility/crusader &gt; unholy any day, regardless of the content. And if it's a low level 5 man, it can easily be tanked without any enchants at all. Mitigation is pretty weak in Classic, and unless your healer is absolute dogshit Unholy won't make a difference anyway; in fact, it wouldn't make a difference anyway if your healer WAS dogshit.
---
Better to get higher TPS and faster clears with a diff enchant. Hardly anyone uses Unholy, and the ones that do only do so until they can afford/get their hands on a better chant.
---
Seeing Spanish in trade chat doesn’t give me a negative experience, just like seeing LFG when I’m not looking for a group doesn’t bother me, but maybe I’m in the minority. I think this is kind of Blizz’s fault with no Spanish servers though. I just feel uncomfortable making people segregate to their own channels when they don’t really have a good server of their own, they’re just people with the same goals but a different language.

---
They weren't good at holding aggro in vanilla if you were spamming shadowbolt.
---
It was so rage inducing seeing so many in that thread saying that like it's a viable option. Locking a server would be a huge shit show for people wanting to play together
---
Yeah companies hate making money and yearn for products they just sunk time and money in to fail and damage their brand.
---
Great Ad hominem  because you cant defeat me in an arguement. Proving me correct. Run away now
---
Well were I to beat a dead horse I might ask if you'd say that whimsical new talk animation matches any existing spoken Tauren dialogue?
---
"Ahhh... I've been expecting you," the elder said flailing his arms, widening his eyes and bouncing on his hooftips.
---
Idk it's just to big and sluggish for me now. My main since cata has been a dwarf , i like being small and feeling faster (even though the speed is obviously the same). 
---
As for what I would prefer that's actually an easy question because I am going shaman too. Troll. Though orcs are also appealing i'm gonna go troll to try something i never played before. Plus if there's one thing BFA did right it's make trolls an appealing race lore wise and stuff.
---
Back when I did play tauren i actually liked it so much that I would heal resto druid without going into tree of life, and people gave me shit for it. I said complain when you die.
---
I see what you did there.
---
FYI - good posture helps a lot. Think about not being hunched over and opening up the area next to your pectorals and armpits.  RSI is often caused by bad posture.  
---
A great stretch - lie down on a bench and put out your arms to open up your pectoral area.  You are stretching and opening up your front shoulder areas.  Put arms out 90 degrees, and also put arms over your head.  Prevent compression of this key area going to your arms.  
---
Also, if you have wrist/hand/arm pain the absolute best thing to do is rest them and not use the computer as much as possible. Take breaks.  Not using a PC is the real cure for RSI.  Let your hands/arms rest and recover.   
---
(I have bad RSI and know some of the top US  medical experts on RSI).
---
Druid is pretty far up there, especially that they get their own entire zone and every 10 or so levels have a long and dynamic quest to get bear, sea lion, cat, cheetah and dire bear form
---
&gt; If you fuck up and join a Brazilian ran server and you don’t speak Portuguese or Spanish it’s fucking GG. 
---
Eh.  Won't effect your raiding if you have a guild.  They might have a large presence, but it's not going to run the server.  I think you'll be fine joining these and the larger BR community has said they're going to avoid speaking Portuguese in main chat and keep it to their private channels.
---
Plus, there are great players that are Brazilian.  Our best rogue in vanilla was a BR.
---
If you say so ;)
---
No redeeming qualities? They corrupted a video game survey so they should be condemned? This is really what you think should happen?
---
Sure it's not cool, but I'm with the poster above you. Lift people up, don't push them down farther that just makes it worse.
---
Can't wait to experience Lag-Forge again.
---
I can do a bangin Murloc impression irl
---
Corrupting data like that is pretty low, but I don't see how depression/incel/etc have anything to do with it.  They aren't sabotaging it as a joke, they want to convince Spanish people not to play on their realm (which is mean but hardly what you're suggesting of it - nice rant tho)
---
It's the latest version 1.15.1.11346, I've put in a ticket to blizzard support as I haven't found a fix.
---
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/user/dodo100/submitted/  
---
&gt;You calling somebody a fat incel is sort of like Hitler calling somebody an antisemitic racist. Forsen's community is basically a gaming version of r/incels.
---
got em' got eeem'
---
Yes, but this one doesn't look as good as BetterCharacterStats.
---
Warrior (dps or tank) + paladin (healer) is a golden combo. One of the biggest issues as a warrior in PvP is mobility and with a paladins Blessing of Freedom you can wreck everyone. Paladin is also one of the best dungeon healers.
---
I don't get it why I don't see this brought up more often. This is what I used to do. Type in /who **warrior 18-20** "Hi wanna come tank DM? last spot" and whispered every online warrior in that bracket. I lvled in a low pop server during TBC, I ran every single dungeon while lvling and only remember like one time I had to disband group because were searching for 30 mins already.
---
It really is an accomplishment ya know, and that is the first true test of WoW. The rite of passage.
---
You don't have that anymore with retail.
---
Playing while others work.. win, win. People who remember classic should mostly be geezers; Some of us may even be retired XD
---
People should play how they want to play.
---
*Laughs stealthily*
---
Yeah, i havent played wow with sound on since 09 lol. Gonna be listening to the game :D
---
Thank you sir! Saved and will be jamming out to this next week.
---
It's the latest version, 1.15.1.11346
---
*13+ levels below you, level 48 gives you honor at 60

Technically, if you choose a default keyboard you're gimping yourself. Ortholinear keystrokes are faster than standard keyboards.

No, it absolutely won’t :p

I'm personally a fan of the chapter dedicated to telling the story of a rock on the side of the road.
---
Aug 27 birthdays unite!
---
But you guys, like many many others, will be flexible at least so you'll pick a server that is not full when they open up more. I think people like you will be fine. It's the ones who are stubbornly holding on to their names who might be in for a rough time.
---
There will be nighttime raids. Look around. Talk to people who are on at your gaming time. Sageblade is phase 5, at this point I expect pugs to go mc. You should be able to get Mageblade or at the very least Bloodcaller from Zg even with your limited time constraints.
---
Did you not read the AMA?
---
Thank you so much. LETS GO HOME AT LONG LAST.
---
Spanish people reading survey on reddit classic wow should be like 0.01% of the whole spanish wow classic players. They are fighting a stupide useless battle.
---
ironically gear doesnt really matter much when leveling...
---
They used to credit your account free days of gametime here and there if the server issues were really bad.
---
He ad libs his reads in Conan fashion and I thought this was pretty great to share.
---
Get YouTube Red. Best decision I ever made.

Do 10 sit-ups or 10 push-ups everytime you take a flight, a boat or a zeppelin.

Level up your charachter and yourself!
---
All I wanted was to enjoy the sunset on Westfall's coast! Then these scaly bastards come Mrrrgrbllllling all up in my business. Fuck of slimy angry Kermit!
---
You'll still be able to farm and explore the world, albeit more slowly. If you're wanting to go farm mob for a while, you still can, but obviously not as quickly as if you were shadow. As a healer, you'll always be better off playing with another person when possible. Solo is still doable - just slower.
---
For PvP, kind of the same thing. Holy priests can beat a lot of things, but overall isn't as powerful as shadow in a 1v1 scenario. You'll be far from worthless - in fact some things you'll still stomp pretty well.
---
Keep your filthy elf selves in your own lands
---
Leveling in darkshore and ashenvale is actually really good so either way i'll need to do it
---
Same here! Got my names so I’m happy. I think Blaumeux will fill up quite fast. With other servers expecting to have high queue times, I can imagine people making the switch so they can finally play.
---
See: layering and the myriad threads dedicated to the subject, friend.
---
Tbf I heard plenty of people say the game doesn't begin until 60 back in the day.  Which was a weird concept coming from everquest where max lvl was 65 at the time, but people raided as low as 46.
---
A new countdown! Week complete. Work will be so much better tomorrow.
---
I have one complaint though, that Lokth fellow seems to be in this episode A lot. I think he detracts from the overall podcast and makes each segment he's in worse. As someone who hate fun, I say you should invite him to every call, quickly killing off the podcast in its entirety.
---
Wat?
---
I dont get it. How is this related to WOW?
---
The one that will be as full as the current ones are now. Atleast you can say, i did my part.
---
Do you know if lifesteal scales with spellpower?
---
Otherwise I might just go with spellpower since it's something I'll be stacking with other gear and will benefit a lot of spells. Whereas Fiery Weapon won't benefit from all that.
---
You wanted Hammond Druthers, "THIS" is Hammond Druthers!
---
I think this is a given. The people who were hardcore on Vanilla MC and BWL will have to accept that no one will ever face the precise challenges that we did when first attempting the raids. Because yeah, Blizzard is going to release the later patched version. I replied to someone in this thread who was like 'we're gonna clear stuff so much faster than you all did' and it's like, yeah... But we disagree about the reasons. We cleared bosses who, at the time, only a handful of guilds in the entire world could defeat. They'll be taking on content that hundreds of guilds have cleared. That's OK though.
---
If I remember correctly you if they are close enough to be targeted with /tar you can /inspect them without even needing to be in line of sight.
---
Yeah man just play whatever you think you will have most fun with. Raid spots will always be open with the amount of people planning on playing
---
So much this, as one who get her SO into MMO, I was happy to just guide her, play with her and do everything we could together. I was giving suggestion, she chose what to do once there was options. Slowlyness, noobiness, or even just doing crazy things, just have fun OP, this is a game nonetheless so don't forget to have fun. Want to explore there because you want so, JUST DO IT.
---
It may be some sort of twisted masochism, but I absolutely love the Murloc sound.
---
Have since December '04 when I first heard it in Westfall, and probably will for as long as I can recognize sounds.
---
&gt;the fact they could be placed on people's blacklist.
---
literally never happened for someone gogogoing. that shit was literally like 3 players a server who ninja'd something or did something big.
---
i can tell you didn't play vanilla because the 'blacklist' wasn't a thing at all but this sub loves to talk about it like it was a normal thing
---
It will never be a dead server. To be a dead server, the pop would have to be 1.2k or lower. A Blizzard WoW Classic server will never be "dead". Remember: Vanilla servers were designed around 3-4k players MAX.
---
I see, after looking at that I wouldn't say its math exactly, and more so just calculated under the theory/fact that Hunter is the constant for the measurement of speed. giving warrior a 1.3x
---
I miss the days of knowing every raider on the server. Lfg was never needed if you knew how to play the groups found you.
---
Nope. Talk to trainer&gt;learn cat. There are trash item cat statuettes in Darkshore that suggest there was going to be a quest, but it didn't make the cut.
---
This is one of the perks of having a guild! Hopefully you find yourself a  group of people that help each other progress through the game. This makes looking for groups to instances a lot easier! Good luck out there!
---
Exactly. Servers are full with everyone creating their three characters, some on multiple realms. You can’t play 3 characters at once, so all the populations are “full” but overstated by 66%.
---
Proudmoore has had the same LGBT community since at least Wrath if not BC. I'm curious when you stopped playing.
---
Thanks man! I'm glad you like it! &lt;3 it was a blast to edit. real credit goes to hurricane and IKEDIT for making those sick renders and cinematics.
---
What that means, of course, is that they will weather the storm of queues and complaints at the start to a certain degree. So while they'll bring up some extra servers, they won't work to eliminate the queues completely.
---
Nothing. They say it's also for hate speech but it won't stop any group of people with the mind set of 1940s racist blondies as well.
---
Some ants on a log
---
Brazil alone has almost a 300 million person population what part of that is minority when we don’t know the % of people that will play.
---
Not so plentiful on ally side D:
---
This is exactly why the OP post is stupid. Sure.maybe some group will so this, either way it's a fuck load of materials, you'll be allowed to "help"
---
Not true. 
---
You get less exp for killing the relatively lower leveled mobs, but quests give a set amount of exp regardless of your level (unless they're grey, which they won't be at 35)
---
Not a fair comparison at all. That was a new game. This is an old game that many if not most will play for a brief nostalgia trip and then quit for various reasons. This subreddit is full of devoted fans, the rest of the world is not so interested or able to play for a long time.
---
It will be that way once layering is gone in Phase 2.
---
Make fake gmail/google account at school/work, fill in form, never use account again
---
Kind of stuck between warrior and hunter
---
Warriors are probably my favorite class but i remember the struggle  of lvling a warrior back in the day and I've always been really bad at tanking.
---
Hunter Is my close second favorite class and the idea of a calm easy lvling experience is very appealing to me especially since I dont't have the time to play like i used to. My only concern with hunter is finding raid spots since i know realistically you only need about 2 per raid. Let me know how strict you guys think guilds will be this time around in terms of classes they allow into raid groups.
---
“Every online game in history”
---
*Looks at Vanilla WoW*
---
Night elf shadowmeld with a cat on prowl can be really fun. It requires you to be out of combat and is primarily offensive. I order the defensive aspect of stoneform. It lets you clear a rogue's blind, bleeds, and crippling poison. And there will be a lot of rogues.
---
god damn they gave me ptsd
---
That is a huge episode!
---
What a great way to pump the hype off the charts and put a bow on the final pregame episode.
---
The next time a C2C podcast posts we will be leveling our asses off.
---
highly considering it for my human mage because of the mount, is the death run worth it or does it take too long?
---
It wasn't lazy or a plain old reskin
---
They were fully remodelled versions of T6 sets with far more detail and visual depth than the originals.
---
 You could argue it was lazy to reuse the same designs but the actual work involved would still be pretty significant to model and texture the lot to modern standards.
---
Plus they had three recolours for each difficulty, and the mythic difficulty had a "superpowered" design that look quite different and very, very awesome. Especially the paladin one where the crown was magnificent and the shoulders had exploded.
---
Yes it’s possible.
---
This is true. During WOTLK I transfered from Vashj to Bleeding Hollow. The name I had was taken on BH. So I opened armory saw that they were not even on it (Under Level 10).
---
Opened a GM ticket asking them to let me have that name for my transfer, and they gave it to me.
---
Druid tank tho ;)
---
Shazz is going to be the toxic shithole of realms. I feel kinda bad for the spanish community playing there.
---
This isn't vanilla. This is classic. WoW in not the phenomenon it was back in 2004. People WILL drop off.
---
There's a pretty nice 30/0/21 build, if I remember correctly, that is both good enough for raid healing as well as being one of the strongest pvp specs overall. Another alternative is to try to squeeze your way into a raid as enhancement as a totem-twister for your melee dps group. I'm hopeful that in classic, more off-meta specs like that will be used in the casual raid setting.
---
^^^THIS
---
If that statement hits home, LFG should never be missed 😁👍🏻
---
Was this to get rid of Spaniards? Shazzrah is a European server right?
---
Eventually.  At launch players on each server will be phased to separate "layers" and you won't necessarily see the same people over and over again.  People are really pissed off about this.  Blizzard has said that they will end layering by the end of Phase 1 and then they will function like vanilla back in the day.
---
Frostbolt.
---
Polymorph rank 1.
---
????
---
Profit.
---
Don’t race to 60. Just explore and meet people along the way. The great thing about vanilla was the communication between people.
---
Why not other way around ?
---
Pssh casual.
---
There's going to be a lot of kids and manchildren screeching about how they can't login and it will all be forgotten about within a week. 
---
Happens every time.
---
If you pvp you want engineering.  Warriors while amazing when supported in a group are highly vulnerable to casters.  Engr allows them to make spell reflector trinkets as well as grenades that can be used as a ranged interrupt, and that is just scratching the surface of what engineering can do in pvp.
---
&gt; but I don't see how depression/incel/etc have anything to do with it.
---
Simple...if you want to discredit someone on the internet, you use those words (along with 'racist' in the OP).
---
It's a question of morality
---
Doh. I didn't think to even look it up. What a dumb. Sorry and thank you!
---
You’re one of those that ruined WoW. Make friends
---
Would you suggest leveling engineering while leveling?
---
Oh I plan to!  It's a bit ridiculous how many screenshots I have in WoW.  I have a lot from vanilla, but I wish I took a lot more than what I did.
---
I remember there used to an addon (don't remember the name) that you could set specific or random intervals for it to take screenshots automatically, which could make for some great, unexpected shots.
---
Deep Holy tops the meters. At least one deep Disc is usually brought for PI/utility. Both use the exact same rotations/spells, and both are raid healers. Druids and Shammys get the the job of Tank healing.
---
Yeah, for pvp it's not a bad combo.  I was thinking more about leveling.  Priest is one of the faster levelers in general whereas pally is probably second slowest (war is slowest).  You get the healing factor plus dps.
---
&gt; Rest of the group: jUsT hEaL bRo!!1!
---
Its so true. DPS who have never healed just don't understand...
---
Please see the nuance in my argument. 
---
Think of it like this. People playing on Thalnos, if someone in their group fucks up, they might think “ugh, fucking Brazilians...” but on Herod, if a group member fucks up, people don’t think “ugh, fucking Americans...” it’s called confirmation bias, there are many good articles on it.
---
Came here to say that using "gay" as a detrimental word is very bad.
---
I feel like the only assumption we can really make is that the populations will vary from high to medium to low in the order they were created.
---
Someone did an internet poll and 69% said they could.
---
So many of these comments never raided in vanilla. 
---
Priests are more sought after than shamans. Priests are straight up better healers and have the only magic dispel on horde. 
---
Shamans are nice healers as well, but only get to the same tier as priests when in naxx gear. The spirit regen mechanic for priests makes a tremendous difference.
---
Love this! Immediate follow, thanks for your hard work!
---
YES! Been waiting for this all week. Thanks for all your hard work Josh. Can't wait to see where the podcast goes from here.
---
That's pretty amazing! I noted in another comment that this was meant to be limited to one song per artist. That's where the real fun of making this came from for me!
---
It is, layer is selected upon login if you are offline for some time. You can always change it if you get into someone else party on different layer.
---
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
---
I'm in health care, told people why I was going off. Don't care what they think, can do what i like with my leave. TBF though everyone's just smiled and said have fun.
---
Shouldn't be considering so many players said they wanted "the real vanilla experience" woth queues and all.
---
Priest, I wont level solo as holy spec this time...
---
Cant tell which one but healing paladins rolling on cloth or dps warrior rollung on leathet is a meme spec to you? Lol just take your downvotes and stop.
---
These people are nuts
---
WoW sucks
---
Yes. However, there is a catch to this. Because a server will have so many people playing at the same time, the server will be split into layers. People will still be playing on the same server, but you will not be able to see every single person for example in Westfall. But once Phase 2 hits, there will only be one layer per server.
---
gotta capital it and move the ! at the end.
---
It used to be a really small range, it got changed eventually, not 100% sure how far it will be in classic.
---

Yea, I did that a few times. If i ran across a huge group of murlocks on my high level warlock I would stop and rain curses and hellfire on the whole camp.
---
Havent subbed in 4 years. Will be resubbing on Monday checking in
---
Thus they win.
---
Should be interesting with dynamic respawns :-p
---
Maybe that's what they want. Lower population so only the wankers on discord have it.

I got around the same, only having several hours a week really cuts into it!

four lightning bolts to the face should to it.
---
Ahhh, Jeff Goldblum episode 15
---
Oh well thanks dude! It's a bit messy and uncategorized but I'm glad it helps. A lot of this will come naturally and some of it ya just gotta learn or experience on the way. All the pieces of the puzzle will fall into place though!
---
The community will drive away trolls and people with bad attitudes.  Dynamic nodes and creatures was in vanilla and will exist in Classic confirmed by a blue post.
---
These seem like minor issues.  3000 vs 10000 isnt going to change much when a world boss spawns.
---
Nice :) As do I. Though I work from a home office, so I can cheat easier by just booting up the gaming pc directly while working if needed.
---
I love the bearded dragon pride. #serverpride, bois! See you there! ❤️
---
very well said.
---
But my guild forces me to. They said they will bust a cap in my ass if i ain't 60 by week 1. I don't know what else to do,
---
sorry Jeff Goldblum episdoe
---
They are both pretty even in raids tbh. Rogues and Mages are the kind of DPS you want to fill your raids with, you should be fine with either one.
---
What was the gift?
---
This!  Mid level dungeons start with Gnomer or RFD at 32ish.  Scarlet Monastery is by far the best middle tier.
---
Enjoy getting booted from your group.
---
7 Raids waiting?
---
literally every class has their own thing. but i'd have to say the coolest immeersion for me in a quest was the first totem quest for a shaman, getting to overlook ratchet from the valley of trials was pretty cool.
---
Scarlet monastry is where it's at for me. That's the point in the game where imo the pace really picks up fast.
---
Yeah - he is thinking that being uncivil is fine. He’s wrong. There’s a rule against it.
---
You'd be wrong. Darkshore is the best leveling zone for its range.
---
The only reason I'm tempted to follow a guide is because I don't want to miss quests. I've heard that quite a few quests in vanilla are hidden and hard to find unless you look around.
---
Otherwise I would definitely go in blind.
---
A "bring out yer dead" bit in Brill would be an amazing fit.
---
Correct way to do it brother, good luck with the grind on launch 🤙
---
dwarf for pvp and 100% sure human for pve
---
dwarf both on priest
---
nah, (RL) profession related discords like webdev and Reactiflux are great!
---
Wonderfully long queues?
---
If you wanted to have zero fuckin stamina, and get one-shot by every other boss mechanic, yes, you could wear your full T3 just fine in raids.
---
I always thought that Disturbed album cover was a picture of a spacemarine getting caught in his suit.
---
For sure. Without them we would never had Classic reborn.
---
Buy the spells you need, avoid those you wont need.
---
It's not that difficult.
---
My friends are making me play Alliance :(
---
so she is single?
---
After months of her nagging "this could have all been done in a day," you will buy yourself weeks as its her turn to pick a faucet and buy a mirror.
---
Yeah, and they didn't start squishing experience until a long while after TBC launched, so that journey of discovery through the world was still there.
---
I shutter when I think back to leveling a warrior in 2004. Like most everyone, I didn't have a damn clue what I was doing. The only stat I looked at was "armor level". I can actually remember tanking dungeons with a pole arm and no shield. Poor healers.  ...but even the healers were too clueless to say, "Hey, WTF are you doing!"
---
It's always been more fun being on the underdog faction for me as long the gap is somewhat reasonable.
---
With this post gaining some traction there's a decent chance my friend sees it, so I'll hold off on answering this one.
---
I’m only saying that about the OP, have a good day.
---
Edit: you are the OP. I’m saying that about you specifically.
---
Flying mounts dramatically changed questing.  You could drop into a quest area from above without having to fight through.  No longer had to worry about aggroing mobs.  Always a safe place to go AFK without being in a city.  Flying mounts is one of the big things I will miss in Classic...that and Karazhan.  Loved that zone.  But am still very much looking forward to classic.
---
That might not even be necessary though, if Blizzard allows for sever transfers at some point?
---
It seems to me like the priority should be having a good launching/beginning experience using the best available info - such as Herod and Faerlina being massively over populated. And then worry about permanent server loc after time goes by?
---
Honestly the best tip I can give you is to hold on to your patience and good attitude about it as long as you can.  Doing research is super helpful, but if you get frustrated it'll really hurt your ability to bond with your husband during the process.  
---
Thank you for giving it a shot though!  Really cool to read a post like this :)
---
little? I remember pirate cove quests, the quests to kill the trolls and that one kobold mine, then to kill some ogres in a cave. Not to mention the Stormgarde elite quests you can do with a group.
---
Not necessarily true.... YMMV but we typically stuck a Priest on the MT, with some drood HOT's for backup.  Droods can cast and forget for, and thro HOT's everywhere.  Deep Disc tends to have more longevity(MP5), both are great healers.  Holy just provides Bigger heals, on decent crits up to sometimes 20% more.
---
Both are great in pvp and pve but I'd lean mage. Rogue raid spots are tough to come across, guilds might bring 4 tops and the rest of the melee are warriors.
---
Raids need more mages then rogues so there's slightly more demand for them.
---
Both classes are amazing at pvp I'd say its a tie between which one a group would want more.
---
Ya!
---
I also feel like people are forgetting how small the number of people taking this survey is compared to the whole population. I actually found the survey to be completely useless, because anyone can put whatever answer they want, and with how few responses there are it’s completely false information that isn’t going to help anyone. also for anyone who thinks there’s reallly gonna be a strong spanish speaking server, there won’t be.
---
Just make it a cinematic. Why would you have to play through GTA vice city and San Andreas to get to GTA 5. Or play through warcraft 1 and 2 to get to 3. Old content is old content.
---
As a murican I just call it "Blow me"
---
Third, they don't even know if it actually IS a child behind that keyboard.  Honestly, does anyone believe that the person on that corner begging for money will actually use that money for the purpose that they give you?  LOL, gullible is the person that does.
---
Slightly better, it'll get gradually closer and closer to that point over the course of phase 1. They're reducing the number of layers as players spread out across Azeroth.
---
Good healer, hard to gear for pvp damage but super bursty fun in pvp. No problems at all if you want to heal, a frustrating struggle if you want to do the damage specs.
---
That's about all I know on their part.

OK so your opinion that paladins are better is great... but they are still both primarily healing classes that bring buffs for everyone else  in a raiding environment.
---
*cries in Night Elf*
---
"Good riddance" is typically when someone is doing something specific to be a negative force... and not a generic person leaving, but I understand your point.
---
&gt; "Works on 1.12 clients" is not "available in Vanilla"
---
I have no idea if this is a weird troll attempt or what, but 1.12 was vanilla WoW.
---
Plus other people in this thread have already stated that addons just like this one were available back in the day, called oQueue and Call to Arms.
---
Blizzard has never said that this addon is against the rules, so you're making that up too.
---
Except that threat was much less of an issue in TBC, between windfury for the tank group, salv for the DPS, and multiple hunter misdirects.

you think you do but you dont
---
Really trying to convince my group of friends to move from Whitemane to Blaumeux. I think they are starting to turn after the ama and the blue post yesterday.
---
That's not practical. Even if you only kill trash mobs in MC, you would still need between 225 and 450 kills. You can't kill some of the main bosses along the way because the boss quest comes after getting honored. 
---
You would need to convince your 40-man raid group to clear as much as trash as possible before the bosses prevent you from going further, then zone out and wait for trash to respawn, then do that over and over again until you get your kills. Given most guilds only raid 3-4 hours per night for 2-3 days per week, there's no way you're getting it first week if you just rely on rep from MC.
---
The silly bit, Is for Physical DPS on Horde Orc is the best race.
---
A human priest is inferior to a Dwarf Priest in both PvE and PvP for Alliance.
---
both have benefits. people like mages for their water/food and ports. people like warlocks because of healthstones, soulstones, and ability to summon other players. mages are a bit more desirable in late game raiding, but not a big issue. there's usually more mages than locks, so it usually works out alright.
---
Is this a faction thing or some people going classic and staying retail??
---
3 or less servers per time zone / server type and 3 name reserves so we can reserve our name on all 3 servers and blizzard has no idea who is going where.
---
Brilliant.

Can’t wait to be home and experience it with more than 25fps !!!

If your goal is to make a pure healer you should go for Holy. 21 points in Disc to grab all the good stuff, and 30 in Holy.

---
Me: Subs early and creates player on a low pop realm
---
/r/classicwow: demonizing me for wanting to keep my cool name on what becomes a full realm...
---
It’s time blizzard take ownership of the situation, trying to make us look stupid for not wanting to switch when some of us are coordinating large groups is blatantly unfair.
---
Or, you know, read the official dev posts, that says severe queues up to several hours?
---
Kinda wish they wouldn't have made battlegrounds cross server.  
---
That way factions tend to auto balance (since horde bg queue will be awful on a 30/70 server). But seeing as battlegrounds aren't coming until phase 3, this probably wouldn't have helped.
---
Agreed
---
depends on realm
---
on a pvp realm the horde is bigger so ur queue is worse there
---
on a pve realm its the ally bigger and worse q
---
the difference is quite notable
---
I don't know… Is the only thing that identifies your character among countless other people, a character that you're going to spend months playing, your literal embodiment in World of Warcraft important?
---
Personally, I believe it is.
---
Tbh, while leveling, 40/60 or 45/55 really shows. But when you reach 60, you are indeed right, it will not be that bad.
---
They can learn it at level 42 if I have the correct info.
---
Remember? Still get called cookies in BFA :D

never said anything about optimal zones, just meant more users will be human based off the polls so most will just navigate to westfall ect :)

If it was any other game I probably wouldn't take off the whole week...but because I have RL friends doing the same it's going to be a proper vacation...without any of the hassle of travel/spending exorbitant amounts of money. Plus I don't have to wear pants....
---
Plot twist: there is a world beyond america.
---
In raids, sure. In dungeons it still was an issue as a Warrior tank.
---
THE CONE
---
The queues will go away, language barrier won't.
---
It's an easy choice.
---
Good call. The playstyle of a shadow priest is very fun as well, so if I roll shadow I'm guaranteed to have a good time. 
---
Regarding the way talents are structured in classic ... It's been so long since I've even thought about how the game used to be. It'll be nice to rediscover the mechanics of the game that used to make it a lot more engaging, in my opinion.
---
I agree that cautiously openeing new servers is a good thing. But I would disagree that a low pop server merging into a med pop server would drastically tarnish the 'classic experience'. Whats the diffreence between a server merge, and a handfull of guilds all deciding they are re-rolling off a low pop server onto a new server? Not much except that they now all have to re-level.
---
Hunter is nice because while it can be hard to find a raid spot, once you do, competition for gear will be low and you actually get to wear your tier sets unlike fury warriors. If you don't have much time I would say Hunter.
---
It’s the last thing you hear before Mini Diablo takes you away..

It's about time Horde was dominant on OCE, even if only by a few %
---
I have no fear being Alliance on Herod, that just means their are more people to kill, and dont forget the instant bg queues
---
Most players are going to be HC veteranans? Absolutely not.
---
Hello, yes me. Also Razorfen with 3 others. 
---
It won't be a ghost server. I would be more scared of the first servers turning out to be ghost servers because it's mainly retail players reserving their names on there and who knows how long they will actually play. All smart and patient players (read: not me because I also wasted half a month of subscription for reserving some dumb name...) will wait till release to activate their subscription and then join the server they can actually play on instead of sitting in a queue for 4 hours.
---
Namen sind Schall und Rauch.
---
So quiet. Waiting for the intelligent life to come disrupt the shit out of it, and slay these peaceful creatures for their own self-progression.
---
Thats how I always got in my guilds. Just pug a dungeon, notice they were decent players, couple of them were in the same guild, hit them up to play more, got on their raid team. 
---
Playing healer so it should be even easier.
---
It always made more sense for IF to be the hub.
---
Which ass would you like to look at for the next several years?
---
That's a question no one wants the answer too
---
twitch.tv/tipsoutbaby
---
Nah but I think your post kind of underplays the amount of people who are capable of hitting 60 in a week. I think there will be a whole lot more hardcore players than you expect, I for one took a week off of work, something I never did for pservers. I think alot of people will be going in with ththe “have fun with it!” mindset, and when they are faced with the reality that even though they started at launch, and there are tons of players twice their level they may pick up the pace and get competitive
---
Depends server
---
Supported by walking mechanic.
---
That's totally fine, when the hype wears off, you will be left with a healthy population
---
Two dungeons with a lot less trash! Haha... It was very reminiscent of the leveling dungeons in that way, but when you're a top tier raid guild there is way less appeal in grinding through a lot of trash. No need for XP, little need for gold and trash loot drops, and the challenge is sheer monotony. That part was no fun.
---
We were talking on Team Speak like.. There can't be any more trash, right? Let's go kill someone. And then there was more trash. It was crazy.
---
Can I ask, were you an Alliance Paladin or Warrior at that time in one of the other raid guilds? Your name is super familiar.
---
Or every night you spend on WoW she gets a 'free pass' as it were.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Thanks for the reply. Still semi considering druid/priest  and warrior (I tank in Everquest). But Shaman stands out as the most unique class that has ridiculous support.
---
Appreciate your help man.
---
I think it’s important to be ready for the worst. I’m not expecting to get anything done Monday be it from server issues, queues, maybe population, but that’s fine. It’ll be sorted out throughout the week.
---
And if everything is fine Monday, cool that’s a bonus I didn’t expect :P
---
It is a shame,  but I'm sure it is difficult to line things up with someone who is across the world. :(
---
Deperver.

LOL
---
I'm fairly certain you could put green check marks on everything.  It is warlocks I mean cmon.  The only thing bad about warlocks, is they don't have enough action bar slots for all their 100 skills and ranks.
---
Mankrik is the horde meme server though... it’s definitely not the default choice.
---
Blizzard’s launches have been fine for the last few years.
---
I agree with this entire post about taking your time, but I don't think it takes 8 hrs a day 7 days a week to get 60.  I mean even on the beta servers it was fairly easy for Soda and various others to get to 45 in 48 hrs.
---
im playing human but the best gnome racial is them feeling like the run faster
---
I did the maths for this yesterday. Joanna says with his guide, he went 1-60 in 4 days 20 hours /played time. I can pretty much play 2 hours a day if I push it and do nothing else. That's 12 days just for the first 1 day played time. 48 days for the first 4 days. and 58 days total to speedrun to 60 if I can max out the speedrun in the same way Joanna did after several practice runs. 
---
Not gonna happen. 
---
I'm just going to enjoy the game. Make sixty in 3-4 months instead of 2.
---
Are you that guy!?!? :P just kidding. Yeah I would agree with that.  I'm probably over cautious. Was still jarring though hahaha. Like "I was the dummy because I wasn't pulling half the instance".  I guess I was though under the newer system.
---
It's going to be a shitshow.
---
&gt;Gnomes got Mario lift.
---
True fact.
---
Rogue = Really hard leveling solo. Hunter = Fast and easiest to level with.
---
We'll see if that changes come Classic, but so far, nah. I'm 6'0" and about 200 pounds, but I quit alcohol and joined Brazilian jiu jitsu and Muay Thai about two and a half years ago, run a 5k in the sand once a week for distance cardio with *one* buddy while going to Planet Fitness about once a week with *another* buddy, so I've maintained an above-averagely athletic build and lifestyle.  
---
There's a chance I begin slacking on training in favor of grinding WoW, but I hope to strike a balance. I'll actually be relieved at the occasional server shutoff for maintenance, because then I'll know that me being away from the computer doesn't mean people are getting ahead of me. Dropping to the mat beside me to do sit-ups/push-ups or jumping jacks/dumbell curls while taking a flight path could be an easy habit that adds up.
---
Unless this is a reference to the confusion most people have about soy containing "phytoestrogens" (plant estrogens) working the same when ingested as an animal estrogen would work if injected (they don't). I never can tell with blunt statements like this one, though after 13 years of not eating any farm animals or their eggs/milk, I've grown emotionally immune to taunting.
---
Can I swim to Darkshore? I can make it! Whew, made it! *pants*
---
Hiisiisisisisissssssss...
---
Rift was so cool during beta. Very vanilla like, but they changed it too much at release to where it just became another retail WoW clone and nobody played it.
---
Gonna Raptor strike so hard lightning will come out of the sword.
---
You will have queue, like it did in 2004. Accept it.
---
Even if you roll on low pop now, nothing will guarantee ir won't fill up. Remember most people still haven't sub for it and are waiting on the 26/27
---
#nochanges, even fun with laggy/crashy launch :)
---
To get around these problems, you decide to always file duplicate information in both the old and new filing system for "just a little while".  However, no-one can agree on whether you should save in the old system or the new system first, nor how to handle the case when you can only add to one system but not the other.  Huge family arguments break out about how or even whether to ever remove old known-bad information from one or both systems.
---
The autistic cousin is repelled by the new system, and eventually stops using it at all, refusing to even come out of the attic.  When the new roommate moves in, he only uses the filing cabinets in the new house, and cannot understand why Uncle John is sure he's never paid rent.
---
And you don't have to be, that's fine! The playlist is intended to be accessible to everyone, so even if you don't like one song, shuffling to the next one will probably be a banger for you. :)
---
As the devs said in wow "the main charcacter is the world". And the skeketons are obv part of the world.
---
This is fixed
---
He has spoken, let the battle begin...
---
Grats! I got cheated out of my Eye at the end of vanilla, so I hunted it and got it in Cata. Had to learn myself mining and blacksmithing to make, but it was worth it.
---
The plan is to go Shazzrah with the rest of Cynical. I call dips on zin'rokh!
---
That's their fault for not subbing yet. Every current server is going to get flooded with new characters being created on them. It's gonna fuck over people who already picked a server with their guild/friends.
---
I am pretty casual so I can play now and transfer latter if I have to.  I plan on solo PVP rather than PVE so if the server shrinks and they offer a transfer i will take it.
---
Things will be fine on launch I don’t understand this mentality tbh, it’s like the people saying I don’t wanna be on a dead realm. Trying to create your own solutions to problems bliz is solving is your loss in every regard
---
Hi Stalin.
---
Can we actually still share quests (assuming there is no quest chain or everyone has done all the prerequisites)?
---
This just comes across as entitled and lazy, learn to code it yourself.
---
Is there a class you wouldn't recommend to a person not only totally new to wow but also totally new to gaming?
---
Common mistake but deathcoil is a horrify not a fear so it doesn’t get dispelled or blocked by wotf fear immune 5 second buff. Also 90% of the time is a gross exaggeration.
---
1. immolation leveling/farming; Arcane pvp vs warriors or while kiting for ex
---
2. Different when afk in the outdoors
---
3. Half a second, not millisecond. Big difference
---
4. Bad while leveling; mostly bad in dungeons; ok in pvp, in the right circumstance. Its not incredible useful and imho should not be learned before u got your epic mount
---
5. Trap/Flare on cd is bad
---
Not that bad.
---
The 800g~ epic mount is the real bitch.
---
http://classicwow.live/leveling

Fall? I was addicted for like 4 years...
---
Yeah, if you only level the essential spells, you'll be fine.
---
Zero Sum DKP gets you terrible attendance on progression raids.
---
3 sleeps, one very painful but (hopefully) worthwhile wait.

SL / SL is not a build in classic.

---
It wasn't that bad, if you didn't care about getting it right at lvl 40 most people got it organically around that level. The real grind was the epic mount.
---
You actually sound like a damn clown.  You can’t have a girlfriend while you “like to flirt” and “Snapchat other women” She sounds lucky to have gotten out when she did.  Hope you’re not rolling Horde.
---
Im laughing at the melee dps BiS lists with the Dal Rend swords, buddy it might take you months to see both swords let alone winning the rolls on them.
---
I think you said it yourself. SP is very important for Protadins in TBC, but in Vanilla it's awful, 5 man or no. But you do you.
---
this reminded me of panhandler in classic !!! can i have 2 gold ! cani have 10 gold i need to re spec !  can i haz 15 gold need my mount
---
Private servers were overturned - as in, harder
---
Thanks. 
---
Horde flag is now my wallpaper.

HD water, real time shadows, updated lighting, ambient occlusion, grass physics, bigger view distance, colour blind mode, bnet chat?
---
I sleep.
---
Don't have more than one skeleton at a time?
---
REAL SHIT.
---
I agree the reason given was dumb though. I just find it funny that this of all things seems to be a deal breaker for some people.
---
Millions of people subbed to reserve names for characters they couldn't play for 2 weeks.
---
I'm not one of them, I think that's stupid and bad business practice on Blizzards end but lots of people thought it was worth it.
---
Hi guys! Can I post this tomorrow please? 210k subs and I feel like it must be my turn by now.
---
Level with herb and alchemy. The multitude of hour long buffs makes a huge difference.
---
They've been warning people tirelessly to move to lower pop servers, people that stick to full/high pop should be going in expecting a queue and can't really complain about it.
---
Wow that gave me shivers man. It might actually be true, this is just the calm before the storm
---
I down voted just to be safe!
---
Spain said that, did they?
---
Probably a good thing I didn't take next week off.
---
I knew IT!!!! i quit
---
A few tips, your directional light is way to bright. Add AO to give your scene more depth. A fake light that focuses on the meeting stone could also be tested as of now it's not distinguable with the for and background.
---
If you like, I have the power to ban that guy into oblivion. :)
---
What kind of peasant does not auto login? Gotta get in asap =)
---
Yep.  This was in regards to line of sight pulls but thanks.
---
First week is going to be a mess but it will be fine after that.
---
Ruh roh
---
Thanks for sharing. I'll be taking dbm recount omni cc and atlas loot. I prefer classic interface, wouldnt be classic without it. 
---
Personally i dont like some other addons that aim to make the game more 'easy' or 'efficient'; they take away the fun. Dont treat the game like a job and you wont hate yourself while playing it.
---
walk to npc. talk. get free mount.
---
The only real bad guys in WoW are the scarlet crusade, as warcraft 3 showed us, Orcs and tuaren just want to live their lives. Meanwhile the scarlet crusade is F the undead, and ANYONE who doesn't want them obliterated!  I wish I could join their faction over the Argent dawn any day!
---
The server issue is a community based problem.  It's not a Blizzard created problem.  Blizzard will receive no repercussions for this issue, only the players who were to stubborn to listen will.
---
Like it or not, you have options to change things, ignoring them doesn't put the fault on someone else.
---
Classic wow isn't for everybody, the came changed so much because it wasn't for everybody.
---
Classic wow is for a niche crowd of people.  It's never going to be made to change to cater to anyone, it's what it is, nochanges.
---
So yeah a lot of of people will quit, but not for login ques, but because they can't stop being killed in stv or cross roads, and the quest npcs are all dead and they spend four hours lfg.
---
Classic wow was hardcore.
---
Queues will get better once people give up or burn out.
---
In the meantime, change servers.  Why is everyone trying to be on herod?
---
Would you rather have long queues temporarily, or dead servers after a while? Because trying to do something in-between is all but impossible to judge. I'd rather have the first one. Blizz have been very open with "these servers will have severe queues, if you don't want severe queues, don't go here". Most people don't seem to want to budge, which is totally fine, as long as they don't spend the next few weeks complaining (which many will).
---
If you're that bothered about queues, roll on one of the lower population servers.
---
yeah the 40 mount isn't bad, most people can get it right at 40 assuming you dont blow all your money on the AH. the 60 mount is where a lot of people had to earn for a while once they hit 60. that was back then though, people are generally smarter and more aware of saving and how to earn gold better so i doubt either will be too much of a problem. pick the class you want to play
---
Facts
---
I will bring ret paladins, boomkins and the sort over a hunter in classic dungeons. I will not experience that bs all over again.
---
Yea, some people like to play the game and others like to be done playing the game XD
---
ISO standard date times are the one true way.
---
I'm thinking of rolling a human warlock. I never played classic and hardly played any of WoW so I'm hoping this is an okay choice. Doesn't seem too hard or complicated and leveling seems decent
---
Why'd you leave your keys up on the table?
---
Warrior main tank. Mining and skinning (skins to vendor, ore to bank), changing skinning to engineering at 60 once im comfortable with my gold (and have enough ore etc stockpiled).
---
I considered going gnomish first, then goblin, but tbh i dont care about gnomish devices as much as i would care about the hassle of re-leveling engineering, so ill just go goblin right away.
---
Do you think that Herod will be able?
---
Chances are tons of people will be at launch, play for a month, and then never log on again. And then servers will need to be combined or there will be plenty of empty servers.
---
[Barrens to Westfall skip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS_Sw70rh60)
---
This is pretty cool but considering most games "journalists" now are completely disconnected from even modern games and probably don't give a fuck about wow it seems like it's wasted.
---
Here is an example of the average games journalist.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=848Y1Uu5Htk
---
Yes, Blizzard now claim they'll offer free transfers from dead realms, but we have no idea when a realm is low enough to transfer off, or when that might be.
---
Your boss is too busy tanking RFC to pick up the phone
---
Let me do some more digging in the screenshot archive. Might have one to post for tomorrow.
---
Were you in the raid group or just trying to sell it to the raid team? It's kind of frowned upon to sell stuff to your own guild, not completely frowned upon, but it just ruffles a few feathers.
---
What harm are they causing the Spanish community? While I don't agree with what they're doing aren't they if anything helping by trying to get every Spaniard who cares about playing with other Spaniards on the same server?
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
Projected where? As I have said: every survey has been Horde heavy, Discord census or even the Classic Beta.
---
Pretty sure the most horrifying thing for me is the sound of getting knocked down.  It take so fucking long to stand back up when you're trying to run away.
---
I actually had 6 pieces of tier 3 in 2006 but vendored them way before transmog was part of the game, so please don't make assumptions.
---
imo the worst part about warlock. They should have stacked by twos or threes.
---
Because of the rest of my post.  Humanoids run away in fear.  Murlocs are the ones that are more likely to come in clumps, have larger aggro radius, and get those couple extra casters.
---
Most of the fotm rogues are going warrior this time around.
---
edit:  I guess its not gonna be "fotm" this time around...
---
My girlfriend quit playing WOW after killing Lich King 25H. She literally said there was nothing left in the game for her now that Arthas was dead and buried. She is coming back Monday with me.
---
Thankfully I began dating my now-wife during WotLK, and she's experienced each modern expansion release with me since. She's been made aware that Classic is a whole 'nother beast versus what she's experienced thus far. As such, I've been able to negotiate 2 full weeks of neckbeard playing as opposed to the standard 1.
---
It’s because you’ll never see something like this again. You’ll never see the aftermath of a war. All because they want to protect our delicate little flowers whose parents should be teaching them that the world isn’t chocolate rivers and rainbows anyway.
---
I'd play NA for the 10 months. A little lag for 10 months is better then a little lag for an eternity
---
Yeah, that’s the point of early access. Blizzard should have just released the server list but not allowed name reservation if they didn’t want this issue.
---
Questing while you own a Thunderfury..... \*thinking\*
---
Use Multi Shot on low armor targets
---
Use Arcane Shot on high armor targets, Arcane Shot deals magical damage and bypasses armor
---
this alone if you know will win most of your fights
---
Is it that bad compared to UD Mage? I played mostly Alliance way back in the vanilla days, so don’t know how bad the difference is.
---
Damn this is very nice
---
Blizzard: Releases two PvP realms
---
Player: Rolls the dice weather or not they gets their preferred names
---
Blizzard: Adds one realm. Please move to a less populated realm
---
Player: Rolls the dice weather or not they gets their preferred names again
---
Blizzard: Adds one realm. Please move to a less populated realm again
---
Player: Rolls the dice weather or not they gets their preferred names again again
---
Adding in that reserving the names is a paid service, I can't quite figure out why people are mad.
---
Correction - "Tonight is a you night gurl, take some time for you. And him"
---
holy shit i didnt realize that came out in 2006... fuckin hell where did the time go
---
Died there when a buddy threw water walking on me.
---
Very jealous that you get to experience this brand new.
---
To be honest, I wouldn't take these other people's advice. Do what the rest of us did back when the game first launched, read the class descriptions and pick the one that interests you the most. There's nothing you can't figure out. Yes Classic doesn't hold your hand very much but I was able to figure it out as a 10 year old back then, I don't think you'll have any issues.
---
Maybe today he will prove to be available?
---
Did the blizzard devs specify if this queue is calculated based off of unique accounts (IE I made a warlock and a mage, do they count both as queueing or just me as a single subscriber)?
---
Should I go female orc warrior or male tauren warrior? I can't decide for the life of me. I know orcs are way better on paper for most things, but aesthetically I can'd decide which I prefer. I like how female orcs are straight back and armor looks good on them. I like how taurens are absolutely massive and have huge weapons.
---
Living the dream
---
The last 4 sleeps I'll have for a while...
---
Just playing the game naturally. You wont make a ton of gold to say respec super often, but you can make due with subpar gear. I personally took a few months leveling, even spent about 3 weeks pvping non stop at 49 as i had so much fun with it. I wasnt really farming gold early on.
---
I remember being sick and staying home for a day or two from school, and just straight killing dragon whelps trying to get the whelping pet which sold for a pretty penny back in the day.
---
I remember a long long time ago when I was playing Everquest I was running through Freeport (equivalent to an Alliance Capital City) and there was a max level Troll Warrior who the guards would attack on site just sitting in the middle of the city with his Epic Weapons -  Blue and Red swords that glowed like light sabers. Epic weapons were class items equivalent to legendary items in classic WoW. 
---
Nobody had ever seen epic weapons before so crowds had gathered to stop and gawk, it turns out it was an in game GM. Things like this are what I'm hoping to feel again playing Classic, I can't wait.
---
wtf 80hours per week.. get a life
---
Skinning/Tailoring to level. Then swap skinning for mining at 60.  Farm what I need to level engineering then swap mining for engi. Proceed to sell bags to buy engi mats for PvP.
---
Or Druid trainer in IF. Seems totally feasible for non-druid players
---
I totally agree with this. Some of the guides help with hard to find items or NPC's, but even then, we need to explore, make friends and have fun. 
---
The endgame is not the game. 
---
The game is the game.
---
Flying is an improvement to riding around, possibly dying to mobs or opposing faction players if you don't feel like being hassled.
---
but what about those who aren’t using these services? it’s gonna make a shitty wow experience where you’re using 3rd party apps to form groups. sounds awful and not very vanilla-like. I personally had no addons in vanilla cuz I didn’t even know what they were and had a phenomenal experience.
---
Ask and you shall receive!

Yea, for some reason I keep coming back to Faction ______ for some reason. The original was "2 Faction Choice" but that sounded wonky too
---
Maybe the following week he can bring on special guest Elizabeth Holmes!
---
This makes me so happy that I'm leveling with my own tank who started playing in vanilla. I feel spoiled.
---
I remember some guy in our guild hit server first 70. He instantly bought epic flying somehow too the day he hit 70. We were questing in Nagrand and he flew in on his epic flying red wyvren and it was so fucking sweet.
---
big deal? most retail players couldnt give a shit if it isnt their key. wipe 1-2 times? they will drop and join another group
---
I have all movement on my mouse,  I use the side thumb buttons for strafing.
---
Shift/Alt+1234QWERASDFZX covers all my needs for keybinding.
---
If I need to click on something or cast something while moving I jump and click where I need while in midair so my movement isn't interrupted (or use autorun briefly)
---
He also uses mass revive, same as the WC3 paladin.
---
I'm trying to decide on a class but they all seem fun! Is there any class/spec that can take on multiple mobs at once and be decent in wpvp/bg's?
---
The add-on questie takes care of this too
---
SMH WHY DID YOU SHOW MY OCD SELF THIS!!! #unplayable #makechanges #icantlogin
---
I'm viewing it like 3 more workdays.
---
Thank you...I started looking into it last night.  As a Hunter it looks like I just have to be ready to come back to Durotar at lvl 10 for my class quest.  MULGORE HERE I COME
---
If I don't remember wrong the epic mount is also cheaper then 900g on warlock/Paladin. More like 400-500g but I might be missremembering
---
Hope you have fun!
---
You can't expect raiders if you don't have a clear schedule and you don't raid at least one day per week.
---
these idiots have been warned. cant wait to see the qq posts monday night about not being able to play.
---
It'll be rocking and rolling by Tuesday tho
---
Source? Every survey I've seen has been 50 50 for the most part.
---
Took so long to farm the TB rep to ride a kodo on warlock. I felt so cool haha.
---
In phase 3 from my understanding soooo... Will be a while.
---
I don't see how that is a valid point, those people had the chance to get the gear.
---
I doubt that lol
---
maybe a few
---
... Yeah, there is. It's whatever server Blizzard are asking people to move to i.e. whatever's not listed on their "these will be very full" lists. Again, Blaumeux right now is not on that list, it's an option right now if you're currently thinking of Herod and are scared of extreme queues.
---
It's not a case of "adding more layers", they can add as many as they want, what you're talking about is increasing the max player caps and they've made it clear already they aren't gonna do that for incredibly obvious reasons.
---
There's people like this on every server and you know it regardless of whether or not you believe it yet. Do you move country every time the party you don't like gets in too?
---
I dont like leveling in wow, never did.  I'm always surprised people are advocating for slow leveling.
---
Lots of humanoids come in "clumps" too. Lots of humanoids are casters too. No, murlocs do not have "larger aggro radius", that's a private server inaccuracy.
---
He is being dramatic, however the idea behind is post is accurate. Blizzard has given the die hard classic fans what they want which is official supported servers. 
---
However they will be dissuading the non die hard classic fans and potential new players from the game with long queues. A potential reason for this may be that classic will not be very profitable long term for blizzard and activison, because they won’t be able to add new content or ways of increasing revenue such as the in game store. Retail with its wow tokens and store mounts is far more profitable of a game model. 
---
So while blizzard is giving the hard core wow fans what they want here and it will certainly boost subscriptions for a time, it’s not their goal to promote and grow classic as a stand alone product. This is why the subscriptions are bundled together. They want to convert classic players to the more profitable retail version not the other way around. If retails players convert to classic players it will have a negative impact on revenue. 
---
I’m incredibly excited for classic and can’t thank blizzard enough for releasing it but I understand that it’s not going to be a huge money maker for them. Without new content to charge for and additional revenue streams they can’t push for all their players to go classic. Long queues will make sure only the players dedicated to classic stick around. And honestly that’s who they are making the game for.

Blizzard gave name reservations for a reason: so people could reserve their names. To then spring new realms on people, taking away their ability to get the names they wanted, makes it unfair. Why even have name reservations in the first place, then? I'm not going to leave my full server where I got the name I've always used just to go to a high pop realm where I can't get my name.

Yes, open world are the worst. They have a lot of "hours of content" but a lot of it is recycled, copy pasted. Another game series that's horrible about it is Far Cry. If you've cleared one outpost, you've cleared all of them. Climbed one radio tower, climbed all of them. And there's like 50 each. Just Copy &amp; Paste all day.

I remember reaching level 12 during my 10 day trial in vanilla. Although I must have been around 9 years old
---
Your edit came a little late there. Coil's the only CC you're gonna have and it's not enough. Between WotF and trinket any competent UD rogue is gonna blow you up and there's not a thing you can do about it in the 1v1. They have more CC, more damage, and are gonna get the open the vast majority of the time.
---
And it's really not an exaggeration, either. Troll rogues are [nearly nonexistent.](https://i.redd.it/inis00ztt2o21.png) Undead rogues are more than twice as popular as orcs, more likely to focus on pvp/ganking, and - most importantly - more likely to target you because of their natural advantages against your class.
---
My entire experience with Vanilla was on a human warlock. It's not impossible to beat UD rogues, but only a fool would bet on you.
---
Thanks brother in Arms, see ya at home :)
---
Since when was spanish a race?
---
Because they want people to watch it.
---
If they made bigger servers there’d be more people on them and same problem 
---
Only way to fix queue times would be too stop the name reservation after x amount of players which would cause a shitstorm
---
Everyone who makes these posts is just begging people to play the game how they want to play it.
---
Then reach out to Blizzard and ask them to restore those items for you.
---
Dude yeah. I played vanilla some time near BC's release, I hung out at 39 and did BG a lot, and had only gotten into the mid 40s when life got in the way for a while. Later, I played lots of BC and Wrath but never got to do the vanilla end game stuff. When Nost came around I DOVE in, it was a grind but I was right around 44 or so when they got shut down. I STILL haven't been above level 50 in classic/vanilla wow, and I played what I would consider "a lot" by normal video game standards. In Destiny I would have easily cleared all the raids in that amount of time played. In a standard JRPG that's like a 90% clear of many of the classics. Vanilla WoW is a grind like no other, many people will feel "done" around 40-50 and move on to other stuff.
---
I'm a walking meme in real life, so why not.
---
And yet it could shine light on what made us all love WoW to begin with. I just hope some of this magic reaches retail eventually but that's a bit of a stretch.
---
The only survivability stat that matters on Rag is fire resistance. Armor is worthless. You lose stamina, but you don't need stamina - it doesn't actually make you take less damage. It only helps you survive large hits. 
---
When you can guarantee that you take either 25% damage or 0% damage from all of his attacks (which is what the cap does), then you don't need the stamina that you would have had from other pieces of gear.
---
Download the game now (Retail/Regular version) if you haven't and make a new account. I'm fairly sure it's free to try and it will give you a good starting point of camera/movement mechanics and abilities. I'm also sure that there is pop up tips/hints when you first start out so be sure to read those.
---
Pretty much just jump in and explore/have fun.
---
Doesn't it release on Tuesday???
---
Little bastards.
---
Also everyone needs to travel to the dungeon. Unless you got a warlock and 2 other people at the dungeon to summon, everyone will have to make his way. No more "sum please" for the lazy people.

People are taking the current game mindset where Horde dominates PvP into classic.  They're in for a surprise!  Alliance is generally the OP faction in vanilla.  Paladins are just too good.
---
the server discord channels are full blown aids. Is this really the community i'll be playing the game with? Yikes.
---
If it was something I couldn't use,  I was pretty quick getting it up on the AH. Now days, in retail, I just sell crap to the vendors to clear out my bags or DE everything on an alt &amp; hoard mats.
---
Thanks Abdul
---
It's not wrong, though. The game was wildly different and much more inconvenient.
---
BRD isn't usually done as a full run. If you did you'd want to be in the 56 or 57 range at least since the last boss is 60. 
---
LBRS is a "max level" dungeon. Usually 58-60 is what you'll see in there.
---
I love that they cleaned the spot for the decal and nowhere else. Truly Horde indeed.
---
It just gets old to only see this shit. Osrs is the worst subreddit on this site.
---
maybe until we spend the next 30 mins getting to the dungeon, the next hour+ clearing it, and we have down time and strat talks.
---
Did i miss something?
---
Those outcomes are not fine. Getting split between servers is not fine for obvious reasons. Even if they ended up on the same server, it is still not ok for that decision to have been made for them by someone else whose only motivation was... what? To not have to suffer seeing English spoken as a second language? Blizzard is not making Spanish servers (nor most languages). They have to go somewhere.
---
I am all of those things and I have never manipulated a poll. Checkmate!
---
Good memory :)
---
Agreed, never found either of those dungeons too exciting.
---
Five days until I can stop religiously visiting this sub.
---
Swap out *mechanical animals* for the more timing appropriate *golden age of grotesque (2004)* or the two better albums that came out before and after *mechanical animals,* *antichrist superstar* and *holy wood* respectively
---
Of all the Marilyn Manson albums from that time (*portrait of an american family* to *golden age of grotesque*) *mechanical animals* is definitely the weakest. This isn't to say I dont enjoy listening to it, or skip it entirely, but if you can only add one album for the nostalgia, *mechanical animals* isn't going to be my first choice (personally I find *antichrist superstar* to be the best)
---
They just look horrible. And share same models, druid&lt;&gt;rogue, warrior&lt;&gt;paladin, etc. It just looks like a mess of textures.
---
There is this bug-themed T17/Living Wodd set for druids in WoD, and it looks good, for a bug-themed set anyway.
---
No alternative in SW since humans couldnt hunter, but IF could work, maybe. I sorta remember class quests being strict by the race you were playing, so you might have to go back to Teldrassil. Besides the night elf zones are so much better, Teldrassil &gt; Darkshore &gt; Ashenvale! Cmon dont go boring human zones!
---
Nope, Blaumeux or however you spell it is sitting nicely at low (which I guess is still higher than a "vanilla high").  A decent 50/50 split horde to alliance too!
---
&gt;People don't like when realms merge
---
Is it really this?  I would better characterize it 'people don't like it when a realm pop drops so low that it becomes impossible to reliably do group content'.  Merging is the solution to the problem, not the problem itself.
---
Ya'll are doing it wrong. My girlfriend is just going to play it with me, at least for awhile to see if she likes it.
---
Because it's the coolest
---
Forgot about country of origin /u/iDylo
---
Well that is highly subjective. No matter what you think of the aesthetics, the tier 3 sets are undeniably the most sought after sets.
---
Also, if you bought world of warcraft during vanilla, or TBC for that matter, you had your oppurtunity to play all of the content. If you buy world of warcraft right now, you are getting every single expansion up to, and including, Legion. So no, you do not pay for the level 60 version of Naxxramas, as that is not part of the game you are purchasing.
---
Also, to end this pointless discussion, the tier 3 sets are available to you through the bmah. You are simply mad because you can't get it for free, without any effort whatsoever.

Spriest is a really hard match up for lock too and wotf helps a ton. Point of my post was those examples don't end up happening, and the idea alliance doesn't have locks is a meme
---
buy a bidet you fucking savage
---
I'm just going to go in and play [at a medium pace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLm5oSJRxIU).  I plan on enjoying the leveling experience.  For me, that's the whole point.
---
Of course there will be queues, what? What's the big deal?
---
&gt;It’s not fair that people who already reserved a spot on a server will get fucked when there’s an influx of players on the 26th/27th, especially people who rolled on medium population realms. Those are also going to fill up.
---
It is fair because nobody made you roll there. Blizzard has said almost daily that they expect to open new servers during the run-up to classic. They've been extremely transparent. 
---
How entitled can you be to intentionally roll on the biggest server and then complain that it's the biggest server? This shit blows my fucking mind.
---
While that might be true, if the question is "What server will you be playing on?" I don't think the things you mentioned are relevant. That seems like a pretty straight forward question.
---
You could make the same argument (groupthink, bandwagon, following trends) for human beings as a whole, so then all polling in general is insufficient. I don't think that's accurate. You can use 300-400 people and get a sample size to represent millions.
---
I don't see why a sample size of tens of thousands isn't an approximate representation of what, 100k, 200k people? (I really don't know the estimated player base.) But it seems like enough to have an approx idea, especially when the other stuff seems to match up (alliance having less than horde on most servers, druids being low on the class selection, PvE having slightly more popularity than PvP, etc)
---
Oct 8th. But I’ll be dual boxing a priest with my warrior, so probably end of September.

I hope you were horde so we can tighten up that A/H ratio on Herod...

---
I don't know what guide you're looking at or how familiar with Vanilla you are, but often these dungeons have a multitude of quests associated with them, and the dungeons themselves are split into different wings. The reason there is such a wide level range is because you can start attunement quests and the first wing on the lower end of the level range, and ideally that content will help you progress in levels towards the upper end which is required to complete the latter half of the content.
---
"I am taking the day off"  
---
"Why?"  
---
"Absolutely none of your business, see you tomorrow"
---
Yep. The guide I was looking at was super handy and reminding you when to buy/keep/bank certain mats for future questlines. I've never leveled up with a guide before, so I can tell you that it's easy to wind up wasting a ton of time. Like having to spend 20+ minutes flying to/from a capital city to buy a silver bar on AH because you didn't realize that you needed it for some quest chain.
---
That's what will happen anyway? Or do you have a long conversation every time you try to join a group?
---
Honestly AOE farming to level only works on dead servers. It only takes 1 person to ruin it and tons of mages try to since every guide talks about it.
---
Rogue on a pvp server. Sinister Strike, Eviscerate, and Slice and Dice. 16 Thunderfuries, blessed blades on the windseeker.
---
I bought remnants of the ashes only to survive till classic 
---
And classic will help me to survive till the monster hunter iceborne pc release in January 
---
It’s just drug hopping at this point
---
Night Elf druids had the infamous quest that had them going to Westfall at lv.16, just so they could learn dispell poison or some shit (or swimming form, cant remember exactly). While long and bothersome, it was kind of a nice journey to be honest.
---
Yes, that is legal.  You can't have BearGrillys (well you will until you piss someone off and they report your name), but you can have beargirl, bearboy, bearmanman, bearanimal, bear, beer and so on.
---
The consensus seems to be that it will only work if you intend to speed level hard from the start and get in front of 90% of most other players. I was considering doing it as well, but there is no way I'll be able to keep a pace like that.
---
how so?  
---
i expanded on the idea and used around 10 seconds of the announcment trailer.
---
There is! From a dwarf corpse I think.
---
That was actually pretty smooth
---
Oh geez lol, that does make your list a little more impressive then!
---
Same, I wish I was getting these. Also, they finally "fixed" the date, everything I've seen so far on posts have been 08.27.19, even for US ones which makes no sens since whole US is gonna be playing on 26.
---
8 hours a day is EXTREMELY hardcore for you?!? haha you fucking casual pleb... also stop telling us how to enjoy the game, if I want to play 18h a day, let me and keep your mouth shut how it is not a way to play MY game
---
Yea, it wasn't until a few expansions later that I recall my blueberry actually holding agro decently. In vanilla it was almost a guarantee to pull off unless you just sit there doing nothing for 10s.
---
My god, do we *really* need a 10th post of this in the last 24 hours?

Let people play how they want and STFU.

Speaking of Rammstein, we gathered a bunch of guildies and saw them in London then proceeded to trash a hotel room. One of our shammies ended up being deceived by a rogue player into drinking a glass of wine filled with piss.
---
They have smaller aggro radius on private servers than I remember in Vanilla.
---
Yes, lots of humanoids come in clumps and/or have casters.  Both are more common in Murlocs, and its more common for Murlocs to have clumps of both.
---
With most humanoids, you have camps that you can avoid, and you can take out individual mobs roaming around.  Murlocs tend to have a much higher concentration around their hovels, or whatever they are worshipping.
---
Yeah not gonna happen any time soon to much competition and if you can't get ahead of the curve gonna take longer to do quests.
---
While I agree with this... I cannot abide in practice. Limited time for WoW is forcing me to minmax just a bit.
---
I camped him off and on for six days. Turned the music down and the sound up, threw on some background music, grabbed a book, and stood within his aggro range at spawn. Soon as I heard that growl I would check the screen and when he finally spawned, threw down a trap and hit tame. Good times.
---
Then they added the permanently-up duplicate in Sholazar and everyone over 77 had him. Oh well.

Nice to see that the few addons I need are already ported. Addon devs rule.
---
On that note, is there some way to set up and test your addons before launch, for someone not in the beta?
---
I know right? You need to crush them and snort them.
---
Do you think that having to wait in a long queue and not being able to play might turn new players off to the game? I agree with you and definitely will not mind waiting for a queue on a sever I want to play on, but I know I will be playing this game for years. Someone who has never played and is not attached to the game yet may just say screw this and move on. That would be my concern with Blizz not capitalizing on the hype now to draw in a new crowd
---
so its fine to hate on some nationality because someone hates on americans already? plus, i dont even know how americans are related to that, shazzrah discord seemed to be mostly british from my impression.

I went for exalted rep with darnassus on my mage in vanilla. Unfortunately I made that decision after level 60 and I pretty much relied on cloth turn ins. That was a long time and a lot of work. Start early question in darnassus would definitely help.
---
I would go hunter in your situation. Druid does have the potential to be decent at anything, however like you have mentioned it takes 2x the work just to be decent. A hunter will gear relatively quickly in game as there are not real competitors besides other hunters for gear. Also hunters are one of the best end game farmers so it will take you less time to get the gold you need for various things. 
---
So while I feel druid is an awesome class, I do believe hunter is what will fit your current life better.

You are a bad healer if you waste mana on warlocks who won't be taking lethal damage. Just throw a renew for them if they're out of mana &amp; low on health

If you are hardcore enough to pay money to reserve a name early, you should move servers, because you will be locked on login queues for weeks.  Blaumeux isn't bad by any means.

I think you have to gimp yourself to boost them cuz both are resource soakers

honestly crafting in general seems like a trap for vanilla beyond engi. Most of the goodies can be done by friends or guildmates cuz they arent bop.
---
You're spot on about people not making it. I played vanilla for over a year and between making multiple characters and not knowing what I was doing, my highest level toon was 54.
---
I still maintain Blizzard capped that last stress test at 15 just to keep me personally from taming Eche.

Does anyone know if this change to Weapon Skill is the version we'll get in Classic?
---
"Weapon skill will no longer reduce the percentage damage lost due to glancing. - The player will gain 0.1% to their critical strike rating per weapon skill against monsters above their level. 7.8% DPS boost from 10 weapon skill has now been reduced to a 0.07% DPS increase"
---
Because that would be important to know. Most Guides/Tips regarding Weapon Skill that I have seen recommended going for more than 9% Hit if possible because Glancing Blow penalty will be reduced. If this isn't the case it seems like one should really try not to waste Stats on Hit after reaching 9%.
---
Maybe, it depends.  It doesn't take 240 hours to hit 60, but if you do professions, and run dungeons and wpvp and stuff, then yeah it could.  People on the beta were hitting 40 within roughly 24 hours give or take a few, and 43 is roughly the halfway point in playtime, so even someone inexperienced following a guide could do it in ~70-80 hours if that's all they focused on (ignoring other factors).
---

One of the new ones that opens at launch is your best bet.
---
Skeram is not safe because everybody is thinking the same thing and switching to Skeram. Guarantee it's full or at least has a queue by launch. It's a crapshoot as to which of the current servers will have the lowest pop when launch comes.
---
Some are single-pullable.  But the amount of them that are, compared to the amount that aren't, is a lower ratio than other humanoid mobs.
---
And when they run away in fear, they tend to run away farther, faster, and for longer than other humanoids.
---
Id say BM is still the best, all you need is a pet and you're going to do amazing. You could go MM but I assume it would be more gear dependent to maximize its potential, like keeping up with your ranged weapon for example. It's really up to you, you'll do fine with either spec especially if duo leveling.
---
&gt; too many sjw buzzwords chained together

What a fucking child.

Yes let the experience the mind numbing wonder of running out of quests and grinding mobs like a chinese bot instead of doing things efficiently

A lot of players will still use stormwind over ironforge.  You get head buffs in sw
---
Pretty much this. I've never played an mmo where I had trouble finding groups
---
Totally ;)
---
Then they are getting a “suck my ass, I’m not healing you then”
---
Hunter is the least gear dependent class, so it's ideal for a casual player who won't have time to grind out all the best gear. It also does fine in pvp.
---
Tier 3 still looks godly imo, judgment is just iconic for pals
---
And? People will get over it as it is now people are already going to screech except it will be that Blizzard is unprepared for classic and only opened up X ammount of realms to start and that no one can play because of queues. Which might make blizzard open up X number of realms in panic to appease. Then what happens if no one wants to move and those servers have low pop and even lower when/if people leave the game for whatever reason.
---
As I said no matter what people are going to be angry and are already calling Blizz out on the fact that you have to sub a month early for names and even THEN that was only for a chance to get said name.
---
I expected runescape music... huge disappointment.

The people asking for ilvl or require a certain # have never played vanilla and I would laugh in their face.
---
IT IS NOT WHAT LAYERS ARE. 
---
\-You dont choose what layer
---
\-You can switch between layers while in game
---
\-Layers DOES NOT mean you can escape the queue problem. 
---
IF layers allowed EVERYONE to play on a realm without queue, your argument would be valid. But because it doesnt work like that, it is not "essentially what layers are". If you have Herod 1 and Herod 2, they are both servers that will have a 10k pop, but allow 20k players to play on the server Herod. When pop drops to 5k for both of them, you can merge them to create a single Herod.
---
*laughs in Firemaw*
---
Thanks, that did the trick indeed
---
I swear some DPS players in BFA don't even have their interrupt ability on their hotbar anywhere.
---
On the last stress test you needed to move to a rested area to be able to shift layers. In order to coordinate this with other players, you'd need to find someone in a different layer. Hearth to BB or Grom'Gol, then run to the arena all before its looted.
---
That's not very exploitable.
---
Man I can not wait to get high and play this game chill. Because there really is no race with no threat of future expansions making your shit bad. The game is just there. It'll have that Diablo 2 style "this item/character is good and will be good forever"
---
That's true, but if you haven't got the time to be sat in longer queues you probably shouldn't be rolling on the servers that Blizz is telling you will have them. There's plenty of people willing to wait those queues out and then not log out for a day.
---
One day people will get tired of making this joke. Maybe another 15 years.

Give me a new pacific pvp server with a decent name and I'm there. Blowme is a horrible name, and is why it's the only server no one is rolling on.

---
Our guild set it's first full guild raid in November. People were concerned that it was too far away.
---
Yeah. Warning people to move to another server helps when all the possible options are already full.
---
I want to move to a less overcrowded server like you have no idea, yet they don't give me the option.
---
Many of the places that absolutely needed CC, like the last few pulls in LBRS, and several packs in DM-ogres.... were hit with several nerf bats by 1.12.  I'd still be sure to bring at least one class with decent CC for the dungeon, but you should be fine without worrying too much.
---
This is all good advice. Feign death + trap macro wasn't working for me on the beta, and I'm pretty sure it was that way in vanilla too. Even when testing with no pet out, it took more than a second to drop combat after the feign death was successfully cast. So immediately trapping after a successful FD probably won't work.
---
NA PVE East servers are FULL and there is no alternative. I reserved all my names immediately and the server was Medium for like a week. Now it's full and there is nowhere to go. I already have RL friends and a guild lined up and I feel like Blizz is trying to punish me for giving them money early. Been a while since I've gotten to feel that old familiar feeling lol.

They waited way too long with new German servers.

I really really really dislike going over the same zone again and feeling like I stupidly missed a side quest.

Typical example is STV quests, picked from various points, that send you to farm the same kind of trolls.

There was indeed a discount for other reputation levels like exalted in TBC as far as I can remember. I think at exalted it ended up to be like  650 gold in total or something like that. At least I remember paying around 600 gold (or so) when I dinged 60, which happened a few days after TBC came out. They probably lowered it due to having the additional cost for flying at level 68 (or was it 69?).
---
The new zones are beautiful, but I miss wide open spaces of the older zones. Everything is so cluttered now

Just put flash heal on everything including movement keys and have him auto follow
---
Blizzard doesn't know what they are doing, they have been showing that every step of the way.
---
step 1 : release 2 PVP servers, and then make people pay to reserve their name 
---
step 2 : notice that 2 PVP servers aren't enough and make more
---
step 3 : Notice that people that paid for their name, make communities and guilds for the first 2 servers don't really move
---
Step 4 : ???? Profit
---
If you actually think classic will start losing a lot of people in the first couple months then u are the delusional one and should probably apply for a job at Blizzard. And saying they know what they are doing is pretty hilarious considering every single change they have made to the game. Store mounts, LFR, LFG, Daily quests, WoW tokens, Titanforging, Crossrealm, Sharding, Making WoW more about the patch rather then about the expansion and not to even start on their other big titles like Diablo and starcraft that seem pretty much abandoned except for a fking mobile game' Sure, they know what they are doing, sucking every penny out of everyone's pocket and they just want the one without monetization (at the start) to just die off as quickly as possible.
---
Unfortunately for classic wow they are using the normalized pets. lupos doesnt have his shadow damage, all pets move the same movement speed, and other rares with unique effects are neutered.
---
the only thing that remains is the pet attack speed variations, so expect lots of broken tooths
---
I might roll an alt there, and make it my main if things go south on my main PvP server, do you have any rules for RP written up by Blizz? I understand that RPPvP is "PvP but without twich spam", but is there realistically something that will get you in trouble?
---
to dead realms, no thanks! ill stick to herod
---
Best is to pull around 80%, healers can get to 100% around the same time you hit 50% health and need healing. It all varies though.
---
Some healers are pretty dumb though and for some reason need to start healing you at 95% and don't fill up their mana, then complain when they run out of it.
---
30 mins then ;)
---
Until you get randomly DCed reeeee
---
RP PVP seems to be the least popular PVP option. Will probably fill up less than regular PVP servers during launch.
---
O,rly?
---
the only thing im scared about is talents... if i make big mistake it will be hard to fix cuz i wont be rolling in gold
---
Here is some light reading for you, seriously... EVE has one of the most abusive and cancerous communities in gaming.

It is for people who have limited playing time. I'm usually done with my day and ready to relax with a bit of gaming by around 8pm. A 2 hour queue will be my entire time window.
---
That being said, I dgaf about what server name I'm on (since my OG server, Magtheridon, didn't make the cut) so I'll likely just roll on whatever is the lowest pop at the time. Hard to say though because, as it stands right now, the only not high/full US East PVP server is Skeram and it's at medium already, with still 5 days left before launch (which is when the majority of characters will be made).
---
Basically what you listed besides stuff that changes how the UI looks along with classic auras/omni cc, also an auto shot timer since I'm going to be a hunter, trinket menu is extremely useful as well.
---
Lol here I was mad about getting September 14, you guys all made me feel better ty
---
I'm not absolutely sure in English, but I think Portuguese has an U
---
The questions are almost too perfect... this really smells like a troll (no offense) to me.
---
If it’s real, it makes me happy at how many people are going to abandon their efforts in Classic within two weeks, leaving the core of people that want to play this game for what it is.
---
I chose Stalagg when it opened because it was supposed to be low/medium pop.... now it looks high/full
---
What's that gonna do if all PvP servers have horde majority. If anything it's just gonna add to the issue.
---
...it's been out under 2 hours and is just under 4 hours long. You listen fast!
---
I'm fairly certain that's how it is right now in N/A, which is why were kind of forced to switch so we can all play together
---
The Shatner one is also pretty funny.
---
I am a member of the press. Where do I sign up?
---
Lmao I wasn’t even planning on hitting 60 too fast but 6 hours for one level ... bruh. It takes me 6 hours to get from level 20 to level 60 in retail :( this gonna be a long ride huh?
---
Yesterday blizzard said that medium servers will have small queues at launch. High pop servers will have long queues and Full servers will have absolutely absurd queues.
---
dead meme realm. good luck and cant wait to see you transfer over in a few months. give blizz that money boi
---
this weekend will be the first in recorded history when large crowds of people are like "Fuck this weekend, is it monday yet!?!?!?!"
---
Of course, I wasn't trying to say that this is 100% true for everyone. It can just be really fun to read the quests, look at your map and try to figure out where you are in the world, plus there are so many funny little stories and easter eggs in this game.
---
You get another 10% off if you get PvP lvl 4ish or something like that
---
This is like when the beta went down for Destiny..
---
.. before we knew that was half the content.
---
You get extremely screwed by the cost.
---
My thoughts exactly. It seems like it could be use a corrective course of action if needed.
---
Blewmoo is definitely going to be the least popular server out of the ones we have now since it’s got a disgusting name
---
ahahah thats funny XDD
---
I think it will slowly rise in population. Everyone is underestimating demand. Word will go around and people will keep buying subs.
---
Pretty cool that Bob Ross is this dude’s roommate.
---
Before the Storm
---
“Fuck yes. That beauty cost me over £1k and drains my soul every minute i spend with her, don’t question her importance.”
---
Thx! So excited for Classic!
---
Warlocks have by far the most/best class quests if that helps way you. Hunters are slightly more inconvenient with feeding pets and ammo. Soul shards weren't as bad as people say but is still definitely an inconvenience compared to other classes.
---
You shouldn't be on those server wide discords to begin with.
---
When you create a new character. You need to begin at that spot sitting. 
---
Then you can head canon you went back in time and the adventure continues !!!
---
It's not about skill, imo, but people who've been doing mythic+ speedrunning for years have a set of assumptions that don't hold true in Classic. That's what I saw on pservers, at least.
---
It's little things, like water is actually expensive. You might expect your priest to drink for 3-5 seconds after every pull to maintain mana, but your priest might want to wait until they're below 40% and then park their ass for 30 seconds. That can feel frustrating for a retail player, and sometimes they blame the priest for playing "wrong".
---
Retail players might want to skip packs and dodge patrols to finish more quickly. Classic players might want to fully clear trash because it's good exp and it's not worth risking a long corpse run when someone inevitably pulls that patrol that was skipped earlier.
---
They're not bad players, just from a different meta.
---
Is there any place where you can see rough server numbers. Ideally I'd love to play on a low-mid pop server, don't want a dead server, but also not a crazy streamer server
---
I don't think it's the best part for me either, but there are still sights to be seen and friends to be made and a few end game items to collect along the way. And though it's closer to 60, Maraudon will always be my favorite dungeon and it's just not enjoyable *at* 60.
---
Later on i would farm Felcloth. I leveled with skinning so sold those mats which i later switched to enchanting/engineering. Engineering for the PvP bonus and disenchanting i would DE and AH the mats or offer DE services to others. 
---
Also would to lockboxes for tips occasionally, but gold wasnt my main focus. Before i was an enchanter i would save BOEs and trade to an enchanter friend that i made who would do most of my enchants free of charge.
---
I really wasn't trying to say to play the way I say (say that 10 times in a row). Your view of it is totally fair to have too. I'm just saying that 5 days is a hell of a long time to have someone in your ear saying "Left, right, kill 10 of this, run back, buy 10 waters". It would annoy me if I was driving a car and I think it will be more fun (for me) to try it without a guide. 
---
Just imagine the race to 60 without any guides or quest addons. The people who win would be pretty damn impressive and better at the leveling process than me.
---
Unless it's a Mac with no tmu support.  No dice there.
---
r/tihi
---
I don't know if most, but bunch of them definitely do have something: healing, some debuffs, ranged attack making them difficult to AoE down, fear mechanic making them aggro other nearby mobs once they get low on health, etc. Would it be enough? Probably not, I only mentioned casual fight difficulty as an example of things I like about vanilla, and while it would make me like retain more, it still has plenty of other problems.
---
First aid is no longer needed when you can deal with 5+ murlocs by yourself at level 5 lol.
---
I think what most people mean, when they say this is that, don't make level cap your priority, because that was never when the game "started" Enjoy the journey not the destination. End game content is not the BULK of classic WoW.
---
&gt;  The real question is why would you ever consider a rogue or meme spec over a tank for any fear ward rotation?
---
Where are you getting the "over" instead of "on top of"?
---
You mean private server? Literally no one refers to them as "illegal".
---
Why?
---
God I hope they break this.
---
Well they did....  You can give them a pass for the 23439276th time if youd like, but releasing 12 servers originally was CLEARLY not the way to go about it.
---
People keep talking about the meld MC combo but a dwarf clearing viper, devouring plague, and rogue poisons is much better to me.
---
Delete it!
---
I'm guess 20 minute que on Stalagg, but only that short because I'll be hitting login the second the servers go up.
---
That's right, it was patched before 1.12, to require blacksmithing to use, no longer just BoP.
---
Thanks for catching that.
---
If your friend is just going to be stubborn you can just play anyway. The answers are there for them to look up themselves and they just aren't doing it. I get you want to educate them but by the sound of it, you won't get anywhere for a while.
---
I don't mind rolling on a lower pop server because I completely agree with you. I just wish it was named like almost literally anything else
---
Whitemane is 56/44
---
Currently Blaumeux is the most balanced and only one with a slight Alliance dominance (51/49), but there's also only 450  responses (compared to 1450 for Fairbanks and 2500 for Herod). 
---
Also keep in mind that all these polls are NOT accurate representation of faction numbers when we go live, and final numbers could sway any way. A large number of players from both factions will likely trickle-down into any non-full servers when they are faced with massive queue times.
---
&gt; because I grinded so hard to get that set a few
---
But they are
---
Hunter all day, especially if you're on limited time / solo.  Level a warrior alt, and you can use your hunter to feed him gold and gear, making life easier.
---
Hopefully no more than a couple months, but I may get lost somewhere in Un'Goro along the way
---
Now this is quality shitposting, have an upvote!
---
Haha suckers!!!!  Monday-Tuesday IS my weekend!!
---
Yeah that's the "population bias" part. Everyone here has been saying "get off Herod, go to Stalagg", so they did. Hence, if you hadn't been here to see that, you wouldn't have moved.
---
Is there any way to avoid to be mind controled? or any way to cancel it?
---
I discovered a Katy Perry song though the WoW parody by Ember Isolte.
---
Well there's a large number of us who do hope they add things eventually. Not everyone is on the "nochanges" train long-term. I look at Oldschool Runescape as a shining example of what Classic could be. Community-polled updates and new content that keeps the game alive, without ever passing the BS that ruined retail in the first place.
---
????????
---
Blizzard: Fill up the new realms and we will open more servers.
---
People with two brain cells to rub together: And what happens to the full servers when all our friends who arent subbed join.
---
Blizzard and reddit autists: ? 
---
Launch day: Fucked.
---
They should add 2 more PvE servers, one for PST and one for EST.
---
Such accuracy, you sir know how to read minds
---
Just play EU bro.
---
Monday is day off in UK. So i plan to spend that day cleaning up the flat, making it shiny and sparkling and squeaky clean. 
---
Then if there's time left, ill go and have a good workout. Some laps in pool etc.
---
Finally when time arrives, ill log in, sort my interface, try to get a guild charter.... and then log out and sleep. because i got work next day :/
---
I lucked out big time.  I just finished my last day (half day) of work and tomorrow morning I leave for a bachelor party.  We come home Sunday night and Im off allllll week for Classic!
---
Troll warrior for pve if you plan on tanking. Orc for pvp. Undead if you wanna look good and be different.
---
Some don't, others do. There's no way that a single layer will hold the 10k ppl a private server might have on release so I expect it to be comparatively easy.
---
To them its more about the potential, and with resources taken away it means the potential for new content being good is alot smaller or just less content in general. Not trying to argue with which expansions are good, just want ways to explain to them that classic isnt taking resources away from classic cause they dont care which game is better.
---
Hate it with a passion
---
Both BFA and Legion. For the release of BFA I played on Silvermoon EU, the second largest Server here, and I had only a little bit of lag and managed to play relatively well.
---
They fixed it :-)
---
The worst part is not to save up money as you approach lv40.
---
I'll give you 20 if you don't feed them.
---
I had a Z-board from when I was twelve. It was branded as Ideazon Merc Board before they changed to steal series. I swapped it out in 2016, bought it when I was 12 in 2004.
---
Ok Thanks for the Information :)
---
What's wrong with this?
---
I hope so too. Really doesn't belong in Classic.
---
Orc for PvP as well.
---
Both are viable. The 5% int is not as important as the weapon skill problem for warriors.
---
Breadcrumb players will cause every server to have massive queues. Blizzard fucked this and i cant believe people STILL defend this trash company.
---
This is basically what I did. Add up the hours that I plan to play each day, then see where that puts me based on 240 hours to 60. It probably won't take me that many /played hours since I will be forgoing professions and playing a Hunter. I'm thinking that I should be 60 by October 1st.
---
Initial servers will never die at least.
---
Go shadow, melt faces.
---
They did back then. They will now.
---
Oh god no.......triggered hard my Murloc nightmares are starting again......AHHHHH!
---
The most recent post from blizzard mentions that the ques could be longer than there are spots in the que
---
Definitely trust this guide to be efficient, considering Navak was the first Horde character to hit 30 when Classic Beta came out. AS A WARRIOR.
---
They told you those servers would be overpopulated. You didn't listen. What's entitled is you getting this angry over having a queue for a week or two in a game that's going to last years.
---
It’s his fucking product, he is allowed to choose how to monetise it. Jesus Christ.
---
30 minutes
---
Warrior is slow and the hunter will feel like it's carrying a majority of the leveling process. When the War gets a new weapon it'll feel godlike for a few hours and then taper off again. Rogue is probably better if you still want to be a melee fighter and don't care about tanking.
---
Priest you try and stay alive and pop fast heals as a holy (or you can disc PvP). Or, probably recommended, you can Shadowpriest and be extremely annoying as a duo in world PvP. 
---
With any class raiding depends on your expectations and your time commitment. With the popularity of classic getting into a casual 40-man raid probably won't be too difficult, a lot of groups will be forming, but you'll waste a lot of time in the actual raid dying or waiting on people. It's fine if you don't mind that sort of thing, but if you're trying to speedrun your weekly clear or w/e especially if you want to play warrior you need to get on the ground floor with a decent group so you can get some gear priority and move up the food chain quicker.
---
I’m not dug in because I’ve done it. Stop projecting. It can be 50/50 for a lot of the fights true. And no you don’t have to be in a corner. And yes drain is ehh. And yes there are variables. But warlocks and rogue fights come down to who plays their class better not what class they are. Honestly it’s the most matched and exciting 1v1 in the game. But continue to project and tell me I’m dug in, when I’m not claiming every warlocks is always going to win against every rogue. Like it seems you are. And btw with people min/maxing going to be more orc rogues around this time. Oh and warlock gear stacks sta so they have more hp.
---
It is okay to spec aoe, you lose out on very little until the 30's even in world pvp, youll get ice barrier the same time also.
---
Goes without saying (looking at the binds) but also worth noticing you rebound your strafe keys to A and D.
---
Warriors definitely do not hard counter rogues. A good rogue will beat a warrior most of the time. Resisting a CS or KS is massive for warriors and turns the fight in their favour.
---
that stairs boss fight is sick
---
My very first character was a night elf warrior.  
---
Not sure how I made the grind to 60 and didn't give up, but wisp form may have helped with all of the death runs.
---
Why is the alliance logo pixelated and the horde logo isnt?
---
So because you were a kid with a fear of viruses and a lacking of available resources *that were indeed available back then, and not against the TOS*.....it's considered cheating?
---
Have you thought this through?
---
I personally hate leveling.  Always have.  Hated it in 2006.  Hate it now.  I will rush through leveling as quickly as possible
---
Oh shit, I forgot that there are no achievements. I actually kind of like them. It's cool to see the people who get world firsts.
---
Can confirm.
---
Nope, according to reddit blizzard is infallible and this is all your fault even though its obvious to everyone that they fucked up the number of servers.
---
That's too bad. 
---
Some of my best memories are from vanilla.
---
There have also been people that have complained about getting ganked for 14 years. Not learning from what you dont like is also sad. PvE is an option.
---
Also, no real AOE threat skills.
---
More Cooks in the kitchen isn't always a good thing.  Too many cooks results in lots of toe stepping, messed up orders, wasting ingredients, running out stuff, missing deadlines, and so on.

---
You'll have no problems finding groups, especially if you're a good player and not an asshat.  Having a good reputation goes a long way, especially as a "dime a dozen" class
---
Should work ok but you'll be competing for gear, if you're just questing that's not as much of an issue though
---
Sounds like Hunter to me. You can't really be an effective tank unless you dedicate a ton of time. Hunters in a min/max scenario might fall off, but to be blunt it doesn't sound like you are going to play enough to notice that. Cheers.
---
30 minutes.  It's possible it's reduced for launch as well.  Many other games have done this in the past to help with queues.  Nothing says they will though yet.
---
I'm danish and i voted english speaking, in the survey. i also speak danish - obviously.
---
I believe it's 1 for gathering, 5 for crafting.
---
Surely they have a cap on it.
---
Chill? This is a debate son, Blizzard can  do all the planning they want, doesn't mean its the best way. And I believe the way they went about it is wrong and will only come back to bite them but regardless I don't care because it doesn't affect me in the slightest.  I intentionally rolled on a realm that not many people rolled.

Classic players in 2019:  how DARE there be an addon that provides a better way to create groups. NO CHANGES
---
Well we are playing anyway without them, and they are also a reasonable person and if i show them proof that classic isnt actually taking resources away from retail then they will mellow out. I just dont have that info to show them and im having a hard time finding it.

&gt;When you use it in common speech you devalue the diagnosis for people who actually have it.

Do you go on this rant every time someone claims to have OCD? Get off your high horse.
---
You have no way in knowing if he/she does in fact have OCD or not. I would imagine since you claim to have OCD, you'd understand that to say someone does in fact have OCD or not,  you'd need to take a very thorough history of obsessions, compulsions, and symptoms that cannot be attributed to physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.

---
The same thing happened on EQ, when they released the first TLP (server that starts in classic and works it's way through expansions at regular intervals) in a long time.
---
Everyone warned them that the server was going to be clogged. No layering technology, no instancing, nothing to alleviate the fact that  thousands of new players were gonna log in all at once, end up in the newbie area with nothing to do because there's just way too many people.
---
They ignored the calls for another server, and they launched it anyways. Well it turns out that the scrub plebians who actually play the game were actually right, it was goddamn unplayable. So they launched another server *three days* after the initial launch.
---
Three days after people started to level their character, met up in game with their friends, formed guilds and everything. The new server was doomed from the start, everyone on the first server basically went "lol fuck this i'm staying here".
---
Luckily, the EQ team learned from their mistakes, because the subsequent TLPs had layering technology to help cope with the inflated population, along with dynamic respawn timers for trash mobs. They also added a way to instance classic raids, something that had never been done before. Once they accepted their mistakes and fixed them, it became an awesome experience.
---
It's basically what will happen with WoW classic. But at least we're lucky, because while the first few hours are going to be a shitshow, at least there's alternatives, in low-level instances. If the barrens are too full, to the point where people struggle to complete quests, there's always ragefire chasm and wailing cavern runs they can do to pass the time while they wait for the crowd to thin out.
---
Also, the devs are in a tight spot. They don't want to add too many servers, because over time the population will thin out. It's a reality in every game that has legacy/progression servers. Huge, huge influx of players at the start, then it gradually thins out as weeks go by.
---
They don't want to create a bunch of servers only to be forced to merge them at a later date when the inevitable happens, so from a company's perspective, its better to have too few than too many.
---
Now from our perspective as players, it sucks, because it doesn't create an enjoyable launch experience. But it is what it is.
---
I agree with you though, they should have created more servers when they announced them, but, it's the first time they're doing this, so hopefully they learn from their mistakes in preparation for the next one :)
---
Exactly, no keyboard turning! It's a sure sign you're wet behind the ears.

You have no idea what you are talking about here, that's basically it. Blizzard's definition and the GDPR definition are not the same thing. By non personal data, blizzard is talking about literally non-personal data. The GDPR is a data based policy. The whole point of it is to make non-personal data considered personal data. They have entire sections as to how this possible.
---
By "GDPR is a joke" I mean are people going to get banned from WoW Classic over their "non personal" information? Obviously not. So what does it matter? You consent to the user agreement by creating your account, and you have every right to use the GDPR to opt out of data collection. Blizzard is just going to cancel your account after that. It's pointless to bring up because it doesn't help people if their account gets banned at the end.

It's not hard at all as MT. The MT gets the first by default, and RNG all but guarantees at least on TF by the time Naxx hits. On average, guilds typically will complete 2-3 in that span of time.
---
So the easy route to getting TF is to hold the MT role of a guild that can clear Molten Core. Hardly a difficult requirement.

The addon devs trying to claim it's just a chat parser are so full of shit.

Tipsout and his family = 18 mil Fraud

Yep. 12 vs 80+ when vanilla released
---
Seeing as its against ToS to speak anything but english I doubt anyone's gonna know that someone is spanish.
---
Yo momma so fat she gets stuck in  portals.
---
Not to mention the line crossing red hot poker torture quest in Wrath I think. WTF Blizzard. I still look at you side eyed because of that quest.
---
Thats so perfect. I even found my hacked 0.97 spotify from 2013 with blockify.
---
Big help! I'm surprised Curse doesn't have a "Classic" category yet

I had considered it,  who knows this thing changes every day, lol

I certainly hope so
---
Swing and a miss.
---
Yeah I don't know much about how add ons work and if blizzard can ban certain ones, if they can I hope they don't allow this but I just find it unlikely unfortunately
---
Edit; just saw the video you linked and its nice to see someone like Ion talking about it and it makes me feel more optimistic, so maybe they will actually do something about it. We will see I guess.
---
This is the ringtone on my phone for texts. I have Pavlov’s Doged myself into picking up my phone every time I hear a merloc, even while playing. 
---
It’s also the best gamer geek call in public.
---
Remember guys! 
---
Release date and time is **Monday, August 26th at 3:30 pm PDT.** Did you catch that? I'll repeat the time for those in the back. **3:30 pm PDT.** Other places including the official website may say 3:00 pm, but that's *fake news*. You want to be there, ready to go on the servers at **3:30 pm**.
---
See you in Azeroth!
---
Just make alts if you guys get 4-5 levels apart. If you can stand being a few levels apart then it won’t be an issue since you can probably catch up whenever the other logs off
---
Do you think there will be enough people as good dedicated tanks that I won't be waiting for groups forever? I mean, I guess there is only one or two spots for a tank anyways. I always like filling one of the healer/tank roles just to get into groups faster, dungeons are one of my favorite parts of classic.
---
With that being said though, I personally really like how the 'neon' lines turned out on the Horde logo. :D
---
I remember feeling accomplished I got half my XP bar full when trying to level out of 58 in the plaguelands
---
Guys an add-on was available in classic that did this....but it was shit but in essence did the same thing... agreed though Delete it
---
Man I love reading this shit thanks for the links, this is literally EvE's lore.
---
its a planck :) yea, i will definitely try to remove backpedaling, however i like it when lvling :|
---
Yes, lets support this con-artist
---
I've seen Metzen say that he always plays a human paladin in any game where possible, and always when he does his replay of new WoW content, and John Staats (of the WoW Diary) has said that Metzen was the only Blizzard person during the early days who didn't play Horde.  Staats said this in response to the suggestion that Blizzard favored Alliance; I think it was in one of the Countdown to Classic interviews.  Staats also mentions Metzen's tendency to play human paladins.
---
Might? It’s logic...
---
Wish we could see numbers, that would help calm things
---
I'm just glad I'm not one of those end racers, this is all going to piss them off sooo much. ( teehee!)
---
As long as there's as many versions of the lyrics as changes you've made
---
that's not "hardcore" though. that's just ganking fun.
---
What's the general play style of Shadow? Is it kind of like an affliction lock mixed with something else?
---
I had the same shit happen to me with Mankrik. I always thought it was Mankirk.
---
You don't need to break the law to convince a megacorporation that they can make money by selling what people want.
---
were u farming cloth as a swords or dagger rogue?
---
Well for once we actually have the power of hindsight.
---
It won't matter, no one's going to invite a feral druid anyway
---
I haven't been home in years !!! Everytime I think of it I get a rush of exitement and I want to jump and laugh hysterically :p
---
because obviously there is a want for it?
---
If so many people hate it and don't want it, don't download it, if nobody downloads it they will probably stop working on it, everyone does download it and use it then the 20 people crying on reddit about it were wrong I guess...

frank you're confusing your life with the life of john rambo
---
&gt; Finding group, actually interacting with other players, etc. The moment this system becomes available, that aspect is gone. 
---
Yes, those right-click -&gt; invite steps are a major part of the "player interaction"
---
&gt; Whats more, like other similar systems (i.e. gearscore) as soon as large enough number of players start using it, it will become mandatory for others, even if they dont want it.
---
Can you tell me how this is even remotely "similar" to gearscore? They're not even in the same domain.
---
&gt; This is not classic. If we're staying true to both letter and spirit of it, this ... thing.... needs to go. It belongs on retail, not in classic.
---
That video demonstrated nothing that wasn't common in vanilla, a person publicly advertised a group, another person whispered for an invite and got invited.
---
What's "not classic" about it?

Fun fooking finally someone pointed that out. I couldn't agree more. I will spend my time fishing, farming and goofing all around Azeroth while levelling. There is still so much to discover, if you just take your time to enjoy the goddammend moment
---
Its not ones own idiocy. 
---
In my case, all my friends are going Herod because the lack of servers. 
---
It's blizzards idiocy for testing how many servers they needed the way they did.
---
Its going to be worse now because everyone that didn't save their name is still going to use the same logic. "Where are my friends playing"
---
God damn that was good.
---
more than half the population isn’t gonna be on discord. you can also just msg in the chat box that you need a group, always works

---
You can Mind Control the tougher mobs to pull and let the adds kill 1 for free. Then the tank would pick up the rest after that.
---
The planet itself is a Titan, so something's gonna happen.
---
Main point of rushing to 60 for me is to hit cap then go around farming all of the rare stuff to make money before it becomes increasingly harder to as more and more people get to max level and start farming/competing for it as well.
---
It's fine. I don't mind. He can call me a liar all he wants. I know what I have, I know what I have been diagnosed with (along with GAD). I have everything he described as a sign of OCD while somehow claiming all I am talking about is a crooked picture or something. A lot of abstract thoughts going through my head that don't always materialize into the arrangement of a physical object, but rather the very thought of how things should be as opposed to how they are.
---
Because the server population is only indicative of the total number of accounts who have made characters on it. 
---
Medium and even low pop servers may have queues because everyone and their mother (as well as everyone and their mother who haven't made characters yet) is going to be trying to log on at the exact same time.
---
There are a few zones that people seem to have forgotten about as they are almost never brought up in leveling conversations. Feralas and The Hinterlands are both places I'll be paying a visit during my leveling journey.
---
That's a good thing though. I've improved, and the game has improved itself to its 1.12 state.
---
I am not too sure , but if that’s the case, wouldn’t mulgore be less crowded because the same number of people would be spread over a larger area vs durotar which is smaller and has more funneled areas?
---
&gt;Blaumeux
---
&gt;total shit
---
[Excuse me?](https://imgur.com/a/WaW6Qax)
---
Can't help but laugh when people start arguing over what is truly "hardcore" and who is actually "casual".
---
Obviously queues will be gone by October, But saying that there will be dead realms already is laughable. 
---
But to say that Stress-Test Data is reliable is pretty funny though, since u think the majority of the classic playerbase seriously paid money to get their name reserved? U know too in your heart that the majority of people don't give a fuck and just like everyone else u know that most people in u're guild/community haven't subbed, i'm in a guild if 45 people and i'm the only one with a sub, that's anecdotal but i bet most of ur group hasn't subbed either. Yet they are all waiting for release.
---
With that Stress Test data they thought 2 PVP servers was enough, and don't try to die on the hill other Blizzard-Apologists died on that "2 PVP servers were enough'' 
---
Because in the end Blizzard realized they fucked up and **DOUBLED** the amount of servers.
---
**DOUBLED** 
---
If they are so great with data, how do u explain the fact that they needed to stop being so arrogant and release legitimately DOUBLE the amount of servers.
---
So then u can only come to the conclusion that their Data isn't correct, cause how can u fuck up so hard that u needed **DOUBLE** the amount than u anticipated?
---
**Blizzard Apologists are DELUSIONAL** SAD
---
Yeah, that's what bothers me. Icy Veins did the same thing, and the dev said there'd be no automatic matchmaking. What does he call the autoinvite function in that case?
---
Yeah same. I had around 6 on my pserver warrior, with lots of dicking around included.
---
It really depends, you could easily take longer if you go out of your way to pick up a profession, travel somewhere, etc.

This myth again. The "game starts at 60" mantra was born in vanilla... who are you speaking for exactly?
---
Best part to me was level 60. Dumgeones, raids, brm pvp, battlegrounds and gearing.
---
Doing out od dated limited repetitive quests was NEVER my draw to WoW.

I knew my wife IRL we talked and hung out etc I never really pursued her until we started talking about both playing WoW.  We got married about 6 months after I transferred my alt to her carebear server in Wrath.  10 years and 3 kids later  we are getting ready ot play classic together on Monday.

If someone says they are on a budget they probably are not going to buy a mac.
---
Nelf Druid or dwarf rogue? I always wanted a Druid because I fell in love with the black cat from the original cinematic, but my younger bro keeps telling me druids sucked in vanilla. 
---
I want to do dps, but from what I’m seeing there’s going to be a billion rogues. Were druids really that bad? I want to kick ass at BGs and world PvP.
---
Thanks for the replies, sounds like hunter is a better choice for me. Shame that druid wasn't better in classic :(
---
If Blizzard ever releases a BC server though, I'll definitely be rolling druid again!
---
The standard resto build is 0/5/46, so you are a weaker healer than full resto, but that spec definitely has a niche. Guilds will be desperate for healers, and I'd rather bring you than an enhancement shaman.
---
I see this as shining on farm content, not necessarily for progression.
---
Nope, it's been tested. 30 minutes and you're out. Or they would've had to change something between stress test/name res and now.
---
Good thing Blizzard convinced me to get a phone! Now I can use these!
---
June 24th 2020. 9.9 months..... oh boy

Anyone know how to contact Henry Cavill? lol
---
I can't believe it is only 100 hours away WTF!!!!!!!!! SCREAMS!
---
Personally I'd go for Untouchables over Follow the Leader for Korn, but hey, to each their own.
---
*Am I the absolute only person excited for Classic??*
---
??? Why would I be talking about concurrent players for a game that isn’t out yet? Come on man. Don’t twist my words.
---
Awesome, I've been looking for something else to listen to when I'm burned out on Joe Rogan, this should do nicely.
---
where at in blizzcon was this mentioned? im trying to find it.
---
I’ve never seen someone get turned away for class choice.  But if you do decide to go orc, leave the starting area and walk north.  You’ll come to the gates of Orgrimmar where you’ll see a zeppelin tower.  That take zeppelin to the Undead starting zone.
---
You're right when I log in there is place holders for all my images but they are all gone.
---
I opened a ticket let's see if they can work some magic.
---
Alexensual was right
---
That's mighty deplorable of him, despite the circumstances I hope you will help him if it does become an issue!
---
I am leveling both a priest and shaman, maining a priest but I really can't wait to play both.
---
Have you explored female Orc for a Warrior? Personally I find them better looking. Not oversized, no massive shoulders, fairly good animations. Just a thought.
---
Getting to the Undead Zone is super easy. Just run to northern Durotar and ride the Zepplin right to Brill in Tirisfal Glades.
---
Been stuck on step 1 for 18 years now, hopefully step 2 doesn't take nearly as long!
---
[Clara, is that you? ](https://youtu.be/acDQyEZN7XY)
---
Play an undead warrior then! All the sets look very amazing on undead. 
---
Don't worry about min / maxing race selection. Remember this is vanilla, one of the best guilds back in vanilla &lt;Nihilum&gt; used an undead warrior as their MT /OT. You have nothing to worry about!
---
When you tire of the queues and twitchspeak, we can use reasonable people like you on Firemaw, even if you are horde scum.
---
I came from BFA, but I’ve also played since 2008 so I still remember and stand by the old ways!
---
Gentle we have reached the promised land.
---
Race doesn’t matter 
---
Yes some are better for certain classes but it’s not a big big deal 
---
If you wanna try hard af and grind out the pvp shit you might want to min max your race
---
I was using a similar addon on a 1.12 PS so i dont see whats the problem. Also from what im seeing its creating its own chat channel so its not spamming in General or Trade. You will never notice it if you dont use it.
---
While there is an optimal way to spec while leveling for every class, the trees give you tons of viability that the optimal way is really only for die hards who want to get out of leveling as soon as possible.
---
If your just looking to enjoy the entire experience the talent tree's in my opinion are very fun because there's so many ways you can allocate your points depending on how you approach the content.
---
Do yourself a favour and play around with a classic talent calculator. I've been messing with them for weeks and love the different builds I can do depending on how I decide to level.
---
People are just throwing Buzzwords around without knowing the meaning behind it.
---
I highly doubt the Russian agents are incels.
---
Do your best and if you're in a half-decent guild your guild should be doing most of it for you or partnering up with you.
---
I'm kind of looking forward to the Wetlands death run. :) It's an experience. I might change my mind after the third corpse run only to die in 20 yards to another angry croc, though.
---
I have one on my druid lol
---
ZF is a fun one I always liked the end fight where mobs keep running up the temple steps!
---
Well, saying no in German sounds so enticing though.
---
Blizzard: Please, be so kind and move to a lower pop server?
---
Germanz: Nein!
---
I'll only blow through water if there's a mage in the group. Otherwise, I've got a mount to save up for.
---
Why skip packs when they are holding so much tasty exp? And you know that Nelf hunter with his pet on aggressive is going to pull it anyway.
---
“Ah shit, here we go again”
---
It's entirely your own decision, but I would recommend, in a game where the fun of it comes from playing whichever way you want...you let people play the game whichever they want.
---
Yo baby ask Jodie if he knows how to tank DM tribute.
---
35789 players
---
You think you won't, but you will. 
---
or something
---
Tanks; like to dps - ineffective - hate your life.  
---
so fail chart
---
Damn. Even our memes are going back to the 2000’s
---
This sub as of late.
---
It's entirely luck based. Sure, the vast majority won't, but there WILL be at least one TF completed by P2.
---
Yeah same here. I've been running old dungeons in retail just to get that feeling of classic. Believe it or not, 2 days ago in MC I had bindings of the windseeker drop for the first time in my life (I play warrior). Would be kind of funky if I get the other half dropped this week and manage to get thunderfury before classic drops. Must be a sign from the WoW god.
---
Also, don't underestimate Will of the Forsaken for PVP and PVE!!!
---
I downvoted because the world would be better off without people so stupid they need to be removed to eat and sleep while playing a video game.
---
reckbombing wasn't a bug it just wasn't intended to be used in that way. blizz fixed it and it doesn't work the same way in classic
---
I have a looking for mats channel on discord set up. This way everyone can keep what they got themselves and can check there if someone needs something
---
This is an absolute masterpiece
---
????? To be honest i'm in the camp that people are at the end of the day going to play the way they want and use whatever the hell they want, so theres no point for me to really stress over it and worry too much because It won't really make a difference. I personally won't use it because its how I want to play, but if you want to use it go ahead. No, an addon that just makes it easier to tell if you get a whisper if anything helps with the community/social aspect of the game so i don't know where you're trying to draw a comparison between the two there? Maybe because they are both add ons lol?  Also I never used the words "too far" in my post so Idk why you're using quotes.
---
I'm so tired of these little spoiled brats crying to the skies over these. I hope they never ever ever implement them because of how much crying is happening and I liked having them in og wow
---
Will I do mad deeps?
---
&gt;So then u can only come to the conclusion that their Data isn't correct, cause how can u fuck up so hard that u needed **DOUBLE** the amount than u anticipated?
---
It's not double the amount they anticipated. Do you know what risk management is? Mindless blizzard haters are so delusional.
---
im pretty sure theres a guy you can pay to reset your talents. the price increases each time you do it though
---
World AoE leveling for a Mage is like Ricky Bobby in Nascar.. "If you ain't first, you're last!". 
---
**Edit to add.**
---
If you get ahead of the pack, and completely leave the area before the next person shows up, you could be Server First 60,  If anyone else shows up, you ruin the xp / hour for both of you.
---
\-- However you can still make a spell cleave group, and AoE dungeon Grind as an alternative.
---
There's no reason for a priest to keep tailoring after getting the robe. (unless you want the zg set for shadow or to make money off of bags and the mooncloth cd) I'm planning on doing herbalism and skinning while leveling. I'm going to drop skinning at 45ish and bringing up tailoring. After I've gotten my truefaith and a few bags for my alts, I'm dropping tailoring for engineering. I'm planning on having alchemy on an alt that will make it to at least 35
---
it's 2019, why do people still have wives? Marry a guy like I did and avoid this problem.

Completely invalidates Joana's website if it works, which would be pretty big, will probably load it once classic starts and keep Joana's guide up on second screen anyway till I'm sure it matches up.
---
They're the ones still making the decision dude, they're not being forced to not pick Shazzrah. And the concern isn't ESL, the concern is no English. In a community driven game with only text chat, you kinda need people that speak the same language to populate the server. Yeah they obviously have to go somewhere, the Shazzrah folks just don't think it should be Shazzrah.
---
Because that was what was being talked about
---
You should still be using the AOE frost spec because ideally even if you are just doing normal questing you should be pulling 3+ mobs anyways because you can.
---
Dude this is SWEEEET. Thank you!
---
Westfall has a lot of bottleneck and bad drop rates for quests. Darkshore typically less populated, more quests in clusters, etc.
---
Oh no I don't doubt that people will not cooperate with it, but threat has never been fun for me as a mechanic both as a tank or DPS. I don't like having to hold back as a DPS or a tank. I get annoyed when I can too easily pull off the other tank co-tanking.
---
Having to sit there doing nothing just isn't compelling. What's worse is players are even more conditioned to love showing up on the DPS meters now so I think we're going to get an even harder mismatch over expectations and what players want.
---
This is the main reason people say classic will fail
---
Yes you could easily preFW for a whopping 1 fear. During the fight, the important part of an encounter, the 30s CD would likely require a rotation between 2 dPriest per tank for safety.  
---
Pre fight buffs are nice but that isn’t going to be continued through the fight in any reliable fashion for nontanks.
---
Yeah we got some nice attention to details here
---
I think you're being a bit melodramatic, my friend.
---
And even if you aren't, anyone that far gone isn't gonna have their mind changed by a click-bait Reddit post
---
Better use all 3 of them on 1 server, preferably "THE" server as well. They're asking for queues and Blizzard is delivering it in spades.
---
The only donside is that this way they'll prolly find the secret hub with the ship and whatnot.
---
What i mean is things like paying your raiders in gold especially plate users who can get extremely butt fucked by repairs.(especially tanks)
---
I think maybe the boomers like that "JUUL" tobacco vape.
---
This addon needs to be broken.
---
I mean if the english speaking people outnumber them, they kind of have to talk english, if they want any of their trading or groups to amount to anything.
---
I really think reddit make it out to be a bigger deal than it is.

Hey, they added a level picker to the guide.

I’m gonna miss transmogging, but not miss mounts and flying.
---
Pure gold
---
whats the actual most underplayed/least played class in the game ? (or rather will be, for classic)
---
i thought about maining something that not a lot of people like/play
---
what would that be? shaman?
---
Let us go home
---
I'm not sure WHY you are wondering that.  The whole reason people want classic is to bring back the original sense of community and actual interactions with people.  This is just a dumbed down version of retails LFG which is probably the worst addition they ever made to the game
---
Yes, yes and yes.
---
Unzips...
---
Who're you calling "Potty people"!?
---
Is tranquil air not in Classic? It's not as good as Salv to be sure but it helps to have it in the Lock/Mage group especially when you hit Phase 5 content unless I'm misremembering. 
---
But with WF, Blood Fury and Zerk at higher phases or farm content it just has to beat BoK and BoS. Especially when you've got geared Fury and Combat raiders filling the raid. Interesting.
---
No one here is talking about concurrent players for a game that’s 3 days away. That makes no sense at all.
---
But I’m sure me saying this a second time you will still try to enforce something I have not said.
---
I’m praying to the old gods that you don’t have to experience traffic on your route home that day which would delay your times
---
yea this is on my playlist for things to watch on 2nd monitor while playing classic. good video
---
Yep, only the best of the best will be able to pull it off. The vast majority of rogues will be easy pickings for the average warrior.
---
Or do what we do, raid together.
---
I mean it's not that challenging a thing to do, but I don't know how good the streamer is so hard to say lol.
---
Top end guilds are aiming to clear before first reset.
---
Lol enchanting is not a good profession to level with
---
This was an edit of Kevin Jordan’s stream clipped last week done by Madseasonshow in the style of those old videos.

If I wait until right before launch I can save that dollar to buy more spicy nuggets from Wendy's
---
Ill never forget the first few weeks of WoW. People would tell others about random items they found (like..... green quality) and IIRC we couldnt even link them in chat. So people would say "oh man I found a 2str 2 stam axe!" and other people in chat would be like "hey! good for you! i'm doing this quest!" and it was just...... the happiest place ever.
---
I wish I could wipe the memories of the game from everyone's brain. Not the memories of playing, just the stats/items/numbers/dungeons/bosses, so everyone goes in fresh.
---
You need the dagger from the beast to start skinning epic skins.  Then you need the glove enchant to skin raid bosses.  The other useful skinning thing is devilsaur, which don't require 300, but whatever other mobs in ungoro require, 250? 225?  The wowhead professions guide is a good bookmark if you can't remember numbers.
---
Double whoooooosh

My best memories from Vanilla was logging in for the first time and going what do I do now. I had no wrong choices in that experience. If someone said hey did you see this egg that drops off etc I would go no write it down on my legal pad and go their later.
---
Westfall and Duskwood myself. I also loved Mulgore and Barrens, but I kind of got that out of my system on private servers, and my friends are playing Alliance so what can ya do. Teldrassil is also a pretty magical area I think.
---
Yeah, drink and then type it out imo.
---
But this addon literally doesn't impact players who don't use it, that's the difference.
---
LFD/LFR changed things because they worked as REPLACEMENTS for something
---
As a warrior I want to rush 40 asap for mortal strike or bloodlust. After that I don't care to much.
---
If it's peer-to-peer with chat as a way of networking, you could potentially really fuck with other people using it by modifying the addon to purposely confuse other clients.  Just throwing that out there.
---
Zug zug
---
because its a common frustration vector
---
Even though it just scans chat channels I think people are bothered because it removes the need for *some* social interaction through automation which is a huge complaint people have for modern WoW.
---
It isn't just about this addon, it's the slippery slope that can snowball over time as a result of this addon and others like it.
---
&gt; People just excited for the game and out of ideas?
---
Whats wrong with that? Not much to really talk about until next week anyway.
---
Yeah sure
---
why dont people just take Burning steppes entrance?
---
If it is similar to live, it opens up, and you run through a setup that takes a few minutes with a few options and boom, you are all set.
---
But kill the bastards anyway.
---
It will die slowly over time. Classic isn't really the game with the most 60 content to do. People will return whenever a new phase is out though.
---
I'd be surprised if classic holds the player base for 3 months since people are so used to retail now that going back to classic will be difficult for many.
---
I bought 3 copies of this version of WoW as there was a horde version to and there was no way of knowing which box you would get. I gave one to a friend and I still have both versions of it on my shelves to this day!
---
This is the best one by far, IMO. Jean-Claude nails it.
---
"Si tu m'cherche trop j'te transforme en sheep"
---
i mean, max level wow isn't really a grind. there are grindy elements like gathering professions, rep, etc., but it's mostly doing interesting things that are interesting and fun, like dungeons and pvp. osrs is almost pure grind, where the 1.5k hours of max efficiency are doing extremely repetitive, simple motions the entire time. there are unique elements in osrs too, like in wow, but if we're going to compare the classic wow grind to the osrs grind, osrs is clearly the grindier game, because it's just designed that way.
---
i know plenty of people with hundreds of days played on osrs. it takes most casual players 200 days played to max, since they aren't actually trying to get to max with the highest efficiency possible. for reference, i'm at like 28 days played and i'm only like 15% of the way to max in terms of xp needed.
---
Currently my plan is go skinning/mining until \~30 or 40 then switch skinning to BS. I plan on tanking, so Ornate Mithril  plate pieces around 40 will be a welcome distraction to the leveling grind and shield spikes will start getting more use with less item turn over.
---
Eventually I'll be going Hammersmith. I want to checkout the Masterwork Stormhammer and don't expect enough people to be going Hammersmith to easily find a crafter. Doesn't look to be much value to Hammersmith long term  but I don't have any plans past that. I figure it'll be at least 2-3 months after launch before I need to cross that bridge.
---
Worst advice on the forum
---
finding groups as a duo hunter/rogue may be harder.  Priest is defacto healer for dungeons, and that alone would get wife in group with you.  Also, benediction staff is coolest weapon in game :P  
---
if you do pvp, viper sting/mana drain is a pretty good combo.
---
You can probably find a guild to take you but you'll want to stand out as far as showing up consistently with full consumables and being on time. I'd start looking for a guild ASAP so you can secure your spot as the token Ret Paladin. If that fails you can always go 20 Holy and 31 Ret to heal in raids and play Ret outside of raiding.
---
Eh, I can and did say that. I don't think most bosses care.
---

---
I hope that’s actually the case because I don’t want to roll a class and then all of a sudden we have BC re-releasing and then we all have to adjust or reroll.
---
For example, I want to be a shadow priest but I know it’s not worth it in vanilla but post vanilla it is
---
So, this is probably just my opinion, but I think Hardcore is more reserved for the people fighting for server firsts and min/maxing absolutely everything. Semi-Hardcore is for those that Want to progress at a reasonable rate, but aren't going to dedicate their lives to the game. Week 1/2 Rag kill = Hardcore. Stepping foot into MC in week 6-8 is Semi-Hardcore. It certainly is still a commitment, but not no-lifing the game.
---
How does an addon using tradechat to communicate "kill trade chat"?
---
Agreed, and it only made BFA that much worse unfortunately.
---
Well the majority of the world would quickly consume something they don't like the taste of, rather than slowly consume it.
---
No servers will die. Blizzard will simply merge low pop servers if the pop gets too low.
---
Sheep, sap, freezing trap would all be good too.  Just depends on the group comp and the ability of the players.
---
Depending on how crappy the servers are Monday night that may actually happen.
---
My wife is gonna play. Problem solved
---
You sound like Holden Caulfield.
---
1-60 in vanilla took about the same time as 1-70 in TBC. When TBC was released the 1-60 leveling was nerfed. They reduced the amount of exp you needed, nerfed most elite quests to normal quests and added a couple quest hubs.
---
The mouse cant hope to hurt the cat either. The hunt is still fun. And yes, annoying people with anger management issues and watching them freak out is amusing. When I get ganked I laugh it off and move on.
---
Call me childish then, I guess.
---
“I was wrong but maybe if I double down...”
---
Hopefully we get a nice high population pvp server.
---
Not in classic.
---
You don't need to follow the guide 100%. Finish the questline if you want.
---
The thing about skeletons were that you knew when to prepare for ganks, it was strategic.
---
I LOVE Zouks. Reserved the name Mantzoukas on Herod, because why not? AND I see him perform regularly at UCB Theatre. Dude is next level.
---
&gt; Warrior(Tank)
---
Yeah I think every server had 'that' 5 shaman team lol. I remember running away from one in WoLk.
---
No tinfoil hat, this is all well documented.

---
No, TBC upped the exp gains, (and I believe reduced requirements? Don't quote me on that part). 1-60 is longer in vanilla than it was in TBC. Average should be ~10d.
---
Similar but slower. They turned up the XP values in certain level ranges for TBC but it wasn't like 5x higher or anything like that.
---
So booored! 😫🎟
---
I'm female. ;)
---
I wish some people thought of this part of the community before they start crying because "BUHUHUH YOU'LL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T PLAY THE GAME AS I WANT YOU TO" when I say I wanna rush to 60.
---
I think your assumption is based on incorrect information. You cannot do what you are assuming people are doing.
---
You can create 3 characters across all servers, not 3 per server.
---
You know what, you just might be. I think you should make a new post on the subreddit to let everyone know.
---
Zygor's Guide.
---
Yes.
---
Why couldn’t they just combine servers if necessary like they did in retail years ago? A. They can if enough folks leave and there is more than one of that type in the region (guessing here but surely...)
---
As an ex-GM, this is exactly the sort of person I tried to avoid recruiting.
---
If I could do it in middle school with the attention span of a gnat then anyone can do it.
---
Doubt it. While people will follow their favorite streamers there will still be tons of people that stay. And as blizzard has said, these servers are massive compared to vanilla standards. Even if half the population drops off, there will still be more people on those servers than there ever was in vanilla, and people in vanilla still got things done, so it will probably be fine.
---
Can't believe how close we are and how far away it feels at the same time.
---
IIRC dps actually had more consumables needed than healers, with tanks requiring the most prep. I was a resto druid and my brother was a rogue, we would farm consumables together yet he was always short on the required amount while I usually had extras.  
---
My best friend was a priest, and I still remember going into BRS to mind control the dudes for the fire resist buff when doing the second boss in BWL every time we wiped. Modern raids don't take that much prep time between attempts ever.
---
Sorry guys gotta delay release for 2 months to fix issue now
---
Not trying to bait you but "improvements" are exactly what most in this community are trying to avoid.
---
I have played emulated Vanilla since 2015 and raided 8 times in MC/Ony. I have made 7 lvl 60 and as many -40 and have somehow had fun. World PvP, dungeons, random BGs (my highest rank ever was 10), getting preraid bis (silly when u dont raid but its fun) just leveling randomly, farming gold. Fishing lol. Many things to keep u busy ;)
---
The biggest time sink is ofc leveling alts. If you enjoy that you can play for thousands of hours and never "need" to raid.
---
retail patch 17.4 around the corner
---
EK: Stranglethorn, Burning Steppes, Blackrock Mountain (?), Wetlands, The zone with the Black Portal.  
---
Kalimdor: Thousand Needles, Tanaris, Winterspring, Darkshore and Ashenvale, The Barrens, Orgrimmar.
---
Eh, I sure haven't played the game in years, but back in vanilla days, I seem to remember always being able to see the "next" zone that I should go to, but was always a few levels to low to survive there, so I feel like I always had an answer to that "what's next" question, it just usually meant grinding out a level or two before actually stepping over into the next level zone
---
Exactly, some healers often panic and start healing the split second damage is incoming. They waste half of the typical drinking phase.
---
As long as the group is in range, and they're aren't being absolutely melted by mobs, keep on drinking.
---
PServers pickpocket loot tables are not accurate.  I tested pickpocketing on the humanoid Scarlet mobs in Deathknell and they gave 1-2 copper a piece.  So Pickpocketing is definitely not lucrative early game, especially without distract to get the mobs facing away from you.
---
If you don't have thunderfury on your hunter you're a noob.
---
dude calm down. you have like 20 comments in this thread arguing with people about the add-on. I don't care how you play the game. You are free to use it. I was just agreeing with OP's comment that the add-on is something Ion specifically warns about in that video

Omg my heart was always racing when our group ran into that mountain. So many battles in there. So much drowning in lava.

I dont understand why people want to rush through this beautiful old game.
---
I recently wrote a guide on this.  I would recommend Manjaro over Ubuntu for a bit better performance and newer software.  However Ubuntu will run it just fine as well.  Simply follow the steps here until you get to the dependencies.  Once at the dependencies you can go to each website I have linked at the bottom and follow steps for Debian based distributions.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/colnzr/installing_classic_or_retail_wow_in_linux/
---
I might just go write a guide for all of the different Linux distros.  I keep seeing this question so frequently.
---
what % of players will complete Naxxramas this time?
---
I don't think this is completely true.
---
Many raiders had gear, but lacked PvP skills.  There is no Deadly Boss Mods for PvP, 
---
As a dedicated PvPer you can destroy many raiders, it's not until the very final stages of Raiding that Raiders had enough gear to overcome their lack of PvP skills.
---
Or in Vanilla...  Is he dying to crits?  Is he in grey gear?  :)
---
Popcorn time. just need raider.io and we are set!
---
/r/eatcheapandhealthy for ideas then /r/mealprepsunday so all you need to do is reheat.
---
Well, for starters there are no Horde flight paths for miles on that side.
---
Yes, I played vanilla many years ago and I never raided and plan to also to not raid this time around.  I just don't have the time to commit to that.  (So much time, stress, frustration if you continually wipe etc) Besides, I've always enjoyed pvp much more and as you mentioned, doing dungeons with friends is fun and can already be like an hour-long commitment.  That's enough to satisfy any PvE itch for me.
---
The struggle is real.
---
I think that will become less of a problem the further we go. Sure, you will see it in the beginning but the novelty wears off. At least, that I what I am hoping for.
---
I'm looking forward to a pre-cata world. Going to take my time, again.
---
Non-sarcastic time.  They actually just added the feature to let you choose your level, I think they are still working on a true progress save, but at least now you can jump back to where you were.
---
&gt; I like seeing people looking for group
---
It literally just visualizes the people looking for groups. There aren't any more or less groups being formed because of it and chat channels will still be booming.
---
I disagree about the no gear. Most hardcore groups I've heard are dungeon leveling so I think they will have very good gear actually. They may be low on gold though because they won't be making trips to vendor
---
They are 100% gonna add paid character transfers between realms of the same type you play. It's just a fact, And it will be a save for people worried about low pop realms in the future.
---
Also, A medium server today would be a locked server back in the day if i remember correctly.
---
Because those are the hardcores who are likely to become influential figures that will serve as weak role models in a very community-oriented game.
---
Mirage Raceway's Discord for example is so god damn chill I know this server's gonna be fucking great. It's why I knew there's no way I'm rolling on a PVP server. Game's about community, and PVP realms have the worst communities.
---

If you think about it, it's worse if they're Enchanters as well. They farm those innocent people, make their blood linen clothes and accessories, and then destroy them without a care to repeat their cold craft.
---
This is extremely violent and accurate. I love it.

Definitely go lower pop

---
This. Once I'm 40 and get my mount it's my goal to get one level a night. Now I am a bit of an addict so I would usually get my level and then think "well I'll just put in a little bit more..." and then 12 bars later I'd log off at 2:30am and hate myself.
---
But if you can do 1 level a night 40-57, you're making decent time. Past 55 it gets even slower so at that point just do what you can. But if you're 59, the rule is no sleep until 60. Rules are rules.
---
thanks thats like the 15th playlist i added to my spotify ... but hey i won't run out of good music while farming for the first weeks

A cat is hunting to eat and because of instinct and is very childish by human standards.
---
I'm not saying people who engage in world PvP are childish, I'm rolling on a PvP server because I think fair fights in world PvP in wow is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. It's super satisfying to be constantly tested in fights during your leveling experience and need to either learn to win or die all of the time. But neither party gets that thrill in a 20 level difference gank.
---
 But the idea of spending your free time leveling really fast so that you can go to lowbie areas and kill a bunch of players that can't hope to fight back is. Like if an adult that I worked with told me they did that I would lose a lot of professional respect for them.
---

I remember the instance from Blizzcon where the devs talked about how we didn't want Classic WoW. After watching this it has given me more of a perspective that they were looking at it more from a technical perspective. Sure there are bugs and things that are annoying, but the live service just lacks that magic that I think a few of these people expressed them feeling in this video.

just go for druid! druids were 'bad' early vanilla. by 1.12 they had been updated quite a bit. It took the playerbase until tbc to really start noticing the druid's potential (and they hadn't changed very much about them either between 1.12 and tbc). Play what you love! druids are very good at pvp, but like most classes, it takes practice and skill to be great.
---
they don't top dps meters, are decent healers, and can be really good tanks/off-tanks (usually not maintanks, although I'd argue they can do that quite well too).
---
They wouldnt count characters.
---
You can't play both at the same time, so why would the factor that into a servers population?

Reminds me of the old warlock bugs with control demon, man them were the days, 1000's dead in ogg.

Tales of the Past 3 by Martin Falch is the best piece of machinima I've ever seen. Hell, better than most movies I've ever seen.

Was thinking how cool it would be if someone redid the entirety of Azeroth in Unreal. I'm not saying Blizz should redo the game that way or anything - just that t would be cool for someone to do that like a pserver where people could ru around in it and explore a hyper realistic version of Azeroth. I recall some screenshots a couple months back of I *think* the Barrens? But anyways... Super cool - keep doing creating and honing your skills!

Not just noobs. Also the lazy bastards that know where to go, but would rather afk watching YouTube videos while you and another person run to the dungeon
---
Gametime is enough, it's exactly the same as a sub just without the need of activating/deactivating every time you take a break from the game.
---
That's why I've always been using gametime instead of a constant sub, since they added that option to their store (you also get the same discounts for purchasing multiple months at a time).
---
It can be helpful to have one on hand just to help with some stuck moments. Theres definitely a lot of sections of the 60 grind that can lag. Finishing all the quests in an area and not being able to start the next zone up, for example.

"it was just callled the barrens, there wasnt a northern and southern half" um what? just because it wasnt 2 seperate zones doesnt mean people didnt call it barrens and southern barrens

There won’t be many high level warriors. They are a pain to level pre 40s and most people will quit and/or reroll another class by then.

All I know is in TBH the common saying was 0-10 took 3 hours and 10-30 took 10 hours with no rested XP. After that, no clue. 
---
I don't remember if that was before or after the XP value change, or if that was even correct at all - just what I remember a lot of people saying.
---
Not so much retconing as the writers not knowing their own lore in retail. A common ocurance.

I got a boe wand drop while leveling a priest in the stress test and got more dopamine than I have in years.
---
Yeah I hate to say this man, and obviously my knowledge of the situation is next to nothing, but based on your description of the situation, it seems like you may be in an unhealthy relationship. It’s definitely a tough situation if your wife doesn’t have any hobbies or friends, because she most likely feels like you’re the only person there for her. It might be worth a shot trying to explain to her that you need time for yourself as well, and that you taking time for yourself does not mean that you don’t value her.

Yep, pretty much all pservers had this, only solution is to out level those early contested zones.
---
Leveling in dungeons only is going to be a challenge for five people with differing schedules. But assuming everyone levels exact the same strictly in dungeons this is fine. I am not sure how much mana you will save with clearcasting but my guess is getting into the ice tree ten levels earlier is going to be much more beneficial.

I leveled to 60 during patch 1.4 on a warlock on Bleeding Hollow with deep destruction.  The speed I got killing things with succubus out vastly outweighed the time spend with void walker or felhunter.  This was with worse wands than you will have available to you in 1.13, which may be why you don't want to level in destruction.  
---
The utility of having an instant shadow spell like shadowburn was able to win me a lot of fights in the world, and it scared off people that were close to winning.  Dropping their health quickly with an initial shadowburn + dot row put people on the defensive, and a lot of times I would kill people running away with my succubus and shadowburn.  I did have my void walker out, but it would be only when he learned a new grimoire rank.  His damage out put was low, and even with just light dots on a single mob and letting him face pull, if he had not learned a new spell within 2 levels he was useless to me.  Often times he was my sacrifice shield more than a tank in the mid levels.  Warlocks don't have many oh shit buttons but sacrifice was one of them.  
---
I remember grinding mobs a lot, because I loved spending soulshards and replenishing them.   I spent a lot of time trying each pet out when they learned new spells, and the succubus always won in efficient long term grind spots.

It's pronouned "BLOW-ME"
---
The only downside is that I'll be too busy playing the game to read them.
---
This add-on doesn't exclude players who don't use it.  Gear Score was bad because people who used Gear Score favored other players who used Gear Score.  No player is getting favored over another with this chat parser add-on.
---
Go shaman or paladin, you'll be happier healing at 60.
---
I'm not entirely sure, this is a good question. 
---
From an organizational standpoint, I guess it really comes down to how the guild leader wants to formulate the DKP system. 
---
I'll be forward and say that I have no late game wow experience, and very little guild management experience, though it is a topic of interest for me and my mind often wanders toward the subject of guild management. 
---
U/kaydenkross left a good reply about how to earn DKP as a guild member, I imagine that most hardcore guilds operated in a similar way - though it seems like quite a bit of spreadsheet work for the guildmaster. 
---
I think this is a topic that could use more discussion on the subreddit so that old guild masters can explain some management systems to newer guild masters and they can benchmark against each other to come up with a fair, widely accepted system of DKP. I feel like that should be attainable with ample discussion from the right minds.
---
Good thread. Helped me burn a few minutes until release.
---
I kinda look at it like playing in a band or orchestra. Some people just fucking sit there with their flute in their lap waiting for 'their part' (waiting for threat, hunters with tranq). Some people play the boring lines, dull repetitive cello parts (auto attacking dps like paladins, boring rotation mages/warlocks). Some have to really go nuts to do their part (feral druids, healers, tanks). I don't mind holding back when I think about it more like a team exercise, but I also really got hyped to play my instrument with other people. My part (first chair playing my ass off) would not have sounded half so badass if it hadn't been for all the other people in the group doing their part too, whatever that entailed.
---
FWIW I don't find threat a fun mechanic to deal with either, but I blame some modern thinking on that. If everyone expected that you couldn't keep threat on everything all the time, it'd be fine, but after 15 years of this game, it's hard to convince people that you're not shit-tier if you lose threat right away, and even the jokes about it just aren't funny because you're literally doing your best...it's just a mechanic people don't think is actually a mechanic. That mindset of "It's literally your job to have threat always!" has permeated even a lot of Classic mindsets.
---
Druids are actually great at farming in the world. You mass pull with moon fires or insect swarms, barkskin and hurricane. Very efficient.
---
You also have multiple dungeon farms you’re really good at. Druids have a lot of gold farming options

Yes. It should work like a breeze with the twitch app.
---
2.4 was the quest xp buff IIRC.
---
As a server we should come together with hundreds after they phase out layering and purposely die to spell out a naughty phrase to show blizz it is still possible and they should just give up and let us have our boney bois
---
I enjoyed most everything about Cataclysm, but I feel like they handled the zone changes incorrectly. I feel like they should have maintained the original zone layout/levels for players pre-Cata content, and then changed the zone after a certain quest line had been reached. I'm imagining having it done in the way that the did Gilneas as you progressed into your story. 
---
One minute you're fending off a Forsaken sea attack, then after reaching a certain point, you're struggling to survive in the new chaos created by Deathwing.
---
Servers open at 6pm EST and I work until 8 RIP me
---
This is 100% correct.
---
Recount/Details. Then DBM if you intend to raid. Things like swing timers or cast bars or CD timers are nice. 
---
Any UI like Bartender/Dominos, Aura/Unitframes stuff is totally unnecessary.
---
Quest trackers are totally cheating lol just play retail might as well get the LFG add-on not vanilla. Monkeyquest and Immersion makes the quests easier to read though.
---
They can change the functionality the addons rely upon, that's absolutely true, but this addon only relies on reading and writing in chat, is that really something you're willing to prevent *ALL* addons from doing in order to prevent others from using an addon that doesn't impact you?
---
noobkiller42069
---
I hope they keep sharding in until at least phase 9. I plan on leveling slowly and reading each quest text out loud to my dog.
---
Yamcha schools Piccolo in alt universe.
---
IDK why people always bring call to arms to attention, it really wasn't that popular.
---
This LFG addon might not be either, but considering how accessible everything is today there's definitely a higher chance that everyone uses it. It just makes up for a more efficient way to deal with spam/chat, but every little % adds up--especially if you consider other addons and how widespread in use they would get.
---
Some addons will only work well if others have them installed as well, this could lead to a slippery slope in some cases where certain annoyances/timesinks of vanilla are practically removed for all intents and purposes. In that case one might as well ask blizzard to intervene and implement their own 'feature'.
---
No. Any 5 mans have a low gear bar. No one was checking your gear, you just met at the instance.
---
In raids - maybe, but generally if it is a pug raid there will be an inspection outside the banks.
---
don't get me wrong, i love classic, but the circlejerk and false information on this sub is unbelievable.

The problem is if everyone starts using it, you will have to.

Excellent. This should take a few people out of my queue :)
---
Its just my  two cents but dont look at how your fiance plays or even your kid. When you create your first character and log into the world of warcraft, take your time to watch and listen to the cutscene. Learn who you are and why are you there, read the quests and get immersed into the WORLD of warcraft. Once you get familiar with what you are doing, you will slowly see that you want to get better in the game to explore more and learn more about this world you stepped into.   
---
Thats how it started for me all those years ago.
---
I mean post there instead of making a whole post just for you.
---
Hopefully he switches to Herod
---
its probably because everyone who played a rogue way back when is over it, I was a top tier rogue on my realm back in the day but I want to try something new.
---
It's mostly an efficiency decision. You face a hard constraint on the number of quests you can carry at a single time. Some quests have objectives that don't align with the locations other quests are completed or turned in, which imposes an efficiency cost in an optimized route, or would preclude you from picking up certain quests at times that would minimize your roundtrip travel cost later. Additionally, there are some quests that just plain suck.
---
Additionally, the argument that there aren't enough quests to get to sixty has no bearing at lower levels when you consider that there are multiple level spans from 10-40 where quests can gray out if you just did all of them.
---
Tldr: You're not making correct assumptions in your logic, but if you like doing quests for the sake of completion (while getting gray xp or otherwise not optimizing xp per hour), nothing is stopping you.
---
I need to unsub bc my hype levels are becoming unbearable
---
People creating characters early is also excellent information for Blizzard to have an idea of day 1 demand. If they hadn't, they wouldn't have known to add additional realms and day 1 would be even more of a cluster than it already will be.
---
&gt; I'm going to be constantly spamming taunt on CD.

Imagine having to use your abilities.  Yes, taunt the mob everyone is attacking.

To tank the other adds and bosses.

Ha, the capitalizations made me worry a bit! I love you &lt;3

Oh no someone is using an addon instead of spamming a macro!
---
I'm going to unsubscribe, delete all my characters, then remake them again 5 minutes before launch.

just pick whatever you want to play, no one can tell you what to do

Where does the money actually come from when you're an enchanter just tips? Or can you just charge flat rates for certain enchants that are rare?

They have that weird issue with some big shoulder pads where they clip through each other on your back. Not sure if they've fixed it.

I kind of want to see him go Herod to see this sub in flames
---
Not as a vanilla hybrid class. But that’s not what they’re there for. You can still be a god in some way shape or form. Vanilla isn’t about damage meters or parsing. 
---
People say druids are the weakest class in vanilla but they’re still great healers and great five man tanks.
---
I actually started late dec/very early jan of 07, right before tbc came out.

Definitely be a dad first, a spouse/co-parent second, and yourself third. I'm a father of two, a husband, and a gamer. It can be done, just make sure you have your priorities listed that way in your mind and you'll be fine. Self-care is an important part of being a good parent and if that means playing games for an hour or two when you can, so be it.

i think he looks like a mouse, his friend is hella dumb, they're both annoying af and i hope they have fun on whatever server they play on
---
you should probably narrow this down some lol as these all play very differently. you may wish to at least start by deciding how you want to play. DPS? Support? Heals? Melee? Ranged? Magic? Stealth? Pet class? A little of this, a little of that (hybrid)?
---
6pm est, it’s been stated almost everywhere
---
Man who cares, people are making such a big deal over these streamers. The only people who should even consider caring is if they’re going for world first something on their server.
---
I remade my 3 characters with different names and even chose a PvP server to narrow down my faction choice. 
---
Now, should I play my Horde Hunter, Shaman, or Druid first on Skeram?
---
We’re entering a new realm of post-irony
---
First time I fell asleep in my keyboard I think would cover it
---
Thanks for the reply! I was having some issues with Questie occasionally not displaying available/completed quests and objectives on the map. Guess I'll have to play around with it on launch. So close!
---
Farming trash doesn't take that long.
---
Regardless, you'd have 7 mages spending those 12 hours farming the rep if you want to do it the slow way.
---
This is why I'm not looking for a raiding guild until I hit 60. I have no idea when that will happen and I assume most guilds that have been recruiting won't have 40 players ready to go in a month or 2.
---
The problem us they run at full speed when almost dead and have a large aggro range making it very difficult to kill 1 at a time. 
---
It sucks chasing one down to kill and 2 or 3 more jump in to fight you.
---
I'm honestly kind of relieved to hear someone else say this. BC was my favorite expansion, but I thoroughly enjoyed Cata. Leveling has always been my favorite part of the game, when I quit the day before Pandaria released, I had 16 max level characters on 3 different servers. It was so much fun I just never got tired of it. So I was really excited when they changed up the whole world and added a bunch of new quests for me to play with! Plus the Cata heroic dungeons were a fucking blast. I mean come on, heroic Deadmines was about the coolest thing ever!! 
---
That said, I can understand why others didn't like the changes. A bunch of familiar, well loved content was removed and has never come back, which kind of sucks. I liked the changes, but I'm stupidly excited to see the old unchanged zones again too!
---
Not anymore.  Now you have one game.
---
Got my girlfriend an account and a subscription. Really looking forward to playing with her and sharing this part of my life.
---
I’ve been doing this all damn summer... Open game, play 5-10 minutes, close game, open different game, 5-10 minutes, close game, rinse repeat....
---
Only if you're into dicks
---
On the flip side, I kinda think Metzen might have misunderstood what that meant. Cataclysm was his idea because he literally thought the world was the main character, and that it being in danger/hurt would be exciting.
---
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the whole azeroth Titan thing was his idea as well and we're just now seeing it.
---
He's not just talking about the areas or peoples or immersion. He literally meant the world is the main character.
---
PS. I love Metzen, he's awesome and more passionate than anyone. But he also had his favorites in wow such as Thrall (green Jesus doing everything for years).
---
I've been playing through wc3 campaign and it's the only game that is holding my interest. It is making me crave classic like crazy, though.
---
The social interaction I had was actually doing the dungeon with people, finding out they were good, and adding them to my friends list because they were actually on my server and there was a very high chance I would see them again. not the 3.5 seconds it took to invite them...
---
Yeah...auto quest turn in is actually pretty fine I would say, LFG tool however just makes the community aspect of Vanilla go out the window.
---
Nah, they didn’t
---
I think Blizzard is on the record saying that addons that introduce features that Blizzard purposefully took out of Classic (like group finder addons) will be investigated and maybe even broken or banned if they need to be. Don't quote me on that though.
---
Holy shiiiiit there are some serious throwbacks in there.
---
name one.
---
This one post has single handedly killed two years of hype for me.
---
Agreed 100% 
---
I have no idea why people are freaking out about this, it truly is not a big deal. You still have to interact with your group and the only thing that will change is the time it takes to put groups together.
---
I can't wait to go to Ironforge and get 240fps instead of 5fps. I used to hate when I had to go to IF -- was sooooo lagggggggy.
---
Yeah, god forbid somebody ask you to use one of your abilities to help them out..
---
Ally always gets the best cities lol
---
People said the USA was bigoted, EU is cancerous in this thread
---
It was probably just that it was the character selection screen and doesn't render the same way the actual game does.
---
There is more to classic wow then raiding
---
I honestly don't care whether or not it's your "fault". I'm not your first grade teacher, life isn't fair, no solution will magically solve everyone's problems. Either you take their advice on switching servers and co-ordinate it with your buddies.. 3rd time's a charm? Or you stay and hope that you're more determined to get in than the people in front of you in line.
---
Let's not pretend that launching with more servers magically fixes all potential problems, it's like the layering debate - there is no perfect solution.
---
I just got my gf to play it and she's super addicted. She never plays games so it's like I'm playing for the first time again through her eyes
---
That's not how it works at all your going to have to haul your arse back to a main city to find another member or group.
---
350ms isn't really that bad. People have gotten gladiator with similar latency, not to mention how the latency was back in actual vanilla
---
Layering is fine now that they actually explained it to us in a lengthy blue post
---
Doesnt this have a built in gearscore checker? Saw someone saying the LFG addon says ilevel. Or was that something else.
---
I think the server situation is going to be a cluster on launch day. I think there will be a lot more people than expected, queues on all servers will be long. I think they will be spinning up several new servers on launch and people will be rushing to get on them as soon as they are available.
---
Blizzard has been wrong about the demand for Classic/Vanilla since day 1, "You think you do, but you don't". They think that everyone will quit the game in a few weeks. I think they are wrong.
---
We are almost there. Almost back home...
---
&gt;I have not seen anything about time frames for servers going live.
---
Have you been under a rock?
---
&gt; Are there any new or experienced parents out there that can give some advice on balancing a hobby like wow with being a new parent?
---
You will get a bunch of anecdotal tales of how you can do it, but you can't.  Each birth is different and there is no telling at this point what your personal experience will be.
---
Sure, babies have to sleep sometime, but you do too.  So does your partner.  And you will also need to be more aware of her needs postpartum as she will still be a mess of hormones and emotion (be on the look out for sign of postpartum depression).
---
WoW is just a video game, it really isn't important.  Take the next 6 months to adjust to your new life and the new life you have brought into the world.  
---
When you become a parent your wants and needs become secondary.  As a father you will go without just to enure that your child has everything they need.  Your wife will still buy shoes and handbags and when you say that you need something she will reply that the kids needs new [insert something here] so can it wait, but the next day a box will arrive from QVC with some bullshit in, but you will persevere to ensure that your child has what they need.
---
And at some point in the future you will catch a break and everything will have settled down and you will be able to fire up WoW and plonk your kid on your lap and play while they are mesmerized by the bright colors.  and you wife will see you spending time with your kid and if you get lucky she will smile and just maybe not nag you today.
---
If you really cant pick favourite between such different classes..
---
then I would really suggest you try multiple and jump between them until you have a better feel for what you prefer.
---
You do not have to rush 1 character if you are not confident it is the right choice. Would say that is bad idea. Better to bring multiples up to low/mid level and go from there.
---
LOL You're 100% right! If anyone doesn't have to manually type and click the same number of times as me to make a 5 man party, I'M FUCKING DONEZO and this game is DEAD. ^((which is why the game died right after patch 3.3 and hasn't been successful since))
---
jfc this is dramatic

it's not about what addon OP chooses to use. He clearly states the addon needs to be removed.

&lt;Gonzos&gt; | NA | Alliance | Hardcore | Loot Council | Herod-EST-PvP
---
The Gonzos will be an Alliance WoW Classic semi-hardcore guild looking to complete all available content in PVE and PVP. The core of our guild is made up of players that have played with each other since Vanilla. We have rank 13/14, multi-glad/rank 1 pvpers and server first raid experienced players. Currently recruiting all PVE spec'd classes and try-hard PVPers.
---
Server:Herod-PVP, Alliance (This is subject to change depending on how trash the Que times will be in the first week)
---
Raid Days: We are still deciding, probably will pick two days from Thursday-Sunday.
---
Raid times: between 9 PM - 12 AM EST. (Raid days and times are subject to change).
---
Loot: Loot council
---
Attendance: All aspiring raiders will be expected to attend the majority of raids.
---
Buffs/Consumables: All class consumables/buffs for min-maxing are preferred
---

---
No one wants to play with their fanboys.
---
It comes from experience
---
Later yeah, but even the blue pvp set will be competitive for 3 phases.
---
LOL.  
---
I was going for fun but same difference.
---
Honestly, I'll probably use the LFG addons. The thing I'm legit going to hate is taking 45 minutes just to put the fucking group together.
---
With the balance changes that came with tbc classes were much more powerful while leveling which made it easier.
---
What? It's a PST PVP server. What are you talking about?
---
they do share asset files, go look into your data folder. The classic required files are a lot less though. When I uninstalled retail it still retained ~50Gigs of files. A fresh Classic with no previous retail looks to be far less.
---
lol 90% of this sub didn’t play vanilla or private servers and have no idea what they’re doing.
---
you mean when they can't even get in the queue, as per the blue posts
---
Move to the US.
---
"No honey, it could be any computer."
---
Looking at healing (horde side) . 
---
I used to main a druid back in the day and not quite sold on shammy and priest. 
---
Being casual though would druid be a good choice on getting into groups. 
---
Pretty lost on what to go with.
---
Yea the hurt reminded me of one time I was out questing, and there was a horde (I was alliance) dude in the area and we peacefully left each other alone so we could get our stuff done.
---
Then some dumb Paladin just shows up and starts fighting him. I wanted to protect the horde dude because he was cool but there's not much I can do in that position. Does that make me a traitor? :(
---
Now don't pay any attention to that. Lok'tar, friend! Zug zug!
---
The way back takes like 5 min of your life, maybe even more.
---
delete this garbage
---
Admit it, OP made you feel like a soulless idiot using your leveling guide and you're just feeling self-conscious.
---
I knew plenty of people, myself included who used call to arms or vqueue. All it does is scrape general channels for people lfg. It just organizes things easier and removes general chat or spam
---
Pulling quickly is a useful skill.  Failing to drink and conserve mana is not.
---
I've played both tank and healer.  If you drink the moment combat ends and use mana efficient spells your tank is going to have a real tough time pulling faster than you can handle.
---
Looking at OP's post history, it doesn't appear he's reposting this at all. I think you're intentionally missing the point that you're aimlessly critiquing hundreds of thousands of people as if they are one entity. Just because you've encountered an idea repeatedly doesn't mean everyone else has. Just because you no-life this sub, doesn't mean everyone else does.
---
 It'll be like thousands of spouses will have suddenly picked up a crack addiction in unison.  Thankfully I'm single so I have no one to judge me.
---
People are in for a rude awakening indeed, nostalgia is strong though!
---
But i see LOTS of people doing that he just sort of accepts it and doesn't say a word unless its a big amount? like classic gold has value. a lot of value mainly for mounts.
---
Hahahaha NotLikeThis
---
Horde has better flightpaths to Diremaul, ZG, AQ40 and Naxx and can quickly hop continents right from the main cities instead of having to fly to a random port village. The only advantage alliance has in terms of flightpaths is faster access to Blackrock instances, which doesn't really matter, as both factions will land on Thorium anyway and the real issue with Blackrock is PvP, not travel time.
---
You can really feel the motion in the human's swing. Top notch work.
---
Using curse of recklessness will suppress fear so if the mob is running towards another group you can put that up and then put up a different curse once it's back closer to the party.
---
I have the exact same problem. Count me in
---
That's fair
---
To the front page!!!
---
Oh shit...I hadn't even considered re-watching the guild to pass the time until launch.  Thanks for the idea!
---
how does faction work, is it imbalanced by that percent?
---
I think many people will be switching server on release day due to the queues
---
The thing is, the guild is a brand new guild for Classic. Everyone that has joined that wants to raid, joined knowing this. Getting 40 dedicated raiders from a pre-established group is probably a lot more difficult than recruiting 40 dedicated raiders.
---
I was focusing on the video so hard didn’t even notice that:D
---
Did they speed up leveling when TBC came out? I started playing a few weeks before it dropped and I never came close to burning out during the leveling process, though I can't remember how long it took me to go 1-70. I genuinely enjoyed the experience, but should I be bracing myself for something that's way more difficult than I remember?
---
Is this a good time to jump in as a total noob to the series?
---
I hope it doesnt, gearscore literally means nothing in classic because BiS items can start at like level 40
---
Did it get better? I was in one that was pure cancer. It got closed and a new one was opened but ugh. I haven't bothered checking it out.
---
Anymore? Did it ever in vanilla?
---
I stayed up all night planning out my toons and their professions. i regret nothing.
---
I'm hoping I'll sleep away most of the next 3 days.
---
Skeletons .... FFFF
---
Say hiii dude
---
I take it you'll be starting a new job Wednesday?
---
lokth, the peoples champion
---
For a little more explanation, the various balance values are calculated by taking the highest percentage in a category, and subtracting the lowest. 
---
For example, Herod has 42.39% alliance, and 57.61% horde. Subtracting those gives Herod's Faction Balance score of 15.22.
---
Totaling these values gives an approximate way to see how balanced a server is overall in interest. If a given server had a perfect balance of pvp, pve, alliance, horde, and casual/semi/hardcore, you'd see a value of 0 on the screenshot.
---
That's cool but it has one problem.
---
The problem is that Browser window is on top of the game. Making it not click through.
---
If you open your 5 bags, they will be under the window and you can't click them.
---
If you change the window somewhere else, you will be blocking some other UI parts of the screen.
---
Maybe max 2 items per person?
---
Then don't. Aside from Bgs there are no systems in classic that will force you into group with players that you did not choose. It's not hard.
---
I dont get it?
---
I dunno. 
---
I think the population will be larger then as anticipated. I am sure there are a lot of crazies, like me, who are excited to play WoW long term again but doesn't give a darn toot about reserving a specific name.
---
 I am pretty sure I will be able to use one of many character names I'd be satisfied playing as (not Thex).
---
 Plus, I am cheap and going to wait until the last possible minute to resub and start forking over $15 a month.
---
I plan on playing a Shaman and my friend is going to be playing a mage. Would ele or enhance pair better with the mage?
---
If this is your idea of social interaction, you're a social rtard. The addon doesn't change anything. You still have to run to the dungeon and talk strategy as opposed to pulling the entire dungeon and cleaving it down.
---
Wtf is osrs
---
Everytime I convince myself otherwise, my heart screams "fuck it, warrior will be".
---
I fucking love plate and axes
---
hardcore
---
My group also just switched. We prefer a playable game on launch day :)
---
These servers are massive compared to vanilla. Community isn't going to be as big a factor as people think it is.
---
I just like the thin black bar at the top that can show you quickly things like gold amount, durability, etc.
---
Engineering (head) and tailoring (chest) are bis until after bwl
---
yikes
---
Well, good thing you didnt get one then? :)
---
These are all lvl 1 characters. Only a fraction will make it to level 60.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHO!
---
I feel like such a dork but having listened to this podcast from nearly the first episode, I got goosebumps listening to this intro.
---
well leaving/ragequitting is less prevalent in classic simply because just getting the group and getting everyone to the dungeon is an adventure in itself. Could you imagine hiking your ass to SM as an alliance character only to turn around and run back because you wiped a couple times?
---
people with the mentality you are talking about wont make it past lvl 30 before they burn out man
---
I drink immediately but that's often not enough to keep up with a bad tank/dps.   One of my pet peeves as a healer is pugging something like ZF and having just a dumbass group with no coordination.   Everyone is on different targets, no CC, no LOS-ing casters.   Now, as a seasoned vet, I can keep everyone alive, but I have to heal my ass off, use cooldowns and drink way more than I should have to.   This leads to everyone thinking they are crushing it, when in reality  if they had a similarly skilled healer they would have wiped repeatedly.   I remember one run in particular where the rogue kept calling for might instead of salv.   I told him when he started attacking the tanks target i'd switch.... he never got might.   I know most ppl here are not these kinds of players, but they will exist in classic.
---
In this thread we have OP not understanding basic common sense. 
---
Don’t use the addon if you don’t want to - but this addon doesn’t hurt anything. It doesn’t teleport you to the dungeon causing no reason to leave the capital city. 
---
Use your brain dumbass
---
This needs to die. Fast.
---
Ok, so Shazzrah is the server for cunts... Got it...
---
Its basically a movie. And thats ok imo
---
It will happen, someone asshole will do it regardless
---
when people are making posts saying "just move". That's guilt tripping. "We're gonna have queues cause you people are stubborn". That's also guilt tripping. Punished in the sense that we did everything right and now apparently it was all wrong. Early sign ups was supposed to alleviate launch and now it turns out that was a bad idea and we have to scramble to the least populated server.
---
I sometimes wonder if they made Desolace depressing on purpose.
---
A repost means you're taking content that has already been posted to a sub, and posting it again, regardless of who posted it first.
---
Saying the same thing 1,000 times with slightly different wording is essentially reposting.
---
Theres literally nothing to feel bad about other then my graphics card when it comes to my life
---
What the fuck is this
---
Level as frost to streamline your experience.  This will allow some aoes while also offering support in PvP gank situations.  Mages can actually escape high level players trying to gank them, using Nova, poly, blink, mounts etc.    It's fully recommended to level as a PvP spec on a PvP server.
---
I just posted a brief explanation that should help explain. :)
---
cause you had to travel to the city and try again in chat not sit in dung wait for automation to make things better
---
Wrong. There will be tons 60 in week two with professions partly leveled AND with enough gear to farm bis.
---
People forget that the old school launch isn't applicable. A huge portion of the community has practice vanilla launches now for a decade
---
Explain what goes into "balance". 
---
Also another cool metric is looking at faction balance for those who prioritize PvP. For example, the #GROBMOB is 51/49 A:H overall but 49/51 A:H for PvP.
---
I instantly heard the Maul-to-the-head **CRONCH** sound from Mordhau in my head after seeing this.
---
That's correct, there are some issues with this. The right side of your screen will be taken up a bit.  You do have the option to make the window click-throughable, but then it isn't scrollable.
---
I've used addons to move UI elements that would be blocked by this to another part of the screen.
---
The English speaking community is filled with whiny toxic trolls, it takes a bit of sense to realise they are not the majority to say every single player is like that. 
---
Being blessed with speaking English since birth, it's clear to anyone.
---
LOL. that's not true at all.
---
I know, I said I was rolling a disc priest.
---
My fav one: the [Toyota commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc)
---
yeah but retail sucks tho
---
True, but I like to account for the extra time for when I can't play as much as expected or not at all. My job can sometimes eat up chunks of my free time, so I have to account for that somehow. If I don't really run into anything that takes away from me playing, I'll just hit 60 before I planned and lose nothing really.
---
Speed isn't the issue, it's sheer amount of enemies. Run Ragefire Chasm on live and it's idiotic how large you can make single pulls, in classic it's a lot harder to do that.
---
Breeding grounds...
---
Pretty sweet! Make more
---
Because you don’t ever interact with anyone ever because the game is a joke.....
---
If you need someone to talk too send me a DM I understand you’re in a dark place.
---
That’s what I said in a clunky way.
---
I don't care cause I play on EU B)
---
yeah i would consider that semi-hardcore still. I wasn't denying that. You even said "hoping" to be raiding 6-8 weeks. And i was saying it's the people the "require" it that i wouldn't consider semi-hardcore.
---
Should I start that way? Or is it better to go gathering profs at the beginning to make money and later go engineering and tailoring?
---
It's already two sentences and most people seem to get the joke. I think people taking it seriously maybe just need to lighten up.
---
Hyperbolic title!
---
We should take bets what level asmongold makes it to without getting ganked.
---
auto invites
---
 I have not ran into this. Most just want their weekly 10 done. And now since raider.io tracks completion even if you don’t beat the timer more people stick it out. In the past 3 weeks I’ve had one group rage quit. I’ve had more 50+ death runs then people rage quitting.
---
You don’t have to. If someone in the group is an idiot, kick them, relist group and wait for the automatic matchmaking to add another dude.
---
Oof. So fiesty! I like it. Don't be shy, tell us how you really feel!!
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
Better yet, implement the suggestion someone brought up before and make skeletons have randomized rotation and nudge them a couple yards in a random direction, so you can't predict how they'll appear. Make it just imprecise enough so that we can't have anyone spamming swastikas on the ground or whatever.
---
Jesus christ, "weaponized autism" will never not make me chuckle.
---
Ill use questie
---
saves me a lot of alt tabbing
---
herbalism  and alchemy. Because I plan to just keep those as my professions and it'll be easier to level them as I play.
---
I suppose if he's using conventional means and everyone else is violating the #nochanges principle, it leaves him with less options.
---
Check the stickied thread. Second from the top of this subreddit.
---
I agree with you. This add on (if what I read here is true) will make the wait for a group much shorter, but you still need to travel to the instance and then in the dungeon you're gonna need to talk to your group.
---
Playing casual with my girlfriend, guide grinding when she’s not around.
---
1. This just takes away data they need to correctly gauge server populations.
---
2. Everyone will just make new characters on whatever server the community deems that region's main pvp server. Except now they'll lose their reserved names in the process.
---
The only real solution is for people to bite the bullet and move off the overpopulated servers or be prepared to wait in queue.
---
Them. Cost has always been reagent + tip .
---
Got venmo or cashapp, brother Horde? :)
---
It takes 1.5k to max a single character while being as efficient as possible, which isn’t the case for 95% for players. Also is not sustainable for 1.5k hrs
---
The same could say how many leveling guides do we need to see for a 15 year old game.
---
Mage PvP isn’t that skill intensive.  You can stretch the ceiling for sure - but the reliable damage, easy defensive options, and reliable CC make the class very straight forward. 
---
Not every raider is a monkey.
---
I do agree - raiding isn’t that time intensive till AQ and beyond
---
It. Is. A. Joke. I. Am. Not. Serious. About. People. Posting. Once. Every. Hour.
---
Vending. Or pretty much anything other than “Frostitute”.
---
You have plenty of time. Naxx is probably cleared in 2 years from now on
---
Anyone with a solid minimap addon ? Changing size/model
---
If you're going to answer with an option he's not even considering you better make a damn good case for it.
---
No part of the comment you responded to had anything to do with SJWs, implicit or otherwise. Of course people were negative towards you. You intended an insult and it was completely irrelevant. Nobody in this thread, possibly nobody on this subreddit is talking about SJWs right now except you. Clearly it's a preoccupation of yours.
---
You can absolutely take issue with their decision to declare the culprits "incels," etc., but "SJW buzzwords" they are not. The irony is that you are the one who defaulted to buzzwords.
---
Yeah, I'm aware lol. I'm one of the gankers. It was a joke.
---
Reddit is just a contrarian fuck
---
Nah... they should just do what they are doing and let servers like herod have 8 hour queues. 
---
If people don't leave after not being able to play opening night... they deserve to wait in the queues.
---
It's not in the spirit of Vanilla. Go back to retail if you want to promote this garbage.
---
Mage is:)
---
I figure it's a nice starting range and most players struggle to level professions in a profitable manner.  I plan to add higher level versions at a later time for each profession once all the 1-150 guides are complete (Blacksmithing is the last to do).  
---
Feel free to subscribe to our mailing list to receive updates on our guides :)

Oh sh..t, LFG addon? in classic?

Downloading...
---
omg omg omg guys im so hyped i cant even talk im shaking omg omg omg omg guys support me on patreon omg im so hyped im so excited omg omg
---
You think you are, but you actually aren't.
---
Lol, I mean, capitalism is the best form of economy humanity has ever figured out for literally all levels of socio-economics it runs under.
---
If you read the post, then you would know that I suggested they also take away name reservations when the server reaches full status.
---
"Two Faction Feud"
---
One thing to note is that 16 debuff slot will in at launch, so more than likely raids will start bringing 1 shadow priest right away.  It might not seem like much, but compared to retail vanilla I think it will lead to a lot more raiding shadow priests
---
its entirely pointless, rude, discriminating and absolutely uncalled for
---
That makes it even worse
---
Awesome idea!
---
Damn you jinxed me. Fuck!
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
What part(s) of the TOS is he breaking?
---
me fail engrish?
---
That one was better.  2x points for dissapointment pun.
---
Wasn't something like this added officially to the game in Burning Crusade and no one even used it?
---
Generally, there are quests that direct you to the next hub. You can find them without any guides. Try to stay in zones that are specific to your level and you will be fine.
---
Classic isn't black and white. There are more variables to consider.
---
Here's my take on it - I leveled a few characters on each side already to 60 without guides. It was great. Discovering the world is awesome and exploring new places and finding random quest givers organically is an irreplaceable experience.
---
But now, I want to know everything the game has to offer. I want to dig into all the hidden, weird, out of the way stuff. It may be inorganic, but it's better than never experiencing them at all.
---
To be honest, I'd kill for a guide that was more like a tourist guide and less of a leveling guide. Pointing out elements nearby that relate to Lore, explaining references hidden in NPC names, pointing me in the direction of obscure quest givers without giving too much information that would spoil the experience. As far as I know, that doesn't exist, so I'll take what I can get.

Cool, thank you for responding! I’m in the same boat as the people whose SO does NOT understand 😄 that’s why I was curious to know if you were a girl, because if you were a guy that would not be unusual - I knew a gay couple (who aren’t together anymore) where one was really into WoW and the other one was much more casual and only played because his boyfriend played.
---
Can somebody explain this to me like I’m 41?
---
Casseroles.
---
Didn't you literally post this a couple hours ago, but with a bunch of incorrect info as well?
---
The ideas are still bad even if you cut out the stuff that was blatantly wrong.
---
Thats the life of normies.
---
"Is the Eye of Sulphuras? Yes
---
Is guild facist? No.
---
It is definitely a hunter weapon."
---
I don't follow.
---
I like "Two Faction Feud" for a bit of alliteration.
---
edit: or "Two Continents"
---
Agree perception was super strong in BC due to arenas (much smaller pvp area) but outside dueling in vanilla and situational BG scenarios it wasn't as strong  Ifelt..
---
You might be looking at an old cached version of the guide from the stress test. A force refresh (ctrl+F5) should correct any cache issue.  
---
If there's no cache issue then just keep clicking Next Step and the guide will continue to the next chapter.
---
r/averageredditor
---
They already said how they're going to do it. With server transfers. They're going to let everyone get sick of it and then make a new server and give you free transfers.
---
Sorry, Bachelor party this weekend. Shenanigans will be had.
---
If I dont make it, enjoy Classic twice as much for me!
---
It gets really annoying after a while. Every time I would enter a city I would start getting messages. The messages were less frequent when I wasn't in a city, but they still happened.
---
Ain't no thang. You get used to it pretty quickly with any disease or disorder that isn't visually apparent. People will be an asshole about it, but back right down when you call them out. 
---
At this point the petty side of me actually enjoys seeing them squirm. It actually bothered me for maybe 30 seconds, he's gonna feel like shit all day now.
---
have sex
---
Dwarf is better for that.
---
&gt; People who use this addon will stop looking at chats for grouping 
---
The addon scrapes the chat and lists any group it finds in the addon. 
---
The addon also posts to any public channel you choose when you list your group so people without the addon can find the group.
---
Biggest problem will be picturing them doing my mom...she's 62 now.
---
“If I take a break from retail for two seasons suddenly I’m a noob”
---
Because you are. If you skip uldir and BoD and came back for EP, you would be considered a noob. You’re ilvl is bad. You have no experience with any of the affixes. You’re 8 months behind in content. You have no raid experience. No neck level. No gear. No Azerite. 
---
But sure. I bet in classic if you take a break for 8 months you won’t fall behind right? Because classic good retail bad?
---
Find something heavy to place on your W key hahahaha
---
I really like this but it'd be nice to see this broken down by different levels of gear too.  Part of the problem with meme specs is they don't scale well with better gear.
---
Had a serious talk with my wife. Had to let her know how I could get around classic. I gotta try to limit myself this time around.
---
They said streamers would ruin classic. Then the addon developers attacked. I think this is specifically from icy veins shame on them. This goes against the entire spirit of classic.
---
Tell me about it. I only managed 10/25 player normal lol. IDK if she's still this good at WOW though lul.
---
This is what I keep telling myself as someone who put in a request for time off months in advance only to get it rejected. FML bring on the 10k ques! I'm salty as hell.
---
What about [Call To Arms](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/)? Hashtag no changes, right melts?
---
The full 1-60 guide for every race is live on the site. You might be looking at an old cached version of the guide from the  stress test. A force refresh (ctrl+F5) should correct any cache issue.  
---
How do you think 1/3 of the playerbase (according to the survey) can reach 60 within 3 weeks, if not like that? /s
---
Seriously though. I'm pretty sure those are the 1/3 that never played vanilla before. Oh boy, they're in for a big surprise :)
---
Where's that "Blizzard knows more then we do" post when we need it, amirite?
---
Yeah . That made no sense. Sorry bud.
---
I'd like to do it this way but I fear it'd take me 1-2 years to get to 60 doing this. By then, too many people will have moved on.
---
DEA read quests?!
---
Definitely playing a rogue. I'm not sure what I want to do for professions though. Leather working for gear? Herb alchemy for consumes and money? Mining and engineering for utility? My brain cant pick one.
---
Already broke the first rule.
---
He makes more as a streamer than whatever shitty career he was going to go to community clown college for so he’s honestly not as dumb as you think.
---
Also, the resolution of the text in the language tab is super low.
---
It's undeniable that the world would be a better place without some people in it. You don't think Jews go around wishing Hitler had killed himself years before he took power in Germany?
---
Escape artist really can make a difference in PVP. If you don't care about PVP, go human. But, if you don't really, really stand the idea of being a gnome, just play human or you won't be happy.
---
if i had a crockpot i would be using it everyday
---
they arnt talking about people rolling on high pop servers. only full servers. Maybe learn to read you moron? And once they are all full, blizz will open more, JUST like they have been doing. Keep qqing tho little boy, im sure it will be all ok.
---
4 or 5 lol
---
Yes, I'm also a black white supremacist you idiot
---
I dont think too much of it.  I do plan on joining whichever server he ends up on though.  He reminds me of the ceo of my corp in eve.  He amuses me.  And all these streamers and youtubers are bullshit acts that feed off each other.  Remember its all bs and enjoy.
---
Honestly if you're not shadow, it's probably a better idea to try to outlast any other caster by burning their mana out, if you happen to find yourself in a 1v1 with a caster as a healer.
---
But yeah if you're shadow, it's obviously much more time efficient just to try and kill them normally.
---
[Also yeah](/u/Cantaloupe_Counter), definitely paladins because their damage is extremely mana efficient but also rather slow paced. You'll have time to cast and you'll most likely be forced to work through their mana bar before they'll go down anyway.
---
Is this Doug Dimadome? Owner of the Dimsdale Dimadome?
---
Did you even play vanilla? Because it seems like you didn't play vanilla.
---
That means 5 months to farm gold.. farm bis.. dominate wpvp.. can still have fun and get advantages from it. I enjoy the leveling process myself, but if I power level myself (not paying someone else) on my main to 60 then enjoy leveling my alts I would not be upset.
---
Maybe he's thinking bigger than himself. If the add on gets massively popular it would most likely have a similar effect as Dungeonfinder added in WotLK. Meaning people stop talking to each other, because there's no need to.
---
chicken and taters are out! Chicken casserole is in. Thanks!
---
Only if you go Holy and dps those health bars up to full.....  That's MY form of DPS.
---
Honestly you probably have it best! Most of us will get the nostalgia of course, but nothing can compare to experiencing it for the first time.
---
You'll be asleep for at least 1/4 of those hours, so that's a positive.
---
[Auto-invite](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4171-AutoInvite.html#info) and [LFG](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4020-CallToArmsLFGAddOn.html) in vanilla.
---
You're still gonna be forced to be social during the trip and dungeon.   
---
Groups being easy to make doesn't change that.
---
/laugh
---
They're ruining everything.
---
Glad this derp post has zero upvotes. Had lost faith with all the skeleton change defenders.
---
&gt;Isn't this sort of a unique scenario thought?
---
Unfortunately, no, it is not. It happens every day in real life and in-game. There are so many men out there that think they can "convert" a lesbian. 
---
Having an LGBTQ+ oriented server increases the population of people that intolerant of racism/sexism/homophobia, and it makes it easier to find more like-minded players. It's not about closing ourselves off but rather saying "ALL are welcome here".
---
First mythic and gladiator set in WoD was good
---
99 hours and 30 minutes as of 12:30 PM MDT
---
Does this really matter to people?
---
Oof
---
Except shadowstrike
---
Damn that is well read and informative. Crazy blast from the past. 
---
When I played the top Alliance guilds were Raiding Rainbow, Inertia, and Poseido (shout out Volarun). 
---
That was a great server - do you remember troll patrol guild, namely “Swifty”?
---
One game to bind them
---
The Horde flight path is even closer than the Alliance flight path...
---
It's a toss up for PvE. Most people would say Gnomes because of the +5% Int but for leveling the Human's +5% Spirit is undervalued. Spirit helps with downtime because it increase both your health and mana regen.
---
So for leveling Humans have the edge and at level 60 Gnomes have it, both by a hair.
---
If people are going to quit the game entirely (which is what I took your usage of the word 'quit' to mean) because of big queues on day one of launch they probably weren't goig to stick around very long anyways
---
But thanks for your consideration
---
&gt; Literally nobody levels destro.
---
Hey I leveled from 0-60 as destro in 2006 when i knew nothing about the game!
---
You guys married your moms???
---
Good to know, thanks for the answer. Hope ya have a fun launch next week.
---
ILVL is a terrible system but something like a smart GS would be amazing for gear optimization no joke.
---
Winterspring
---
But LFR/G isn't limiting your interactions with people. The actual gameplay does. That you run a dungeon without downtime, fast paced clearing and fast paced gameplay is what leads to people not talking. 
---
A tool to group isn't limiting your interactions....
---
thats actually really cool
---
Man that axe is vendor trash
---
If were gonna start splitting hairs here no addons are really in the spirit of Vanilla. How can you call it vanilla if you're modifying it at all?
---
Besides, all this add on does is scan the dumpster fire that is city chat for serious group mates.
---
The big problem with LFG was the instant grouping with cross realm strangers and instant teleporting to the dungeon. You put in no effort and because of cross realm groups, your behavior had no impact like it does in Classic.
---
Personally I don't see this add on as a big deal, even though I won't be using it myself.
---
The funny thing is that this add-on wouldve been possible in vanilla.
---
Who was the Affliction Lock that use to do good vid's back then? He had an opening scene where he rises from the grave and did a lot of 1vXs? I went Affliction because of that and loved it.
---
Edit: had the 1 v many backwards
---
These types of addons existed in vanilla.  They weren't that popular, but things like Call to Arms did the same thing.
---
Sure, but depending on the dungeon that's not exactly difficult. Even then a mere [3 months later they added the same functionality to innkeepers, making it even more accessible](https://web.archive.org/web/20060521200014/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com:80/patchnotes/patch-05-06-07.html).
---
But at that point how do you plan on making any gold? Just by selling extra herbs you have gathered?
---
No judgment here... you are among friends
---
That's a classic.
---
&gt; It is my further expectation that if Blizzard has plans to do a final reboot of the servers prior to full release, it will likely happen well before 3PM PST. My guess will be probably in the AM, on the 26th, PST.
---
The entire point of a "reboot" would be to basically reset the queue line, so it doesn't make any sense to have it half a day before the servers go live.
---
While I'll be on a pve server, I love battleground pvp, so I'll be happy if I'm 60 when battlegrounds open up.  Young kid, wife, job means probably not a whole lot of raiding, but I'll have time each night to do some pvp.
---
It's Vanilla, its pretty easy to figure out what gear you need.
---
I retired my priest in my favorite spot from vanilla. Dusted off the T2 and Anathema, it's been a while.
---
Yes, we all know. This has been posted a dozen times
---
Or she just doesn't realize what you're actually talking about doing. Also there's no such thing as the one.
---
I really want that c’thun eye marble, Blizz please sell on store thanks.
---
Gold seller sites got written with dead body's, not the sleletons. Also gold sellers used hacks to form these words and I dont think there are hacks like that anymore.
---
We AND blizz vouched for #nochanges, so giving us our skeletons backs would be nice.
---
Oh gosh, it's been so long. Let me see if I can remember the specific names. LazyPig and others like it could auto-accept group invites. I remember using something similiar to this app to call attention to LFG posts in chat, but it didn't have a GUI like this. I'll edit this if I can find the specific name for it. Obviously combat parsers existed back then and parsed your combat logs to form the data. I know some people use chat filter addons to only show the keywords they were looking for.  
---
EDIT: CallToArms and vQueue were two.
---
Awesome!
---
What makes you think people won't group together anymore? If this invites people and ports them to the instance it's one thing, but a reliable group with no quitters or ninjas still is a big incentive
---
35 year old senior med device engineer father of 1 another on the way, and im going all out baby!
---
Are there any benefits to logging in the first few weeks? Like in-game launch events or rewards? I’ve been planning on giving it a week or two but don’t want to miss out...
---
Gihv dat man hez bonus points.
---
Bro, you're forgetting the fact that WE HAVEN'T RUN THIS SHIT IN 15 YEARS. 
---
Just because you and I know shortcuts doesn't mean that the majority of people will. I don't understand why this is such a hard concept to understand - people are dumb. The fact that you can wipe in LFR is just proof of how lazy/stupid people can be.
---
It should be mentioned that 80% of the players are playing on pvp servers.
---
I would transfer off of the full Realm I am on but there are no less than high PvE servers in US lol. Really hope they don't add them Monday night
---
What about it is not in the spirit of vanilla?
---
This sounds pretty intense. I never leveled tailoring in Vanilla. What's the mount you speak of, and do you attain it through normal class training? Or is it a drop somewhere?
---
I figured I'd go tailor/enchant since I could just make my own disenchant fodder, but you're describing some next level uber-raider shit here, and now I'm interested.
---
Edit: And what's Truefaith? I'd look this up, but I'm at work and can't seem to get on WoW-related websites.
---
This is a disgrace. How do these people not realize that it’s addons and requests like this that turned WoW into the what the BFA experience is today? The entire point of classic is that it’s NOT like retail. I don’t get how this point flies over people’s heads.
---
If Alliance youtube "in frost we trust". That is how you level.
---
Macros you want /stopcasting on counterspell. Other than that mouse mouseovers for spells like poly. Cancelaura for iceblock.
---
Early pvp spec looks like this. The only thing that changes is the hit talent based on what you have. You put point into cone of cold with some more hit.

Once geared some more specs open up. Two elementalist builds with ice barrier or blastwave. When really geared pom/blastwave becomes viable.
---
For duels ice barrier builds are almost always the best. Other specs are more about bg roles or just fun. Mage is not the very best duel class though. Lock is. Any class can take on multiple people if skilled with the exception of maybe warriors with no consumables. With consumables they are fine and in group pvp they are the meta class.
---
Mages are just flashy and make for entertaining videos.
---
Your pve spec is gonna be arcane power frost and you will be pressing frostbolt until AQ. Then you press fireball. They are one of the most boring PVE classes.
---
You mean when they introduced cross realm groups you moron
---
Why are there so many people who don't know how to take a screenshot? Is this a hint as to the type of people i will be fighting against in pvp? Looking good in that case.
---
Which is strange since the biggest complaint when comparing Classic to retail is the lack of social interaction and community.
---
So knowing this, why does Blizzard need to force it?
---
Let’s go home, back to before we started spamming the “going home” sentiment.
---
There were addons like this in vanilla btw
---
You should sleep up until midnight, then you don't have to sleep during the initial release! Lol
---
very few games allowed me to experience the deep thoughtful enjoyment since wow vanilla, but i will list them out, all these games excelled for me in Trippy psychadelic aesthetic, they made up for being less massive and intricate in pure raw Mind impact.

If there's not enough distance, then spammer can still make a writing, it would take more time and more bones, but he's likely using a bot, so it wouldn't matter. I'm all for persistent skeletons, but I think that there are better solutions than teleporting.
---
Is it viable to try for a frost/fire hybrid?  I have heard there is a build that allows shatter with fire spells, but I'm not sure how well it fares while leveling.
---
Give us German RP servers!
---
anal Clusterfuck (PvP) is still on Low maybe you could go there?
---
Is it [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqd5zw/here_are_some_early_alphaconcept_maps/)?  Third hit for searching for "map of planned content" in the /r/classicwow search box.
---
It could take 100s of man hours to recode them to react in that way and also not break something else. For someone who was barely alive when classic was out you're sure acting like you know what you're talking about.  No one used skeletons to alarm them if there was pvp.  They used the defense channel.  If you're running up on skeletons, you're already dead. You and everyone else who keeps bringing this up are making mountains out of molehills just to rage about something. It's a non-issue.  Also, you literally said it's the easily fixable.
---
Indeed... as I was reading through it I realized I had it playing on spotify
---
Discord can have bots that do far, far more than this add-on could ever do...
---
Sounds like you're the one that didn't play vanilla.
---
Combat Text add-on, for retail.  I an unable to check to see if this is going to be made for classic though.
---
Good thing I don't drive anymore.
---
Decided to go ahead and check some of my alt accounts, I guess I played a lot more than I thought on OSRS. Now I wana know what my total time played is. Probably over 500 days ingame I'd assume.

What was the name? Just curious.
---
How so?  I have seen videos of people chaining frost nova, cone of cold, and blizzard.  Does that not work?
---
They were an amazing team. We played against their WSG pre-mades and I posted this in another comment already, but the one time I remember beating their main WSG team with our RCW pre-made remains a big highlight of Vanilla.
---
Raynor was their tanky warrior who was ever-present in the PvP conflicts, along with their PvP leader who played a priest (Name began with an R as well). That character (the priest) was the first Rank 14 PvP character on Deathwing.
---
When we realized we were up against their pre-made I got on Team Speak and we formed a strategy that involved me CC'ing Raynor with Entangling Roots while we stun locked the priest and took him out. They had no dispels for the root except for the priest and a mage who we also burned through. We dispatched a rogue to the mage, who was a little late out of the gate and not prepared to deal with dispels. The rest of our team was entirely focused on burning through the priest. I wish I could remember their (priest's) name. Huge respect and don't like referring to them as 'the priest'.
---
That was a key part of the strategy.. I was like listen, Raynor is going to be in our face leading their attack and we need to not engage him AT ALL. He was buffed to something ridiculous like 15K hitpoints and with even modest healing he was legit impossible to kill. We kept with that for the entire match because they relied on that duo to dominate the middle of WSG, and we neutralized it effectively and won. We only ever engaged Raynor when their heals were dead and on respawn cooldown.
---
So yeah, that's on the highlight reel, somewhere near the top. They were a fantastic guild in a great many ways.
---
I agree, but they could easily program it so that your skeleton is generated a few meters in a random direction from your corpse to combat that.
---
I'm just glad I got to do the stress test and verify that my potato runs Classic at a respectable frame rate.
---
@ everyone thinking LFG Addon will “RUIN CLASSIC!!”

Sorry to hear. Hope you have a good lunch and good weekend before your life falls apart in the hands of a stinkin computer game lol

Only if you didn't understand the first argument so you believe that everything that I said which was just a more verbose version was my arguments.
---
The only argument I actually presented was the one about how I don't know anything because there are too many factors to account for.
---
I'll do fine, I won't be the guy who whispers people "LOLOLO Why are you wearing that? It's not the best item, you don't understand classic LOLOLO"
---
I care a little, not so much but a little. Why make a change to the game by reducing the amount of skeletons? For me its an unneccessary change compared to original vanilla.

you dont get a mount from tailoring. Just that selling mooncloth while you farm is a nice supplement to my preferred farming of satyrs (as they drop felcloth anyhow). Also mining and herbalism are dismal to use as a money maker before having an epic mount--so i really focus on grinding prior to having my mount.
---
Definitely gotta watch that episode this weekend
---
How do people in retail play the game the same as in classic? You can't chain pull an entire dungeon, you don't have fast gameplay, you don't have anything close to the same gameplay as in retail. How can you play the game the same if the gameplay is nothing the same?
---
UGH I sat for two hours on my pc last night just like nope... nope.. nope...
---
it encourages people to not make connections. running a dungeon without downtime is not a feature of the game, like LFR/G is. gameplay being easier is also one of those things that led to people rushing dungeons.
---
edit: fast group time -&gt; fast run time -&gt; repeat
---
This guy raids
---
Or, just not use the add-on...

---
I will burn out if I don't use a guide and listen to podcasts and music, plus I find doing this with the more grindy side of MMOs incredibly relaxing.
---
I didn't find levelling enjoyable once you hit around 30 in vanilla so I would be shocked if I did enjoy it this time round.
---
I also agree the the level 60 content in vanilla is great and it's the part of the game I want to play.
---
Also I find the people that want to play more casually are the ones that are trying to push it down people's throats the most(I don't recall threads saying speed level or you are doing it wrong). Some guy in my guild nearly had a meltdown the other day when we were talking about which guides we were planning on using.
---
Ah, another man of culture!
---
One search of "rogue leveling guide" yields a rogue leveling guide as the first result you fucking chode. No one here is your personal search engine.
---
How are they doing this? No servers are live...
---
OP whining on James Bond sub because a black chick is going to have the 007 designation and pretending he's the arbiter of what is considered offensive. 
---
Just don't play the game, chud.
---
Yeah, Call to Arms was around as early as 1.6, if not earlier. I definitely used it in vanilla for putting together groups. I'm mildly surprised to see so many people believe it wasn't a thing at all in actual vanilla.
---
No, the only benefit would be to get ahead of the leveling rush. When thousands of players are all questing, it can be very helpful to get past the zerg so you don't have to fight for tags.
---
However, given that we'll have layering, it may not be such a big deal. Also, if you don't plan to no-life hard for the first week or so, then it's a bit moot because the zerg will catch up when you quit.
---
So, if you aren't crazy about getting to 60 fast, don't worry about it. You'll probably have more fun waiting a bit rather than bashing against the queue.
---
Dude, it didn’t even happen very often. Also...Yeah, I don’t mind that a company that generated 7.5 billion in revenue figures out a way to clean this up without making stupid changes to comfort the tiny minority that might get offended.
---
People just don't stop to think before complaining about everything.
---
Sorry these streamers will never be a real friend. They might get a restraining order from you psychos though.
---
I prefer 4 sleeps, log on, 10k queue, Stare at queue until playing, never log off.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know you were required to play vanilla WoW in order to form an opinion on how silly it is to care that you can't leave more than one skeleton behind...
---
I did play BC and WotLK though, if that makes my opinion any more valid.
---
I also went through your comment history like some weirdo... and you seem like... a pretty cool guy honestly.
---
Have fun with Classic bud.
---
i am unemployed due to panic and anxiety, so hell yeah i'm going to be playing HORD (hard/horde lmao) for the first week at least! and i also started in BC so i'm in the same group as you :)
---
I’d bet you’re wrong.
---
Well if it helps avoid people like you I'll definitely be using the addon
---
It does. You’re literally at your computer taking a picture of it. It’s literally faster and higher quality. 
---
But ok. Keep taking shitty pictures of your computer. All your post will have people talking about how lazy you are instead of the actual content.
---
Lmfao nice
---
I can see it quickly turning into Stormrage US population imbalance, 40k alliance to 30 horde. It's pretty sweet for the 40k alliance but man do I feel bad for those 30 horde.
---
Hardly, he just realized that he's in a vacuum and that sun is the headlight from the Classic train.
---
Fair enough.
---
But you don't? It doesn't segregate people, it just helps show you all the chat info in a nice GUI. You still see everyone posting groups, and they still see yours. 
---
Do you know what this addon does? It doesn't use any GearScoring or anything that people dislike in retail. It does the same thing other addons did in Vanilla. What's the issue here?
---
Every single person who uses this addon creates an increasingly smaller pool of players who do not use this addon. At some point (if the addon works well) a lot of people will use it, creating a cascading effect where you're basically forced to use it.
---
Yeah, then the people who don't want it are slowly isolated from the server because they don't want to be in the retail ez crowd. Sounds great!
---
but whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Wow would be really boring game if the only thing you could do at some point is to look for a tank. I mean, if you have literally nothing else to do in the game.
---
We are all shocked that this wasn't mentioned in a single one of the 27 threads about this addon yesterday.  Shocked at this completely new information!
---
Ban people that use it, we will see how many will have the balls to try it again after few ban waves. I mean, if you can't break the addon, break the will of the people to use it.
---
Is it morally right? probably not, but there are ways to control it.
---
You want people to waste money because blizzard is illprepared for a good number of realms? Sorry but not our problem.
---
i thought u cant run scripts in 1.13 classic

---
Lookup Wow Classic sandbox. Dunno if it breaks any rules tho
---
I'm not 100% on this, but I'm pretty sure someone else on this sub mentioned that since they're based on native Americans it made sense. Apparently native A's were pretty good shots when they were introduced to firearms.
---
I thought we were going back to 2005 not 2011
---
The idea behind LFG was pretty decent, but teleporting you to the dungeons and doing it cross server was dumb. Thats why I dont care about these addons at all, I *remember* the pain of wasting an entire saturday standing in ironforge spamming "LF1M TANK SM" and then you finally find one and run all the way there, fight the first trash group and the healers like "Oh I gotta go for dinner" and drops, then the tank says "No heals? OK I go too" and then you run alllllll the way back to ironforge and start again, except this time you cant find anyone, its 2am now, so you just give up.
---
People romanticizing that are mentally ill, it was not fun. An addon that simply smooths out that part of the process is completely fine. Having what amounts to a bulletin board of people saying "I will be willing to run these dungeons right now" does not kill the "experience".
---
Verfugbar's Sake! Give it to us already!
---
When I was a kid, Nancy Drew was to me what vanilla WoW is to everyone here. Now I’ve grown into other games (obviously) and I didn’t even know they still made them. I wonder if they’re still any good...
---
That’s the one
---
Blizzard has already ruled those out, and it makes sense. Better to have a few weeks of chaos than to let servers stagnate and disruptively merge them down the line. Community first.
---
The hyperbole is real

I miss the days of knowing every raider on the server. That stopped as soon as lfg was a thing. You weren’t for the most part grouped with people from your server.  
---
While this addon is mostly fine IMO anything further than a chat parser won’t be.  In vanilla you didn’t need lfg because if you knew how to play the groups came to you.
---
This retail vs classic really needs to stop
---
Plot twist. Most games already had a variation of 'suck'. Your hype for Classic just brought that to the light.
---
i'm gonna level my shaman with heavy emphasis on auto attacks with weapon enchants and fire totems and shocks. no casting , except for healing when needed
---
They did come in patch 1.9, aka a few patches before 1.12 (they went 1.9--&gt;1.10--&gt;1.11--&gt;1.12)
---
Its largely why i'm not re-rolling hunter, the main thing i loved about them has been largely neutered from its far more in depth state pre 1.9
---
This guy seems fun...totally an Alliance player.
---
Thank you!!
---
I hope they ban this addon
---
Choice.
---
I fell off after wrath. Played casually for a few xpacs after but never felt the same. Can’t wait to go home in a few days
---
The problem might be, that the amount of people you can block is limited.
---
Oh and look! Your thread was deleted! Because it doesn't belong! Who would've thought?!
---
I dislocated both shoulders this past friday, accidents happen folks! Good news is Mandatory 1 month no working/driving...oh no whatever will I do??
---
That's less than the number of people who played on certain private servers.  The notion that *less* people will stick around to play on official realms than privates servers is hilarious and naive.
---
&gt; All this does add on does is save groups/people from the chat spam LFG posts and move them to a simple layout. Nothing else changes.
---
I think the issue can be that it snowballs into the new "meta" since it makes LFG posts etc so much more potent that it changes the social landscape abit and thus in turn makes it less necessary to socialize and create your own social network and utilize guilds (even big social guilds etc) and in that sense affects the community. 
---
Some might argue thats a reach or exhaggerated but its deinitely a possibility. 
---
Basically that it has a POTENTIAL to mess with the "social meta" and downplay the importance of networking on your own and pugging easier. Even if it only collects the LFG spam etc in a nicer way, it does make that more digestible and in turn more user-friendly which can lead to the above mentioned scenarios.
---
I personally would prefer it without the addon due to such a risk but Im not worried either way REALLY.
---
And I understand that people dont want anything that could POTENTIALLY mess with the social and community landscape even if its only "empowering" a current feature within the game such as LFG, it can have ripple effects. 
---
That said.. many are probably against it because they think its like the LFG system in retail, which it ofc is not and thats an unreasonable take.
---
As much as I joke about it you made the right choice then friends make this game what it is. Just stay away from those stupid elves
---
Those warriors might have actually been mentally challenged in real life.  Literally the only way they could have lost is by doing exactly what they did.  Believing that video is like watching WWE and thinking it’s an actual fight.  Shit was all for show.
---
I can see why some view this as a controversial addon, however there are two **big** reasons why I think it's actually fine:
---
1. Unlike LFG in retail, everyone will still have to traverse the world and run to the dungeon the old school way.
---
2. Unlike LFG in retail, you'll only be able to group with people from your own realm. No cross-realm shenanigans with people you'll never see again.
---
Taking the above points into account, it's clear this addon doesn't have the big pitfalls that the retail LFG tool has. All it's *really* doing is offering an alternative way of finding people, compared to spamming trade chat, etc. If anything, it actually promotes getting out into the world, since trade chat ties people to standing in capital cities, whereas this works anywhere.
---
My advice to the Vanilla purists, is if you feel this addon desecrates the spirit of Vanilla/Classic, just don't use it. This falls into the same category as addons like Questie. Such tools are nice for those who like them, and take nothing away from those who don't. Just play how you want to play, and let others do the same.
---
That would be a bummer! Most of the exciting functionality comes in the form of script/run commands. But I've got some useful pet macros that do not use lua scripts fortunately :)
---
NO FLYING IN MY CLASSIC

Lmao - you’re an idiot. 
---
Let me get this straight - someone comes up with a better feature that allows people to connect more efficiently - and you decide you DONT want to use the addon - but some how it’s everyone else’s problem that your decision limits the people you can group with?  
---
Entitled much?  It’s your decision not to use it - but don’t turn around and bitch because there’s less people you can group with because of your own stupid decision. Lol. Jesus Christ you’re a moron.
---
&gt; No one has made any advice videos for Classic WoW
---
excuse me?
---
Right, but that doesnt change anything really.

Isnt it just a zeppelin ride to org then a ride to bluff or did the zeppelin to bluff not come out till later

As a prot warrior I refuse.

I'll make my own groups everytime.
---
Despite being a vanilla veteran, I had to use google to find out the orb of domination is from the Razorgore encounter and I still don't know what the orb of naxxramas does. Teleport is my guess?.
---
Lmao going as far as ignoring people because they want to use an addon. As i've said before, if it helps avoid players like you then I think I'll be using this addon.

I know what you mean. Mordhau is pretty awesome tho. If not for the gameplay, then for the extremely silly voices and outfits on duel servers.
---
Should just change the login screen to the WotLK one. Then everyone will zoom past it as quickly as possible to avoid the fucking dragon screech and no one will ever notice.
---
Well, everybody will be forced to use it if they want to find groups, unless blizzard puts any sort of restriction on these addons.
---
That's kinda the whole point of the post... People will be forced to use addons to play the game. Or the community will be split in two.
---
really makes u think

Hi Khiran,

Welcome to ZT. I might advise you to post this on the ZT subreddit

There is also a discord server that is heavily used for the Zalandar community. So you might want to also check that out.

our doomguards or infernals used to be on a timer, and when it timed out it became wild. You could summon one the instantly dismiss it for the same effect. Letting one rip in Ogg usually meant if no one near your level was about it would kill everthing until the guards took it down 20 mins later.

They are. And in this case, they more than make up for WoW not having their own cinematic stuff for the content.

I am just glad the developers are communicating.  There was so much wrong with Legion and BFA because it seemed like the team were just going about their business and trying to drag the customers along with them.  But, turns out they don't know everything, and being open about discourse will have a better effect than shutting everything inside the walls of their HQ.  
---
Screw DPS Legendaries and azerite armor.

Time to see if Ion is a liar or not.

---
blizzards busy building a bunker in preperation of the fucking money hurricane that is the day before servers go live
---
Let's ban warlocks as well. They are simulating LFG.
---
If someone buys a month subscription,  they should be willing to check queues on day 2 or 3 if they get frustrated on day 1.  They will see no queue on day 2 or 3 and then decide to continue playing.  Seems quite logical to me.
---
No, I never said any of that. You said that. I wouldn't expect anyone to invite me to something I've never done that is considered extremely difficult. I wouldn't try to push a mythic+ without having done that dungeon and experienced the affixes. The point I'm making is still: add-ons like RaiderIO or Gearscore dictating everything about getting someone invites to a group is something I personally dislike. I dislike it because if you start late, it can keep you behind longer, especially if you're not playing with a guild. My opinions got nothing to do with any of the reasons you've made up for me. It's like you're purposely trying to miss the point so that you can troll. Thousands of people buying carries doesn't equate to everyone above me. Way more people are legit than are not. Also, I'll be 60 during the first three weeks, probably.
---
It's all I can think about right now.
---
So I'm going to be leveling by myself, due to work and rl commitments I'm not going to be playing hardcore only for fun. 
---
I would prefer DPS but don't mind healing but just don't want to be waiting for groups all the time. 
---
Would probably prefer an "easier rotation class" but still want to have fun. 
---
What class would you recommend for me.?
---
It doesn't simulate the retail LFG. It's a glorified chat parser that doesn't segregate the community. Can we stop with the hyperbolic posts?
---
I dislike it's ability to auto post into chat, about the only thing I dislike about it though.
---
Absolutely noone used that system, it was a complete failure (thankfully) so I hardly consider that system "Vanilla".  If they remove auto-invites and any other decision-making from this addon I would be ok with it - it would be just a simple chat parser to help you filter through all the chat spam.
---
I know what a repost is, but you're making quite the leap between 'content' (pictures, videos, short stories, etc) and ideas. This post was discussion, pure and simple. *You* may have had the discussion "1000" times, but when I lurk here I primarily see guides, viability of classes based on raiding, freakouts about layering etc. I have a friend who no longer comes to this sub because he feels like it's becoming more like r/wow. 
---
You can call me dense, you can say I'm using hyperbole, whatever you want to throw at me. All the while you are literally ignoring the fact that your experiences on this sub are not the same as literally hundreds of thousands of other people who visit this sub different amounts, at different times of day, with vastly different experiences of wow. 
---
All I can say is, unsub if you want original quality content. This is a subreddit for a video game and people like OP just want to talk about their preferred methods of playing.
---
I see this as a problem with layering not with the addon. Also layering will be removed eventually.
---
What do you think it’s about then
---
I think that ARK was the only game I've played since Wrath-era WoW to get me hooked, but even that didn't last too long.  To be honest, it's great that I'm not really playing video games, but...Classic is probably about to roll right in and ruin that.
---
Yeah after you install it and open the menu for the addon, you get 3 to 4 squares in the screen one for incoming dmg, one for outgoing dmg, alerts and notices, I think they fused the last 2 into one.
---
You can move these squares and change their size, speed of the text and so on, you can put it to show 10000 or 10k, show name of skill or show only icon.
---
&gt; You aren't going to convince people otherwise because it's the general opinion of all that LFR is a bad thing.
---
Yeah I can see that. It's so stupid though. It's the game iteself not 1 tool that it provides that hurt the community. The playerbase themselfs hurt the social aspect of the game by forming these seperate bubbles of communities on discord etc, where they only talk with already made friends form 10 years ago and ignore in game chat. But w/e.
---
He is the enforcer, making sure raid members get out of (potentially) dangerous aoe by putting their feet to the fire, so to speak.
---
Correct. This addon is nothing like retail LFG. There's no teleporting directly into the dungeon, and it only groups people from the same realm. All this does is speed up the process of finding players you'd probably recruit in trade chat anyway. No biggie.
---
If diehard Vanilla players want to keep using old grouping methods like trade chat, then they're free to do so. For such players to demand the addon get banned though isn't cool. Just like quest helper addons, use them or don't use them, and let others choose for themselves.
---
Dirt cheep too. The offical ones on Blizzard's website are like £15-20. This one only cost £2.50 when I ordered! Weird that you can't buy official ones like this though, I'd have happily given Blizzard my money
---
Anyone who was around for SWtOR's launch should recognize all of this. That game had other issues too, but a big one was caving to complaints about queues during launch week, standing up a bunch of new servers, then ending up with truly *empty* (as in nobody else in your faction capital at certain hours) servers a month or two after launch.
---
Blizzard doesn't want that, and they're clearly expecting a massive drop-off in players after launch.
---
By what appears to be a Paladin whom did not bubble hearth at the sight of you, oh wait, that's me.  LOL

And no. I like to be lazy, she likes to get stuff done. She tells me the stuff that needs doing, I do it. If she needs to chill, i tell her to chill. Our l individual strengths and weaknesses balance each other.

It's actually really hard to tank in t2 since you take no damage and can't gain any rage, while people are doing shitloads of damage as well. Usually at that point it doesn't matter much though since everything just explodes.
---
I remember tanking 5mans with enha shaman in t2/t2.5 gears.
---
Dungeons become much more fun when you try to do them quickly (imo). gives them some more needed challenge, especially when farming it's fun to race against your best time.
---
Fair enough but by big in my experience is like 20-30 people, more than enough to be cancer.
---
Commercial decision or otherwise, without name reservations Blizzard would have no advance warning about where players intend to play and the impact of those numbers on realm populations. So if nothing else it's served a purpose of tipping them off ahead of time as to which servers are seeing big numbers. Another benefit is on launch night you don't have to create your character and you can sit on the character select screen ahead of launch, which is the stage after the server login process.
---
Will it still be a clusterf**k? Absolutely. That's inevitable. It's a high profile launch of the most popular MMO ever. It's going to rain fire. I'm not expecting anything to happen after I click "Enter World" at launch. But that won't last for long.
---
Let people be excited dude. I can’t imagine having so much free time you’re going to sit there and report other people just expressing excitement for something they have waited months if not years for.
---
To add to this most of the better add ons aren't really needed until endgame which will be months away.
---
So if someone else likes ketchup on their steak thats weird?
---
I just feel like you should mind your own plate and anyone who wants to put whatever on their steak can do that with no judgement from me.
---
Just my thought process on the matter.
---
This is what my albums look like on my phone.
---
523 minutes hahahahaha
---
I wouldn't even get that hyped for Classic (because I spent more than half my life from 2004-2006 on it) if modern games wouldn't suck this hard. They are (almost) all absolutely terrible.
---
I bet that's why they said "unless they change the addon API".
---
Not for PvP. Gnomes are arguably the best for alliance PvP with escape artist. It’s basically a free PvP trinket proc.
---
I wonder if it’ll be anything like when I played Lineage 2 back in the day. Used to have a dedicated group and I remember we’d go to a place called SoA (seeds of annihliation) and chain pull mobs for about .02% xp per pull. Sometimes on a large pull we’d get close to .1% xp for the pull. Leveling took literal months. But the gameplay was fun.
---
Give me 15$ for the game I won't be playing until release
---
you know the difference between nerds and geeks? you see the nerds on the left side of the picture. they know their stuff and they're borderline autistic savants that acquired a mass of knowledge in a specific field that noone else matches. on the right you see the typical geeks that saw a nerd in their "a little too big"-pants and thought it looks kinda trendy paired with those nerdy glasses. they basically hate their job but like to show off, they care alot about what other people think about them. they spend most of their days in a starbucks on a mac book acting like they're doing something really important and complex stuff when in reality they are just browsing the web. geeks are extroverts that always try to let everyone partake in what they are doing
---
For the company? Yeah definitely
---
So commuting on my supersport to work on the tollways bearing the colors of the horde is a no go?
---
Thanks for being honest.

Same here

Wow -&gt; LOL -&gt; path -&gt; wow it seems
---
Wat.... i'll expect lines to visit this nature masterpiece.
---
Last time i leveled enchanting on a fresh server i did really well just selling beastslayer enchant to the all the levelers i had my mount money by 33. Too many people have this idea you can not make money with crafting professions while leveling.
---
fuckin for real
---
especially a gnome with pink pigtails
---
You come for the voodoo?
---
this mage is just terrible cmon omegalul
---
Just because you don't think it, doesn't make it not happen? Precaution goes a long way, and in this current society, that can save a company. Also someone can easily be spewing white supremacy in chat standing next to a corpse swastika made up of different colored humans. Anyone can do that, this just makes it much harder.
---
Just because you think something, doesn't mean it's true. Before you chastise me saying "you think I don't know that", I do think you don't. If you did, ya wouldn't have said it.
---
Yup now I cant use my guide and reach 60 in 3 hours
---
Because what’s offensive is subjective and constantly changing, chud and it’s different for each individual. Believe it or not, some people don’t get offended very often.

I am the official artist, I am also a huge Vanilla/BC/Wrath fan. You can see more of my work here at: [jtmayhew.com](https://jtmayhew.com)
---
I think it’s a topic for later. It would be a huge mistake to make any changes until Classic has run its cycle, but it’s much more likely they’ll release BC after Classic instead of doing a Classic+. I’m sure they’ll do fresh realms for classic though like PServers do
---
sounds like if its a big enough problem there should be tons of them to group up with.
---
You need to remember that for years, the Vanilla WoW community has been dealing with people being condescending towards, and ridiculing their wishes.  Because of that, it's pretty off-putting to see someone who isn't part of that community (yet) come in and tell them that what they want doesn't matter.
---
I know you're probably being sarcastic, but sorry for coming off as a dick.  I hope you enjoy the game as well, as a lot of us consider it to be one of, if not the best installation of the game.
---
I feel like watching this is feeding this.
---
They may share some syntax and some other similarities but they are 2 very different languages. (I don't really consider html a language either) but it's the best comparison in terms of "hardness" to me.
---
I did, and if you think this addon is going to kill the community aspect then there's something wrong with you. 
---
Everyone remembers the most fun was putting together a group not, you know, running the dungeon together.
---
I'm just going to /spit on and blacklist people using this addon.
---
I never said it was. 
---
I do think blizzard has a responsibility to avoid massive overpopulation on their servers. It is their game, if they think this is going to be an issue then they should act on it, instead of telling the players and hoping they will willingly change servers.
---
There was never a button you could press, that would put you into a group of players, with specific roles and a specific dungeon to run to. That was added in Wrath. This is essentially the LFG tool that's currently in retail but NOT in classic. Classic requires talking to other players, which this addon negates entirely..
---
https://youtu.be/gxBXke6KvPA
---
Here’s a short clip summarizing my feelings about anything that fat idiot has to say.
---
Pamela redpath?
---
Oh damn that's good
---
wow. greasy
---
How does this LFG addon work? Teleport / cross-realm or layer chat? What?
---
Separately, Do all layers share chat so that trade chat in IF reaches everyone?
---
Facists
---
Plans are to log in and see the que time. If it's there I'll just dick around in retail. Otherwise I'ma play classic since I binned the private servers I played on. Won't be needing those when I've got classic
---
The difference between what macro's can do in 1.12.1 and retail is massive, so I dont understand why you make this comparison.
---
Did you test these macros on retail?
---
Difference between us and RP’ers
---
But.... You're finished. What will you do now?
---
Not a clue as to what vanilla way like, I didn't play it. but like I said,

I didn't call you a racist, but a hit dog will holler I guess.

And I would hope that trying to avoid having Nazi iconography all over the place is something that we would agree on regardless of political persuasion.
---
That’s a Texas sized 10-4 big shooter.
---
I have no idea to be honest. I think the first time I was able to run it solo was during WotLK at level 80. But a lot has changed since then. You can probably do it earlier now with level 70 or something, I don't know really.

improve spell speed?
---
Pvp servers were fun because of that.
---
Gotta unlock them FP's anyway boi
---
I doubt classic will have a long and fruitful life unless they are very rapidly churning out the expansions or create new servers that allow community input on new content.
---
The name really isn't that important.
---
Wieso, wird's dann günstiger?
---
Well, since wsg won't even be out I think that's one less category of people to contend with!
---
The number of spelling errors in this guide confirms that it was in fact made by a hunter.
---
You'd have to run back to a place with a blacksmith and fix it.
---
It can happen, but with a prepared tank it's really rare, especially in leveling dungeons. The tank should be top repair when they go in. The group (including the tank) should be good enough with their classes that they don't cause too any wipes, aware enough (either through experience or looking up guides or just asking other people for help) about how the dungeon works, etc.
---
Edit: Depending on what broke, I've known people to grab random loot bits to swap in and avoid the repair run.
---
I'm trying to finish up my playthrough of Fire Emblem: Three Houses before Monday. I think I've got like 10 hours left.
---
How you gonna jinx this whole sub like that?
---
Play what you want to play man. You love warrior, then play that. If you want to try something else, do that.
---
You can get a good feel for your class by level 10, 20. If you don't like the playstyle, then make another character. You are not locked in.
---
Yes I was hoping that this is the direction the game will eventually take. They could add instances and raids with parallel storylines without changing what will become in the future (TBC, WOTLK)
---
My god that was AMAZING!
---
The Arthas music at the end, so good!
---
You someone think that a person who uses guides to progress in a timely manner is somehow going to get bored faster than the guy bumbling through the world chasing butterflies?
---
Interesting perspective.
---
the Addon , the people who use the Addon, and the Dev who made the Addon need to be perma-banned not just from Classic WoW, but everything involved with Classic WoW(Forums, subreddits, everything)
---
I will try not to camp you when I see you in the field, Alliance scum.
---
Thanks for taking a look! :D
---
I've already read up to page 59 and holy cow, he statistically disects retail WoW and compares it to Vanilla WoW so well. It's been hitting me over time that WoW feels like a single player game and i feel so disconnected from the world. I was on the fence for playing Vanilla since i know it will be incredibly hard, but now, I am for sure going to play Vanilla. I want the challenge, and the community.
---
I have a Sulfuras.....on my hunter so I can’t even get the achievement (asked a GM and they said not possible to give it to me even though he could see I did make it, because the achievement was to equip it) and I’ll be damned if I go through the process to make another just to have the eye drop on a character who can’t equip it again.
---
I suspect it really doesn't, but blizz gave what is perceived to be an 'SJW' answer to why skeletons weren't in and that melted a few snowflakes. If they just said, "sorry, we're not doing skeletons for some obscure technical reason" or "frankly, we are spending our time elsewhere besides making a new skeleton system that mimics vanilla" I really doubt there would be this many people bent out of shape about it.
---
I agree.
---
Except for the part that Dire maul comes after deadmines so why would people start  referring to deadmines as VC before they had a reason to. It also ignores that no one just did dire maul, they did dire maul east or north for example.
---
DM is deadmines.
---
Dm east is diremaul east, DM north, etc.
---
Lol why are u so mad
---
Yeah, I could tell.  I genuinely just wanted to help out :)
---
Don't get the razer naga. It sucks and will crap out on you in two years. For less than half the price, you can get a Logitech g600 which not only has a better build quality, but the g shift button kicks ass. Go read the reviews on it compared to the naga everyone that has both will tell you.
---
-former naga chroma user for years and years and will never go back.
---
The new meme.
---
So. The issue with that is that the community doesn't trust blizzard to make good additions to the game anymore. 
---
Also, AQ40 and Naxx gear was too good that the scaling was thrown way off. This is why BC had to come out when it did.
---
My cousin was in a similar situation. 2 kids and probably only going to be able to play 2 hours a night at near midnight. He talked with his wife and she didnt mind him playing earlier in the day on most days. Now were gonna be able to get him to 60 in 2 weeks instead of 2 months.
---
OG OG OG
---
Fuck
---
So what does reset it? Mouse movements?
---
The thing is, nobody used it back in vanilla. It was a different culture. The retail culture now is different, and we don't want that culture in Classic. So you can make a gamedesign decision to stop that culture from forming and ruining another iteration of WoW.
---
I want to see what classes players intend to main
---
Man I remember Scholomance. I always needed CC and I needed players who were not dumb and I needed to do LOS pulls. I thought I remembered that poly didn't work on undead. The problem was that if you didn't do these things you would get feared into the rest of the room and wipe 100% of the time.
---
No problem.
---
Thanks, wasnt showing for me for some reason
---
Yes, I was reacting only to the above quote without getting the gist of your complaint.  But to be fair, your qote:
---
&gt;NA servers have been warned that so many players will be logging in at the same time they won't even be able to join the queue, they will just get an error.
---
He is right, they have been warned of just that.  You are also right, it was for high and full servers.  I think the more pressing matter is that there arn't looking to be any medium and under realms...ie they are all going to be high to full.  I think it's making many of us nervous, as most of us want the game to be a great experience especially for newer players who might stick around...if they get a chance to taste the tasty candy that is vanilla.

---
I agree its a problem with layering but tools like this increase the problem ten fold. Since with a tool like this anyone can actively abuse layering vs without it you would require several friends on different layers that would be wiling to constantly invite you whenever you ask with minimal delay.
---
Haha your a clown my man. A racist clown, but still a clown
---
Oh and your antivax and a 9-11 conspirator, holy fuck your the trifecta is misinformation. Goddamn dude
---
in general camping will be the name of the game. join a group for 5x the chance to hit i guess. make sure to look around and go where there aren't people camping. usually there are mobs for quest progress at a couple of places other then the most obvious area  
---
other tactics seem to be to explore a ton at first, and die-res-run to flight points and get xp just from doing this, but you have to do this from level 1 as the xp becomes negligible from exploring after a couple of levels. not recommended  
---
personally i will go to bed early and wake up at 6 in the morning to play when most more hardcore people will crash, and hopefully dodge a lot of the camping.. but i doubt it somehow
---
/world is an unofficial channel IIRC.  It will likely exist and people will join it, but I'm not so sure it's "official"
---
Yeah.
---
TBH, a lot of the quests are well done and interesting if you take the time to actually read what you're doing and not just go grind out whatever the objective is. You cannot complete them all before making it to 60.
---
*Most* of the dungeons are really good.
---
In about a year there will still probably be pickup groups for MC/Onyxia that you can casually show up to.
---
You can get at least the blue PvP gear which is decent without a ton of grinding.
---
-Someone that raided *a lot* during vanilla.
---
Wow, you're even more out of touch with reality than I first thought.
---
I was poking around on the Blizz store today and saw the vulpine something or other mount for like 25 fucking dollars. 
---
No, Blizz. Just no. Almost making me rethink my decision to sub. I can't believe just how far this game has fallen.
---
Outstanding move
---
The people that like LFR are going to find a way to emulate how LFR works. The ones who don't are going to do it the way it was done before. Idk why people gotta argue. /shrug
---
Idk, nobody can say for sure. I always stay clear of taking time off or getting hyped for launch day. It prevents disappointment. If I plan anything, it's usually the week after. If I get to play at launch, that's a huge bonus for me
---
But maybe they want players to have the experience THEY want, instead of the experience Blizzard thinks they want. The reason Classic has taken as long as it has is because Blizzard ignored what players wanted to give an experience that Blizzard thought they wanted. (" You think you do, but you don't") and it seems they have learned from that lesson. What makes you think Blizzard knows more of what you want to do, than you do?
---
i just think its really sad that people can't just.... talk to people they run into
---
It's like layering.  People don't actually care if it's good or not, they just need something to cry about for another 98 hours.
---
Just remember, you can't outrun a murloc no matter how hard you try.

Theres about 5 per day along with shit art posts, useless BIS lists with 2% drop rate items from rare spawns and what class should I play posts. At least mods started deleting pictures of game boxes and Brady games books.

Personally, I've found the wand/melee weaving to be *way* too much effort for the payoff. You need a fast melee and a slow wand, idk maybe I just couldn't find a good auto attack bar for it but it just seemed like a minimal dps increase for a lot of extra micro.
---
Why does it say to save 40g for mount?
---
Super minor, but personally I recommend going 3 spirit tap -&gt; 5 wand spec -&gt; 2 spirit tap. Having over 50% spirit tap really helps you keep up your mana during those first few levels, and will make more of a difference than the little bit of extra wand damage.
---
I've seen other guides that say to use mind flay. I do not see the payoff before you have shadow weaving/shadowform *at all*; at very least until 36. Everything below that, you're spending mana and cast time on a spell that does marginally over your GSS wand damage. It's just wasted.
---
The last Pserver priest I leveled was shadow w/ a respec at 40 for shadowform, but I am likely doing it differently this time. I'm going shadow for Spirit tap/imp SW:P and then going disc for the better mana regen. The best talents in shadow are the better resist, shadow weaving, and silence... Those are pretty minor IMO. Shadow weaving *seems* good, but it's really only helping SW:P, and since mind flay is so bad it's not really even worth stacking. The mana saved by the improved resist is easily paid off by the mana regen in disc that you'd get. It's kinda a tossup, but I'm still very tempted to try disc till 44 and then respec to shadow.
---
I don't think experience counts for much.  I played vanilla but I doubt I will remember much at all about the best stuff to do and when.
---
In terms of experience vs routing, I think routing wins every time.  It removes the uncertainty of choice and turns it into mathematical sum game.  I have no doubt people following routes will beat me to 60, handily, even if it's their first time on vanilla/classic.
---
Revenge for all those years of the Daily Dose I guess
---
the race you will not get tired looking at.  some model that brings you joy eaven tho you in a year migth not like the looks jut just giggel inside since you thought this was the shit at launch.
---
back in vanilla i played a UD priest and she was ulgy as fuck, still loved that char.
---
I play druid main, never had macros to be honest. Without macros, you can look at an addon called "druidbar" - https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25036-DruidBarClassic.html (It used to unshift you automatically, or shift you say from cat -&gt; bear if you hit your bear key while in cat)
---
Skill cap is a benefit, not a drawback. If you are in OWPvP, or OWPvE there's a lot of tools in the toolbox you can use to get yourself out of bad situations. (Or in many cases as I did, fight group quests solo which most classes are unable to do)
---
If you want to just be a basic healer, you're fine. Normal classic mechanic with healers - downranking and mana management.
---
(Reminder: druids are viable in all content, they have less raid slots due to less potency over other healers, but bring a ton of utility which is always welcome but are very underplayed due to the skill ceiling, and not having big flashy numbers other classes are able to do)
---
And if you have questions, please let me know, happy to help.
---
I'm going for portions of; 200g minced meat, 2 spoons of white rice, 50 grams of red bell pepper, 50 grams of carrot and a handful of spinach. Fry meat and veggies with your choice of spices, anything goes really (except too spicy, for the sake of your bowel movements). Add rice and chicken stock, pack in plastic containers that can handle being microwaved.
---
2-3 meals of those a day. Between meals  supplemented with almonds, walnuts and easy to consume fruits, such as apple slices, grapes or whatever fruit that wont smear all over the place.
---
Have water bottles ready in the fridge. You don't have to consume more than necessary. Again to avoid visiting the little boys room too often.
---
Also screw all that and get a case of Monster and dont hold back on the doritos.
---
Good luck and have fun.
---
Nothing resets it, that's the point. It's to keep a fuck ton of people from waiting at the character select screen for hours.

\*hears dark and ominous stormclouds\* nah i'll be fine. not feeling jinxed at all...

So nothing at all with the API(the CURRENT discusion we are having............) got it

---
Thank you for the advise! I just did! :)
---
I literally never heard anyone call it VC at all in vanilla WoW Dire maul was always called DME/DMN/DMW in my experience.
---
It is just so weird seeing VC pop up everywhere all of a sudden. It is like you wake up one day and everyone starts calling coats, beesplongers or some shit and then claim that coats were always called beesplongers. Like wtf am I getting pranked?
---
Was it TBC beta that required 'winning' a contest via leveling competition or level 19 pvp contest? Man, good memories

Druid tank forgot to switch from the healer gear he wore last dungeon.
---
Are you delusional? You even prove my point in your comment. The fact you have to type out an LFM message alone is more than the LFG tool make you do. TIL typing less than 4 words isn't talking. Retail WoW has you hit a button to enter a random dungeon with random people you will never see again.
---
Your point was " It's stuff like this that slowly removes the community of it. " I'm saying no, it doesn't it's just a different medium of bringing players together that is barely any different from joining a chat channel specifically for casual dungeon encounters.
---
Blindly? What are the facts and the reality? The reality is that the addon is old, was tested during beta, Blizzard are aware about it and nothing was made, while tons of changes were made to addon API to change stuff like hiding information about spell ranks, about casting bars, about threat. The thing he was refering to, in the video, was to some sort of hypotetical addon that would mimic LFD or LFR, ClassicLFG doesn't come close to that.
---
Please enlighten me, how will this addon ruin Classic?
---
I remember unleashing Infernals on Crossroads quite a bit.  I know they "fixed" it at one point, but I hope this is still in.
---
Spoilers: It didn't
---
The reason I'm going to use a quest addon is to be able to get all the quests that I would normally miss! There are alot of secretive and hidden quests that alot of people simply just miss, and I want to experience it all this time around
---
I think what made classic so amazing is the journey it certainly wasn't easy but it definitely made it worth it. Everything had purpose for example tou find a green item there is a chance at some point it's a big upgrade and toy are thrilled you get a blue and it means something in retail WoW everything is fucking purple even if it sucks professions in classic mean something in retail they seem almost irrelevant. Flying ruined WoW in my mind as that killed world pvp. Classic every trip was an adventure a journey u never knew what you were going to encounter. That's just some of the things.

I'm not up to date on realm related news, but my friends and I are going to be playing on Skeram. Why do you say it will be bad?
---
We need his name for science.
---
The difference isnt small. It makes you heavily underperform. Playing a legit spec vs a "fun" one isnt a difference of just 5% damage
---
There is going to be an addon that will autoblock those messages really quickly. So I wouldnt worry about it too much
---
Do you know what is worse than not getting the name you wanted?

Getting it but losing it when your ghost town of a server gets merged into another one.

What do you guys think is the most fun DPS class to play in a regular dungeon group and why?

Guy in our guild back in Vanilla, his parents had configured their router to switch off every night at 9PM. We would be mid raid and we would all laugh and tease him and at 9PM he was gone.

If you have the possibility, hook up a big TV to one of the computers as well. If there are insane ques, just stay hyped with some streamer or multiplayer game on the TV.

Got a pic? I wanna see it now!

Thanks actually wrote several versions but well as its 4 days before launch something had to be posted!
---
The most important part of playing WoW is reading. Read the quest text, read what your spells do, read what talents do, etc. If it has a tooltip read it (Tooltips appear when you hover your mouse of an item, object, etc).
---
*unzips*
---
Druids have a very high skill ceiling with multiple forms, gear sets, and spells. I don't recommend it for new players. You'll get overwhelmed.
---
originally I think it was 50, no idea if that's the case in Classic
---
I love the female orc animations, the male tauren animations leave something to be desired.
---
Yes. This is very obvious. So much so that I'm not sure why you decided to post this anyway.
---
Why the hell LGBTQ community needs their "own" server anyway? I understand polish/russian/hispanic etc. But lgbtq? 
---
Imagine if hetero declared some server as their own
---
And you know what's gonna happen? People will still cry about long queues and unable to log in on launch cause there are just so many people who don't read these things. Blizzard are doing everything to let people know about this. Big ups! Love the Classic devs!

Oof you're so far down the rabbit hole you can't see I'm on your side.
---
Even fewer people pay attention to the AMA than most news posts they put out. Which is why I suggested putting it right on the character creation area.
---
As was foretold.
---
I'm perfectly ok with this, everyone knows where to go to find groups or soon will. 
---
A discord channel run by mongs doesn't improve the experience.
---
Some actual useful and original content on this sub?
---
Color me impressed!

This is exactly how I played Vanilla, and I plan to do it again.  I had 6 60s with varied professions, was mid-level PvP rank on several toons, knew all the lore and class secrets and in jokes, knew what was moving on the AH, enjoyed the Warchief buff for grinding, etc.  Never saw anything past UBRS.
---
I've gotten quite attached to blaumeux in the short time I've known it. I got the name I really wanted, and the server name cracks me up. it may be PT and I may be CT but ILU blammo. the demos are looking good too. 
---
Now I'm looking to catch the next pvp servers opening so I can snag my dream horde name. i'm hoping it'll be soon, I'm wary about servers that'll open day of launch or after.
---
I actually donated mine to DI as part of a move just a couple months before Classic was announced. Been kicking myself ever since.
---
&gt; Leveling is the best part of Vanilla,
---
No it's not
---
I really wish there was an addon so I could see enemy cast bars.
---
My new one has one button... it's really dissapointing. Looked for ages couldn't find a mouse with two buttons on the left side, + the 4 on top. My hand is too small for the right side buttons!
---
I don't think you understand it lmao, let me help..
---
David decides he wants to run Deadmines. Checks the LFG addon and doesn't see a group. Davids a tank, so no problem. David then creates a group on the LFG addon and selects Deadmines from a drop down menu. (NOTE: David has yet to type anything AT ALL)
---
At this point David fills out the "Title" section with "DM - need 3 dps/healer" and in the description decides to type "Fast run!" and hits create group. (Note: only 7 words have been typed. 6 if you don't count 3 as a word, but a number..) A mage, priest healer, hunter and druid see the group and all click the button to join the group which sends an automatic typed message to David, and either David clicks to invite, OR the addon does that automatically as well. Now we've got a full group of 5 for Deadmines and David never actually had to say anything to any one. Only 7 words are typed this entire time, none of which are directed at anyone..
---
Anyone have a list of good recommended console commands like this one
---
It didn't catch on in the private server scene?
---
If you hate that one, let me tell you about the other two...
---
I just remember finding it whilst standing in the barrens spamming /silly
---
Get the grandparents to take them but still claim your sick leave for work during the morning for your grinding.
---
Azshara
---
Heckin' awesome.
---
LFG addon is NOT like modern WoW. All it is is an add-on that congregates people who are looking for group.
---
It is more akin to the original LFG UI where you would post groups and people could search things, or like FFXIVs version.
---
There is nothing wrong with that addon. People will just make battlenet communities, third party websites, etc.
---
It isn't going away. Stop whining about it. People already used it in Vanilla. It was called spamming zones or the meeting stones.
---
i know dude... corpse explosion is going to be a useless spec for all us necromancer players. real bummer but im sure classic diablo2 will sitll be great.
---
Myself and a lot of others I knew used those addons, especially near the end of vanilla. I agree the culture was different, and there was a lot more talk between party members. But that was also because you’d often get the same people in your groups.
---
Bruh. I'm rolling troll warrior and I cant even use 2 handers untill I train them.
---
While waiting in queues I plan to read up on instance walk throughs/boss strats for fights that I haven't done in many many years.  That way I can lead groups through dungeons if they've never done them before.  If I fet bored with that, I'll go through irl junkmail/shred papers.
---
I don't use addons, but ok.
---
Omg it's a gurrl run!
---
Hahaha, that really made me lol.
---
Am still gonna murder you though, horde scum..😁
---
Quality content
---
"If you don't like people trading gold from retail for classic, just don't do it"
---
Yeah I hear you op
---
You clearly have a lot of WoW and MMO experience but I want to offer some thoughts.
---
&gt;My go-to roles in MMORPG are bard/support
---
Bard = Shaman totem twisting. Unfortunately a 5/31/15 (or variant) totem build is considered a meme spec due to low damage, mediocre healing, and you only need 1-2 per raid. I also love Bard and this was my main in Everquest. I wish there was something better in WoW.
---
&gt;offhealing is fine though
---
You might want to look into Shaman 30/0/21. Ele Sham have some of the highest burst damage in PvP and you can still offheal in PvE. WF totem is great support. Players will sound demanding "wf totem pls" but they'll love you.
---
&gt;and tank
---
Out of Druid/Paladin, you probably want Druid. They're the best dungeon tank and can offtank raids. Paladins have threat/taunt issues. If you decide to roll a Druid, don't expect to kill anything. They're so niche in PvP (flag running, defending points, etc)
---
&gt;don't mind pure damage roles
---
If you're hardcore then you'll want to go Warlock. They are top tier starting AQ and get super OP in both PvP and PvE with Naxx gear. You'll delete most classes instantly with those 4k shadowbolt crits.
---
&gt;**Hunter:** The next best thing that's not pushed to healing. Quite far from my playstyle and while it's the class I've tried the most it doesn't click me much.
---
Same. I've tried Hunter so many times at 60 and the playstyle has so many quality of life issues. They fixed a lot of them in BC but so many classes counter you in Vanilla PvP and your damage falls off after BWL.
---
LOL no it is not. 7 days is above average by a decent margin.
---
I kinda want to keep Classic wow to myself. Its part of my history and me, and is something I want to cherish as my own thing
---
Well, that won’t happen because they disappear after server resets...which happen weekly. 
---
But skeletons do persists for up to a week assuming the player responsible for that skeleton does not die somewhere else.
---
Estimated wait time 523 minutes?  That is pretty generous.
---
You lucky SOB, I need tons of sleep
---
They have a time frame listed on the site but it’s 3pm pst in North America on the 26th
---
Watching an interview, hosted by streamers, of *the people who are developing this game*... = You sheep are idolizing these idiots, you're too stupid to even talk to me! Pretentious AF.
---
Downloaded the Warcraft movie so I can put it on repeat while I level!
---
“Grief is the price we pay for love”
---
While that makes sense it might be difficult to determine if someone you invited used those terms or dialogues about it where you could convince them away from their satanic believe.
---
Mount at 40 is going to be another disappointment.  I remember being nowhere near enough gold for my mount at 40.
---
Maybe go play on a PvE server mate.
---
What would you suggest based off of speculation and intuition?
---
Lasagna is always a great one. Fairly easy to make and freezes really well you can just cut it up into serving sized pieces, toss it in the freezer then microwave a piece when hungry.
---
If this is regarding the lfg addon you're the embodiment of arguing from a place of ignorance if you're arguing against it lol.
---
It existed in vanilla.
---
It's literally just a chat parser.
---
Is anyone playing on the RP server? This will be my first time playing one and I thought it would add to the nostalgia. Any tips for a first time RP'r? What add-ons if any will be updated for classic?
---
You seem confident asmonbald won't constantly be at highest ilvl and bis due to his fanboys giving him their left nuts.
---
WeakAuras would break for one, many bossmods, prat.
---
That’s lawbringer helm
---
PoE and EVE were the only ones I could play.
---
Because both PoE and EvE are so different from Classic.
---
But any other MMORPG, I just couldn't.
---
Please kill this.

---
Monday evening at 6:00pm (est) :D
---
Everything you stand for is wrong. Your brother didn’t die from vaccines. Your lying for attention. Grow up
---
Playing Horde and using Will of the Forsaken lol.
---
It's insane how lopsided the Lock/Spriest match up is depending on who is what faction in Classic. An Alliance Lock is going to develop PTSD from Undead Rogues but an Orc Lock will crush 90% of Rogues.
---
And I hope Blizzard bans anyone using such an add-on. I know they won't, but they really really should.
---
I have autism and it was definitely like this in Vanilla.
---
You're argument is moot because modding is an officially supported element of the game. Just because you chose to limit your capabilities doesn't mean others should too.
---
&gt;Definately
---
Enhancement is the best leveling spec for shamans.
---
Oh my goodness I've missed Barrens chat so much!!!
---
I don't think they are a moron, the tech is really impressive and it was initially amazing to see old zones populated again! However, I agree that it ultimately creates an even worse problem (those other players might as well be NPCs) and agree that server merges with no CRZ would have been much better.
---
Is it good advice though? When people move and then are asked to move again. And on the second ask there isn't even anywhere to move because all the realms are essentially full? I don't know man, it just seems there was no point to signing up early. I was already subbed but for the peeps that wasted their half month for no reason, it kinda sucks. Blizzard should do better next time.
---
I'm not sure about mage. Kinda does seem a little boring.
---
Private server refugees.
---
Don't try to talk to them dude. They will just bitch about it.
---
They don't realize that if they ban this addon people will still use battlenet communities, 3rd party websites, discord, whatever.
---
Like jesus this community finds every single thing to complain about once one problem is alleviated. Its now skeletons and LFG tool.
---
Probably food and drinks.
---
Also you may want to snap him back to reality every now and again so he doesn't ignore you.
---
That's smart but kind of scary.
---
Still going to be a nope from me. Ofc they know how many downloaded classic. They know how many active accounts there are, how many dorment accounts (battle.net clients)  who got classic etc.
---
They have specifically said they have contigincy plans for more servers on launch if needed. Right now they are hoping people will spread out more evenly.
---
The wife
---
Totally agree, soon we will have gear score and achievement addons
---
Thx for your comments. You're giving me something to consider, along with fixing mount typo :) 
---
Worked great for me binding the wand/melee buttons to my mouse without too much micro management during last beta. Have you tried it with the WeaponSwingTimer addon?
---
And that's your choice. Others would choose to wait 2 hours if it meant the experience they wanted. Some made sure they were on at the right time to get the name they wanted, and if their server got shutdown because Blizzard decided what was best for that player, whether they agreed or not, theyd be rightly pissed. They have warned us, If you want to wait fine, but you can't say you weren't warned or that Blizzard didn't spoon feed you to a less populated server. No, no let the ignorant learn their lesson, and keep the responsibility with the player where it belongs. I changed servers 3 times, it's not Blizzards fault or anyone else's that people decided not to heed their warning.
---
I’m sorry I said mean things to you. I’m sure you’re a wonderful person.
---
Im going to turn my speakers up to max when I start the game on launch day. Immersion not only for myself, but for the neighbors too
---
If you watched Esfand's chat with the mod author yesterday you would have heard that it's more than that, if both players have the addon it communicates information such as talent specs i.e. labeling a priest speced into holy as a healer. Of course we will take it to the extreme so in the game, it can show the group leader if the rogue they're planning on inviting has (15/31/5) and choose to ignore any rogues that he deems don't have the right spec because why the hell would you invite a rogue that isn't the perfect spec for you when you've got the selection between 30 rogues. The author has explained that ilvl will not be apart of this information so we can be thankful for that.. for now. This was NOT something that was available in vanilla. You couldnt even inspect people and see their spec.
---
I'm glad it's not just me. It made me fucking rage so now I'm female dwarf priest
---
Tbh probably blizzlike
---
There are guides for level 19 twinks on classic wowhead but it gets harder to find stuff after that level. You can easily find the best items for each bracket though by doing filtered searches on wowhead
---
Okay, then a discord bot will come out with very similar functionality that's just slightly worse to use.
---
Yeah... because they were both using the freaking addon and they both clicked "Auto Accept"!  The "Auto Accept" takes away a mouse click!  Show me on the doll where that is "Social Interaction"!!!!  That option is only available to users of the addon... it doesn't force others not using the addon to "Auto Accept".
---
Are you arguing against "Automation" or "Social Interaction"... pick a perspective and stick with it.  Because if you're trying to argue automation... guess what macros are?
---
Great design's
---
And then there's Herod over there in the corner
---
Oh man this is great.  \m/
---
My p.server guild had planned to go to Gehennas, however this update is making us reconsider our plans. Firemaw is now looking mighty attractive. As a PVP server it'll still have **plenty** of people, but hopefully without all the issues of a server that's beyond full. 
---
Either way, my plan is to play Classic on launch, not be stuck looking at a queue screen with hours ticking away into oblivion. Will have to see how things look on launch day!
---
God damn it... Classsicat tip toed around the question about the LFG Addon.
---
They had the chance to talk about it but of course they chose not to.
---
Hell yea I will.  I'm just one cat, but I got the rest of voltron coming with me.  We are gonna slaughter.
---
Um.. these governments already do that.
---
Druid does seem a tad too hard lol.
---
If they weren't so toxic they would be ok to play with. Literally crying the first slow pull or the first time someone dies because of whatever. Then they say YOU take the game too seriously. Xd
---
I stopped playing even retail completely, like I can't find enjoyment there anymore knowing Classic is here soon. And it's not like I haven't been playing retail until now, I'm 438 ilvl which is probably ilvl I'll be for the next few months because I won't turn on BfA until it's over after Classic comes out. 
---
There's nothing holding me there, like every time I login now I think to myself "what the fuck should I do". Another M+ ? No thanks, I liked it in Legion but I've been doing them in BfA only for that shitty score to not be behind, I hate BfA dungeons and the new affix is unfun shit. Weekly raid clear ? Raids are one of the few good thing about BfA, but there's nothing for me anymore. Got my rank 3 essence from there as well as curve and that's it, don't care about more, especially when class design still sucks and my class is not fun to play in raids. PvP? I got duelist in the first two BfA seasons but I can't bring myself to do that garbage anymore, and I used to be mostly a PvP player. But BfA PvP is just laughable. Classic PvP might be unbalanced, but it's more fun and even without arenas than BfA.
---
I started playing Dead by Daylight few weeks ago after like two year pause and honestly I'm having fun, so I'm killing time until Classic comes out with this game.
---
People like you and OP were what created Cataclysm and BFA.
---
I'll pass this on to my mate who's helping me. Thanks for the tip
---
You're the only one replying.
---
"Don't question me" is all I've heard from you.  You're an arrogant prick.
---
If you think being "alt right" is not synonymous with White supremacy, roll on down to the mall on a Saturday with a shirt that reads "I'm Alt-Right" and take in the reaction you get from people.  
---
If you make it out, it probably STILL wouldn't change your closed off mind.
---
You think some old fuck "weaponized" some poeple who had already organized, and had already started dissecting who the fuck they were before he showed up?  You're making a boogeyman out of an affective nobody; while not considering that all he did was jump on the fucking bandwagon that was already rolling.
---
I listened to your response.  Then I refuted it.  You seem to have a problem with that.  That problem...  is not my problem.
---
If you're not chatting to people while completing quests or dungeons and you don't stay in touch that's on you buddy. Unless this goes cross server (lol) it's basically a glorified chat channel. I'm sorry if you met some of your best buddies while spamming for a WC group.
---
That's the theme of the game, Alliance VS Horde, stop being a sensitive carebear. People participate in combat sports like the UFC to fight their opponent as a part of the sport. People play Counter Strike to battle the enemy team. Horde fights Alliance. It's not just lore, it's a game mechanic, that's why they show up in red and PVP servers are a thing. 
---
It's not my lack of empathy, it's your lack of understanding the game. Defeating, outwitting, catching opponents with their pants down and taunting them doesn't have to be malicious, it's fun and it's human nature.
---
Also: I loooove ganking alliance players and making them rage. It gets me off.
---
That is CCU. Players were always 4 times the CCU.
---
And an inkeeper
---
How about: Nope!
---
what is she referring to with "the tree one"?
---
Remember when retail basically made Gearscore a default feature of the game by listing iLevel in your character stats? FUCK THAT, TOO!
---
The toxicity wasn't there because they didn't expect you to have perfect rotations or do x amount of dps. If someone accidentally pulled it was laughed at while you restarted. I hope its the same way but I have a feeling people will be linking dps meters acting like they are good.
---
yeah honestly, people keep saying it ruins social interaction like saying LFM 400 times in /2 enriches your social interaction.
---
Truth
---
Sure thing bro, whatever you say.
---

Hmm...
---
I'm gonna be watching the Warcraft movie for the first time the night before to get myself in the mood.
---
This is my first time and I’m gonna find my own way :)
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
It goes against the spirit of classic, which the classic devs have said they will break addons that do that. Just because we had the same addon capabilities in vanilla doesnt mean we should have this in classic. GTFO with your LFR bootlicker bullshit.
---
While cookies seem like a kind and sincere gesture, they are likely a bad idea. In order to ingest a cookie, your boyfriend will likely have to look away from his screen and disable his mouse or keyboard hand to pick it up. In addition the glutin content of such a smack is likely to lower is long-term efficiency. I would recommend instead a lent style supplement and a straw long enough to remain in his mouth for the entirety of launch month comfortably. In addition, you boyfriend will need large amounts of stimulants in order to stay awake for the first 730 or so hours. This stimulant, likely caffine, should be mixed into the supplement in decent quantities.
---
BRD is definitely the longest if you aren’t going for a specific kill. Lots of running back and forth. 
---
ST and LBRS share the 2nd place spot because people might not know the path, especially LBRS.  Even now I get completely lost in that place.
---
I was there, the autor is changing it due to feedback, people will need to opt in if they want to show it to others. It's a valid issue, but it's cherrypicked, and a detail that most people that are complaining are not even familiar with.
---
Login music for sure
---
Ever? Or later in a phase?
---
BGs will arrive in phase 3 (AV, WSG) and phase 4 (AB).  You can walk out to queue for them, or use a battlemaster in a major city.
---
The Elwynn Forest theme will always be the most nostalgic for me personally.
---
Yeah, but you'll still need to take hours out of your day to run dungeons.
---
Defiantly and definitely are two different things. I believe you were going for Definitely
---
Bgs don't come out til phase 3.  You can queue for them in major cities
---
Retail is a completely different game at this point with a completely different audience. There's simply no way to square that circle without alienating one group or the other.
---
I'm just hoping Classic is successful enough to demonstrate there's still a market for old-school "the world is the main character" game design and at least a couple developers start building something to fill the void that's existed there for the past decade.
---
Of course, I get this is hard, and it may be the lesser of two evils. Just saying that Blizzard is trying to get people to switch and for many, they are strongly discouraged to do so.
---
Light candles and lock the door. Don’t leave the tape in the VCR!
---
That's because if you're 27 you're a milennial.
---
The best way to not let LFG addons work is to not add them. If enough people aren't using them, they won't succeed. It's that simple
---
The real problem is gamers give in too easy, and will have every single LFG addon available because boycotts never work. I'll never forget the CoD boycott and how massively successful that boycott was
---
No joke. Take out that iLvL bullshit, something that was never in classic to begin with, and this picture looks pretty damn handy.
---
So it's not a simple chat parser. If people were aware of this function they'd be even more pissed. Ok, sure, theres an opt in eventually. That doesn't stop the group leader from ignoring anyone that hasn't opted in.
---

Same as gnome. It's not too bad really, once you get to menethil harbor the only real walking is from the village to the starting area of teldrasil.
---
I haven't played in ages. So not really sure what will be fun.
---
It auto-invites.
---
Maybe you should stay in retail with all your QoLs. You should try thanking the vanilla enthusiasts and the private community that make Classic a reality, and continue to ride their coattail instead of trying to ruin it with BFA features.
---
People hate on ST but I love it
---
I already switched. I want to play and not wait in a queue. Too old and too employed for this shit.
---
last time i checked it was high population also at least it's not shazzrah
---
You're going to want to try, as soon as phase 2 comes out level 60s will be looking for kills for Honor. If you are on a pvp server
---
*until next expansion
---
Sprich deutsch du hurensohn
---
I think almost every add-on I've seen that appears to be 'popular' for the start of classic looks and functions BETTER than similar add-ons that existed in Vanilla. People are just better at making add-ons now than they were 15 years ago. There were chat channel parsing LFG type add-ons in Vanilla. They looked more barebones than what this new LFG classic add-on does (altho Call to Arms was a pretty good interface for it's day), but ultimately they did the same thing.
---
I also find it funny when streamers complain about a LFG add-on. When the \*\*\*\* are they going to spend an hour messaging in a chat channel "LFG, need tank/healer"? They can just pick and choose among their followers and get a dungeon run going. Same for people already in guilds that have 40 or 50 members or more already.
---
[Not quite](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Foggy_MacKreel)!

Yeah he's not getting it, we all just want to make sure he knows it takes hours to do dungeons.

---
Oh!  Well shit, I GOT YOU!  
---
&gt; ...what happens when this addon gets traction and everyone starts using it. 
---
**Answer:**  People will find groups faster because it automates making chat messages for LFM/LFG, and has a handy, selectable "Auto Accept" feature when an invite window appears.
---
Now you can move on to "Both sides MUST have Shaman/Paladins, you're ruining the game!!!" posts.
---
If you focus on only leveling 1 profession or 2 that ties into each other, and solely focus on leveling. You're going to land on 7-8 days /played. I made it in 6d 11h on a shadow priest on Nost without using any kind of efficient leveling while leveling tailor/enchanting. While not a perfect measurement, I doubt it will take you 10 days unless you go out of your way to do something else that doesn't give XP.  
---
Your biggest time sink this time around is going to be queues, I expect several hours on FULL servers for the first 2 weeks.
---
I was responding to somebody talking about a specific 2v1 scenario.  You are talking about something I am not referring to.  
---
Now, regarding your scenario.  If the warrior’s mother did not drop them when they were a child you will be getting kept in combat while deadzoning with shouts.  If you go beyond deadzone you get intercepted.  I’m inclined to think the warriors you are facing just installed WoW.
---
I die a little inside when I hear that noise.
---
Can you stop spamming me now I'm done talking to you ty.
---
I was actually 19 when I started playing vanilla... was I an adult?
---
Ignorance is ignoring logic, which you have done this whole time. You have done nothing but try and use alterior reasons to justify your position which is laughable - bottom line, again, you like to attack people with different opinions and call them slurs because you can't win intellectually - good luck winning the game of life with that mindset
---
They did actually say in the AMA that LFG addons break the Classic experience, which they don't want. They also said they will be breaking certain addons.
---
I wish it was too obvious. But I know how lazy people are and should be reminded of serious health issues that can occur.
---
Trying to relive the past. Interest will drop quick. Btw I’m a vanilla OG and still play to this day.
---

Everyone loves to quote Ion's Blizzcon discussion that they won't allow these sorts of addons, while simultaneously shitting on Ion for lying about everything. So which one is it?

Thanks a lot for your open source app.

I use docker at home, so made a quick dockerfile for anyone else that wants to spin it up that way.

thats probably 40 level 60 horde killing a handful of level 5 newbies since thats all they are good for
---
And so we're back in BfA. That's why this addon needs to be canned.
---
Question: How does me using an addon that removes the gryphons next to the actions bars impact your game?
---
There are not fewer quests for any particular level, however there are usually not enough quests in one particular **zone** for you to level up to go to the adjacent zone but have no fear, you can easily quest your entire way to 60 without ever grinding mobs just for XP - it just takes a lot of zone hopping to do.
---
I think it's also important to point out that while there are some quest chains that are very long and takes you through multiple zones and instances, in general each zone has its own lore and its own things that needs dealing with.
---
As far as following a "lore path", there are usually quest givers that asks you to visit NPCs in other zones to give some directions but once you've visited your faction's capitol you can pretty much choose what lore you want to experience and which path to go from there, it's all up to you.

I met an Orc Warrior named Rakhanishu one time outside of Karazhan. We /waved and I took a Screenshot of us, it was lovely. The horde on our server was mostly pleasant to interact with, lol. We are tentatively going to roll on Thalnos, but may switch due to the High pop potential. I'll hit you up if we change, how is Grobbulus looking right now?
---
Leveled a priest to 60 in classic, it was my 2nd character so it took much less time than my main(mage). Priest level surprisingly fast, I'd put them in a tier below hunter/druid/affliction lock. Once you get spirit tap maxed (level 14) you're looking at very little downtime and a lot of survivability.
---
She said "game all night", assuming it was just like a new game he was gonna binge all night because it was new. He said "all fall" meaning he was gonna binge the entire fall season lol
---
This would legit work on my wife I think. She always wants to customize my character but it disappointed by the lack of customization.

Healers are always going to have a harder time than DPS when farming. It sucks, but it's just how it is. But there are still plenty of options to make gold as a resto druid.
---
Avoid 1v1 mob fights. You're best bet is to do AoE farming with moonfire, insect swarm, and hurricane. Find mobs that you can kill decently quickly with this strategy and you'll be fine.
---
Professions, of course. Making money with professions is also an option.
---
You can also find a DPS partner to farm with you'll do excellent. You can provide DPS support plus heals. You'll be able to pull large numbers with minimal downtime.
---
These are just some basics. There's lots of guides out there that can give you some other good ideas for how to make gold. Google around and I'm sure you'll find something you like.
---
I have small hands too, and i really reccomend the Naga! Takes some time to get used to, but i reach all buttons just fine 😁
---
What part of this is BC? BC has harder dungeons. Vanilla dungeons are amazing but they’re not very difficult unless you’re underleveled
---
Slightly dodgy 😊

I was with you until this.

They should have actually spread stuff out more Imo, so people would love between capitals and not just stand in one and spend all time online there.
---
I remember there was a quest in Darkshore, "[Deep Ocean, Vast Sea](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=982/deep-ocean-vast-sea)" that was legendarily despised by the playerbase. I don't know the quest myself because I never leveled a NE, but I remember it having a very special reputation among the community.

there's something about the simplicity of trekking through the Valley of Trials with your low level gray weapon, tracking down the Burning Blade Coven after genociding vile familiars, running around aimlessly, killing felhounds and fiends before finally coming across that glimmering pick-axe that Thrazz'ril left behind in the center of the cavern

Also, adding HAHAHAHAHAHAHA to the end of your post really doesn't make you sound down to earth... at all. It actually kind of highlights that you're pretentious.

Aim for pre-raid bis dungeon gear. Then see if a guild is open to having an item be bought if dropped.
---
That's my goal. Best I can do in the time allotted +one hell of a weapon that has no business being on an all blue character. Can't wait.
---
I used to pick Dragonlance character names. I still do, but I used to, too.
---
basically this:

---
As far as I know, the problem is the amount of data that needs to be sent by the server, because as number of players increases linearily, the amount of data increases exponentially.
---
For example, if you have 10 players in a zone, all of them will need to be sent updates about themselves and all the others. So it's 10 players times 10 players, or 100 "packets" to be sent.
---
If you have 100 players in a zone, that formula becomes 100 x 100 = 10 000 packets. Number of players increased ten times, amount of data increased a hundred times.
---
And note that the data needs to be sent multiple times a second. An the faster/more action-y the game is, the more often the data needs to be sent. World of Warcraft, being an entirely tab-target MMORPG, can probably get away with 10 updates per second. Planetside 2, being a first person shooter, would probably require something like 30.
---
&gt;To my knowledge, the only real massively multiplayer games are Planetside 2 and Eve online. I've never played Eve online, but it seems that they have some sort of time dilatation cheat to make the rendering of huge battles possible.
---
Not only that, but EVE quite famously has very low update rate of once per second.
---
&gt;Planetside 2 gives a real sense of "massiveness", but I wonder if there's not some dev fuckery underneath that has more to do with illusion than with server capacity.
---
Planetside 2 has a hard limit how many other players you can actually "see". All other players are simply not rendered and you cannot interact with them. This is easy to see in really packed places like Tower-style bases, where you can just run around and see other players pop into existence right in front of you. I don't know what the exact number of players is, but my gut tells me around 100.
---
I'm torn between NE Hunter and UD Mage, specifically for the purposes of PvP. I have played extensively on a private server that is instant level-60, and have a good grasp of both classes. What the private server lacks is WPvP (retro-wow) so I am curious as to how both those classes compare at the 1-60 grind.  
---
In your opinion, which class is better for PvP/WPvP and why? Which is more enjoyable overall?
---
It increases demand for gold as suddenly people have an extra uses for it, thereby increasing it's value, causing more people to farming, which has an impact on various prices throughout the game.
---
While you can argue (and be right) if you say that Neil buying gold from Bob means Nell will farm less you need to remember there's a delay between Bob farming it and Neil "not farming" it.
---
I might as well just stay in my full realm and see what happens.
---
The answer is easy, you CANT have infinite capacity on a server. Layers are going to be remove, do you want 60K+ people in one server?  also some lag issues
---
You need queues.
---
Addons like this just seem to be doing the same thing they did in retail. Soon this one will display ilvl, then mc completions etc etc. Everyone gets reduced down to a number then we're in the same boat.
---
By the way, between level 10-20 wouldn't your spirit be so minimal, and your wand so powerful, that alternating between 'spirit tap' and 'wand spec' makes a lot of sense?
---
Who gives a fuck. Jesus, dont you people work during the day...

---
What are you on about?  You can write your own macros in game.
---
I doubt you even play before WotLK if you want this much automation in an addon.
---
Where?
---
All the 'normal' servers are long full, too
---
Exactly. Especially with how much of a grind classic will be I’ll only have time for one character so it has to be good.
---
Once you have an active sub you can install the game. There will be a drop-down in the WoW section of the launcher to choose classic.
---
You can log into classic right now and go through character creation, this is how people are reserving names. You can create up to 3 characters right now to reserve names, you cannot log into the game with those characters.
---
I do not mind the names that much, but saying "Golemagg" in Norwegian sounds like some horrible thirdworld language, like danish.
---
So i wouldnt play on that. But there are alot of cool names to choose from, its strange why they've chosen such bad ones
---
 No the brand Virgin
---
I would not be stunned if they offer a TBC based sever if classic brings them enough cash.
---
I had my fiance try a P-server out before the stress tests even started. She said she liked it, and she was excited. Now she seems so unhyped about it. I don't know what happened. I'm just gonna get her a sub and hope she likes it. I explained all the classes to her when helping her decide what she wanted to play. She's gonna be my pocket healer (I didn't force her to heal, just works since I am a warrior). I hope she enjoys the game as much as I do. She seems super mad that I'm gonna be spending a ton of time on the game, but if she likes it maybe she won't care as much. Shes the kinda girl who needs "us" time every night,  I love her but I just wanna play games sometimes.

Our guild farmed out as many shadowmournes as we could after we killed 25H LK. It was such a great legendary.

They have made clear the bones of their argument.

I'm a dota 2 addict. No issue here
---
People watching too many vanilla Rogue pvp videos tailor made to make the guy look badass while he's fighting a bunch of undergeared/underleveled players, or just plain noobs (and ofc he never shows the times where he dies)
---
Granted, Rogues are nasty af in pvp and it's my favorite class to play, but we aren't unkillable gods.
---
Then the addon moves to a website and they get ad revenue.  Theres no automation in game and just an easier interface to find players/groups.

Okay
---
In phase 2 Blizz will add the honor ranking system, but no BG. Now what might happen is the same as in 2000back, TM vs SS war zone. Everyone will be there and fighting each other to farm honor for rank 14. The thing is killing lvl 50-59 players also give honor, so for sure there are going to be groups that farms those also. Last thing is, layers  will be gone by phase 2.
---
Hillsbrad will become a war zone where lvling will be impossible, STV will also become a war zone, Desolace will have refugees from STV and then it'll becomes a war zone, Zones 50-59 all war zones because of people farming lvl 50-59 players to get that rank 14.
---
The daze dismount was hilarious
---
Wait, correct me if I'm wrong but there's no way in hell you're doing level 20ish in 1h?
---
Well, sleep or masturbation time, but who the fuck is giving up bate time?
---
Blizzard has said that medium will have queues
---
see you back in retail when 8.2.5 hits
---
Another " do this" post , fuck you
---
Yeah, vsync introduces extra input lag while a framerate limiter doesn't. It also drops you to 30 fps if you go below 60 while a framerate limiter will just let it run as fast as it can up to the limit you set which usually gives a smoother experience.
---
I tend to lean towards ASOIAF for some of mine lol
---
I think it took me like six months to a year to hit level 60 on my mage during classic because I was in high school and had other stuff to do. 
---
Now I’m old, disabled, and with no life. Extreme hardcore here I come :D
---
I spent like $100 trying to get the fucking Olympic skin for d.va. I got literally everything but the only one I actually wanted.
---
I think you mean, take two Zeppelins...
---
who the fuck cares. if you want to play a gnome protection warrior, go for it
---
&gt; What I'm arguing: Automating shit = bad. 
---
So... macros in general.
---
Going mage as well, and the biggest con for me as a gnome is that it's a gnome haha I love having more real estate to show off my gear.
---
and  Harpy Lieutenants
---
Im not pretentious! Also, take my order, you are beneath me.
---
Keep getting downvoted for saying "Blizzard haven't released enough servers". Is this place seriously that full of fanbois that the almighty Blizzard that made a complete fuck-up of Retail can do no wrong?
---
Or lifegiving gem
---
I think I had it right from the beginning but now when I close my eyes I'm not sure anymore
---
Yeah it makes sense, basically it doesn’t matter if I pick the herb and lose the sale or sell the ore and buy the herbs. Or vice versa
---
I think the biggest part of it that they will break is the part where it automatically invites, because they have said before that one button click should be one action, nothing should be automated. I think that's right anyways.
---
I'd counter, that's also adjusting equivalency points that are adjusted for every class, adjusts based on your spec, even adjusts based on what your current stats are.  So yeah, maybe comparing a rogue vs rogue that are both sword spec... yeah you could get a direct equivalency value, but that's it.
---
You can't really compare that equivalency number of a sword rogue to a combat dagger rogue and definitely can't compare that to a mage or to a fury warrior.  That's the issue, you're getting apples to oranges once you change specs and class.
---
Exactly!  Its kind of frustrating lol
---
Well said.
---
Visually compare them then.
---
Yeah honestly my biggest pro tip to all the people in this thread talking about their limited time is to get some form of remote desktop set up (chrome remote desktop is free and works fine for this purpose) so they can just remote in from their phone to their home pc to hop in queue before they drive home from work etc.  I doubt it'll be that huge of an issue after the first week or two, but a good tip for basically anything like this where queues are expected.
---
I feel you, this has seemed like the longest week.
---
If it was Velen wouldn’t it have only been introduced in TBC?
---
Confirmed on Esfands classic cast our boy Omar confirmed he is switching sides and going horde as a shaman! Lok'tar Omar!
---
edit: here is the source [https://clips.twitch.tv/ConcernedTransparentFalconJonCarnage](https://clips.twitch.tv/ConcernedTransparentFalconJonCarnage)
---
But that's good, why would they accept people on random greenies or without the required resistance gear?   
---
  The difference is that full raid gear might not be the best in classic, even worse when it comes to specific encounters which may require resistances, an ilvl/retail LFG system is dumb and irrelevant in classic, but just because ilvl is irrelevant it doesn't means gear isn't extremely important.
---
I don't know why they don't just have both versions available the whole time.  Some people like the look of the unarmored or armored more.
---
Should meet those liverless boars in Westfall
---
People in goldshire drop cloths, that's known
---
Character name is important in the sense that I want something fitting and cool but I have tons of options, so I didn't bother saving a name.
---
Macros don’t automate shit. Not to that extent.
---
Where? Medium right now might become high or full at launch, but afaik a medium pop server should never have queues.
---
Hey guys!
---
Me and my girlfriend is going to play Most of the time together. I have played some wow before but my gf is brand New. New to mmos in general. She seems most interested in hunter (she wants to dps) but not set in stone. Im trying to decide between warlock and pally.
---
What do you guys Think? Is hunter a good beginner class and if yes, what does it pair best with? Wl or pally?
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=Do+i+need+a+subscrption+to+play+classic+wow%3F Try that.
---
Sorry what?
---
I have a full time job and two small children, im going to be as efficient as possible. I want to run high level dungeons with my friends! So i have to go as fast as possible, because my time is very limited.
---
Roll up in there with your crew!  Ready for a dance off!!!
---
I'll be using a guide, but not to rush to 60. I want to make sure I get every quest in an area before I leave it, and since quest givers don't have markers on the minimap it can be hard to find all of them.
---
It's important to me that it just feels right for my character, and I actually like how it sounds because you will be hearing it in chat and over discord.
---
You are retarded and I can’t wait to gank you until you uninstall.. what server are you rolling on?
---
Right on, that’s what I figured. I just wanted to be sure I wasn’t making a mistake by heading over early!
---
Thanks again, it really is appreciated
---
STOP. CRYING.
---
And you're still playing right? ^Right?
---
just get an addon that shows questgivers on the map instead of a guide
---
And in the 4 guilds I was in from launch of vanilla till end of BC, they were mandatory.
---
Except he didn't at all...so keep on praying that they are going to get rid of something that literally just reads the chat and parses the chat?
---
It isn't going away.
---
They sprinkled some crack on him.
---
How cute. You think you need specific classes to run a dungeon. You can do any dungeon content with a tank, healer and 3 DPS, as long as no ones a complete dipshit. Even then, as long as the tank and healer are good, you can get away with carrying an afk DPS.
---
That's what I'm worried about- that I won't be able to experience the end game content when it's relevant because I'm not turbo rushing to max level ASAP.
---
Yes, you can swim to the east, but that still takes some time and there’s a mob camp.
---
No. Pserver thing
---
Yeah man it’s called world of Warcraft not world of peace craft
---
I paid for 2 extra accounts just to have extra chances at getting my name.  Sadly I got #2 on my list and didn't get #1.

---

---
Dabu Omar!
---
what a clusterfuck of a bad meme , shame on you
---
Ok let's talk strategy:
---
As soon as you're free from work/school on Friday, drive home *carefully* - pay extra attention, no distractions, no impairing substances. 
---
Stop at the grocery store on the way home, but a decent store (not Walmart - minimize your risks!). Buy: 4 gallons of water (you want ~1/2 gallon per day, plus extra just in case), 2 loaves of bread, 1 large jar of peanut butter, 1 large box/bag of kale, and 1 large bag of carrots.
---
At home: lock all doors and windows, set the A/C to 70, and turn off/unplug all electronics except the fridge. Wash your kale and carrots thoroughly, then store all food and half the water in the fridge. At 8:00am, 12:00pm, and 5:00pm you may eat 1 peanut butter sandwich (use a SPOON to spread) along with your choice of a handful of kale or 1-2 carrots (whole, NOT sliced) along with 1 glass of water. Additionally, you should drink 1 glass of water at 10:00am, 1:00pm, 3:00pm, 7:00pm and 9:00pm, with more as needed. 
---
You should go to bed at 10:00pm and wake up at 7:00am. In the morning you should brush your teeth for 2 minutes (gently) and rinse with non-alcoholic mouthwash, take a bath (or a sitting shower) in lukewarm water, and spend 30 minutes doing yoga stretches. Between breakfast and lunch, you should do about 30 minutes of light exercise (push-ups, sit-ups) with adequate stretching before and after. Do this again between lunch and dinner, and one more time at 8:00pm.
---
Otherwise you are to sit or lay quietly, using no electronics. You may read a book if you wear oven mitts while doing so. You may write or draw, but only in crayon. There will be no cooking, no going outside, no sharp objects, and no variation from the schedule. You may sit 5 feet away from a window (blinds drawn) for 30 minutes per day to get your vitamin D.
---
On Monday, approximately 3 hours before servers open you may plug in your computer &amp; monitor, sign into the servers, and then step away. You will perform very light stretching and exercise in between taking moments to keep your account active on the character screen. When servers open, play until you die.
---
So you think they will make zero profit with wow classic? I think they will significantly increase profit even if only for a month not a huge percentage but even 1% is a shit ton of money
---
It was so boring, I just had to stop after like an hour
---
Yeah engineering is great for sure. Lots of cool items you can make. It's not a must though unless you will grind for high PvP rank or are super hardcore. It's a fun profession though, access to cool items. If you go for it you will not regret it.
---
you spelled hunters wrong
---
Yeah, the people bitching about people using guides act like they weren't just alt tabbing to look shit up on thottbot all the time back in the day lol. It's the same shit, just put together better.
---
&gt;5 minutes to switch layers? Hell no, a minute absolute tops, probably closer to 30 seconds, with an SSD you're blowing through the loading screens on the alt account supplying level 1's. Checking 50 layers would not take me 4 hours, it would probably take me about 30 minutes.
---
Devs already said that you're locked to layer for at least several minutes after you log out.  That's where I'm getting the 5 minutes from.
---
I do admit multiboxing with 2 accts would be x2 as fast as I originally calculated; if both you and your alt log on/off, you are likely to get 2 new fresh layers, at least until you've started getting through most of them and start repeating layers.
---
If blizz really wanted to gate this, they could just put a layer lock on character for \~10 minutes after gathering a rare node.
---
I’m sure. Good thing I haven’t played since WotLK lol
---
SAME. I'm sitting here bored af no wanting to play anything else
---
Im naming my RP toon Grandpa. Not telling why
---
Human Mage for me. My first ever alliance character and still my  main in retail until I retire him for Classic.
---
I'm on Herod since my friend wants me there, what realm for you?
---
!
---
It's been said that Play is learning in a safe environment. Don't be afraid. Jump right in. You can't play WoW wrong - literally impossible. Make a new character and figure things out at your own pace. So what if it took 2 mins to figure out zoom. That was time well spent. Google is your friend.
---
"How do I install WoW?"
---
"How do I move in WoW?"
---
Etc, etc.
---
Zoomers wanna zoom
---
It's in Darkshore that I fell in love with the game :)
---
I played a holy priest in wrath and I was a big fan. I've seen basically everyone saying night elf is awful, it's just my favorite race so I was considering it. 
---
Is undead the best option for horde priest? I think I've seen some people talking about troll, but I would much prefer the undead priest combination compared to troll. If the difference is as stark as night elf vs dwarf then maybe I could swap
---
Subnautica has been a great distraction for me.
---
Dun Morogh music by far. I think about it at least 5 times a day, especially when I’m in a bad mood. Lifts me up always
---
Its just a joke at retail. Retail is easy compared to Vanilla. Is it your first time playing wow? 6 hours seems a bit long.
---
&gt;How does signing up for a pug work? Do I just use dungeon finder?
---
There's no dungeon finder.
---
How it usually works is that the group leader just starts spamming LFM in LFG chat while standing in IF/Orc, typically for most stuff they want you to show up in person for a quick inspect just to make sure you aren't in full greens.  There are also pugs that are more scheduled where they will announce the date and time for pugs in advance and you can sign up on discord or by talking to them, often these runs are on every reset so it's nice for people who can make it every time, but new players are also constantly joining.

shut up you stupid horde!
---
So you **do** understand the desire to have a cohesive community that can communicate with each other.  
---
It seems you want this for yourself.. why can't you understand why another community might as well?
---
&gt;ITS LIKE MAKIN MAGIC FROM THE SIMS 1 BUT FOR THE SIMS 4!
---
I legit thought you guys were talking about the next MTG set until this part.
---
hunter is the easiest class to play. high dps and great solo ability for questing. very good in groups if you know your class. warriors are the best tanks but are very gear dependent. can be rough to level if it's your first time in the game.
---
I see
---

The name is the name of a monk that I leveled with my dad and brother. I don't remember what happened but I left him at 70~. After that I was able to get 1 of the warglaives on him still at 70~ .I never actually had the motivation to level him more but never deleted him.
---
That’s what I told my wife and kids last week and they have not been around since to rebuttal.
---
That’s why you take them swimming on the first date
---
Exactly
---
70 ping from DC to LA data center is certainly noticeable vs 20 ping on the Chicago data centers
---
The auto invite is the only part that kinda sucks - BUT.
---
But: People have to remember that we still do have server communities. And it's actually kinda fun to find random people every now and then. You can still kick people after they have been invited and people from your ignore list would also never be invited since their messages don't get through.
---
Also, people who don't want to use it don't have to. Arguably it's better since then you'll ONLY play with likeminded people who are against this addon and prefer a more thorough form of communication. And you'd then NOT queue up with people who are simply in for the quick dungeon run. Arguably this is a win-win for both sides.
---
That's the spirit !
---
If you have the money and free time available then yah. From what I can remember pre cataclysm it was a very fun time.  There is a ton of grinding at high lvl and quests require you to actually read them. Getting to lvl 60 isn’t a quick journey unless you’re a veteran or played on a private server. 
---
Honestly if you have a sub to Wow already it’s pretty cool that we get to explore areas precataclysm and postcataclysm all for one sub fee.
---
By staying Herod or going Skeram?
---
Of course, Blizzard listened to people like the OP and thus their game went to shit.
---
Paladins are far from useless in raids or 5 mans.  In 5s you can go as heals or dps and nobody’s gonna really give you shit, tanking will be harder tho.
---
For raids you can either be the leaders friend and get to be the one Ret for BoK or you’ll just have to heal.
---
Tho since you’re playing with friends for leveling you should be fine.  As for soloing you will actively have to try and die.  It’s a slower leveling process but you are effectively immortal.

Do what you gotta do. Set aside some time to binge launch night / day after if you can, get some good time in with your buds. Then after that, strict timetable for how much you can play.
---
I don't know how severe your issues with the game were, but if you're seriously concerned, give a close friend your password and have them setup time restrictions on your account (if you have a consistent schedule).

Or, just be the RL and masterloot the bindings to yourself.

Who is that quote from? I’m not discrediting it, just curious. But jeez I may switch then.

I haven't complained on the subject, nor do I intend to as I see why they are doing it, but it is a little (VERY LITTLE) disappointing. The huge battlefield of dead bodies during a PvP fight was kinda cool. Not enough to ruin my game though, is what it is

---
what is a mount off competition?
---
Downloaded.
---
Ooh, that’s a great tip! Ironically I was thinking about that too.
---
As far as leveling professions go, I was aiming for Skinning (to vendor), and First Aid. I was going to wait til 40 and get a mount before switching to Mining/Eng (faster node runs), or just until 60.
---
Do you think that’s a sound strategy (if so, what’s be a solid 2nd prof?), or should I just start Mining/Eng?
---
My worry is that I’ll outpace my mining and have it be useless until I go back and level it, in which I’d lose a lot of vendored leather money.
---
Not too surprising; bit of a shame though.  Buuuuuuut I'm in the US and have Netflix, so there's that.
---
I also played ESO recently and coming from that the most jarring change is self-rooted casting. It takes some getting used to because most of your hard hitting abilities have a cast time and you can't move.
---
The easiest transitions from ESO IMO are Hunter and Warlock because they have more instant things that can be cast on the move.
---
I played a Warlock in WoTLK and will be doing that again in Classic.

It's okay to disagree.

Ion disagrees with you. That's enough for me to confirm that we are on the right track.

I'm by no mean a purist, but this will split the community up unless it isn't a standard feature. Which it will never be. That's what I am personally worried about. Try and read that out loud.
---
Look in not saying Blizzard is wrong. But if we assume that this is a random sample which it seems to be... does that make Stalagg the most populous NA server before calculating margin of error?
---
But that would mean certain people would have that advantage and the average player wouldn't. But, I can't see how that would stay a secret for long anyways, so you make a good point. It would just be a game of cat and mouse for blizzard to waste resources on.

Try not to get triggered by me getting triggered, tough guy. Or maybe try to differentiate between disliking something and being a sensitive cry baby. What does that make you? Try rubbing two brain cells together before you get salty, planner.

I've got the same issue. On a positive note I am getting a lot more done around the house now because I don't get sucked into games or movies or books or.... really anything other than classic WoW.
---
For our friends wife it wasn’t that hard. We already play some games together and we already have fun doing it, so we just stoked the FOMO flames with her. 
---
“Come hang out with us!”
---
I think it’s good if you can get her started ( a little late now) playing games with your other friends. Jack Party box. CIV. Borderlands. Anything you can get. I think she enjoys our collective company, so it never hurts to have the peer pressure.
---
TL;DR
---
Yes they can scale up the servers to literally hold millions of players. However the plan is to remove layering in phase 2 when the population has naturally declined down to around blizz-like population(and enforcing queues for servers that won't die down). So in order for servers not to get 20k queue once that happens, they are putting hard limits on the pop on servers.
---
We need to bury this information. This man has released knowledge too horrifying for mortal minds.

Keep it secret.

Keep it safe.

Nice! This is a really good tool for researching pets. The only thing I'd like to see added is the total number of training points spent with the levels you select for each ability.
---
For example, [if you look at this site](https://www.bobo-talents.com/pets/?f=9&amp;l&amp;d=bgMfZ9ZgZe5gszPBq) you can see that it tells you how many points you've spent on the abilities you've selected and how many you have left to use.

---
Repair bots were a thing but it's not like you wanted to drop them all over the place. I only really remember seeing them in raids.
---
I'd wait a week or two to take those days off, if I were you. IIRC, world record for 1-60 is like 4 or 5 days, so even if you take them, you won't reach 60 in 2 days and if you're going to take time off work to play WoW, might as well do it when the servers are stable and queues are more manageable.
---
This stuff would probably really damn annoying to me if it ever happened lol, but it's still kinda funny. My guild's one mage was getting bored and frustrated at Azuregos one day when another guild was making a pretty lame attempt at it. So, our mage got aggro on Azzie and started running over towards the cliff area. Azzie followed of course and when she was right on the very edge of the cliff, did the summon move. It ported our mage along with the whole guild doing an attempt, right over the edge to their deaths. The laughter on vent continued for quite awhile.

I had the feeling of crack when I played Stardew Valley for awhile. I booted it up yesterday to farm for the Dinosaur Egg because I never actually found one in my ~160 hours of playtime. I found it in the first 10 minutes and very much had a "Now what" moment.
---
I would assume I’d be bottom of the totem to get a drop if I’m not there for the first part of the Raid.
---
I don't what space-time universe you're in, but for me, classic is being released in 5 days and dire maul will not be in it. So the fact that dire maul loot exists in the future, way past when I plan to be doing MC, is really irrelevant to the discussion.
---
Not as bad as [this](https://imgur.com/a/xXgWBSt).
---
Any of that /run stuff will pop up a window asking you if you're sure you want to get banned
---
I'm not saying he's lying at all, but that banning a LFG addon would required stopping players from being able to send data messages to each other... so it would also effectively break other addons like multiplayer Peggle and DPS meters that sync between players to be more accurate.

I watch this and Jimmy: a World of Warcraft story on a REGULAR basis, too good.
---
Warrior leveling only sucks 2/3rds of the time. 40-60 isnt horrible and you can tank dungeons up to 50 as arms if you keep a sword and shield with you. First aid will be a must. 
---
Mages have a much easier go of leveling and are sought after in most groups. 
---
In pvp I would rather be the mage while leveling but if you like melee that go do that.
---
Right. Then everyone would reroll on a server together.

Need help deciding between Warrior and Shaman. Both classes have positives for me so I'm mainly focused on the negatives. I'm new to classic and only know 1 other person who is going to play, so while we can level together, I might be on my own frequently. This on top of the difficulty of warrior leveling seems tough, especially as I will probably not be no lifing it. 
---
For shamans, the number of keybinds worries me. I realize the solution is just git gud, but I still don't like feeling like I need to be an octopus to play my class optimally. Additionally, my favorite race is Forsaken, which would rule out shaman, although I'm not opposed to Orc or Tauren.

#**DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**
---
Depends on the run and how hard it was to form the group.
---
You still have 4 days folks, get out while you still can! Dont come back for the rest of us!
---
Could have sworn that I have seen that already.
---
This addon doesn't make finding people any faster though.
---
You’ve spend more time on writing this compared to finding out if there is a subscription
---
Don't listen to your friends.
---
Lots of people will assume that just because Warriors are better tanks than Druids (and they are), it means Bears can't tank, but they can.
---
Some with Cat DPS, sure, it's not going to be topping meters, but it will be average if just played good and well above average if played great.
---
Again, same fucking thing with Healing, sure Druids are no Priests, no question about it, but just because they're not the best doesn't mean they're useless.
---
If you listened to some folks, every tank should be Warriors, every healer should be Priests and every DPS should be Mage/Lock/Rogue/Warriors.
---
In between MotW, Innervate, Battle Res and the ability to save the day when shit hits the fan, a good Druid will always be a great asset to any raid, but you'll certainly have to work your ass off and build yourself a good reputation before you get invited to raids, rather than having to beg to get into one.
---
Is Paladin (any spec) able to take on the world elites solo? Even if through a battle of attrition due to their healing?
---
I'd like to be a holy crusader of types who can stand toe to toe or even one against many with the baddest lvl 61 and 62 of mobs in the wild.
---
&gt; You can really only talk about /played times when referring to people who are primarily interested in getting level 60.
---
Yeah, I don't agree. If I'm saying "super casual" I'm talking about some average time, which will include people being calm in play.
---
We just have to push back and actively shun people that use it. ;)
---
Strict rule of no Doritos in my house. I'll eat a family sized bag of Cool Ranch in a sitting, and then feel disgusting the rest of the night.
---
How does it do that? You know the addon doesn't prevent you from asking to join their groups just because you don't have it... right?
---
Yeah... Ten pushbacks.. then you scatter... Then you feign. Then you LoS. Whew.
---
Yup
---
People that dont want to play with assholes care
---
Thank you for your feedback and the suggestion!
---
I will implement this during the next few days!
---
I see. Didnt play horde no
---
Exactly. This stuff was so bad in vanilla that hunters got a reputation for it. Its scary to see hunters in these comments talking about being a liability to your gearing.
---
But the "How I think I will look" is actually how you do look in PvP.
---
Kind of a weird addon to get upset over unless it became unofficially required somehow. I won’t be using it tho.
---
Under 5 days is the world record speed run. You are saying in 7-8 calendar days they will level? Unless they are playing 20+ hours a day, I doubt it
---
I never quit a group because of wipes. The only time I would leave is if it's getting too late or for real life obligations. But as long as I have time to play WoW, I'm not leaving any group no matter how many wipes. So no upper limit for me.
---
You putting in more work to use an outdated guide than it would take to use an up to date guide.
---

---
Now there's some politics I can get invested in!
---
Ye fuck insert faction scums
---
&gt;I knew plenty of people, myself included who used call to arms or vqueue. 
---
Interesting.
---
I don't think the addon is a big deal by itself, but eh. I'd still say it kind of goes against vanilla "principles". But I think that's true for lots of addons, especially when you start considering boss mods, rangefinders, swingtimers, etc.
---
Personally, I'd be fine with spending some time by combating the UI. That's a staple in a lot of games. Heck, Starcraft 1 is entirely built around that idea and it's one of the greatest esports.
---
A lot of the "difficulty" in playing the OG MMOs like Everquest 1 / Ultima Online came from UI annoyances as well--I think they have a place.
---
LFG mechanic somehow ruined the social aspect of the game, alongside with ilvl comparing tools and crossrealm grouping.
---
People went from trying to form a good group, mostly from trusted people on your serv to just auto accepting requests filtering stuff by ilvl. There is no social interaction in this at all. And this will just make vanilla wow closest to the dog poo retail is currently.
---
You’re making a bigger deal about this than anybody else is.
---
The jimmy story brings me back and is still a good laugh! I also loved the time gnome series
---
It doesn't, as the add-on uses LFG chat. Nothing prevents you from responding with a pm and having the group leader manually invite you. All the add-on does is reading LFG chat and parsing which group is looking for what dungeon. Anyone who doesn't have the add-on can still join these groups just fine.
---
Nah I only drink my coffee black. They sell coffee filter pouches on amazon. Perfect for cold brew but expensive  (for filters). Just fill one up, put it in a pitcher with about 7 cups of water and let it go overnight. Next morning toss the bag, stir up the cold brew a little and you're good.
---
Seconded. Every few hours I’m with my girlfriend the excitement just bubbles over and I announce it. She’s happy for me to have a hobby I’m passionate about. It doesn’t hurt that we have opposite schedules so most of play time will be while she’s either asleep or at school.
---
Call to Arms didn't do as much as this addon. Watch how it works and stop repeating the same false information.
---
Yeah this seems pretty acceptable IMO. Although personally I think I would draw the line for LFG addons at auto-inviting players or auto-messaging players. I'm ok with spamming world/lfg cause people will be doing that anyways. I'm ok with compiling groups into a nice list, thats just convenient. But I don't think addons should be auto-messaging players or auto-inviting players as this isn't in the spirit of classic IMO. Invite manually and message manually and I'm good with these types of addons. Just my two cents.
---
Oh and just saying the word ilvl in classic should be grounds for a perma-ban. Keep that trash in retail.
---
I think it will run in both without an issue, but why even bother with 32 bit?  It's substantially out of date.
---
Don't worry. Classic will be going for years, and the phases are going to be months apart, not weeks, so you'll have plenty of time. I doubt we'll be on phase 3 by February.
---
Eh, not too bad. Maybe $25-30 for 2lbs of Venison jerky.
---
For dungeons and any public raid group nobody is going to care. You will have trouble getting a spot on an A-Team if you don't have the most preferred race/class combination, but other then that, just play what you want and learn your class.
---
I like pvp but nothing is more boring to me than horde vs alliance shit. Tribalism is lame even in pretend world. I've always found this aspect to be the weakest point of WoW.
---
I kinda hate grats spam
---
*darkspear, mostly because most of the others are mesoamerican
---
&gt;  I don’t have to use it.
---
You also don't have to use LFD/LFR in retail. It still destroyed the game
---
That's exactly my point. People seem to think they are going to lose their identity once a server merges, or that they just won't know anyone. As you pointed out, a community builds quickly.
---
Here's the [interview](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291757/xdlate-wow-classic-interview-with-ion-hazzikostas-and-calie-schie?webhook/xdlate-wow-classic-interview-with-ion-hazzikostas-and-calie-schie) that mentioned he created the prototype for WoW Classic:
---
&gt;We also learned that Blizzard engineer Omar Gonzalez came up with the prototype for Classic WoW's setup, inventing a way for the modern client and server to read 1.12 data.   
---
&gt;He kind of locked himself away for a few weeks, and came out with something that was a prototype--it was very rough, contained tons of bugs, the world wasn't fully rendered, but it was the original classic world, pre-Cataclysm. It had the original skills and talents, and we knew there's was a ton of work to do, but we felt like we realized for the first time, "we can do this."
---
Amen. I remember staying for something like 6 hours in a LBRS group. We wiped countless times. But the people were fun and funny, no one knew what the fuck was going on anyway, it was our first time in there, and to this day it remains one of my favorite memories in the history of MMOs.
---
Don't try dude. This sub has found its new circle jerk.
---
What most of them don't realize (and want to guess why? because most didn't even play vanilla or were too young to remember right)...is that there were auto invite addons IN VANILLA ITSELF. Call to Arms was a thing.
---
Damn thanks for the reminder, I need bananas! They are awesome to eat, I slice them horizontally into small circles eat em with a fork. Super simple snack I can munch on. 2 kills = 1 piece of banana!
---
Beyond snacks - water. Lots of it. Every hour I usually take a bathroom break.  (2-3 minutes at most) Helps keep my body from shutting down completely, allows me to stretch my legs and arms.
---
I don't drink soft drinks (pop, cola, energy drinks whatever), so it's juices and water for me! Heavier on the water side.
---
For PvP, it's a bit harrier, but still doable. You'll run into the hardcore raider every now and then. Those fights will be rough, and often unwinnable. But that is far from the norm. Most people will have gear just like yours with maybe 2-3 epics for a looong time. Getting a fully epic'd out 60 in vanilla takes a good while.
---
You can enjoy it, both in BGs and the world, but you'll just have to accept the fact that every now and then you'll run into some epic mofo that's just going to light you up. Just gotta let it happen and move on.
---
Also worth remembering that there are going to be many casually dedicated guilds out there that will be doing raids like once a week. Yes, you will get gear slower that way, but raiding is probably not completely off the table if you really want to do it.
---
I end up with really slow times with this. Given that I can lazily level a Warrior to 40 in less than a month, I don't think it'd take me until January to 60 a Warlock.
---
I think the problem was a combination of the teleporting with the dumbing down of every single dungeon into an absolute faceroll with no risk of dying at any point.

On the contrary I'm trying to get all of my friends addicted so I don't have to feel as bad about myself anymore :)
---
Its super fun with friends too. Used to follow my dwarf friend around in that game, we would get lost and he would be looking around where to go all stupidly, i laughed so much in that game
---
That's what their servers look like during Battle for Nazjatar anyway.
---
You sir... are a smart man.
---
Common misconception. Any good locks will be topping certain bosses in MC, and topping trash too
---
i call Wrath... Wrath, lol. i think at this point the semantics are being argued more than the system, though.
---
a Meeting Stone is entirely different from a button that lets me queue into a group with randos and not have to actually work that well with anybody in order to advance in the game. the latter is what i meant to talk about - so thank you for clarifying theyre talking about a different addon!
---
edit: please let me know if there's some knowledge i am missing, because i was pretty young still when wrath came out, but to use a Meeting Stone you still have to know people and already be in a group with them in order to use it, and some users already have to be AT the stone. clearly, i was misunderstanding the addon, but at this point i think the addon sounds kind of redundant. just talk to people to form groups lol

Checking in as another woman who's been tanking since vanilla and whose male partner isn't really into video games. I wish I could get him to play WoW but he thinks it's boring. Maybe I shouldn't have made him healbot that one time I actually got him to play...
---
I know he's super disappointed in me for wanting to play Classic, but we're just.. not talking about it. 😬

“That’s a clue reference to purple” has become a regular part of my vernacular because of that video.
---
Which one was the one that looked just like him but the horde had the quest to summon it?
---
Debating levelling as discipline for my priest. I plan on going Holy and raid healing at 60, and I know shadow is great for solo levelling but I would like to be able to heal dungeons too while levelling and I figure discipline is a good compromise on the ability to competently heal and DPs for questing? 
---
Second, I'm thinking enchanting and tailoring for progressions, good choices for 60? Should I wait to level them once I hit cap and take herbalism/skinning for levelling to farm gold for mount?
---
Wrong =)
---
Depends on how much fiber I've consumed lately.
---
The definition of race isn't just skin colour;  it's any shared physical OR social quality, which can very well be a language, skin colour, nationality, homeland, religion and so forth.  
---
So yes, it's possible to be racist against Spaniards.
---
Probably all the marketing Blizzard has done the last few months...
---
Here’s some advice... switch back to Horde! ;)
---
I'm sad that we have to play the game with people with your shitty attitude.
---
You cherry picked a single example of the collection of all social interactions involved in forming groups and then used that one example to demonstrate forming groups involves no social interaction, bravo.
---
Absolutely. Leveling paladin, I remember being able to solo almost everything. Obviously, not Boss level monsters, but elites, even 61 elites sometimes, is totally doable.
---
Fire Emblem: Three Houses for me. It's been super addicting and I am hoping I can finish my first play through this weekend before Classic comes out.
---
It's launch day. Let yourself have them friend. Dooo ittt.
---
Playing 7 hours a day every day for 30 days straight.
---
except by definition it is.
---
That's cool
---
Except..wait for it...there were auto invite addons back in vanilla. You know why? Because all this does is parse chat. It isn't a smart grouper, it doesn't have a mind of its own, it just searches for keywords and invites.
---
Call to Arms was a thing in Vanilla...so where is your defense of stuff now? If auto invite add-ons existed in vanilla what is there to argue about now?
---
I feel attacked.
---
Until it is completed.  Usually helps when someone leaves after three because it's generally that person who was the issue. ;)
---
League of legends was definitely my crack when I first picked it up around season 3, thankfully I'm a recovering lolaholic now and only play every now and then with huge breaks in between (not played for a few months, played a bit of tft when it came out).
---
I don't know what I will be like with classic wow but most of my friends are playing it so maybe I'll take another hit on that pipe
---
It's always been a race.  Go look up the definition of race if you want.
---
If they do that system then maybe but my only hope is that once the game starts to die down in player count after a few years I'll have a better chance at getting into the honor bracket for 14
---
That’s reasonable! Any other fun tips/tricks?
---
I have the pickpocket macro (autoloot script) prepared and tested during the stress test, but otherwise I don’t have much Rogue or Vanilla experience.
---
I’ve read your guide though! And I read a different guide stating not to use stealth because it slows you down and provides no benefit with the swords build. But I also want that pickpocket/lockbox loot, so I’m thinking stealth will be fine regardless. I won’t be world 1st anyhow haha

As a top laner I relate to you so much. Love winning lane hard in to see my botlane or jungle feed, juice up the rest of my team and make it impossible to win - but that doesn't stop the repeated no votes leading to a 35 minute loss where the only towers taken are the ones I got top.

People are saying if you don't like it don't use it, but im obligated to use it if I have less people in a pool. Why would you want an addon to automatically invite everyone. I thought convenience is what killed world of warcraft, so many people who preached for classic are now being hypocrites and saying this tool is just for convenience and efficiency. Im so lost.
---
Sounds like a hipster metalcore band.
---
When I joined this sub it was just shy of 50k. Very happy to have seen it grow so much.
---
Anything that clearly shows a cursed player on the raid/party frames + mouse over decurse macro.
---
all the same i cant wait \^\^
---
What happens while your waiting for DR to drop? They run away?
---
Depends.
---
they can't unless they kill every addon releated to chatting
---
This speaks to me so perfectly that my ongoing theory is that you spied on my life and used it to create this meme.
---
Fuck man you really had me in the first half. Come over at /r/wowcirclejerk sometime, we could use a man of your talents.
---
At least you found out now and not tuesday ha
---
Opinion noted and disregarded.  
---
I'll have all the time in the world to slowly level alts and take everything in.  There's only one launch.
---
You'll be fine dude
---
You guys, I finally decided. Druid. My decision is final. I've never been more sure of a thing in my life. I was die hard shaman until this week. It feels great to now know, whichever way my gaming group goes, ally or horde, I have made my choice. It only took 14 years. Yay!
---
Green. Hills. Of. Stranglethorn.
---
You got some big udders for daddy or wat
---
To stave off boredom, research boss strats and read/watch dungeon walkthroughs so you can lead your party to glory.... unless of course you've already done this...
---
I think the most interesting part about this whole conversation is that MMO developers have never really figured out a definitive answer to "What is the ideal MMO design?" Even Blizzard, a company that caught lightning in a bottle back in 2004, seemingly had no idea how they did it. If they did - why is Classic launching on 8/26? If they knew what they got right in the first place, why would the most recent expansion not just be a return to form for them? Why wouldn't that have been true for any of the last 5 expansions?
---
So, maybe, after Classic launches to ridiculous success, companies around the world will sit down and have a good long think about what MMO design success actually looks like, and "Classic 2" will someday be a reality, whether it comes from Blizzard or not.
---
It's wayy more than double that for casual players.... I probably have more than double that and I'm barely at 2k total

I respect that
---
It's weird seeing people freak out about an addon that just parses chat.
---
10 Hours ? Pffff what a joke.
---
I don't think addons should auto-message or auto-invite people. That's where I draw the line for LFG addons. Compiling lists and spamming world/lfg is okay by me. But I don't want message spam from someone else's addon. I want to hear from a real person not an addon.
---
I know. Not like rerelease/remasters have been popular for a while now or anything like that.
---
Gear score would basically be worthless.
---
Items aren't balanced well enough in Classic for it to mean anything at all.
---
No, it makes no difference to them if you sit in a 10 hour queue or not. They recommend this because the gameplay experience will be better if you move.
---
"Guys! I *really* wouldn't roll on that server. You're going to complain if you do!" It's like getting in line at the grocery store behind the old lady with 2 full carts and a checkbook when the speed lane is empty and the cashier is trying to wave you over. That cashier's life isn't impacted if you fervently ignore them and wait in line for an hour. Just don't go to management to complain they needed more cashiers because you had to wait.

Anyone who uses gear score in vanilla, is an easy flag for someone you do not want to group with.
---
Where are the front flips??? I want my money back!
---
I appreciate you
---
I bet the death rate is way below average over the next 4 days. People are going to exercise caution lol
---
Journey before destination, my friend.
---
Except auto invite add-ons were part of Vanilla..but surely you would remember that if you actually played in vanilla...oh wait, I forgot, you probably didn't and are just basing it off of private servers, who also have auto invite addons.
---
RDF was a whole other subsystem.  The communication was completely invisible... in fact, it was impossible.
---
This addon literally wouldn't work without a chat channel.  If someone with the addon used it to create a LFG message, and you don't have the addon you can still respond with an "Invite please" and an invite would appear.  You would never know if someone created the LFM message actively, with a macro, or with this addon.
---
The same exact thing would happen with or without this addon.  How is that hurting your experience or breaking the game?
---
Theres a specific spot in the addon for classic only and on the website you can choose to filter and only see Classic addons.
---
You should start with preparation as rogue, you're not real horde /s
---
Depends on how bad the wipes are and how willing the leader is to replace the people causing problems.
---
2 Wipes where it's clear the tank (or someone else integrally important) has no idea what they're doing, and the raid leader isn't replacing them? I'm out.
---
HoW Do TiMeZoNeS WoRk?!????
---
If it's the original honor system, haha that would be so hard. You would need a hardcore coordinated pvp group that rolled pugs basically all day long. I was in a few rank14 pvp groups back in the day. I only got as high as 9 I think but I also did hardcore raiding that cut into my PvP time. Those groups were serious. And they exploited the system by selecting members to boost to rank 14 by logging in to their account and playing for them when they were unable. And they would just rotate who achieved rank14.
---
Unfortunately yes. I hadn't seen this amount of corporate cocksucking since Anthem.
---
Compared to an in game interface that doesn't require you to do those things? You're trolling right?
---
And this time I have a computer good enough to let me see it!
---
Sadly this, so easy to lose your place in que only to either get lucky and go in instant with other people crashed, or being placed right at the back of the line.
---
THIS IS JUST FOR WED-SUN for the first week of launch. Depending on how launch is. Players are expected to be level 18-20 on wed. If servers wont allow it. We will follow a leveling guide together tuesday night to prepare for the next few days.
---
Yeah dude your time is really limited, thats why go make reddit posts about Trump's chin.

Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Alliance ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.

Sulferas.
---
It is so weird. I have allways read it and pronounced it as Sulfaras. And I know it is actually spelled Sulfuras. As of tonight I have dicided not to play classic because i cant control myself. Maybe that is why i am drunk and and it did taste extraordinary good tonight. Help me
---
HA!
---
I TOOK THE WHOLE WEEK OFF cause i thought it was tuesday ALSO! now i got all of monday and tuesday to play.. 
---
to bad im camping the next 5 days
---
My wife and I stopped raiding after Arthas as well .
---
She says she’s not going to play Classic, but she swore she’d never play WoW back when I started playing in Vanilla, but I came home one night to her leveling a Druid.   She holds the record in our house: 36 hours straight.  She almost went full-Cartman.
---
Yeah. One of the darkest Disney movies.
---
I personally never thought we would win this particular fight. Their reasoning was fairly sound from a development standpoint.
---
Play on an Oceanic server?  That's what all the Kiwis and Aussies did in vanilla... played on servers physically located in the usa :-)
---
Especially when they say it is against Vanilla...when Vanilla itself had auto invite add-ons that used almost the exact same methods..and some even more egregious.
---
Sometimes when I read this sub I feel like I am one of the only people who truly played Vanilla and actually remembers it. And not some made up version people have in their minds.
---
If you're really into PvP you can try to optain the rank 10 PvP set which is as good as most tier 1 raid sets. Downside is you'll have to spend around 20 hours per week spamming battlegrounds.
---
You can also get some good epics from the battleground reputation vendors.
---
Overwatch and rocket league are the only two I have sunk alot of time into since that time.  It's hard for me to justify buying single player games anymore because I never beat them before losing interest.  Not to say there aren't any because there's still a few here and there but they are few and far between.
---
I get that feeling from BRD at like 56-58.. so close to cap and your starting to pick up some pre raid BIS items.
---
I don’t see it...
---
Ill give him 600 for it
---
Early retail pally is pretty dry. More interactive in vanilla hilariously enough.

I'd recommend just the classic ui and adjust at the end of your first session.

Water and the occasional gatorade for me. Mix in some tea and coffee when feeling a little low..

My first play through I grinded 53 to 60 in the first farm in wpl. This was back in Dec 2004 so not many quests and didn't have great resources like these days. It took around 3 day of 18 hour sessions to do that. Never again. These days I'll follow a guide.
---
That all said I recently got 64 in bdo and that one level probably took me more than 20 days played time so I think I'm ready.
---
could have just clicked save page as and got the images and even working check boxes but i guess text is ok
---
Ironically, you're on the side of "changes" right now.
---
You can’t view the groups being formed without the addon. Did you read the icyveins post describing the addon? The first bummer point reads: “Groups created using ClassicLFG are visible to other players using it on the realm”
---
Also your tone is obnoxious.
---
I start thinking of FFXI, which I left for WoW in 2006. Now that game was nothing but a grind...
---
Have you ever heard of a survey? You know when people say "30% of Americans think fish can't be trusted", do guy think they've asked every American? 20k answers is plenty to get statistics from. He's correct in saying it doesn't make sense unless reddit as a whole have turned away from Golemagg.
---
So you're asking for a reboot of Classic after Classic that just includes more content? That sounds like a lot of redundancy. I think it makes much more sense to run the Classic+ route and just increase the level cap, essentially starting a new progression of the game away from the likes of TBC and WotLK. That's if they do it at all - I think I'll probably be ready to leave WoW behind me after Phase 6.
---
Anyone who evaluates a player by item level in Classic is a fool. Half of the pre raid BiS out there is level 45-54 gear.
---
The addon automates creating/joining a group. If you want automated group creation, go play on retail.
---
Oh no I’m not talking about the speccs. But even with a mouse using the keyboard is so akward. Mines always slightly tilted to reach everything. You don’t get that on a laptop
---
Yeah the "Boss" (skull) level monsters are +3 over content level. So 63 effectively. So correct you need to be at least 73 to get the 'legacy' damage at its full effect.
---
Oh, now I see what you meant hehe.
---
Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
Also, Call to Arms did not auto-invite.
---
I try to space them out when I eat them, and that's helped.
---
Eat one, do a menial 15 seconds to minute task, eat another, etc.
---
Since I'm going to be playing as a DPS, I won't leave groups unless they totally fall apart and we can't get anyone else to join for a few minutes.
---
When I'm playing as a healer (like in retail), I'll leave if the tank isn't responsive to tips to make the run easier for the group, like not pulling when I'm out of mana, or making sure they are picking up adds when I'm getting hit, etc.
---
Just don't use it, moron.
---
I’m not even sure SWG was possible to grind without employing the overnight bots everyone used.
---
Sims and WoW are good. However for some reason I can’t download WoW. Can someone help?
---
My German Shepherd would've bitten the balls off of anyone and slit their throats as well that would've threaten either me or our domain. Don't see cats doing that. Cats offer zero utility beyond keeping company.
---
They didn't play then, as with most of this sub, they either never played outside of P servers or they were too young to remember anything, but pretend they were a Naxx geared min-maxer.
---
"each of the major divisions of humankind, having distinct physical characteristics."
---
People in Spain do not have distinct physical characteristics different from other caucasians. Have you ever seen a Spanish person? Have you ever been to Spain?
---
For warlock there's two main choices: Undead (fearbreak, cannibilize for sustain), or Orc (damage / stun resist). So the choice is yours.
---
Traditionally, warlocks have a hard time against rogues in pvp. Even with that said, class fantasy and enjoyment reigns. I played UD warlock, had a blast, made it to rank 10 before hard switching to a druid and taking it up to rank 13. Cannibalize saved my ass more than a few times.
---
As for spec, PVE you are looking at SM/Ruin, or DS/Ruin. (Boring) PvP affliction or destruction pick your poison.
---
For leveling, highly recommended affliction. Being able to multi-dot targets and keep pulling is really useful, as things can burn (via dots) to death without much effort.
---
No you will not be able to group across servers.
---
You already know you know nothing. Therefore you know all you ever need to know.
---
Thats in classic, my trolls said that during the stress test
---
True
---
Thank you both!
---
"AnD tHeRe GoEs AnOtHeR oNe" As if you didn't try to insult me there? Get your shit straight.
---
Also you can't seem to understand what I'm saying, so we will leave it at that.
---
Their dead bodies will be hanging in front of Orgrimmar! Heads, Spikes, Walls.
---
This is exactly how we got LFR.
---
We let one tiny thing stay, and then people build on that, and eventually we get the group finder in retail.
---
The entire point of classic was to not have these anti-social features, allowing these addons spits in the face of the very people who are trying to go back to a community based game.
---
Read what this guy says and do it. Until you step into Molten Core, warrior = arms &amp; priest = shadow
---
&gt;function ClassicLFGChatParser:HasIgnoreMessageTag(text)  
---
 return string.find(text, "#noclassiclfg") \~= nil  
---
end
---
if u put #noclassiclfg in the end of u search this addon ignore u
---
Who cares? I never got picked up when just spamming chat at least with this I dont have to talk to people we can just join up and do the raid or dungeon
---
I mean dude, Classic WoW is amazing in many ways, but itemization balance is not one if them.
---
Modern WoW may be shit in many ways, but the item balance is better in any/every xpac compared to Classic.
---
And iLvL DOESN'T mean shit in BfA.
---
Did you notice she managed to keep her arse
---
you dont need to download BFA. check the Version Tab on the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Launcher of World of Warcraft  and switch to Classic.
---
This is what happened, until we have video evidence that says otherwise.
---
Only slightly slower for Hunters. Literally every other class benefits from duo'ing; even with Hunter it's not so bad that it'd be "slow" or detrimental. 
---
Just never trio. The xp gains are too low for that. But 99/100 it's faster to duo than solo.
---
[Say that to me in Stranglethorn, fucker, not on Reddit, and see what happens.](http://i.imgur.com/9Sh6rSd.jpg)
---
The short answer is personal preference. The long answer: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPRHdLWkURv6EZ9yjHUApY9hDw4IJbJ6/view
---
Click on the bottom left “world of warcraft” on the client, and there should be a drop down menu where u choose either classic or bfa, and then just install classic
---
Certain classes level much faster in a duo, but for the exceptional solo leveling classes a duo will be slightly slower. 
---
Speed shouldn’t matter too much to you if friends are a factor. 
---
Fun &gt; highest efficiency.
---
Hmm. I see no autoinvite in that add on. Interesting difference.
---
Wow dude... everyone knows the 3 desert zones Silithus, Tanaris, and Winterspring.
---
Left control.
---
I'm a pally, keybinds are dumb.

I just texted one of her old boyfriends and was like “now is your opportunity, bro”.  That should keep her busy for a couple years!
---
But it makes grouping faster and easier. If replacements or new groups are nearly effortless to find, you are less invested in the group you’re in. You are less likely to stick around and work through the issues with your group. This, of course, is the time where relationships are formed. Strategizing, communicating to overcome issues, socializing in the downtimes. Finally, overcoming a challenge with others bonds you together. 
---
It’s bad for the social fabric, it’s not Vanilla.
---
You're so right. If there's no challenge to finding your group, you'll be quick to throw it away if things don't go smoothly. The reason I stuck with so many groups after countless wipes and hours in vanilla was because hearthing then finding a replacement could take ages.
---
December. I'm happy.
---
I don't quite understand their reasoning...
---
So, they launched Classic to refrain the player base from playing on private servers (and giving them the money), but they are going to remove things from classic bcs they chose the 1.12 patch...
---
What's wrong with u, blizzard? Removing things permanently bcs u know better? That is what took u to where u are now, having to launch a 15 years old version of ur own game, fools.
---
Imagine being so far up in your own ass that you can't see that Blizzard fucked up badly by releasing **TWO** english PVP servers for the entire European continent. NO SHIT that those servers got filled. Now the first "emergency server" they added is also full.
---
The players are allowed to complain about this when it was completely obvious that two servers would be maxed out before launch. I guarantee you that after one week after launch, there will be 5 full pvp servers, with another 2 or 3 added to try and help out. So why would they not release 5 servers right away? 
---
"have the audacity to complain" Fucking hell.
---
click the version and click classic in the launcher not that hard
---
At least the players it will find are from your server and there’s a chance you’ll see them or interact with them again. I fail to see how other than “100%” legit vanilla experience this is any different in the long run than standing in ironforge or org and spamming that you need a tank and a healer for random dungeon. Either way you’re getting whispers from strangers. What made this stuff better is vanilla and even still through TBC, was that if someone sucked or fucked over the group, the guilds and whatnot were known server wise and you could basically avoid this guy and spread the word that they sucked or were awful to be around. This mod doesn’t change that, it just makes finding a group easier than being in a capitol city.
---
Germans just can't help but plant their flag everywhere eh huehue
---
Socially stunted zoomers who can’t talk their way into a group. If there’s anything against the spirit of classic it would be this and some kind of gear scoring addon, kill it
---
He probably wouldn't have written the novel if he thought it was a non-issue...
---
The struggle, I know that feel.
---
20 is bit high for deadmines, ive done it on private servers and we were around 17-18 mostly
---
&gt; cause you had to travel to the city
---
I don’t. I have chronic tendinitis and arthritis and therefore deal with slower than average reaction time. In my defense, too, mousepads collect cat hair like nobody’s business and I got a lotta cats!
---
Some people just want to see the world burn
---
Well this comment was a bit grim
---
I really like how every post about this tool is being heavily downvoted, no matter if the post is for or against the addon. 
---
If you post pro-addon, then you get downvoted and berated on how the addon is bad for classic.
---
If you make a post about how the addon is bad for classic, you get berated and downvoted and being told that it just reads the chat and isn't really that bad.
---
So what I'm asking, which side is Reddit on? Or I guess maybe everyone is just tired of this addon being brought up again and again. From all the posts I've seen today, it seems there is like a 50:50 split of people that are either for or against the addon (or some just don't care).
---
Thinking about fairbanks or blaumeux if the population gets bigger which im sure it will, not resubbing till day before tho
---
Nah. Classic *needs* an LFG addon of some kind. The game will be pretty much unplayable for me without it, and I'm looking forward to its implimentation.
---
Listen to your heart. I didn't have that chance, my friends all played earlier than me and already rolled alliance. The reality was, once I got to contested zones I wished I was horde. My best friend in that group told me he wished he'd went horde (he started after our two other friends and followed them). And, in my honest opinion, I think our two friends who started day one both secretly regretted rolling alliance but were too committed to switch by the time all four of us were up and going. We had our friend group, no denying that, but I'm still certain all four of us wished we were the other faction.
---
Been thinking of doing the same with my nelf , especially since it's where I plan to start classic.
---
I've been listening to it on repeat.
---
On horde never, on alliance fear ward is so good it will be sought after sometimes
---
This is EXACTLY what will happen.
---
The three names you can reserve are total, so it wouldn't be possible
---
All it does is read chat. Preventing addons from reading chat would have too many consequences.
---
DBM is still very much around, all they did was block one specific API call that prevented one specific use case. The addon was never against the ToS.
---
Plus, if an addon is banned by name, people can just change the name :) 2 lines of code. That's what people did on a certain worldpvp-focused classless server that banned the Spy addon.
---
This type of addon is the antithisis of the Vanilla experience. There was NEVER an addon like this that survived long in vanilla wow only after.
---
I hope blizzard kills it, if you don't have the time, don't play timesync.exe
---
Dude, I wipe about 5 times when I poop...
---
Oh, woops.
---
I won't! I also found healing really boring in the free trial during the dungeon runs. I played a protection warrior in BC. I really enjoyed that but think I should try something else. Gonna play as warlock this time.
---
https://youtu.be/bN-0_ErU-wU
---
A co-worker who also plays is predicting that WoW 2 is exactly what's in the works, and will be sooner than expected.  He believes that Classic was put in place for purists to have a place to still play.
---
Lol goooooood luck fam

Basically have to have to have an active guild that decides you get the drops for it.  I guess you could get lucky but legendaries are extremely hard to get.

Classic experience.....and its gone...
---
Echoing this.
---
Rogue is the king of OWPvP followed by Druid.
---
Stealth is VERY effective in OWPvP, being able to pick and choose your battle is huge, and being able to escape is another huge thing.
---
As for professions - engineering as Pumpkin said, it's king for pvp. As for besides that, mining is great as that fuels engineering, or you can pick basically anything.
---
Be sure you have potions and bandages on hand. Some people say using potions in pvp is "TRYHARD" or "DISHONORABLE"... alls fair in love and war. All that matters is who is standing in the end. (Sidenote: duels are different and are supposed to be honorable blahblah)
---
Wait, there exists people that didn't play vanilla?
---
It was only by sheer chance that I found the pirate ship in the bay between Wetlands and Arathi Highlands.
---
For whatever reason decided to peer over the edge, and in a blaze of glory I made my way down to stumble across this quest hub.  I don’t remember the specifics, but it amazes me that it was there.
---
This was 14 years ago.  36 now and still remember that moment fondly.
---
We are kind of playing it by ear as launch gets closer. Pushing people to make characters on Blowme in case we don't want to deal with the queues on Whtiemane where we initially rolled.
---
some days it is, others its not. :)
---
Man. I really miss the lawbringer armor. It always looked stupid (mostly the helm and banana shoulders) bit God damnit I was so happy/proud/felt accomplished when I got my full set
---
What about dwarves
---
Fuck icyveins for lying about their addon. it's not just a chat parser
---
When you respond to well crafted arguments by flinging ad hominems it makes you look like an idiot.
---
Probably make character ilvl inaccessible to LUA scripts. This one looks like the one I'd disable if I worked on WoW classic: [GetAverageItemLevel()](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/API_GetAverageItemLevel).

I don't think I ever turned it in.  Legitimately think I moved on.

It’s not a chat filter/reskin that is such a mischaracterizarion. It’s designed to ease and speed up the process of group formation. It does so by helping you cast your net. It doesn’t change literally nothing *or no one would get it, it wouldn’t have been developed, and we wouldn’t be having this conversation*

Levelling with a friend or 2 is fine. Some of the xp is divided between you but not too big a worry. 
---
Levelling alone is ok too and occasionally grouping with others for those pesky elites is fun too.
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Lol at your edit. I’m a bartender, I’ve definitely used the word retard in conversation with management and never suffered the slightest inconvenience from it
---
I don't think you understand how this addon works...
---
thank you!! also i remember that generally i just use /who to figure out who to message, i have NEVER relied on a general chat lol
---
edit: the first iteration of the Meeting Stone is weird as fuck!
---
You won't get an honest answer to this. People are living in this bubble that Classic is some Utopia where everything is perfect and forming a group for a dungeon is a bonding experience that will form everlasting friendships. LFG in Classic is arguably one of the worst things about the game. This is a QoL addon that people will forget about in a week because of the systemic psuedo-outrage people have in this sub; layering, skeletons, lfg addon, server qs, etc.
---
Thanks go out to u/simjooo for the inspiration!  
---
Wir suchen noch btw. - semi-progress auf Hordenseite, recruitment post ist im DE WoW Classic Discord zu finden.
---
They always were a number. This just cuts down the needless bullshit in trying to get a group together.
---
Because if you don't use push to talk, it is very annoying for everyone else in the channel. I have a buddy that never uses push to talk and it is rather frustrating hearing the background noise.

The quest that tells you to go to a valley in swamp of sorrows.....to drop an item from that elementals.....THAT is a low drop.....cant remember the quest....I think you take the quest in SW....

Time is money friend, and a Mage is the best money maker in the game. The spells you want don't just cost money, they cost time.
---
youre right, it wasn't popular enough to be able to ignore chat.

i think blizz should wait to see if it becomes a problem before changing addon API.

---
Just saves time for actually building the groups; it's not like it removes any of the communication you'll be doing with your group. Just saves the "/2 LF tank BRD-&gt;/w 56 war tank" interaction.
---
 I feel the only people against this are starry-eyed cata-babies that never got to understand how shit standing around in town for hours looking for group members actually was.
---
There are a lot of variables that play into it. Class composition, area, faction, specific quests, etc. If you're going to be leveling with a group, you need to make some adjustments.
---
So, yeah, the short answer is yes it's detrimental to level with friends - you won't be server first trying to take your friends with you the whole way. However, if you're not aiming for server first, then it doesn't really matter. In fact, if you're significantly behind the curve, leveling with friends can help to insulate you from attacks by higher level players if you're on a PvP realm. Ultimately you should do whatever is the most fun.

---
LOL this actually got me to laugh IRL. Amazing post.
---
Is the issue with the addon that it has autoinvite or that you don't have to sit in town to find a group? Because server discord LFG channels alone will mostly eliminate the need to go to town to find a group. Furthermore, there was an addon IN vanilla that did exactly what this addon does except for the autoinvite.  EDIT: I also neglected to say you still have to run to the dungeon which will take up a lot more time than finding the group to begin with.
---
Actually free trial is still available for all the other modes of WoW. 
---
I'll have to play next year I guess, thanks for the info.
---
I hate it but Whitemane best girl.
---
Bl for you Chad. Me and the other 30+ year old fat virgins will be eating hot pockets that we leave resting on our stomach when we are busy playing.
---
English here too!
---
&gt;I'm encouraging not letting others tell you how to play, while also telling you how to play.
---
I don't get it
---
&gt;There's no way you're this bad at interpreting speech.
---
I don't hear anything, are you talking?
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Sounds terrible. Just play solo, that's what I did!
---
Yeah I have to agree, if this becomes a mandatory thing because everyone using it then I might as well have just stayed in retail if I wanted an lfg system lol.
---
Lol it drops Monday...100% will be in at launch
---
Just watch.
---
you want to get to 60 as fast as possible, but what about all the content that is 1 to 60?
---
sure seems like a waste to spend money on it tbh
---
edit like the developers didn't spend a fuck ton of time and effort to make content 1-60 just to have people skip it
---
power leveling is a reason why we don't like BFA. because people just skip all the content between

Yes, tell her this is a game you absolutely adored as a kid and it's coming back. Tell her that there will be times where you won't be able to just drop things because you are literally playing with people all over the world and certain activities required prearranged times (that these other 40  people also put aside for you). Explain to her your role in the team.
---
Let her know now there is no save option, there is no pause feature.
---
Remind her that you still absolutely love her and will not stop loving her any less but there will be times where you will spend a bit more time with the game than her (at least at the start).  
---
Tell her some of your war stories, tell her about the story, the first purp you got, the adrenaline surge in STVietnam. Invite her to join you.
---
Explain to her to please let you know in advance of any plans she might have and that you will make her plans priority over the game - last minute things you cannot guarantee if you can do it. 
---
Tell this is going to span for the first while, at least until level cap.
---
You don't have to go HAM on the game either. In any relationship there's always give and take and good communication. Do not neglect her just because you need to grind. Be flexible with things you can accomplish solo to spend time with her, and ask for flexibility for group events you have preplanned.
---
I'm 40, been married 18 years. I had this chat with my wife. She understands and knows how things will be over the next while. She is fully aware me and my boomer homies are gonna be conquering Azeroth and I won't be watching her shows with her as I normally do. She knows about raids and party obligations - and I know about the balance I need to achieve between WoW and her. I did invite her to play, she tried it, it wasn't her cup of tea, we both moved on.
---
You need to find that balance. You need to talk with her.
---
I was too, and I managed to raid casually. Just find a guild that shares your goals and has compatible raid times. Don’t try to get into world first race insanity if you don’t have 16 hours a day to spend playing.

No, I'm sorry. AWA members do not negotiate with customers. If you have a grievance, you can bring it up with your local AWA chapter head.

As asmongold said [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KERMZd9vSBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KERMZd9vSBM)   9:35-10:50 if you think you dont have time for play classic,dont play it go play something less time consuming like retail and dont try to ruin something that so many players want to experience just because you dont have time
---
did the clown shit in your party hat? go rinse yourself and come join us in the bouncy house :D
---
"Now i'm dead like BFA" 
---
Got me
---
So the Genie would be Blizzard?
---
Yes you are, because there are indirect consequences to players actions. WoW isn’t a single player rpg, even if you play it that way. It’s an mmo, and the individual actions of players have effects on the game in general. If this add on became popular, and people stop searching in world or in chat for groups, then we effectively have lfg in classic.
---
You can do that with the base game. Just right clic invite everyone who whispers you. That's all the "auto invite" feature does.
---
Holy balls lol Good luck with that. However I do remember a couple of accounts back in the day selling for a couple thousand dollars USD. I thought that was insane :S also vaguely remember there being a craigslist/ebay market for accounts back about a year after release.
---
1. There are Chads and Virgins on both sides. 
---
2. You may only prove yourself a Chad in battle. 
---
3. You either die a Chad or live long enough to see yourself become a virgin.
---
Everyone comes to realize that the Mario Bros 3 i played as a 15 year old is hot fucking garbage. Enjoy the peak of shitty level design, 2d graphics and pixelated mario and easy jump mechanics. Tell me how hard Bowser is when even casuals can clear it.Thanks, have a good weekend, enjoy your shit show monday.
---
Research? Those dungeons are burned into my mind.
---
Sjw logic, u are such a moron to propose something like that, this addon is legit 100% allowed by the current blizzard API.
---
This addon is a bless... first it show how many people are fucking ignorant how addons works.
---
Second it show how many people have a fantasm about vanilla ignoring the fact thoses type of addons exited in the past and during the pserver scene without any probleme! !
---
Third he came right before the release and force blizzard to draw a line to what they allow and what they don't.
---
Selling
---
What is dead may never die.
---
I don't like it either but they can't really do anything about it tbh.

Lmao.

Man Classic community is the worst one I ever met. Full of boomers who cant even read or understand what this addon does, Jesus.. People spitting on this addon and when they type why it sucks they name things this addon does not do. How the fuck can you compare this to retail LFG, are you stupid or what? This is 10x healthier for the game than stupid discord server communities, yet noone cries about those cause they arent named "LFG"..
---
Wow, these are awesome! Dragonfang Blade from BWL would look nice too.
---
[Blizzard agrees too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2552&amp;v=hhKkP8LryYM) (42:32 for those having issues)
---
If a non-user of the addon has the exact same LFG chat experience and ease of finding groups as somebody who does use the addon, that's fine. But if the addon provides any functionality that Classic deliberately removes from retail, as Ion himself puts it: "We know that once it's out there, saying '*just don't use it'* isn't good enough because it will start to become part of the fabric." Bear in mind this stance appears to only be regarding social aspects of the game rather than class performance etc.
---
This thread is weird. I'm far from a #nochanger as I'd love to see BC / WotLK things added (Or entirely fresh thematic content like Jagex does with OSRS) - but the LFG experience was one of the most frequent arguments for Classic WoW that I've seen over the past decade. Classic WoW isn't even out yet and a sizeable chunk of the Classic fanbase (if this thread is a representative sample) seem to have changed their minds and are already inviting in small incremental changes to aid quality of life and casual ease of play.
---
Thanks for promoting this. Will download and use. Why the fuck would I want to deal with spamming chat when this will just group me up? Get the fuck out of here with that bs.

I wish I had gold to give you. Enjoy poor man's gold.
---
Any thoughts ?
---
Up until very recently I played Retail and enjoyed it for what it is. Now that Classic is imminent, I'm totally on board with that. I'm even warming up to the idea of Classic+. However, when I think about the intellectual property in an objective way, I really think it needs to be retired. Even a "WOW 2" would feel just too played out for me. It's time to start thinking about leaving it behind and launching something brand new.
---

Does it launch on the Tuesday for Australians? I was under the impression it will be the Wednesday seeing as we’re ahead

Lmfao get over yourself

Oqueue moved to a website.  Any lfg addon will do the same.  This will not be a battle that purists will win.  There will be a LFG addon or website that's not automated 100%.

When you minmax a game so hard you start minmaxing life.
---
"Before anyone tries to convince me not to use guide to level , I have leveled several characters to 60 in vanilla and pservers so now I'm just looking to level as fast as possible mainly due to limited time and to catch up with the guild and not stay behind."
---
&gt;Proceeds to tell OP about all the content he's going to miss.
---
Oh boy, everyone of course is on the server I pick.
---
Following that logic, all professions are useless except for engineering since you can just buy them from AH.
---
Buying things from AH is easy when you have the gold but other profs are better money makers than engineering, the price of refined salt is very high and is a stable money maker, devilsaur gear at the start of the game can go for hundreds of golds per piece because it's BiS for all melee and hunters, that's half of the class roster.
---
Your next argument is going to be " grind for gold " or just "buy gold online" , some people want to make gold through professions and telling them it's a mistake to pick up anything other than YOUR way playing is beyond bigotry.
---
Bloh me-uh
---
I thought it was a really fun movie with a really lame ending. The whole golem sequence is just really badly executed and hard to watch, but the battle in the forest, the orc effects, the magic, a lot of it was very enjoyable.
---
I think he is talking about principles rather than how different it is.
---
If I had a button that added a change I wanted to vanilla, I might press it. But I won't because I don't want everybody else to have access to that same button.
---
Even if you can definitely argue that this tool doesn't have that bad functionality that LFG/LFR had you rarely know what type of effect it will have on the community until it is there. And likewise you never realize how different the game becomes by a bunch of small changes until it stops being the same game.
---
For example, if we were to assume that this addon is widespread and used by practically anyone it would become a cakewalk to find new members in case you aren't happy with someone in your current party *for any reason*. This can be an incredibly negative aspect that this addon brings. Be it from elitism or "don't want to waste any time!" mindset that a lot of people tend to have for some reason. The moment you give people a quick option to find other people you devalue the actual players you can find and make them into numbers, to some degree. Bit of a doomsday example but I could definitely see it happening and not be a semi-rare occurence.
---
I don't know how much you understand but you only seem to look at the oranges and apples example yourself.
---
The easiest way to prevent stuff from changing or getting worse is to *not* embrace something simply because "it isn't *as* bad." Because let us be real here, the only reason people want to embrace this is to save themselves time in the moment. The average player doesn't even *think* about what is best for the game or how it impacts it in the long run.

Very competitive in PvP on WSG weekend you are primarily FC. On AB/AV weekends, not the top choice for pvp healer (priests and paladins take the crown), but still a very strong utility role, typically in holding nodes, stealth capping.

---
**EDIT**: Second gold of the day ffs this community I swear people are too nice. Please, ask questions if people have them.
---
I believe the problem lies not in the ability of this addon to parse and organize an individual's chat logs but in the addon's ability to collect not just what you can see but the chat logs of every player on the server using the addon, then compiling all chat data across server into a list of groups.
---
The damaging thing about retail's LFG, LFD, and LFR is that it lowers the difficulty in finding groups, but also more importantly replacing group members. When it comes down to it I believe that there is a linear correlation between groups becoming easier to form and the degradation of the social aspects of the game. This is a small change toward QOL for grouping that will have a small negative affect on the social networks in classic wow.
---
I'll post here tonight probably.  The current weekly challenge doesn't fit my skill level (lol) but recreating a bit of SoS is something I can do.
---
That’s how I’ve been thinking about it. I was kicking myself because I could’ve just told them I can start the Monday after release, but in reality the first week is gonna be a shitshow anyway haha.

There is no Hope. Vanessa was adopted by the Saldeans after her father was viciously murdered infront of her, but they didn't know who she was, so they named her Hope. She then grew up and reformed the Defias, and then reveals herself as Vanessa during the Cata-era Westfall quests, and is then killed in Heroic Deadmines
---
bustedddddd
---
Neh. He just needs to be absolutely rolling in gold. Any guild will gladly give the eye to a guildie that can buy/farm the mats themselves; pretty much no raiding guild will gift a guildie the 5-10k in mats for this wep tho, aside from perhaps Ingots. So basically if this dude is able to save up 10k gold for the mats it's as good as his.
---
Just don't touch the big gem and you'll be OK.
---
Try to find the WoW cookbook and cook something from it.
---
Lol, like this is gonna happen.
---
It's a joke right, that I'm not in on?
---
Probably mining/engineering unless you can fund engineering/alchemy
---
Normally when you see people LFM you message them knowing another person just typed that. I’d rather not have in the back of my head the thought of “hey this could be an add on spamming this”. I feel like you’re more likely to not get a reply as well if someone fills up and they don’t need you. This pretty clearly would give you an advantage because you get a larger pool of players (interacting with players in other zones that have this add on which makes it like LFG channel on crack) therefore to not use it would put you at a disadvantage is what I dislike. If it didn’t have that advantage I would be more fine with it. Overall though I just hate how it makes individuals and groups seem less valueable.
---
Yeah, I doubt it. Like I said in my own post, I think the smartest thing to do is milk the IP via Retail expansion packs for the next 4\~ish years and then launch a completely new MMORPG.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
It’s up there among the best game movies in my opinion, along with Doom and the first Resident Evil.
---
That's fine since he can just conjure more. Thats the beauty of infinity :) you never run out.
---
The addon creator will just start a website with the same idea.  All people want is a lfg interface.  It's coming whether it's in game or not doesnt matter.
---
This is why I don't wanna play it
---
&gt; But full-tine job/husband/new father side of me says, this could be a nice time saver
---
isn't this the exact mindset that got retail to be what it is today?
---
Awesome tool here thanks!

I personally love human because of the rep gain and spirit buff but Dwarf priest with Fear Ward is the clear winner.
---
&gt; it actually talks to other people in other zones with the add-on to  increase the number of potential people that can join your group. 
---
This is the exact problem. You can look for players serverwider without any effort while this "ChAt PaRsInG aDdOn" does all the work for u.

To break the addons, they would have to break addons that were in WoW and thus, nochanges means letting it stay.

The development standpoint is:  "You are getting 1.12, they are not available in 1.12."  Just like you aren't getting old armor pieces that had their stats changed.  You know, like the green helm that was turned into a blue helm by the time 1.12 hit?
---
Are they the same as the old .brashendeavors Petopia? Probably used more than thottbot by hunter mains.
---
This is also great for auto run....helps me when I use a naga or scimitar because I use # pad and shift key for over 20+ keybinds with just your mouse....if I use the numlock key to autorun it messes up my keybinds
---
If you go alliance this is totally possible with the shadowmeld racial on a Night Elf hunter. Not the pet thing but the hiding thing.
---
what discord? well i know its shazz but i mean why is the discord popular to begin with? or why was it?
---
Help me Reddit-won Konbi! I'm stuck between Orc Warlock and Dwarf Shadow Priest. I lean more towards the priest, but I don't want to respec once a week to PvP/farm. I love the class fantasy of spriest, but raid groups only need one and I didn't think I could put in the time to remain competitive. So, Orc lock it was, but then I realized that my post-60 plans had me putting in as much time as a competitive shadow priest anyway, so now I'm stuck between spriest or warlock. 
---
I've often heard the advice that if you want to play spriest, just play warlock, but there are some things about Warlock I don't like. I hate the voidwalker. VW is trash, period. Without talents, it will not hold threat. It also doesn't have a hard taunt, torment just adds threat on the mob's threat table. Mobs shred it with ease and it's damage is crap, further hampering it's ability to hold aggro. I was actually just going to drain tank to 60. The class has no mobility, CC is fear/terror(which can pull other mobs and doesn't work on undead) unless you have out succ(charm), and a bubble that comes at the cost of a pet(and a trash pet at that). SL warlocks hit like a wet noodle without gear and you have to give up ruin or SL(siphon life) to get it. I also have the worst luck with nightfall procs. I was willing to accept it as a silver medal, but if I'm going to be going hard at end game, why accept less?  
---
The big thing pulling me towards the priest is Inner Fire + Power Word: Shield. It absurdly powerful in PvP and with wand spec and spirit tap, leveling is a breeze. Not warlock breeze, but still very fast and very simple. My main issue is that I don't have a guild yet, which means I may not get a shadow priest slot. That's it. That my issue. If I can't find a slot, then I'm healing at 60, which I'd rather not do.  
---
Help me decide, reddit, you're my only hope!
---
Finkle's Lava Dredger ;)
---
Very tempted...but it's PST. I don't remember this being TOO big an issue during vanilla for people who were EST on PST servers, but who knows this time around.
---
Same :(
---
Any mage found operating outside the AWA guidelines will not be able to join an AWA-affiliated guild, which is currently every guild on Skeram.
---
Dwarf no doubt. PvP/pve doesn’t matter. Dwarf
---
I'm really keen to play warrior. For the aesthetic, the reward of gear upgrades, being able to tank while leveling up with other casual friends. I'm a new dad working full time bla bla bla so I worry at 60 I'll never be able to gear to a satisfying level and won't have the cash for respeccing/repairing. Should I stubbornly stick to it against my better judgement or should I just roll mage or hunter?
---
Then they shouldn't have charged money for it.
---
So I'm struggling. I had this all figured out. Then my shithead friend had to give me an idea. So anyways I'm going to be rolling on a PvP server and leveling up mostly solo. I was planning to play either a priest or druid (one with friend duo when we can). But then he mentioned fucking Warlock. So my main concern with a pure DPS will be getting groups, especially at 60, I don't want to be stuck waiting for groups for ages. Also I want to be able to PvP decently without having really amazing gear. So any thoughts?
---
This is why i just roll need anyway on my (pre-) bis items... Fuck people who think I shouldn't be rolling because we have a melee in the group who "needs it more". Bitch how am i ever going to get pre-bis dalrends if i am never allowed to roll need? Literally every group has melee in it...
---
A bit over dramatic.
---
A majority of people playing won’t use reddit/forums or even think of an lfg add on 
---
I guarantee you that people will always be searching like normal since there will be plenty of people like yourself who feel the same way.
---
Find a good guild and guess what? The lfg tool or even using trade becomes irrelevant
---
that's not telling  people how they should play at all. it's just explaining how things work lol
---
I’m so looking forward to getting here. It’s one of the only zones I have memories of when leveling.
---
Fuckin awesome dude. The hard work you put into this is amazing. Listened to all of your episodes over the space of 2months and almost caught up. I thank you a lot!
---
Apparently you're not allowed to grab LFM messages from trade chat and display them somewhere else. You have to sit and stare at the screen and hope that the dungeon you're looking for don't flash by while you're blinking.
---
Given how popular the pvp-rp server is  I don't think you'll have *any* problems finding an est raiding guild. You could always pop onto the discord and see if any are recruiting that suit your hours :)
---
Super fun and crazy class, congrats.
---
I normally play tanks but I intend to roll a hunter this time around. I wonder how long I'll make it before I say "fuck it, I'm sick of shit tanks" and roll one myself...
---
Ahh thank you! Can you tell me what a fear ward is?
---
Yea, I think people who browse this sub see an addon like this and immediately thing #CHANGES but it's literally nothing to worry about it. The addon doesn't do anything you can't do normally just like every other addon they cling to. They just have a vendetta because they see LFG and assume later expansions. It's a sad reality for the majority of these people.
---
So begins the cycle of hunters not getting groups lul
---
I remember having mass guild invites to raid, it would suck if people throwing a tantrum here made it so that useful addon was broken.
---
I think the reason I remembered this scene was because it was a literally laugh out loud moment in the film for me.  At the time I found it so funny.
---
The real reason for the granite maul nerf
---
Outdated
---
The music, the shitty windows movie maker intro... so 2000s, I love this, takes me back.
---
that the best advice
---
How many posts/comments are you going to make?
---
I prefer battlegrounds over world pvp. A PvE server means I can chill and not worry about getting ganked. The phone rings and I need to AFK in the middle of the road? No big deal.
---
Sometimes you want to just kick back and fish. I can still pvp when I want to, on my own terms.
---
Eve Online can also be really relaxing. Did they ever put the original music back instead of that dynamic shit?
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀GM's wont respond to this post 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Yeah, no leveling guide is worth paying money for.
---
I will do both.
---
Gnomes rule and Alliance side has better ambiance.
---
Why? Don't you just need elementium bars, bindings, and some mat drops from MC?
---
Why waste time leveling to 60 on a server that you don't want to play on?
---
If they offer free transfers in the future they will be from full servers to lower population ones, not the other way around.
---
Lol no.
---
Exactly what made me so interested in them. I wanted a sleeper spec
---
I think every server will be full so there won't be a "less populated"
---
&gt;You will enjoy it a lot more if you're actually doing the explorin' instead of simply following a script somewhere  
---
Well if people want a real Vanilla experience and didn't play back in the day, they probably shouldn't use leveling add-ons.  When WoW launched, there were basically no leveling guides or add-ons designed to show you where everything was.  If you want the experience someone would have had back in 2004 at launch, you won't use any add-ons or at least not any leveling add-ons/guides. 
---
If you don't care about trying to recreate a more authentic Vanilla experience, then by all means!
---
Need more people on Bleameux please!!
---
I'm pretty sure there's another gif of this dog out there where he/she "explodes" after that last sneeze.
---
&gt; LFG addon is not in the spirt of Vanilla
---
Was there some place where we all agreed to only play if things were *exactly* like back in the day?  That ship sailed with vanilla, there are some QoL things that people really like and want, and they'll get them one way or another.
---
Nah, people will go with the most used ones if they stick around. 
---
And hopefully they do, honestly. This is much better than spamming trade chat for an hour for a tank. And that is really all it does.
---
Hi, /u/Pheightful
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu4aka/new_to_vanilla_and_dont_care_what_racefaction/). 
---
1.12 also had all open raids along with tons of items/drops etc that aren’t in classic launch. They’re gating those, despite the fact that “it has always been known” that we were getting 1.12.
---
I remember that one. Fell a ton trying to get to him. Never was able to.
---
&gt;Some people in my opinion have unrealistic expectations of how classic will feel socially. They site the beta and stress test where people would give out buffs randomly, or give you gear if they couldn't use it, or helping you kill something without needing to be asked.
---
People have done that on private servers for years and on the beta the whole time it was up. Why would it randomly stop because Classic WoW has launched?
---
I thought it was funny. I am literally 5 years old though to be fair.
---
I said to someone before but it could be based of votes. People don't show up until like... 5 votes and shows the reason. 
---
Well known streamers, wouldn't matter if people do that to them cause well.. people already know them. This plugin wouldn't matter to them.
---
I really don't think this is a problem. The "problem" is the automated daily heroic / LFR group finder on live. 
---
This is just the pre-made group finder. It's literally the equivalent of the old trade chat spam for groups, and putting that into GUI form and making it work anywhere in the world.
---
It's still obviously only going to be people from your server, and so you're still going to want to keep note of good and bad players in your groups so you avoid them in the future.
---
Obviously you wouldn't enable auto-accept because that's just fucking retarded. Yes, let me auto accept anyone that asks for an invite, L15 ret paladin for deadmines applies a second before a L20 mage?
---
Auto-accept if you're making a large group to go raid a city or town? Sure, but you're never going to use that for dungeons. 
---
With or without this tool, you will still end up joining plenty of groups where a few of them are on discord together and not talking, or they're just not sociable at all etc. Tonnes of my runs in vanilla were minimal to no chatting, obviously the ones that you remember are the fun ones, where you formed new friendships, other the standard ones where nothing memorable happened.
---
I keep trying to talk my husband into rolling on a different server, as the one he wants is already super full and has been. But he doesn't see enough guild recruiting on other servers. Owell, guess it will be a true Vanilla experience with hour long queue times.  &gt;_&gt;
---
The glass bottles were the same cost for 25% less (12 vs 16 oz) plus I figured the cans would survive shipping better
---
Im not sure if anyone said \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\].
---
Ah cool, thank you!
---
You can't make both horde and alliance on a PvP server yo.
---
Lol you're all over the place man.  What you're complaining about isn't in any way enabled by this addon more than you can just do without this addon.
---
The food/water is per stack?
---
You manually posting "LFM UBRS" in trade chat: The epitome of social interaction
---
Your addon automatically posting "LFM UBRS" in trade chat: Blasphemy
---
Makes next fear effect do nothing to whoever has the ward
---
...really, just need to know where the throne room is (...for the horde...).
---
fucking lold
---
Oh that's clever.  He's trying to combine two pieces of falling sky:  Layering AND AddOns!
---
That’s not a union, that’s a cartel. But okay. Glad I’m not playing on your server.
---
Private servers are not the same as vanilla or classic
---
It took me two seconds to get it LoL
---
Also I have a chest pain, watching this hurts a lot.
---
This makes me sad
---
Ahhh the troll war...

---
Even then the build quality is much nicer on the g600. Use one its so glaringly obvious once you do that with razer you're paying more for the brand. Not even to mention the g-shift button and now game changing that is.
---
The most convincing argument I have seen against this addon is that with the ability to add a description or title, people are eventually going to be filtering through players with tools that calculate iLvl, which isn’t something that should be in Classic since some level 60 classes have BiS items that are blue or have low level requirements.
---
I think even without the LFG addon that there is a possibility of the iLvl thing happening anyway, but with the two combined it would likely become a problem too similar to retail, where every player becomes no more than a mere number.
---
You sure like to speak for the developers and what they intended.
---
Pretty much
---
yeah ban the addon.

1. Open more servers

2. Wait for release date 
---
3. People will get tired of queues and roll on the newer realms 
---
4. Profit
---
I remember back in Wrath i was in a guild where if you want to raid it was required to have Wowquote installed, an addon that plays funny sounds if you write stuff in chat. It had like 1000 sounds and it was always tested before raid started if everybody really had the addon by playing some sounds and if he couldn't hear them he needed to reinstall.... dang was a great time to be raid leader back then and make the rules...
---
Yes, you should use this for a business, it's a surefire path to success. Yes'es all the way. /s
---
I totally support these kind of addons. They were in vanilla. Its not at all the same as being teleported to a dungeon. YOu still have to be a part of the group, and if it falls apart its not like you can requeue teleport ect.  Im very excited for vanilla and appreciate everyones hype , but this doesnt break the "spirit" of classic.   
---
I think many on this sub are just abit over enthusiastic about getting away from the retail version.  
---
Let everyone enjoy their own adventure, that is the spirit of Vanilla.
---
I haven't watched the whole movie, but I have seen multiple clips and I think you hit it right on the head.  The CGI for the orcs is great and the voice actors for them nailed it.  But the actors were all stiff, robotic, or just bad.  The dialog was also hit and miss from the clips I saw.
---
I also saw quiet a bit of 'blatant green screen' issues in some of the clips, so there is that as well.
---
That is disgusting
---
They have said they are, depending on demand on launch day. The reason why I pointed out downloading the classic client is because I assume that the majority of everyone who wants to play classic have already downloaded the client. Blizzard knows how many [battle.net](https://battle.net) clients have downloaded the client, they know how many accounts are accessing said [b.net](https://b.net) client etc. I think they have a good idea of how many will play on launch. However they have also said they dont want to "just launch" servers. They want as many as possible to spread out on the available servers and then launch new ones if needed.
---
There has to be a drop-off to get rid of layering.
---
Then you're real gross, sorry to be that direct
---
Troll teeth, I think.  The ones north of Grom'Gol had horrible drop rates for this quest.  Then there are other quests with similar drop rates that literally take forever.  You kill so many trolls in STV for these quests.
---
Bound the BoE world epic Bloodrazor while levelling as a prot warrior that didn't tank, then vendored it when I found a better sword.
---
you don't have to install retail
---
You should go back to BFA ya fucking moron.
---
Truuuuuuuuuue! As a night elf I've had this struggle...
---
Moving forward in life.
---
NICE! we are still discussing what race, undead/undead or Orc/Troll not 100% sure yet but we are pvpers for sure so MIGHT go undead/undead.
---
Holy fuck man get a life.
---
They need hit gear badly
---
So what you're saying is it's actually fun and not just a joke if you aren't super anal about it? Who would've thought?
---
I agree, we needed a better name for the NA PST server :(
---
"LF tank WC, last spot"
---

---

---
New layer bois. too easy
---
I turn 25 on release too! Happy early birthday
---
mate that’s not what they teach you in stats class: individual statistics about death? no. how to understand data and perform calculations? yes
---
Just entering the dwarf starting zone as a hunter is enough to notice it’s a bit harder to space the autos out due to the lag. My friends want to play in PST but I’m about to just ninja roll my tune on skeram
---
Only issue is, none of them want to move. So I'm basically stuck, unless the decide otherwise between now and monday.
---
Let me guess. The pally was lvl 40ish, waiting for his RFD group to show up. You were lvl 12ish and he got you to flag pvp somehow.
---
You're supposed to use an item or get waterbreathing from someone.  It's dumb easy after that.
---
Vanilla had addons infinitely more detrimental to the "vanilla spirit" that added automation that was miles ahead of what this addon is capable of. Vanilla even had addons just like this one. Arguing against this pretty basic chat parsing addon seems absurd in contrast to the addons that have been available on private servers with the vanilla addon API, and what was available in actual vanilla like completely automating healing. All the people acting as if this is some how radically influencing the grouping process and not just cataloging chat messages into a convenient UI are being incredibly disingenuous. The auto-invite feature is a non-issue as well since no one would ever auto-invite random idiots into their strat runs lmfao. Literally all it does is make it easier for people to apply to groups and interact with each other.
---
If something as simple as that is enough to set you off and start demanding Blizzard bans the addon then I don't understand how any of you are planning to play at all. There are WAAAY bigger issues that have been proven to cause MASSIVE problems with the changes Blizzard has actually gone out of their way to make to the game like right-click reporting and layering. I find it very odd that something is simple as this addon would push people over the edge in contrast to those problems. It's a complete non-issue.
---
This just looks like a bad ass 16 bit Ragnaros! I am jelly.
---
Cool.
---
You can manage both! I believe in you lol
---
In the lava of BRD, off the edge of the world in Winterspring, or into a group of elite dragons.
---
With all those cig butts and shit? Come on man i know were all nerds but jesus christ that is absolutely disgusting
---
Stay on retail if you care about ilvl.
---
I don’t disagree.
---
Uh, this is classic. Transmog doesn’t exist. Gear is pretty distinct looking. You’ll be able to recognize their gear quickly and make a solid judgement off of that.
---
In Flames, Soilwork, At the gates, Area 51, Rising Moon, Edge of Insanity, Opeth, Burzum, Mayhem, Darkthrone, bathory, Mercy Fulfate, Celtic frost, King Diamond etc.
---
Absolutely.
---
An important part of being in a legit healthy relationship is both partners feeling secure and comfortable speaking up and resolving "conflict."
---
If someone wants you to log off and spend time with them, they should be comfortable saying exactly that. Thats easy to do when you have a partner you know is open and receptive to such messages. People cant read minds.
---
Yup. Velen is a TBC server that opened the day TBC dropped.
---
Not alot of competition for gear as a hunter, esp if you're going alliance since you're the only mail user.
---
Not sure about spellcloth though.
---
Two big reasons I'm going hunter is because they have great solo potential and not alot of competition for gear since I won't have as much time to play as I did when I was younger
---
protip, you already linked that, you dolt.
---
Watch TNG again maybe DS9 too, and maybe voyager.... ik I have a problem.
---
10/10 for the names.. 
---
Laughed more over Asmonbald and Omarworship then i shoud
---
Good guys Blizzard. Releases right before school so the kids can’t play and right at the end of vacation season so the responsible adults can’t either.
---
"No changes" and keeping worldbuffs the way they are is another one of those things. 
---
People didn't stack worldbuffs to that extent in Vanilla. Sometimes you'd hear of guilds doing it for Loatheb or Saph/KT but it was extremely rare.
---
They claim that changing it is going to make it more casual and this is a slippery slope. Ironically worldbuffs make the content trivial so you're already doing that by gaming mechanics of a 15 year old game.
---
If you take a look at all the guild-recruitment posts on Discord from "semi"-hardcore guilds they all require worldbuffs lol, that's not semi that's full on hardcore. Semi would be just using pots, hardcore is doing DM before the raid, logging off and gathering all worldbuffs which makes the game a joke.
---
Cigarette butts sitting on the table isn't clean my dude
---
Not gonna lie you had me in the first half.
---
Play Outward, honestly. Pick it up, and play it. Play it with a friend!
---
You should listen to this man. He's from the Future.
---
Even at endgame they can deal lots of damage as Ret with a really good 2H. To clothies at least.
---
Hellfire boars maybe

---
It's interesting. I think that's why Blizzard even say they're being cautious about what to do about it - the impression I get from the clip I linked, and people's discussion about Call to Arms (but now we're talking speculation) is that Call to Arms was far from the average/expected vanilla experience, and hence Blizzard do not want it to become the average/expected Classic experience. They're worried that such addons may become necessary if they have a (perceived) benefit, and if those addons become too prevalent then it does make a fundamental shift in the "fabric" of the general community's play style.
---
There is no summoning stones in classic.

Actually, i spilled the ash try by accident before i took the picture, I just left it in there for some extra texture
---
At no point does it automate the ***entire process***. You still have to talk to people, you still have to walk to the dungeon. You still have to interact with people that are only on **YOUR** server.
---
Auto-invite addons have been around since vanilla, this one does nothing new besides look nice.
---
There are some items from the level 50 quests that are entirely unique with unique effects, for example: The Rogue quest rewards a Cape that reduces fall damage that you take. You stack the cape with the passive Rogue bonus and you can survive some pretty hilarious drops.
---
Just because you won't necessarily need them doesn't mean you shouldn't get them, they're pretty great to have lying around, I spent an afternoon shanking people in Thunderbluff and whenever they chased me I would just straight jump off the side of the city, take next to no fall damage, and run away.
---
I mean, do you play the game to complete it quickly, or do you play the game for fun?  
---
A car wash?  I don't get that analogy, unless a car wash is fun, lol
---
Blizzard should have released a purchase "bundle" for wow classic, just a regular 30 day sub but linked to the launch day of wow classic and named thereafter. It would be a good way to gauge how many resubs will be coming.
---
Update the battlenet client
---
Hit up Kargoz on youtube. He has the closest thing to what you are looking for in the form of a 30min video. Leveling path is dealers choice really, but the efficiency in classic comes from reducing your travel time as much as possible so you are always spending time to earn exp and not running around back and forth.
---
It is raid viable for heals, and lets you swap gear sets to tank/dps dungeons or do solo content easily. Plus, it's not terrible in PvP, although it's not the best druid PvP build by a long shot. All around, really solid build.

---
TC do yourself a favor and look up the g4 episode of cheat for vanilla including the commercials.
---
You guys make valid points but I think the closer you are to launch the more valuable those pages will be for players who are racing to 60 and looking for a quick quest turn in, cost be damned. Every little bit counts!
---
I 90% Agree!  There is no endgame.  Take it easy, slow, etc.  the only reason I don't agree 10% of the time, is stupid quests like [Mark of Tyranny]( https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) which is bis until the end of time.
---
That's pretty much inevitable. People are already doing crazy math to determine values on items.

Teldrassil for me. That may be an obvious pick to you but I've been a lifer on horde so it's not somewhere I see often. I will always feel nostalgic for the nelf druid I made back in vanilla playing through that zone. I only got her to level 20 but that zone has always been a very strong memory for me even though I have thousands of hours playing horde. A lot of the alliance zones are my favorite. I know you guys prefer Ironforge but I was always impressed with Stormwind and the incredible amount of small details that were put into it. I spent many hours wandering it on alts observing NPCs and the different districts.
---
Yes! as long as you're the same faction, you'll be fine.
---
I have the name I want on Faerlina. Somehow got that when all the servers launched, but couldn’t get it when just Skeram and one other got put up. 
---
Definitely not leaving my chair.
---
Is OP trolling? People in here just keep explaining why it's not a big deal and he just keeps doubling down. Hey if you don't like the add on don't use it.
---
Pretty much. Most annoying shit ever. Oh and F Undead also. Stop looking around and let me see your ugly ass face you stupid bitch!
---
They may not allow transfers to a higher pop server. However it is an interesting question is saving 25 hours in queue, over the 1-60 journey, worth $25? Especially if you have several million in gold on retail that could fund it.

---
40 people are giving their time. Best case scenario every person who decides to play a lesser spec is taking time from the rest, worst case your guild won’t be able to progress in the later phases without weeks of wipes and a lot of undue pain.
---
The “ease” comes from the knowledge and ability to prepare. Part of the preparation is in raid comp and spec...don’t do those things then no it won’t be easy when progressing.
---
Not always a cliff nearby though =c

Silly ass kids these days are adorable. He's probably not going to even get to 60, much less clear MC.
---
You cannot cast other player's spells during MC, you simply control their movement.
---
You CAN however, use mob spells while Mind Controlling them, so if for instance you MC'd a mob with Fireball spell, you'd be able to use their Fireball. It makes for some ridiculous damage depending on the mob in question.
---
The Player will get the threat if you MC them into mobs (I did this a lot at the elite Ogre cave in STV)
---
You cannot make people use portals.
---
You cannot MC most bosses, but there is a boss in Naxxramas that requires Mind Control to defeat.
---
You can MC someone that just got out of MC, but it will not last as long.

I didn’t know this addon existed.  I can’t wait to use it.  Sounds like a major convenience.
---
Ofcourse not, that was just an example. Also would be useful when doing UBRS Strat Scholo or anything to see how much someome cleared etc. For me those are the most helpful addons if you are pugging
---
I do not forget. I explicitly address this, which is why my proposal has nothing to do with Blizzard actually changing anything about what made vanilla good. It is strictly about new content, and a restructuring of endgame progression.
---
Blizzard should not be trusted with making any changes to the game's structure--community polling or not, as the community is equally untrustworthy. It was us who said Ghostcrawler's "bring the player, not the class" was a return to vanilla's community-focused philosophy. What it actually was: class homogenization.
---
right because an automatic chat based group formation tool is exactly the same as classic becoming retail
---
Ilvl in classic hahahahah
---
Ilvl means !literally! nothing
---
Go play retail if youre using that addon
---
You do realize that some BiS gear can be lvl 45 from Mara.
---
I have NEVER met someone as dumb as [Karltanner2019](https://www.reddit.com/user/Karltanner2019/) in this subreddit, he takes the cake.
---
This is easy. Big shoulders? Male. Want to play human but ur friends are forcing you horde? Play female.
---
Lok'Tar motherfucker.
---
Yeah but if I go ally it would be dwarf hunter. Well guess I'll need to come to a solution soon.
---
kings get rained on though, put him inside next to a cozy fire
---
Depends on your race choice imo! 
---
Dwarves - Beer and fried mars bars
---
Night elves - Spirits and pixie sticks
---
Humans - Wine and bread
---
Gnomes - Soda and candy 
---
Tauren - Milk and beef
---
Undead - Surströmming and Garum
---
Troll - Rum and jerk chicken
---
Orc - Blood and broccoli
---
&gt;At no point does it automate the ***entire process***
---
I'm sorry, I didn't know we're going to be this pedantic. It does indeed not automate the entire World Of Warcraft Classic Gameplay Loop. It only automates the entire Group recruitment process. 
---
But I guess we're never going to agree on whether that is good or bad.
---
Platinum always on point with the memes :)
---
Post-it notes
---
Like raider.io, right?
---
There will always be that one player who thinks the group isn't going fast enough and will just start running forward for literally no reason.
---
IMO in this case it isn't the length of the post, but rather the insistence on continuing the dialogue which makes it a "big deal".
---
Can confirm. My high school ex was the person who initially got me to try it; when we eventually broke up one of the reasons was because I ignored him for raids. Oops.
---
It draws from all chat channels, meaning you can spam to people across the world without leaving the dungeon.
---
That is what everyone spamming LFG does anyways.  I just had a set of macros that I would change the instance name of and spam chat with them.  This is literally just that, but moderately easier.  Not even substantially easier.
---
Must be purchased in the checkout line at Microcenter.
---
maybe im wrong or just heard what I want to hear, but I was a tauren hunter in the stress tests and it sounded normal for me.
---
Ankh cost at max level is a non issue. People forget the cooldown on ankh is an hour in classic.
---
Your memory is failing Elemtrium is BWL. (if my memory is failing the mob you need to MC to learn to smelt them is def BWL. I think a bit after vael)
---
I'm actually planning on behind behind the curve lol
---
I'm honored to be your bookmark! Thanks :-)
---
how do we know you good for the prizes, where is the money coming from?
---
What gave you the idea that next year classic will have free lvl 20?
---
Yeah, I think some of the scenes were entirely green screen, and a few were actually on location where they built like half a set and used a big outdoor green screen for the background, those are the ones that look kind of obviously green screened. All in all, I expected it to be a garbage cash grab movie, as most videogame adaptation movies are, but I was pleasantly surprised what they did with it
---
They probably have API statistics. So there are no "secret" ones.
---
Is this Piccolo getting killed by some type of a saiyajin?
---
For someone who really didnt get too hyped for the annoucement of the classic release - this last week has been hell. I am doing pretty much nothing but planning. Planning my days meals so i can nuke them to avoid down time, planning my questing routes, planning my character professions and how to spec, planning what server i am going to be on. The only thing i dont seem to be planning for is my real life which i am willing to admit will not exist for a few months at least past monday.
---
I tried to swim to Ironforge from Westfall. Oddly I never made it.
---
Having a hard time .. $15usd (probably closer to $20cdn and likely tax on top too!) for a ‘14 year old game’. Now I loved it but not sub ed in awhile and time is hard zzz its a lot pf money to play jist classic.  
---
I don’t want current, just classic :/
---
Auto invite existed (whether that particular add-on chose to use it or not). In vanilla you literally used to be able to have add-ons play the game for you.
---
Auto invite is useless without role selection. And regardless it's useless for raid content because you have to be very selective with pugs due to how raid lockouts work.
---
Planning on going Enchanting/Skinning from the start. Enchanting for Smoking heart of the mountain for my druid tank. After wich not too sure if I want to drop enchanting for Leatherworking or not.
---
Yes. I hope they add at least one new server soon. World pvp is really fun but been there and done that. Just want to concentrate on PVE this time.
---
Im spanish at Shazzrah EU PvP, for the horde https://postimg.cc/jWgH76RW
---
Doesn't the agro switch to you as soon as your MC breaks? (For point #3)
---
If you're rolling warrior I just might..
---
Honestly don't understand the issue, especially people demanding it be broken by blizz, honestly just let people play the way they want, you don't have to use it and can find others who don't use it so what's the issue? Stop being so purist and let people play how they want
---
Funny coming from a guy thinking there is no mine with 10 nodes. I suggest you try the bottom left of the Shimmering flats for Mithril. Then realize that zone is connected to the zone above it with elites for Horde on chat. People will be doing elite quests there all the time and they won't even realize you aren't there because you are on another map.
---
Anything else I can help you with Mr. Broccoli? Now go back to the Classicast video/streamer you think isn't a fraud lol.
---
Get it yet? I'm telling someone as ignorant as you how I could easily exploit this and screw up the game you want to play and you are still attacking me.  “It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.”
---
They did change the sound, they don't go *BLAM* so much as *kersnick*, quite noticable if you compare them
---
I wasn't expecting to see a bunch of video clips from everything other than classic.
---
That's why I switched too blauxmaux
---
you are super dense if you think that.
---
Layering wont work because there is a server pop limit. But if we had 3 different servers, they all would have the same pop but the population would be spread among them. Its like if layering itself had separate caps and not just a single server cap.
---
poop
---
Damn. Heard someone talking about using MC on a paladin while playing Horde to get buffs. I must be mistaken. Thank you.
---
Go play Retail then.
---
Don't see people who still play CS1.6 over CS:GO getting their experience altered (ruined) by CS:GO-only players who want the QoL and features it provides.
---
No it doesn't... You have to specify the chat channel.  You can use it in all chat channels, but not at once.
---
EDIT:  Meaning you can set it to "World" chat, but that's the only one it's using at the time.
---
Because I want to?  Even if this tool wasn’t broken I probably wouldn’t use it often. I play with my friends most of the time. 
---
I can’t play the game if I don’t play it like you?  Lol go fuck yourself.
---
I am a full casual an I answered the poll. Time on the crapper well spent.
---
Boss makes a dollar I make a dime that's why I play WoW on company time.
---
Hey! I'm just trying to justify my actions. Don't break my narrative.
---
Really, I don't think most people go around looking for low levels except for bait. When you're questing and you just happen to be in the same area as low levels, yeah, red means dead. But that's more of a you're in my path type of situation instead of looking to gank.
---
It wouldn't be a big deal, but hear me out, what if we had the tank without aggro keep it up?
---
Hi, /u/LycanClaus

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu4pgt/what_are_things_new_players_to_wow_should_know/). 
---
It sounds more like you're the one being childish here. It's a realm of multiple thousands of people.
---
You should get a grip and stop ACTUALLY hurting the "spirit" of classic. Classic is not about saying fuck retail. Classic is enjoying the adventure how you want. This addon existed in vanilla, well before bfa.
---
Im going to sleep waking up at like 6 AM
---
I am fine with "getting trough" if its a guild group. But if its a pug I prefer everyone to know basics of a dungeon we are running atleast
---
You seem pleasant.
---
&gt;The guy you responded to has authored 4 posts in the last 6 months

He authored 4 posts. I show the fact that he authored 4 posts.
---
&gt;You link comments made by him
---
Not what we're talking about, buddy.
---
Every time someone brings up this point, you bring up a red herring. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t port you, it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t complete the dungeon for you. It matters that it makes the process *easier*. Not without challenge, not extremely easy, just easier.
---
*Hey there!*
---
*Seeee ya later!*
---
This is why I won't be inviting hunters to my groups as a warrior lol

---
World of Warcraft is a feeling, who needs a social life?
---
Are you a virgin that loves dildos or do you love dildos that have never been used before?
---
It doesn't matter though unless you he is your friend or sth. If its an upgrade for you its ok to need. 
---
Can't believe I defend huntards.
---
You think you do, but you don't. /s
---
Not really. Not everyone is a min-maxer. Most people will just be glad to have you, assuming you're not a dick, and you're decent.
---
Why not just make them  additional 60% mounts
---
It's really hard to actually "stockpile" for the war effort. It's literally 3 million+ items that need to be turned in. You would need a coordinated effort from multiple guilds, having literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bank alts, in order to really "stockpile" any noticeable amount of war effort turn-ins.
---
[Not merely possible.](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/).
---
ROFLMAO
---
Highest character was a 38 NE rogue, sold all my gear and everything else to buy some red colored cloth stuff so I could look like a ninja. Friend had to sell everything on his alt to get me some gold back just so I could regear
---
Huh boi an addon that’s a glorified macro 
---
And he calls the authorities or sth this is hilarious
---
You could call it Tuesday morning I guess.
---
So what you are against is not the addon per se, but the fact that people have accrued 14 years of knowledge / experience.
---
You can't just not use it. If it becomes popular then everyone will need to use it or they aren't getting a group. Just like raider.io in retail.
---
Dwarves are legit the only tolerable race in the alliance.
---
Only Really wands. But you can always afk  farm the weapon skills.
---
The fanbase didn't change, it just got larger.
---
I haven’t, I’ll 100% do that
---
I’m going undead priest (Shadow). Now I’m trying to figure out what professions to choose between. What I read so far people recommended either going tailoring/enchanting or herbalism/alchemy. Is it true that you need to commit tremendous time to the game in order to make alchemy valuable (farming recipes/harvesting etc). Thoughts?
---
Fire sucks for leveling because you just won't have the crit to make it worth it. It is also way more mana hungry than frost. I love fire though, great spec.
---
Gums
---
That'd be amazing
---
The first one they can enter
---
It only posts to selected chat channels, it actually tries to comb through all chat channels for instances of “Mage LF Deadmines” and notifies you.
---
I'm hoping fairbanks will be decently populated especially ally side. My mates wanted to go there when I wanted Herod. Might be for the best to dodge the queue but I really hope it doesn't die off
---
Cant pick my realm because Mankirk is full lol
---
I'd ask them to tell me what the F key does.
---
If they say "pay respects", I'll ask them politely yet firmly to leave.
---
Yeah let's act like everyone only goes on Reddit at work.
---
I used Call to Arms in vanilla.  It basically did exactly what this addon does.
---
I've been able to hold myself over for a while by playing Europa Universalis 4 of all things. Ever since I stopped playing WoW that has been my goto game. Ended up with about 2500 hours in it so far and I think the reason that it has lasted so long for me is the strong feeling of linear progression that a half-decent player can get out of it.
---
Sure, you can look at it and say "this is a dumb, boring map game with way too many dlc's to buy for it to be fun" but for me it really nails the whole "from small beginnings" schtick.
---
“NEED A HEALER THEN GOOD TO GO”...*waits and continues to spam for 30 mins in town*
---
“Social interaction”
---
I can’t wait to use the addon and get more out of my game time by avoiding needless chat spamming in town.
---
It's bad.
---
Really bad.
---
Like John Wayne Bobbitt bad.
---
Wear gloves.
---
Mages are slaves. We must fight against this insanity. Mages on the loose will be the death of everything.
---
For fuck's sake. Take the upvote and begone.
---
I'm a huge proponent of listening to the player base and believing them when they tell you what they want (for example, half a decade ago when we got "you think you do but you don't").  But it's beyond a doubt that a well-informed and in-tune professional or team of professionals at the studio need to still be in charge of maintaining game integrity and spirit.  
---
That's how OSRS does it - literally every even remotely impactful update to the game must be run through the player polling system and pass with an overwhelming majority voting it in.  That concept has its own set of issues too, but it's a great example of a pretty extreme philosophy of listening to your players and doing what they want you to do.  But even there, the Jagex team maintains ultimate control over the direction of the game.  They rarely implement something that players did not want, but they do occasionally "veto" something that actually did pass with a huge majority but then they realized some unintentional impact it might have and thought better of it.  And of course much more often, they'll pick and choose what gets polled in the first place.  They keep a close eye on the community and what they want, but if the community suddenly randomly wanted the EoC update (not that that would ever happen), they wouldn't even poll it to begin with.  So they maintain firm control over the direction of the game, while also constantly implementing almost exclusively things that most players want, in the way that they want it.
---
I kind of got offtopic there but my point was that even though I think listening to players is basically the right thing to do 100% of the time, someone still needs to be in control of the whole thing to keep the game within its own bounds, to keep the game being itself and not morphing into something else.
---
Hey guys I just wanted to make a quick video on this new information that was uncovered from the Reddit AMA with the Classic WoW dev team. I will be working to update my BIS list for phase 1 mage as soon as I can. The same goes for my world buff guide, Sorry about some wrong info being spread, but at the time it was how we thought Classic would be, but Blizzard can always change these things so I will do my best to continue to update any info that becomes obsolete.
---
I see. Thanks for answer. I dont like gambling with who I invite but it is what it is, I knew already that friend list will be my best friend if I decide to be a pugger
---
Oh come on now. The queue won't be anywhere near that small. Only an hour and a half? Hahaha please
---
You havent lived unless you have camped someone on your main to the point where they created another account just to make an alliance to whisper you to stop. 
---
To add context - the one i am talking about camped my alt for 45 mins in stv. It was definitely provoked lol
---
Can you add bank and mailbox(s)?
---
Addheral i will simply invest more time then the average joe, so getting ahead of the curve will happen naturally.
---
&gt; 90% of the content revolves around world pvp.
---
Elaborate?
---
Literally the only difference between pvp and pve servers is being able to gank people out in the world. I don't understand what you mean by "90% of content revolves around world pvp".
---
Eating your weed is fine. Just prepare it correctly. But I swear to god if you waste a perfectly good burrito by burning one end..... Rest In Peace.
---
Nice guess man
---
Pawn also requires to regularly Sim your character whenever you change something to get *proper* results for your statweights.
---
Which most people don't wanna do on retail since it's quite the hassle, despite some websites/addons/programs doing 99% of the maths for you.
---
Now multiply that with the "Classic good retail bad" mentality of hating Min/maxing and you'll quickly see why Gearscore will never work out regardless. 
---
The addon would need to sim every person everytime they change a piece of gear or a talent, then value their points and *then* it could tell you their *actual* Statweights which can translate into some arbitrary gearscore
---
Which is an insane amount of calculations that no sane person would ever host on their server. Forget it, GS should just stay away. 
---
If you ever just used the premade Pawn stats btw: That's not how you're supposed to use the addon at all.
---
No social interaction. That's Classic!
---
Oh yeah, mb. 
---
Should make Tank and DPS aware that the aggro the MC created will go directly to you, so the MC mob needs to die asap and the tank needs to pick up the adds quickly if you're gonna do this.
---
&gt; exactly the same as 
---
Well yep, precisely. It's not **exactly** the same as retail, its incrementally similar to retail. That's how Classic became retail - through incremental quality of life changes that specifically targeted things like LFG and social-interaction, among others, which the past decade's consensus has been that they detracted from the game experience.

Just resubbed today, my names were available. Wasn't expecting it but I'm glad. Decided to roll Alliance for some reason. Wanted to go Mage so I had to choose between Forsaken and Gnome. I've never properly played a gnome so I hope it was the right choice but dem racials.. also not the biggest fan of Horde cities. Bad memories of Undercity and Thunder Bluff elevators back in the day, though my computer is far better these days.
---
They are just saying that they will resart the server before release. Not a day, not a time. Could be today, tomorrow or on Monday night
---
Corporation run by a scumbag like Bobby Kotick says something will not be in product. It's in product. Do not pass go. False advertising.

You have to put in far more time than anyone else, and early on. Take off the 27th and 28th at least, and don't sleep in between. Pull a solid 48-72h all nighter, focusing solely on the most efficient leveling possible, and you'll be good to go for the rest of the expansion/way to 60.
---
Players ruined the social aspect of the game.  Not the functionality of an addon.

You can’t force people to talk with you, bud.

Gotcha

I have an Ultrawide :P
---
My wife wants to try Classic (she has a low LG retail mage) and she wants to tank. So I'm gonna roll a healer and hope she likes the tanking experience.
---
This addon is fine. It's compatible with chat. If you don't want to use it, you can use chat.
---
Someone's gonna die the day before classic comes out
---
The dude arguing hardest to be alliance was also alliance on retail. He still plays retail and hates the horde on a philosophical level. It's really frustrating, like can we just play a goddamn game together?
---
Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!
---
Good effort though. :D
---
Sorry but that’s a toxic attitude, if it’s raiding I can understand wanting them to at least watch a video guide before hand. But for a 5 man you want them to know the pathing and each mechanic of the bosses? Understand this is an MMO and some have played for years and others will be brand new to this just trying to get better. Just remember you were in their shoes at one time and should want the community and your chosen server to prosper with players continuing their playtime for quite some time rather than being an elitists and kicking noobs from a pug of a 5 man dungeon
---
Good bot
---
Lol go at the end of the video
---
Ahhhh. Thanks.
---
well, pre-mists so...
---
What he means by discord isnt the voice chat side of it, but the channels that most realms will have specifically for lfg, so a big chunk of lfg spam would be oit of game in these discord channels as opposed to being in game trade channel.
---
Also wow definately did have an automatic lfg tool back in vanilla, it was just garbage so nobody used it. It wouldnt differentiate between role, so it wmyou used it it would just randomly group 5 people together regardless of role, you could get 3 heals and 2 dps, or 5 dps (probably most common one).
---
can you send me the link where the events are being hosted?
---
Nobody wants their servers flooded with kids. Good time to start. It's all the same for working adults.
---
Thank you very much, I'm really pleased my macros help you build your own setup.
---
People do bring up that information issue, and for those people I recommend the exact same solutions you outlined. For me it hasn't been an issue. When I'm looking at the screen, my icons are not the focus of my vision so it doesn't matter that the cooldown isn't displayed. I have to make the decision to glance down at my icons to check the cooldowns, so I can tap the modifier at the same time. I can do this during a GCD to avoid wasting available casting time since longer cooldowns don't display the GCD.
---
Secondarily, by condensing the number of long cooldowns displayed at a time, my eyes can more quickly pick up and register the particular cooldown in which I'm interested. If I glance down and see only one (relatively) static icon amidst a dozen GCDs I can focus on it. If there are 3 icons that are mostly greyed out, each with a reddish image underneath and in close proximity to each other, it takes a tiny bit longer to register the relevant information.
---
In PvP, I never find it's the case that I need to hit a ~15 second cooldown the moment it comes up. I can check the cooldown during GCDs and as it gets closer I know "at the next time it's advantageous to interrupt, it'll be off cooldown" rather than simply Pummelling every 10 seconds. More over, if I am expecting something to nearly be off cooldown, I don't actually have to look: I can just tap the key until it triggers.
---
It's really not awkward in practice, your fingers are going to be dancing on your modifier keys in general anyway. Like checking your watch, it doesn't take but half a second to glance down at it.
---
I think your macros are excellent, and the /cancelaura Bloodrage is really clever. However, I wouldn't use "harm" in your second conditions. With harm, if you aren't selecting a target then the buttons won't trigger anything. By default, attempting to use a harmful spell like Charge with no target would fail to cast then select the nearest target. I'd also use [nocombat,nostance:1]Battle Stance so that you don't accidentally switch to Battle without actually being able to Charge.
---
I might steal that Bloodrage trick, if I can possibly squeeze it into my charge macro. In fact, I probably won't use the Hamstring variant in my OP, which will give me room to include /cancelaura for my mount too (very important for chasing in PvP). No automatic dismounts in Classic, after all.
---
For your defensive stance issues, consider the conditionals [pvp] and [nopvp]. I've used conditionals like [group:raid,nopvp] to signal a PvE raid environment. I'm sure you'll figure out a good system.
---
It's honestly the best mini-game to pass the time traveling. Even better than bejeweled.
---
It's true.
---
Go Druid! Stealth, low gear dependence but also low gear competition, can tank almost all dungeons and raids. I was in your shoes until a few days ago, but I’ve now convinced myself.
---
Never Really thought of that... now I need to rethink my mage or hunter situation 😅
---
Yes there was. 
---
It's called "Classic", an almost perfect copy and rendition of Vanilla. That's what players wanted, and that's what we should be getting. Classic isn't supposed to be "Vanilla plus QoL changes that we get to pick and choose from when we think it's convenient".
---
point to the lie?
---
Yup! I moved from Fairbanks.  Actually got my name this time too!
---
I still have a can of the Horde game fuel. Maybe it's time for me to crack that open and see what comes out. I remember it tasting a lot like code red.
---
Don't worry, it'll still be around. I promise. 
---
Gotta love Dark Legacy, though.
---
&gt; One of the major problems of that realm is the unbalance between factions.
---
You have no way to know this.
---
So is it Resto as spec, but using feral for all other content, or is Balance the other choice here?
---
lol as if man
---
I'm kinda surprised anyone will use a LFG Discord. It's not that hard to find groups....
---
You’ve self-owned, guilds are social connections that stick around, lol. You’ll continuously see them, which is another way social connections are made. Working through challenges with guild groups forms the same connections, and you’re less likely to leave a guild group. Also, it doesn’t matter how difficult it is to form the *initial* group (which is where most people stop thinking about the impacts of stuff like this), it matters how hard new groups are to form and how hard it is to find replacements.
---
I’ll be tanking by the way. Of course I have no proof, this a discussion of principles and possibilities, not the past, but the future. I have evidence, but yeah this is mostly a though experiment
---
Nothing. I canceled my sub a bit ago and haven’t really found any video games fun. WOW was the only game I found to be fun, but BFA got way too boring - felt like I was making no progress no matter what I was doing. So I really haven’t been doing anything.  Tried playing sekiro/nioh/dark souls and it was fun for a bit, but I need a game like wow that doesn’t bore me to death (like rift, eso, terra, and eq all did)
---
I will not be charging my brothers and sisters of the Horde any fees for food/water/portals. A tip is always appreciated and will help me keep the free food/water/portals coming, but not required. For the Horde!
---
Sincerely, your Forsaken Mage Troublemite of the Blammo realm.
---
How did you get hour and a half from 832 mins?
---
That’s pretty close to 14 hours brother.
---
I hope not :P
---
There is no reason to do this because gear won’t really matter for anything pre-BWL and you aren’t going to pug BWL.
---
Honestly this looks sick
---
Thanks for bringing this to my attention; I hate it.
---
Nothing is stopping you from creating lists of friends and guilds while using the addon.
---
You are just circle jerking.  Don’t worry, it’ll be out soon.  And you will still play it to death regardless if this addon exists or not.
---
Get back in line, little consumer.
---
Squuuwuwuwuwuwu
---
Ehhh 45 minutes to form dungeon group? I hope it wont be that long!
---
Im on zandalar tribe and im genuinly hoping it stays medium, however I think regardless of the realm queues will hit everyone on launch
---
&gt; I agree with people who say that PVE isn't playing the full game. But I don't have time for the full game anymore.
---
And if you go on a pve server and want to pvp the option is always there.
---
The market will correct itself.
---
I haven't played WoW for years. I have been trying to play on retail in preparation for classic, but I cannot stand retail.
---
Retail is so bloated, and it doesn't feel like you are progressing at all. I make almost no choices for my character. For me, it's like playing a space flight game that is open world versus an on rails shooter.

Hel with what? Sounds like you're doing everything right.
---
Plenty of people will roll.alliance just because most horde races are ugly. And even them. More horde means more world pvp
---
Sorry, didn’t realize I said FTC from my perspective it looks like I typed BBB. My mistake champ.
---
Yes it is. You can't say something won't be in a product and then have it in.
---
Team whitemane. Get this shit to the front page!
---
Depends how much you will compromise for your tank(loot reservations etc), 45min is definitely not rare.
---
Jesus calm your tits
---
Except this addon won't make it fleeting and unimportant like retail, first, you still need to travel to the instance, second, you are always only the same realm as your group members, meaning reputation is important.
---
People comparing this to retails experience of dungeon finder are dishonest and idiotic.
---
Or are we pretending that spamming chat for people gives a fundamentally different experience? Because it doesn't.
---
thanks doc
---
This is why I'm quite happy that I have at least 4 friends playing this time around.  
---
That way I can at least yell at them when they fuck up.
---
Agreed. Yeah idk why they're down voting me either I'm speaking the truth
---
The worst one of all time are Goblins. They fucking swing left and right like every 2 seconds
---
Gen Z. Generally people born between 1997 and 2012, per Pew Research.
---
Before Rend.. if I recall correctly..  the mobs after the egg room run with low hp and also knock you off the ledge when they charge
---
Honestly, a threat-meter and that’s about it.... oh and the DPS meter as well
---
It’s not about the queues. It’s about giving the community a choice of two hotels from the beginning. The community clearly states right away that two hotels isn’t enough for the huge amount of people that want a place to live. Blizzard decides not to listen to the feedback. The community reluctantly follow Blizzards intent, and move into one of the two hotels.
---
As predicted, the two hotels gets overcrowded right away. After a few more days Blizzard somehow seems surprised of the situation, and decides to build another hotel, and urges the community who settled in two the two previous hotels to move across. The third hotel is now filled, snd they build another. How many times will this happen before and after launch? Established communities gets ripped apart because of this. 
---
The community is pissed about this because the message was clear right away, two pvp servers wouldn’t be enough for classic EU. Blizzard didn’t bother to listen to this feedback until it was already to late.
---
This has nothing to with queues for me. This is about established communities and also reserved names. Long term server health is important, but thinking that 4 full servers at launch will be enough for the huge demand of this game is frankly ridicolous and delusional.
---
Because it sends automatic invites based on keywords, and it filters players into a numerical list rather than people to actually talk to.
---
I am always the creator of the group
---
Making linen bolts is a good chunk of that. It's not bad.
---
Well "fun" is all relative.  Someone people will enjoy torturing themselves trying to beat MC with a full meme spec raid.  Others want to spend their life away and blow consumables/world buffs up the wazoo just to clear content that doesn't need those buffs.  My guild is somewhere in between.  We might consume/buff up early to first beat content, but I don't think we're really planning to speed run meta stuff.  We might end up doing split runs just to challenge ourselves more.
---
Yeah 😂
---
Weird
---
My guild were planning to make a google doc list that we can all edit and put a note for the reason why we want to blacklist the guy.  
---
I don't think there will be a doc server wide. I highly doubt it.
---
Until the next expansion...
---
I don’t see anything wrong with that. I’m not a fan of wasting my time in dungeons with bad players. And this addon will allow me to add more people to my friends list to play with.
---
Then not allow free realm transfers. Problem solved. But i highly doubt people will be transferring very much, itll be like a 24 hour cooldown and its mainly to just get people to play with their friends. You really only know like 40 people out of the entire pop anyways, i dont think it would matter.
---
I was a 60 druid.
---
druids are actually pretty good at PVP. it's all about the long game and surviving.
---
if you go like 1/29/22 or whatever is hotw spec, you'll be as effective as a resto druid, yet will definitely be able to tank. like I used to off tank in MC and in other places.
---
18k armor is no joke. like if you're in PvP rogues can't kill you instantly with 75% damage mitigation
---
Isn’t this just essentially what’s done in retail only the server transfers are dynamic and not permanent.
---
wait till you have 10 of the 40 pugs go afk , or leave directly after whatever boss they want gear off
---
MonkeyQuest is a vanilla addon.
---
Tony Stark in the cave comes to mind
---
Yes, this is true.
---
Mazen's Behest...That takes the cake for me too
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
This is blown out of proportion because it’s not at all the same as LFG in later expansions.  It’s just using game functions to ease group finding.  Spamming chat for groups is not social interaction.
---
This is the biggest circle jerk I’ve seen on this sub so far.
---
Something in the style of Ghost would be great
---
That is exaxtly what im saying. That is stupid too.
---
I would like for everyone to stay safe! However, queue times would be a little shorter if some people die, so... ehhh
---
There are more quests then you could ever possibly do while still being at the same level as those quests so your logic doesn’t really make sense. Maybe they intended for you to play through with multiple characters doing multiple quests who knows but you shouldn’t assume to know what they wanted
---
Don't be afraid to grind. Grinding is equal or maybe a bit slower than questing, but you also make a lot of money out of vendorables and more mobs means more chance to get a good boe. If the quest areas are congested, instead of grinding to supplement questing, you can quest to supplement grinding.
---
Troll mage. Very good leveler, top 3 DPS, very strong both in pvp and pve.
---
Can we keep a statistics on how many breakups are about to happen?
---
Stealth.
---
Stealth + boomkin.
---
Shadowmeld + MC.
---
8am 27th, Tuesday morning in Aus - right in time for me to start work :'(, 26th everywhere else?
---
I'm confused mages and warlocks are great at both pvp and pve
---
Hellfire's skybox was one of my biggest "wow" moments when walking through the dark portal.
---
I got 2 2 letter ones on reservation day
---
xD
---
Blizzard confirmed it's referred to as DM.
---
And for the record, literally no other instance in WoW is abbreviated after its last boss; they're abbreviated after their actual names. Wailing Caverns = WC, not Muta, Ragefire Chasm = RFC, not Jergosh (or even worse, JTI, Jergosh the Invoker). It's obvious Dead Mines = DM. Referring to it by its boss is fucking stupid. No other dungeon does that, short of Ony which is literally called Onyxia's Lair. I don't see Dead Mines being named Vancleef's Caverns or some other shit, in which case VC would make sense..
---
Two bears four turnips five space ships.. 
---
My non native brain is too small for this
---
He's a paladin though.
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
in LFG discord you have to talk to people in one way or another. 
---
This shit automates everything and even auto invites for you. 
---
There is a strict line of what classic is and what it is all about. any attempts of changing that either stupidity or trolling.
---
Premade groups as a feature should not be in classic at all. Use /lookingforgoup chat.
---
Nah BS artists claim there are no caves with a bunch of mining nodes in them in Classic.
---
Most raid mobs will be immune to this. However, you can make plenty of progress in the small instances, and if there's an undead mob in the pack, you can shackle it and be a 2-CC party member. That's neat.
---
Bears do not.. What is going on?!
---
Is that worth as a mage with free food?
---
Omg that’s amazing I’m so retarded
---
Sounds like you want mage or warlock
---
okay sure, I agree with what you're saying. But I feel like this would only apply if you need to run a fair distance to the next mob after killing one, but a lot of the time you have to run for like 3 seconds to get within range of the next mob. So wouldn't the mob density of the area you're killing in change whether or not you should be using hawk or cheetah?
---
That's a valid concern, if blizzard planned to change classic, but since they don't, the whole slippery slope argument is garbage.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
Your reasoning does not work in practice.  You could have a lvl 59 rouge who has been playing classic wow for years on private servers perform better than someone who has better gear and has completed the starting dungeons at least once.  Completing a dungeon doesn't tell you anything about how good or toxic the player is.  EVERYONE should start as a clean slate when forming a dungeon group.  Decide for yourself whether you want to kick the person if they are being toxic or wiping the group.
---
No, with Herod 1, Herod 2, Herod 3, your name will be unique and registered on all of the databases so if you are playing on Herod 1, and someone tries to take it on Herod 2, they cannot because it will be unavailable. Hence the free transfers but only on the same name server.
---
Thats the whole idea with this. So when you do server merges, you dont run into that problem. Which is way better than server merging some random ass Blowme and stallagg realm that will force someone to lose their name.
---
Roll mage if you like casting, they are pretty fun in all areas of the game
---
I'm talking about everyone's list.  Lots of annoying people like this to avoid.
---
&gt;  razer you're paying more for the brand
---
you could probably say this about all razer products lol
---
All of the classes are viable. Some specs aren’t the most viable. Mages and warlocks are both fantastic dps, if you want a caster dps.
---
Ugh, forgot about that quest.
---
Sure if you needed gear specifics, but tbh just an interface with what groups are looking for members with an option to whisper the group leader is likely to go untouched by Blizzard.  I'm just pointing out that all these "ban this addon" posts really wont get them what they want.  Wow players are resourceful and lots of us have far less time to play so any kind of stream lining will be used by the player base.
---
!Remindme 6 days
---
Might not be indeed. I enjoyed it a lot back in the days, I dont know if I will have patience this time to play with people who body pull trough whole dungeon run
---
Wasn't there one made in vanilla?
---
To other players, are all our characters tracked to our bnet account now?
---
As the days get closer the quality of meme's have gotten downright impressive.
---
I resubbed specifically for the stress test a few weekends ago. I bought a token to resub about a month in advance and didn't earn quite enough in live to buy another one, so I bit the bullet and got 6 months. I know I'm going to be playing classic for at least that long anyway, so it's worth it. Plus it gives me some cushion to get my gold farm up and running in retail.
---
Retail is now basically _only_ for funding my classic subscription.
---
Wow legit first time someone hit me up with a serious comment, 
---
Yeah I also thought so about the layering but the idea was so cool for me that I could not let it go lol, i Tried hard to make it as clean as possible but still kind of unpolished, 
---
Ty a lot for encouraging me man, means a lot for real, also i'll try to become a real neckbeard and do some quality content, hope this also works out for you bro.
---
Well since you care about my opinion so much: No, it isn't ironic. hth
---
And if you straight up only grind to level... people will be max level with no profs, no attunements, decent gear, no reps and 100% pricing for mounts (ouch!).
---
IIRC, one of the polls had more results for Grob from East Coast players than West Coast. Finding people should be no problem.
---
You need to go outside and take a walk bud.
---
Ah ok very true
---
This is how I feel with Terraria, waiting for Journey's End as they add Master mode.
---
Debating whether to play WoWClassic, I played it a lot back in vanilla, but I do really enjoy newer features like achievements that I imagine they don't have.
---
Right lol
---
It was always DM on my server (NA) in Vanilla, I never heard anyone call it VC.
---
The only time I heard it called VC was from Europeans.
---
Dire Maul is DM east, DM west, etc etc
---
Clearing scholo 3 times doesn't tell you how good that player is.
---
Pretty sure that eyeball landed in Northwatch.
---
Night Elves do not have brains. Literally. Explains how they can live so long. When you die, your brain dies. But if you don't have a brain, you can't die. When you get a bruise, your skin becomes purple. Then the brain tells the skin to not be purple. If you don't have a brain...  
---
I have a masters in biology.
---
I can't even fully focus at work right now.
---
It wouldn’t teleport you to and from the dungeons. That is my major problem with LFG. Even Pantheon the new MMORPG in development by the creator of EQ will have a social LFG tool, but it will just help people group up, and it won’t give rewards for doing dailies or any of that junk.
---
Thank you so much for these amazingly kind words, please know that they mean the world to me, and thank you so much for supporting the show by simply listening, I really do appreciate it xx
---
Ye. And, as someone suggested, there is no breaks on qol train.
---
To break lfg tool blizz should
---
1) disable most addons
---
2) fail cause lfg tool will still exist in other place out of the game
---
fuck, this post is retarded, and dont plan on pugging BWL lol
---
hey are you from the future or something
---
Dude this is layers within layers
---
Totally opposite experience from my time in vanilla. The pigeon holing was pretty standard in the circles I ran in.
---
Is this zoomer joking?
---
The target audience isn't retail wow players. What.
---
Report the add-on on curse. you have to be signed in for the Report button to be clickable. It is obvious why so many people are vehemently opposed to the add-on. I reported it for being against the Classic ToS
---
lol, the first time i looted the sunwell legendary bow a warrior took it too xD
---
Would you mind explaining how it isn’t ironic?
---
Ima immerse myself in the group took 4 days off so hopefully I will get to crossroads by then
---
Depends which spec we're talking about. The only one that is totally 100% a joke is probably Protection Paladin, they have too many limitations, such as: They have no taunt. They have a limited resource for threat generation. Gear is horribly itemised for them, forcing them to give up either threat generation or damage mitigation to increase their Mp5.
---
Everything else can be made to work to some degree, and even Protection Paladins have a job in 5 man Dungeons. Just in a raid environment these specs don't really thrive.
---
They're not optimal. Some of them have value for leveling or pvp though.
---
Only retarded people called it VC.  You don't name the dungeon after one boss.
---
it was pandas for me too.
---
I suspected classic and poe might have some overlap in players..
---
This isnt automating it, this is literally just a graphical replacement for chat spamming in cities.
---
The classic purity crowd really is some of the stupidest fucks on this planet.
---
That's the problem I've got. There's a website that does custom deskmats like that, but it would litterally *just* fit on my desk. And I don't see the need for my keyboard to have anything under it.
---
True. They are probably going to spend more time in retail than classic, while I will be playing classic exclusively.  We're going to have a discord meeting tonight, and I think that is going to be my main argument. If they are really my friends, I would hope they would consider changing their minds to play with me.
---
Use the search function to see heavy discussion and testing on this topic. It's still on the hot page. You'll get more information rather than people opinions.
---
Nightmare is the way it was meant to be played tbh
---
the guides helped me make not hate the swamp of sorrows, there are quest that end up there and aren't started there
---
That wasn't why they called it VC lol. It wasn't because of the name of the dungeon. What do you think people first went down there to do?
---
That's sweet.  I hope you really do that, even for a day.
---
thats like your opinion, but some people might think otherwise. If you have better ideas aside from waiting in queue or trying to force people to switch to a realm they have no interest on playing on, let me know.
---
This is the biggest and most retarded circle jerk I’ve seen on this sub.
---
I would be okay with an add-on where you could list recommendations for players like yelp
---
You know you can "auto invite" people who whisper you manually, right? Just right clic invite people who whisper you.

 **&lt;Shadow Realm&gt; \[Horde\] | Faerlina | NA-East-PvP | Raid Times: TBD | Semi-Hardcore | EPGP / Loot Council**
---
**Intro**:
---
We're a guild build from friends and we're looking for like-minded people that are looking for pwning Alliance scum and dominating in raids as much as a semi-hardcore can. Maturity, talent, and experience is highly seeked by us but anyone who's shows potential, willing to learn, and they're chill are welcome.
---
**What We Are Looking For** :
---
We're are the Shadow Realm! All are welcome as we send our enemies into the Shadow Realm while we feast on their souls.
---
\- Currently all classes and specs are OPEN. We might have restrictions on classes later on.
---
\- A pair of raid leaders/players interested in raid leading
---
\- 80% Raid Attendance (Raid absence must be called out 3 days before the raid.)
---
\- Ability to reach 60 in a timely manner (3-7 weeks)
---
\- Guild oriented players interested in PvP, Raids, BG’s, and other guild activities
---
\- Ability to handle banter and humor
---
**Loot Distribution: EPGP / Loot Council**
---
**Expectations for Raiders (raiding optional)**:
---
In general, we're pretty laid back except for raids. We want to have a few rules to make sure we get people on raid days:
---
1. Keep a professional, mature, and positive attitude as well as team fist mentality. Communicate with your officers if you have any criticisms.
---
2. Perform at the highest level possible and improve your character constantly for both PVE and PVP.
---
**Expectations for PVP**:
---
No Alliance lovers. Must HATE Alliance. Can't ever lose against them. We send them to the Shadow Realm, they don't sent us. Otherwise, do whatever as long as there is an Alliance corpse. We are planning in the future when Phase 2 comes out to have PVP days where we have raids hunting down Alliance scum.
---
**Application**:
---
Just come join our Discord guild and talk to us. We want to get to know you and see if you're a good fit for our Discord.
---
[https://discordapp.com/invite/NcccHSs](https://discordapp.com/invite/NcccHSs)

Good way to kill some time till Classic to post elitist shitpost
---
I honestly think it is the true experince. You're going to get ganked, you're gonna wanna pull your hair out sometimes but it's all worth it for the Wpvp. For me its exciting knowing every corner I turn to I could be killed by the enemy faction. Stranglethorn Vale with a group of friends is great fun. Always on the prowl for the enemy faction. It gives you a sense of pride in your own faction. If you ever get to experince a Tauren Mill vs Southshore I bet you'll be thankful you went to a PvP server.
---
there are lots and lots
---
Well, I never said they weren't viable, all I said is I wanted too play something MORE viable. I never played Vanilla and was under the impression that their was a sort of tier too the classes.
---
Leaps and bounds different from raider.io
---
That’s something that literally tracks your character and progress
---
Gotcha. Is there any sort of way I can reliably price my tax on the enchant so that it is reasonable? I dont want to lose out on potential earnings but also dont want to rip people off.
---
Dude same. I've never seen any kind of skill tree so massively jumbled like that. I got a headache just looking at it. Uninstalled that shit immediately
---
I know both are listed, I was just making sure you knew that the BBB doesn’t do shit.
---
i cheated on her so i dont have to worry about that
---
Log-in queue simulator 2019
---
Ding ding ding!  That worked.  I was trying to find the EXE file but what you do is navigate to:
---
    C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_classic_
---
Then select add folder.
---
Working as intended
---
No, it really isn’t.
---
You need to break global chat communication. You can keep raid communication.
---
They killed oQueue by implementing it into the base game as the Group Finder. The only reason oQueue was ever agains the ToS was because it had a donation button, which addons aren't allowed to do.
---
If you have any experience with PvP in MMOs, then I would say yes, play on a PvP server. All of the low level zones (until level 20ish) are considered friendly territory, so you can't be attacked until you have a little bit of a feel for the game anyway. I will agree that it is the "true" experience, but if you haven't ever played before and don't like PvP, I think I would suggest playing on the PvE servers. There are a few zones where it is very difficult to quest due to the amount of world PvP, and personally I enjoyed my time on PvE servers almost as much as PvP.   
---
That said, the most important thing is going to be finding people you enjoy playing the game with. If your friends are playing on a PvP server, you will want to play with them. I think you will have a harder time enjoying the game without friends than by choosing between PvP/PvE.
---
Which is why we have a 1.12 AV that will completely backfire? LOL at the faith you have in Ion. Omar and Brian seem to care. Ion already manipulated you by trying to insinuate tier 1 and 2 always had 16 debuffs. They didn't They had 8. Ion knows that to. He was a raider in Elitist Jerks on a Resto Shaman at the time. He was just manipulating the audience to accept what he decided on.
---
Yeah, it’s not happening.
---
It’s not a good idea. Nobody wants to be on a completely different server in a couple of months.
---
...that's not "90% of content revolves around world pvp". That's your subjective opinion on what world PvP is.
---
Also I played vanilla PvP private servers for 4 years. Hated world pvp because 99% of it was just unfair ganking.
---
Ret paladin can be used to buff the raid and use nightfall. You only need one though.
---
Atleast one sulfaras MS needer.
---
Oomkins, dps shamans, survival hunters can be accepted in casual mc/ony runs because for them the hardest part is getting 40 people and not the bosses.
---
But dont count on getting in for vael in bwl.
---
farm prof &amp; farm elementals
---
Shazzrah seems like it's full of Britbong 4channers.
---
So generally not a pleasant or relaxing place to hang out. Probably good for memes though :/
---
It could cause problems if people start filtering out for example druids and paladins, even for low level dungeons, because they've been brainwashed into thinking that "only warriors can tank". Or they filter out all dps except rogues and mages.
---
There are going to be some really good rage videos for people that experience crashes/disconnects.
---
&gt;You don't name the dungeon after one boss.
---
Nope you don't. Also not the reason it was called VC.
---
Generic raid mobs are immune? Damn. Thanks.
---
This sort of addon could have existed back then, it just didn't.
---
Slipper slope is stupid in this case aswell, it literally can't get worse than this, there's no slippery slope here.
---
Every form of journalism is like this. I freelance writing automotive stuff for different magazines and websites and if I every said I didn't like the car I was test driving they'd never give me the keys to another one of their cars again. You have to be a huge company or a very big deal (I.E. Top Gear) to talk shit about a car.
---
PoE's next league looks super interesting and I'm just like y'all still gonna lose a ton of players, myself included, sry see you in 4.0 maybe
---
Actually it’s a lot more than what you just said, and your response being this pretty much sums up how in depth you’re capable of thinking. Long term, not healthy for the game. Have a good one!
---
WTT Tity on Thalnos
---
&gt;  there is a block list,
---
The problem is that if someone starts trolling, other people will engage them. So blocking doesn't really solve the issue.
---
Reports are the only way.
---
Sorry to hurt you with fact and reason. 😂
---
MonkeyQuest is just a window that shows your current quest progress on screen without having to open the quest log. It's not a leveling guide.
---
Zygor had a paid leveling guide addon in vanilla but it came along pretty late.
---
It's RNG on top of RNG.
---
It would populate the list with the LFM spam coming from the LFG channel or it's own private channel which is how they worked in vanilla.  If that doesnt work or is broken they just will make a website version and take in ad revenue and pull data right from the armory.  Regardless it's here and it's not going away.
---
Yeah....leveling a priest tailor and I'm really not sure if I'll keep up on first aid.  I expect I'll be grinding for cloth as is &gt;.&lt;
---
I thought I should tank mobs as a hunter, because my pet would hate me if it died (I wasn’t about to risk my raptor dying) and I thought “why use arrows when they cost money?”. So I was to the core a huntard. I was a mele hunter that didn’t allow my pet to tank.
---
What if a ton of people wanna play on Herod 4 and it becomes over populated but they can't switch for another week?
---
Played both to 60 in vanilla and Mage is quicker. Also quicker to make friends as you’re a walking buff, port and food vendor in a world of inconvenience. 
---
Rogue is not as bad as people make out though, as you can do certain quests a lot quicker through stealth. You can also choose your battles on a PvP server, apposed to being straight-up ganked as a Mage.
---
What was the name of that super rare shit needed to raise a dead mage at Southshore graveyard? I’ve outleveled Hillsbrad and half of the quests in Arathi before the yetis coughed up the item
---
It's not auto if you have to do it manually you brainlet
---
I swear I was thinking of this today before reading Reddit.
---
I’d rather just have 1 server that has everyone and if it’s full then it’s full. I can chose to wait or play an alt on another server. The whole point is that you can run into anyone on the server at anytime.
---
Do you not have adblockers?
---
&gt; it truly is not a big deal.
---
ok guess we dont need it then.
---
I'm honestly not sure what your trying too say but thank you for the reply lmao. 
---
I know boomkin is Balance Druid, and shadow meld is for NELF. Just not sure what MC is.
---
In retail?  You DPS immediately.  Aggro is not a problem except maybe if you're single targeting a mob in an AoE pull and your tank isn't paying much attention.
---
With that logic, all servers are just layers with different names.
---
Stalagg and Whitemane? Dude, those are just layers with a name! Woah!!
---
Classic Players: we love this game

Blizzard: we get it, but to make the experience pleasant, pls spread out on the different servers. Here's some more.

avoid bathing, statistically a lot people die in the bath!
---
Implication.. are these women in danger?
---
no they shouldn't. It's a tool you don't ban hammers becuase a bunch of idiots are using them on skrews instead of nails.
---
A tool is just that, a tool.
---
French who hate french community here, on what server should I go (PvP)?
---
To be fair, more people played vanilla back in 2005/2006 than are playing BfA right now. :P
---
According to some shitbird in the comments, realm forums are being added upon launch
---
Definitely the foundry full of goblins in Deadmines.
---
No, it certainly applies here. Also these types of addons did exist back then, however addon visibility was much lower. 0/2 nice try!
---
&gt; If you have better ideas aside from waiting in queue or
---
Your Herod5 would still get full and you would have to lock it so people couldn't get on it, and when it was full, if all those people that had made characters tried to log on at the same time, they'd still be waiting in a queue.  You didn't solve queues.
---
&gt;  trying to force people to switch to a realm they have no interest on playing on
---
Herod3 doesn't solve this issue either.  They don't want to be on Herodghosttownmergegroup, they want to be on Herod3.  A bunch of randos they've never heard of show up because they got merged away when Herod2 and Herod1 populations dried up.
---
You have no actual solution here.
---
I’m actually our Feral OT.
---
Don't feel to bad. Most of 'em are also immune to taunt. 
---
Imagine how much fun it's going to be to get retail-only players to wrap their heads around that one.
---
I think it would be more important for your own self-discovery to go on this journey yourself. Namaste.
---
Create a website and have people app for your super important dungeon runs.  Hilarious thread.
---
It seems I may have been wrong about my thinking. See I thought there was like tier list too classes when it came too Classic. I guess in Classic, Spell casters are where its at.
---
We used to use this rule on our server:
---
dm is deadmines
---
DM is dire maul
---
Trying to customize my trolls face but he keeps bending down to look at his toes.
---
You don't need 95% of the player pool. You need tank.
---
A lot the early pulls in dungeons are a huge wake-up call.   
---
\-The very first 4 pack of lizards in Maradon will mess up any group who isn't ready for the AoE silence.  Also, there is a pretty nasty rock elemental patrol that will aggro if you don't pull the lizards back. 
---
\-The very first pull in undead strath is pretty difficult if your tank doesn't know how to AoE tank and the healer doesn't line of site the caster skeletons. 
---
\-The first undead pull in Dire Maul west is super difficult without a priest in your group for shackle undead.
---
He announced on the Classicast podcast a few hours ago that he will be rerolling horde and shaman this time around.

I thought this was sar'theris strand, too :)

---
Anecdotal and all, but my old vanilla raiding guild had a token feral druid. He tried his absolute damnedest to do as much dps as possible. He farmed tons of consumables, geared well, played well.
---
We had some very bad rogues in our guild. I don't really know why they did so poorly. They had solid gear. Maybe they didn't use slice and dice at all or something. But the decent rogues (who still didn't even use consumables because we were lazy) usually did almost double the damage of the bad ones.
---
Our feral, who tried so hard, could not even come close to competing with the bad rogues.
---
a 60 - 40 split isn't that bad. Besides, if you level with friends then you'll win PvP fights no matter the balance.
---
if you are unsure dont play it?
---
servers are full anyway you wont enjoy queues
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too RPPVP to understand?
---
Lots of better classes for that. If you want a melee class, warriors can close the gap and hit really hard even without praying for windfury. Even ret paladins are better for pvp because they can't be kited.
---
What? All I’ve seen is servers being opened, haven’t heard of any closing. Can you send me a link to this?
---
I will pack extra linen to wipe the paladin scum off my hoof.
---
people used ventrillo / teamspeak and forums. Basically the same thing, just condensed into one app.
---
you're comparing an in-game addon to a 3rd party chat service lol
---
It's a tool that caters to crappy guildleaders who can't make decisions on their own. Plus, it's not really something that was done in vanilla WoW.
---
This is people not understanding the problem with LFG/LFD/LFR and the differences between them.
---
Automated group formation is an issue becuase when the game automatically creates a group, puts you in a group, and teleports you to the dungeon the design of the game wants that group to succeed. That skews the development of the dungeons to ensure the difficulty curve is such that that automated group will succeed.
---
This is akin to the LFD/LFR tools on live, which are terrible for the game.
---
The LFG tools on live are a iteration of the system that is really good for the game for a number of reasons. 
---
It does not automate group formation, yes there is auto-accept. But, that is not automatically putting forming a group of X tanks X healers X DPS from a pool. In addition it's an option that should not always be used.
---
It is more of a bulletin board system where the user can either post a group looking for more or the user can browse the posts and see groups looking for more. Then they can ask to join that group. This is very important because it gives player to player interaction, the same as spamming "LF Tank Deadmines" or "LF2 DPS RFC" in trade chat, but with a better user experience not just for those involved but for those in those chat channels as well.
---
It does not influence the design of the dungeon (or other activity) in a negative or positive way because there is not the same expectation of success as with a automated system. If a group fails that Players put together, it is the players faults. If a group fails that the automated system put together, it is easier to blame the system than the players. Meaning you don't want automated systems to fail.
---
It does not teleport you to the dungeon. This builds player buy-in for the success of the dungeon and roots an emotional connection to the group. When you need to expend effort on a thing you tend to care more about a thing within a limit of diminishing returns. It's why the original meeting stones where a good thing, but teleporting directly to and from dungeons is a bad thing. This is the same reason it is a good thing you need to use the meeting stones and get to the dungeon physically for M+ in live.
---
In short, the automated systems LFD/LFR are really bad systems for the game as a whole, be it classic, retail, or really any other MMO with the same basic dungeon/raid design as wow. However the actual LFG Bulletin Board style system is really good and healthy for the game as a whole. They might do similar things, but how they do them and how they do them differently is extremely important. Both Elmer's Glue and Rubber Cement are adhesives, they stick things together. But you use them for different things for different reasons.
---
No. It’s a bad idea.
---
What makes you think the new servers will be dead? Sure theres a chance but theres no way for you to know.
---
102 hours is forever still
---
[GROB MOB video is also pretty good, check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqKsWgkdhvI)
---
how is 2500/10 000 a small sample size? hell, even 2500/20 000 is a pretty big sample size. They can predict elections with a 5% sample size.
---
Dude no one plays retail wow, the game isn’t fun for kids, it’s not fun for anyone
---
Can confirm this book is amazing.  John Staat's did a great job and it will help fill the void until Classic comes on Monday.
---
thank the heavens. while i understood the benefits for the addon, i hated it
---
You are making me roll Warlock instead of warrior mate :(
---
My other mount IS YOUR KING!
---
I think this is the longest reddit post I've ever read.
---
Understood, appreciate the help!
---
I meant as in PVP locks aren't gonna do as hawt till the later phases as you mentioned. 
---
Locks for PvE are valuable though especially for raiding. 
---
I am still stuck between doing a warrior vs lock. Lock is insanely fun but I have never done warrior late game so I do wanna cross that off the list.
---
Hi, /u/JanoshDeth

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu5bhr/im_gonna_roll_priest/).

i like it

Mage t3 looks like winter clothing
---
a lot of downtime ? No, you're always pressing a key
---
1-2 spell spams ? YES (that's every class really. Some are 1 button rotation)
---
rage starving ? yes if you're beginner and with poor gear. Gets much better later on.
---
Wow bud reeeee harder lol comin in with that major toxic overreaction
---
I want to main a warrior so badly, but leveling one first on a brand new pvp server, not to mention the re-release of classic just seems like a very bad idea. So rogue it is. Then warrior quickly after.
---
So girlfriends/wives always want all their man’s free time? I beg to differ. I don’t mind the amount of time my guy devotes to WoW, and he plays for hours every night. You know why? Because I respect his interests and him. Because he doesn’t completely shut me out when he plays, and lets me know when he’s busy at the moment, so, communication. And because I have my own interests and hobbies. We’re our own people. We have lives outside of each other. Like a healthy couple should. Any partner who demands all your free time needs to get a life and is possibly controlling or even abusive. Love shouldn’t mean losing yourself in another person.
---
Raids that are solely meme specs, sure, you're gonna have a hard time. But there are 8 classes and 40 spots, you could mix and match. And the idea that someone is gonna "carry" me as a Paladin makes me sick. You gotta know what you're getting into and be prepared to play your class in all sorts of different ways. I've been thinking of going some combo of holy/Ret, getting plenty of consumes, and generally being useful to my guild as a player. Raids can be a decent consistency of all classes, we can come to some sort of middle ground. Sure, i can't out DPS a Warrior, but who can?
---
It’s ok, you can be a NE mage in retail now
---
Yeah, my first exposure to those comics was the Thought Slime video I linked, and all I could think was *yikes*.
---
But it doesn't. You're just wrong. It straight up says, on the page for the addon, that "Groups created using ClassicLFG are visible to all players using it on the Realm." On the page, it has a tab for browsing groups created using this addon.
---
Heavily leaning towards warlock. I found myself just doing duel after duel on that class because I liked the play style so much. I tried to play mage for an extended period, but it just didn’t stick. I tried shadow for the first time last night, and it’s okay. But will still probably go lock.
---
I feel like I now have the information needed to make a good decision—rather than just shooting blind.
---
To translate into noobspeak.
---
Don't deal too much damage when fighting with a group, mages are very squishy so it's important that all the enemies are detracted attack a member of your team which has lots of health, the tank. Dealing too much damage can cause enemy's to attack you instead, this is called pulling agro.
---
You have the ability to turn enemies into sheep, but they return to normal if anyone attacks them. This is useful to reduce the number of enemies you have to fight at once, hence it helps the group a lot if you sheep when needed.
---
Hehe yeah, I just haven't played WoW is soooooooooooo long. Might just steal the gf's monitor, she doesn't use it much atm &gt;_&gt;
---
They're generic goblin traits. And they have New Jersey accents. So... yeah.
---
You’re in the minority. It’s not happening
---
I remember it being called VC in early 2005. Don’t know when DM came out but that’s just what I remember.
---
US server
---
So was getting 15 fps in cities. Hope you downgraded your PC for vanilla experience.
---
Melee hunter...
---
This strages guy needs a fucking life
---
So you don’t actually know
---
You know my pain brother....
---
Yes they can they use every weapon
---
lol, I did free up some cool names on Herod a few days ago.  At least for people who like MtG.
---
Oh yes and then the twinks come in. So much fun
---
Play what will be most fun as cliche as that sounds. If that means supporting your friends then great, but who knows if they will quit or you meet new ones that potentially play tank/heals. Since you're going to focus mainly on PvP I'd say go with Hunter, get a sweet pet and you have a built-in tank for most content outside of higher dungeons and raids and you'll still be very viable for BGs and WPvP.
---
That's why nursing homes are full.
---
&gt;I don't care about the autoinvite part.
---
To expand on this, I don't see *how* people expect these LFG addons to be removed. They really only combine basic chat API with InviteUnit(). The chat interface is just about guaranteed to stay, and users don't care that much about the autoinvite - the alternative is that one has to copypaste the invite command to the chatbox, no biggie.
---
I've tried this many times. You get to a part where you finish the quests but Hillsbrad is far too high level so you end up going to Barrens or Stonetalon. At this point, I suggest Camp Trejo. There's a quest that requires 60 Quilboar tusks which is a good grind.
---
Its also why no one invites DPS warriors to their group lol, they also use everything.
---
It's a start
---
Endgame you’re a healer primarily. I personally love deep resto druid healing in Raids, 5-mans and BGs.
---
It brings some utility to raids and BGs especially in the form of Battle Resurrection, Natures Swiftness for an insta-heal and shape-shifting for some situations.
---
Imagine a faction finally focusing down that warrior in a BG and you pop him back up and top of his health before they can even re-target.
---
People really don't care. I offer my friends to be the driver  but they rather drive drunk than wait for the whole group to finish up togheter and be driven around. 
---
They always talk about hoping to not get pulled over. And I answer with 'ye would be a shame that they pull you over when that kid is still stuck between your wheels.
---
But then i'm the buzzkill.
---
Holy shit that was worth watching just for the Alizée flashbacks at the end. I 2002'd hard.
---
In both cases they are healers people want in their groups. People don't necessarily want a lot of them, but then again there aren't a lot of druids and afaik demand for healer druids is usually higher than supply. The only downside is that you don't have a normal ress, but of course someone else in the dungeon group may have that.
---
I consider myself an amateur writer and I run into naming problems all the time. My solution, while it may be somewhat lazy, is to use online name generators and edit a good name I find to make it better. Sometimes it gives me a good name on its own and I don't need to edit it. Virtually every character I've ever made has gotten their name from a generator, and that's including outside of WoW. The only exception has been this original setting I've been working on in my free time.
---
If you can't think up a good name on your own, then get a base name or a good one off of a name generator and do with it what you please is what I have to say.
---
Here's a few examples of some of my character names.
---
Niveth Othrril: ESO Dunmer
---
Doralis: Retail WoW Belf
---
Aldrick: Classic WoW Undead
---
Hareek-Tah: ESO Story Argonian
---
Krirg: Retail WoW Orc
---
interestingly i have a similar path genre-wise though the games are different
---
usually goes WoW--&gt;Dota--&gt;Diablo2(Both modded and unmodded)--&gt;WoW
---
&gt; The problems with this addon and LFG is that it creates a hostile disposable human being atmosphere where you only care about winning and just kick people until you get the perfect player because it’s too easy and quick to replace people. People become objects, and not human beings.
---
Yeah, when you replace someone in Vanilla, they can instantly teleport to the instance... no, wait. Uh, well, I guess you can run out to the meeting stone to summon them qui....wait, no, not that either.
---
This addon does barely anything to change how easy it is (or not, to be more accurate) to actually get a new player into the instance with you, compared to vanilla.
---
Pretty cool, where did you get it?
---
A certain Pserver didn't  get so popular that blizz had it terminated without reason.
---
Those 100k signatures wouldn't have happened unless people were having fun on the Pservers.
---
I think WoW really is that good.
---
I love this 💘
---
Won't be close to that high.
---
Absolutely, all healers are welcome in raids.
---
Druid your primary role is going to be raid healing (instead of tank healing) due to lack of healing throughput on a single target. While super mana efficient you are also tasked with a ton of other utility type jobs (emergency CC in BWL trash pulls, as hibernate works, cleansing a ton, poisons and curses, battle rezzing).
---
As for dungeons, yes, no out of combat rez makes things a bit more challenging at times, but also makes people play less stupid, as they know a long walk back might await them if they go too nuts.
---
But yes druids are healers, and they are fun to play, and perfectly welcome in any group.
---
I'd say that the real problems with retail LFG are that you're playing with people you'll never see again because they're on other severs, and that it shrinks and sanitises the world because of the auto-teleport.  Running a dungeon becomes a very rushed and impersonal activity.
---
I can't help wondering if people would have become so opposed to the LFG tool if all it did was automate the group composition like this add-on does.  You still have to get to the dungeon manually, and you're playing with people from your own server so reputation and communication still matter.
---
I won't be using the add-on if I can help it, but I also don't think it's going to end up being quite the problem that a lot of people seem to think it will.  The worst aspects of retail LFG simply can't exist in Classic.
---
can devs go on any server at anytime how does it work where will he play
---
This guy is the ninja asking the real questions..
---
Here's the link [to the proofs](https://youtu.be/xMAsB1Mn0Ks)
---
&gt;And why were you not talking? Maybe because you didn't want to or others didnt want to? You want to force people to talk to each other for no reason?
---
Because modern WoW is basically diablo and all people do is zoom through content, even if it isn't timed, and bitch if people are doing something wrong? Why ask if you have no frame of reference and haven't played modern? Nothing was "rushed" when they introduced LFD, people absolutely stopped socializing *because* of the system, dunno how u think otherwise
---
not even planning on getting ahead, layering and the increased dungeon exp(in contrast to private servers) wil make beeing part of the pack enjoyable.
---
lmao yeah watching all these boomers get triggered over this is fucking hilarious
---
I feel like you have no idea what you are even suggesting at this point. We literally talk about making a whole new game 1 response ago and you somehow got lost?  
---
You talk about brand new classic with entirely new raids.... and you can’t fathom why we are talking about making a brand new game at that point.....  
---
You are all heart and hope in your entire discussion without a single thought as to how to actually accomplish what you are longing for. 
---
The vanilla and classic overall balance and design cannot support anything other that what it was designed and redesigned for every patch until the end. 
---
So surely some goof wouldn’t suggest making new raids and content that give renamed and realigned items of exactly what we already have......
---
I don’t feel like you are arguing anything, you are just emptying your heart without thought. Which is why I’m replying with all the snags and issues logistically with what you are proposing. 
---
I have read and reread everything you posted and I do not see anything other than unicorns and rainbows, which amount to nothing that wasnt brainstormed and rejected by blizzard when they finally admitted failure and agreed to release classic.
---
My husband and I play wow so won’t be an issue for us. Lol
---
Hmmm good point. And would definitely be a breeze as my solo leveling option.
---
when a weaboo forknife player only knows a few dances.
---
i usto have 30 spell power on a heirloom , and you usto get the full 30 at level 1 which was great
---
tbh a white or staff of jordan with spell power enchanted on it is just as good as a heirloom weapon
---
with gold you can really improve the leveling experience of an alt
---
but yeah im glad no heirlooms
---
For cats to compete with Rogues they need to farm a constant stream of Manual Crowd Pummelers and powershift. And even then, they're just competing with Rogues, not topping them. I have no idea why anyone would willingly sign up for this.
---
Feral Druids' role in Vanilla raiding is off-tanking and doing spot DPS and spot healing.
---
Shhh we like it low pop
---
Nothing to see here....
---
I'm jealous because she went to mulgore before me &lt;3
---
What about you explain it then instead of acting cool and pointing fingers!?
---
Can’t wait
---
Are there any guilds out there that needs a EU priest?
---
you don't understand, "lfm" and "inv" are the cornerstones of the vanilla community
---
packed in each of those six letters is so much meaning that a retail scrub like you couldn't possibly understand
---
when a *real* vanilla veteran presses L, he doesn't just mean "looking" - his memories of his very first deadmines run course through his finger and hit that L key, imbuing that keystroke with an incredible amount of meaning. the fear, the bravery, the victory of that dungeon run becomes part of that letter L
---
and when he types "inv", he's not just asking for an invite - he's saying "judge me and if you find me wanting, then you will be making a grave mistake, for i am Dalichkingx and i am known throughout the land as a powerful warrior. if you deny me my rightful place among your adventuring party then i shall let my guild of fellow legends know that you are blind and honorless fools who desecrate the realm by your very existence"
---
if you rob people of the experience of being forced to exchange those meaningful words, those incredible talismans of self-expression, then you make it so that Classic is NOTHING like vanilla.
---
me and the other 3000 people on my lfg discord agree that it would kill classic
---
All major cities have all professions, the first major hub for each race may or may not have the profession trainer you are after, fortunately the capital cities are generally pretty quick to get to. (5-10 minute run, make sure you set your hearthstone before making the run so you can quickly get back!)
---
That's rich, coming from a farm animal.
---
It was, i played vanilla. At the high end you just inspected someone and looked directly at their gear. This same argument has been made, and proven wrong, since the original gearscore in wrath.
---
You can't blame the tool for people using the tool wrong. Thats like saying we should ban cars because people have accidents with them, and some crazy fuckers hit people with them.
---
It is a tool. Somepeople will misuse the tool. You are better off not playing with those people anyways.
---
Fairbanks F and S are a little overstylized.
---
The rest look awesome though!
---
No BGs until phase 3
---
PvP is the only point of gearing up.
---
If you aren't crushing people who spend way less time on the game than you, then whats the point of raiding?
---
Hahaha thank you! I'm so glad you're enjoying it!
---
All the bad players from real Vanilla Alliance (they were the vast majority back then) are rererolling Horde thinking they are going to have a better experience this time. The same thing happened in TBC, but mainly due to bloodelves. Horde sucked over night and was no longer better. Same thing will happen here and we will also have much longer queues.
---
Thanks Alliance. They are pretty much forcing our hands to play dumb races we don't even like. Then when we steamroll them they will switch back to Alliance claiming Paladins are OP and Horde will be decent in pugs again lol.
---
That’s not even true lmao. If you know your rotations you can definitely keep up. Esfand gets top dps as a Ret Paladin, and you offer a lot more than just damage to a raid as well. Is it optimal? No. Can it work? Yes.
---
The REEEEE is coming from people demanding a fucking addon be banned from the game.
---
An addon that literally cant do anything except interact with those using it and cant do anything that the game itself already limits.
---
Big dumbass on display here, thanks for the example.
---
Hi, iam in the same boat as you. I also was a Vet once but Live did drift me away from our Homeland, i also speak the same languages as you :) I didnt decide so far on which server i will be playing, my cousin and me havent so, i would welcome you gladly to our journey.
---
Derre :)
---
He's after the first of the three drakes after Broodlord Lashlayer.
---
Rule 5
---
trying to find a guild on a server that's heavily sided to the opposite faction fucking sucks. It won't be as bad on huge servers like classic has, it'd still be a problem if the faction imbalance is worse than ~60/40
---
Just wait for the sleep phase before engaging.
---
Not just the threat generation, also the tanking skills were worse in classic. In retail (since forever) thunderclap hits all enemies, but in vanilla (and TBC) it would only hit 4 enemies. If you had 5 or more enemies to tank you would have to tab through them and apply sunder armor onto each mob individually to try and keep aggro. In retail you press thunderclap and then the mobs just stick to you no  matter what.
---
Except it is not against any ToS..  
---
These addons existed back in vanilla aswell, it's just that information spreads much faster today than it did back in 2004-2005.
---
I remember getting my first copy and not being able to play for a day or two and studying the box for hours. Lol
---
Remindme 5 days!
---
There may be a class quest around level 10 depending on your class. But I think level 20+ quests can be found in major cities.
---
Every PvP server favors horde from anywhere to 1% to 8% based on player made census. This can all change on the 26th since there are loads of people who don't read any wow forums and aren't subbing until day 1.
---
It doesnt matter that its not cross realm. Blizzard knows cross realm API is disabled in Classic and they never expected any addons to be able to cross realm invite. Yet they still made it clear they will be policing addons against the spirit of classic.
---
It doesnt have to port you to the dungeon.. Theres no addon API for porting...
---
It doesnt have to cross realm group you.. There is no addon API for cross realm groups...
---
It doesn't have to give you blue items, or a bag of goodies or a buff durin the run like Retail.. Blizzard **already knows these things cannot be done by addons** yet they still made it clear they will police these addons.
---
Meaning you can still create something that is against the spirit of classic without it being a 100% match to retails LFG....
---
I do know what I’m talking about; you could do clear kube pod deployments or a traditional deployment strategy and an F5 load balancer.
---
Here’s my pout right, is if they are scaling up, why is there a login queue to wait to play? that is the point of scaling up, correct? And that is really where my intrigue comes from.
---
Bindings for TF anyone? No?
---
No. You whisper someone, they invite you, you click either accept or decline.
---
With this addon, you click a button and get added automatically.
---
Just made the decision to switch when I saw the realm update from yesterday. The queue for whitemane is going to be so long people might not be able to even get in the many hour long queue in the first place much less the server. Figured now was the chance to switch before all the names get taken. 
---
 https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update-august-21/262141
---
That's actually not a pretty good idea but I don't think there are any Target dummies in classic :/
---
IIRC they changed it later to be a small percentage instead of a single person, so you could potentially have like 2-3 rank 14s per week if I'm not mistaken?
---
Then don't use them.
---
Its so surreal but so wonderful
---
Hey man. I’m not arguing about the addon, but just because you’re on the internet doesn’t mean you need to be an absolute asshole. You’re point would be better made without the toxic bullshit you threw in there because you lack the ability to control your emotions.
---
You really could benefit from fishing and cooking as well. Supplying yourself with cheap food while leveling is great, and once you hit 60 you can get some great stat boosts from well fed buffs.
---
Something easier like a Cruel Barb
---
It’s gonna be funny seeing all the “I’m a hunter why does nobody group with me “ threads in a month

Pretty awesome. American here. I earned a whole ten days of vacation last year.
---
It’s the fantasy of the warrior that appeals to people
---
There is something for everyone in the game. Can you be top teir geared without raiding? NO. But this game is more than just raids. There is a world (of warcraft) filled with hidden lore and amazing scenery that sometimes takes a bit of work to find. My favorite spot i found in vanilla was the waterfall in STV. The dungeons are fun, and challenging. In retail if you wipe in a dungeon its bad. In vanilla it was common place. The community alone could keep you entertained for hours if not months. 
---
My wife doesnt raid and still loves vanilla. She spent most of her time playing, by helping other players and running dungeons for lowbies etc.
---
Ayyeee! I played as a night elf as well on Rivendare and joined during TBC. What guild were you in?
---
Doubt, climate change killed all the future people.
---
BiS is bis.
---
Anyone here from Pyre or another classic Arthas guild? This is Desdel.
---
Play a troll female, that way theres only one face that doesn't hideous.
---
Are you not worried that these servers are like 10x the size of what we remember from vanilla? Have you been on an overcrowded modern server? I have some serious doubt the community will be what we remember
---
It's not as bad as some people seem to remember if pulls and things are done right. I did mostly instance to level from 58-60 as warrior tank like Scholo, Strath, BRD ect
---
Cared enough to post.... No one cares about your opinion kid
---
When someone doesn’t know anything about you, when you are just a nameless face, that number means a lot.
---
We’ll have an issue similar to this in Classic too, just a bit different. With 40man content giving only a few drops to be split among 40 people, the odds of you not getting loot is pretty darn high. If you’ve been pugging MC each week, but have no loot to show that you’ve cleared the content, people will have no way to judge your experience. So if you and another player of your class/role/whatever applies to the pug, they’ll pick the one that better geared. Does it mean you are incapable? Not at all, you could actually be more experienced and a far better player. But they don’t know they, so they go with the player that offers the highest chance of success based off very limited information.
---
At least with a r.io number, you are denied quickly. You don’t have to meet someone and get inspected first,!wasting much more of your time.
---
Poison pickpocket quests may send you back. But Not Sure if they can done in OG as well because it's can become rouges too.
---
Come Firemaw my friend, as long as you communicate in English :)
---
I never gank lowbies or kill more than once. I’m just tired of people complaining about for 14 fucking years. You should expect to be corpse camped on a PvP server cause it has and always will happen.
---
I'd pally tank if you know, it was viable in anything but dungeons and even then meh.
---
That was only needed for xrealm functionality and isn't relevant in classic, as it can just send whispers.
---
And thats perfectly fine. The community holds blizzard to what Blizzard can control. They cant control Discord, and they cant control Vent. So do your group finding there and no one will care.
---
But addons will have to go. They said they would, and we will hold them to that.
---
I’m excited for the grinding in WoW. If anyone here has done the OSRS grinding you are more than just ready. The loot table for runescape is fucking insane on certain pets/items.
---
They’re the best tanks.
---
Enhance shaman is a viable 2H class, especially in pvp
---
Same! She got me hooked but I was better. Carried her in Kara. Left for a better group for SSC and TK. Ignored her for wow trying to get my legendary bow just so I could abandon my quiver. I was a jerk. T_T
---
It's not a secret history there was actually a great long form post about it here a while ago. Idk why history is in quotes but ya it was called VC because people were grouping you kill an elite for a quest the elite was called VanCleef and it turns out he happens to be in a dungeon called Deadmines. The name stuck because that's how things usually work. Even if it doesn't make the most sense I'm not really in favor of ignoring history.
---
Both those groups speak english as well as brits. No reason to avoid them if you want an english server.
---
Exactly... this logic is so hilariously broken its ridiculous.
---
Look at /u/TheDarkLordChuckles at the top of of the Meta meters!
---
You sound like the problem
---
The same virus?
---
E
---
That showing an add on causes mass hysteria in people who never played vanilla to begin with.
---
The auto invite stuff needs to go imo, rest is fine to me
---
 My guess will be the first 60 will be in just over 3 days played. 3,5 days at the very most. 
---
Will probably be pretty close in real time number as well. Some crazy dude staying up without going to bed or two players rotating.
---
Doing a bit of investigative work, I found a host of roguecraft episode 3 that was uploaded on 2005-08-31. Looking up the launch dates of patches that would put it at roughly 1.6
---
Classic wow
---
100% agreed. 
---
Anyone looking up leveling without at least trying to figure it out on your own should really just stick to easy, new, WoW.
---
so sad, it's out of date :(  
---
... will definitely watch this one though!
---
You guys seem to be extremely bored. Why don’t you go play some video games?
---
https://i.imgur.com/achw7tU.png
---
They'll be the most popular at launch but wont be at 60. I know that doesn't answer your question haha just something people dont consider.
---
I feel like a proud father watching this. **#MANECREW**
---
10/10
---
There are a bunch. What zone?
---
bro do u even lua
---
People just like the image of a big strong class. That gets in people faces. Warriors/Barbarians are always super popular no matter what the game.
---
Cry more, you are welcome to skip the game. Hell with that attitude, we hope you do.
---
/who is all you need....
---
Because classic is vanilla.... and people have been playing, breaking and perfecting vanilla for 15 years at this point..... 
---
The data and practicality of flaws in design show that warrior is broken strong throughout the entire game in 2 out of 3 required aspects of the trinity. 
---
Pretty common sense why they were underplayed originally and overplayed now.
---
Just any old elites?  They are all over the place.  Go look at zones in WoWHead if you want, but they are all over the place.
---
I was primarily referring to Venruki and co.
---
You know, actual accomplished players, rofl.
---
Whitemane REPRESENT
---
Jumping squares in IF
---
They have good damage while leveling but it's really bad at 60. They are kited super easily, so while they can get lucky in pvp I wouldn't say they are above average.
---
Is it though? Lmao
---
It's going to be interesting to see if people go there or not. It is kind of out of the way for Horde and you have to not get killed Deadwind Pass. I rarely ever saw anyone there back in 04/05.
---
the only mmo in existance without cosmetics, ingame shop
---
Nice bouncy boobies too
---
exactly  
---
I know that lots of classicfriends are delusional but this is just laughable  
---
what "socializing" does it cut? None  
---
all it does cut is you having to spam advertisement in chat, having to WHO people who just whisper "invite" and doesn't make you stare at chat for an hour
---
Best tank, best end game dps, one of the best in pvp once they are geared.  The best class tends to be the most popular.
---
And right below it says they're posted in chat.
---
You wanna run RFK, would you despise a Bear Druid because you suspect he has balance talents? I think his point is empty.
---
Now if only you can view results on your phone
---
My idea is try saying something with your mouth open and tongue loose and try to figure out what that sounds like. Remember not to form any shapes with your lips/mouth. 
---
Iahnaw
---
I said I don’t know and it sounded like that. RP your own character to name your own character!
---
Ah see you said you shouldn't be able to join a group by clicking a button. Clicking the accept button does exactly that.
---
Well if you're playing Alliance you could get on team from IF to SW and go back and forth? I'm running out of options lol
---
Mine is more like 7,but it's the biggest size with a few extra flavor shots, espresso shots etc. I rarely buy them. It's more of a treat me situation.
---
I would let her know that if she thinks "game night" is just one night... it'll most likely be "game season" and cover up his windows so he doesn't get distracted by sunlight and all that pointless shit.
---
How do you know that would be the case though? It might as well be the other. The people who opt-out will be ignored, forcing them to enable it anyway.
---
This is what I thought. How does it relate to the pic OP posted, are these players who've been killed multiple times?
---
Yea, it autoinvites, but not without any interaction.

I used to troll my guild on my mage during Wotlk. Mages invisibility works different from rogues so I can literally walk up and stand right on the boss. Some people in the raid freaked out lol
---
How about you blaumeux. The name seems stupid at first but everyone is just going to meme and call it "blow me" which is a win in my book.
---
Do you wash your feet often
---
Nah, launch day is going to be a shitshow. If people can't log in they'll be here or on other forums raging about how fail Blizzard is. They'll definitely not be playing Counter Strike.
---
So... why was this thread deleted?
---
Wouldn't people just alt tab and look at a map online?
---
They’re all terrible actually
---
FA is good in all scenarios. Seriously, from niche usage in raids, leveling and pvp, you can’t skip it.
---
That being said, the first few levels, if you’re concerned about speed, you can always level it after with the linen you stockpile.
---
Also, if you lvl a caster at launch, you might wanna keep your linen to make a Lesser Magic Wand (need 54, check a guide)
---
Cheers and happy Classic!
---
That isn't even how it works.  It parses the normal chat channels and displays the people that fit what you are looking for.  Everyone using the normal channels will both see LFG spams from this addon, and be invited to groups of people using this addon.  
---
It literally changes nothing for people not using the addon.

---
Can't comment. Don't watch much Asmongold, his streamer personality makes me cringe.
---
Venruki, Snutz, Cdew, Hafu, are all names I know from the pro arena circuit, Blizzcons and the like.
---
Play a FREAKING Druid.
---
To elaborate: 
---
1) Flag carrying - yes druids are KING. They are slippery and fast as hell.
---
2) Base defending - stealth, heals, bearform.... KING!
---
3) OWPvP - the only one who can top a druid is a rogue. And even then, given the flexibility of a druid in OWPVP, you give people NIGHTMARES.
---
Druids are fine in PvE healing as well, not the top in terms of throughput, so they are not tank healers. They are raid healers, with much more flexibility and mobility over other healers. As well the utility of dispelling poisons AND curses, along with b-rez (cannot be replaced), and innervate (priests would bend over backwards for this to be cast on them) druids are great.
---
Raid teams typically have 1-3 heal spots reserved for druids, my guild specifically has 2, and it was hard to fill the second to be honest. &lt;6% of the total population play druid, and less make it to the end.
---
It's a tough class to learn don't get me wrong, but the skill ceiling means the ones who truly want to play the class, have so much more room to grow.
---
In the end of the day, **YOU** are the one playing the character, nobody else is. **YOU** play what feels fun.
---
Pop into a private server (I have 2 I can recommend, instant 60) and see how it feels, or load up an emulation server and play around for a bit.
---
I will close by saying this, nothing is more satisfying than watching your opponent in OWPvP literally GIVE UP and stand there accepting their death, after trying to fight you for 10+ minutes.... and fail to kill you.
---
Yeah that’s why I’m thinking human.
---
Any comments regarding the ability to be viable in PvP with swords or dagger with a pve spec ?
---
you mean poop sock?
---
This quest is a trap, as the time spent doing it is not worth the reward, even factoring in the exp and item drops from the zhevras.
---
Shadow priest beats mage because silence and mana burn
---
This is too real
---
They had their hooves cut off preemptively for poachers like us.
---
LFR heroes in here talking about the meeting stone/inn keeper from Vanilla which nobody used. This addon is a matchmaking addon with auto-invite feature and chat spam. It essentially creates a network for people using this addon which is the very thing Ion spoke against in that speech. The addon also has a talent inspect option which will be used to exclude people running their own specs from doing dungeons. 
---
I don't trust this addon Dev. He says on curse that there is no automatic matchmaking, but the addon itself has an auto-invite feature. It automatically forms your group for you. He also fails to mention the talent inspect option built into this addon. Pretty clear the author intended this addon to be more than just a LFG bulletin board.
---
It's going to be the raider.io for Classic.

I’d rather destroy my liver than pass a kidney stone
---
Moving it too a website would be a win though.
---
I mean,  you could use a website now,  but people want this add-on instead. Why? More convenient.
---
No crossrealm and no teleporting to the dungeons.
---
All it does is removes you spamming a macro "LFM".
---
There is no social interaction lost.

---
The only reason people will use this tool is to abuse it because they are too lazy to inspect someone's gear, or too bad at the game to judge someone's ability. I've played vanilla, too. Likely WAY more than you. I played it 8-12 hours a day, raiding and ranking to grand marshal.
---
There is no scenario in which this tool will not be abused. That's like saying "there's nothing wrong with LFG tool, only those who abuse it!". No, the whole idea of it is already abusing the nature of vanilla WoW. ESPECIALLY vanilla WoW, where some lvl 40-ish GREEN quest items are still BiS at 60.
---
I forget, can you use high level bandages even if you don’t have that profession?
---
I appreciate the insight. I didn’t want to drag OP too long so i didn’t give the whole back story. I have been talking about it for months, we went to Florida, we had a great summer. But definitely see what you’re saying.
---
its like that for alliance too in my experience (this is on oceanic servers though)
---
thats not a horrible idea....
---
Wtb link
---
If your warlock friend won't group with you because he doesn't want to compete for gear, he's not a very good friend. Spriest's melt faces in PvP and wPvP, but they are limited in PvE due to mana and threat issues. Play what you want, man!
---
Edit: You can heal all 5 man content as Shadow, and 10 man content with decent gear.
---
The thing is. I wouldn't mind switching between spriest and healing priest if I could have a badass spriest for pvp and heal in pve, that's the perfect set up for me imo. But I hear the respec cost is too much for that to be realistic
---
You are hilarious. People are going to get new weapons with no skill and have no idea what's going on. Dungeon speed will be an abrupt learning curve that a tank should learn fast or they will be a "is the healer afk?" player.
---
[EXTRA THICC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEgwxGWgiIg)
---
I really like dwarves but it feels like they're only best at tanking and fear ward, I still can't decide what class to play at all but I just want something to hit me with new surprising outcomes when it comes to pve and pvp, playing on a pvp server and I don't want to be ganked, alliance only for the boys but any class with unpredictable outcomes to never get bored is all I ask of
---
None of those awful names
---
None of them are names
---
It's a great leveling dungeon. The two dragons that are hard af but drop nothing? Love. It.
---
Wow you're right. But vQueue wasn't.
---
Other warriors, which is why they ideally consist of 25% of the raid compared to 0 ret paladins. If you think you are not going to be carried playing anything other than holy, you are either playing with (relatively, compared to you) bad players or other meme specs.
---
God damn do I miss windows xp.
---
it's a joke
---
It just wont happen, no matter how many Yay or Nay...its 4 days until launch. Im kinda scared of the queue but i prefer how it is than implementing some stuff that makes it even more complicated
---
You are a super slow right clicker my dude!  I would say it saves one maybe two seconds.
---
Ty for informing us you're a casual. So is 95% of the playerbase
---
I maintain a data center for a living. I have no inside knowledge of how WoW's server farms worked back then or now, but I know how enterprise data centers work. The storage on this blade would most likely been a slow RAID 1, for booting the OS only. The shared WoW database it accessed would have been on a Storage Area Network (SAN).
---
Also, the server came from Blizzard without the hard drives.
---
Why no felt hat? Why no quest neck? Archivist cape is a 1.3% drop chance iirc. Drakestone is a 1.7% per run I think. I imagine the flameweave cuffs are around that.
---
This seems to be the overall consensus in this thread, and to be honest it's kind of refreshing. It seems like a solid community so far. As a bit of a purist myself as it relates to content (trailers, gameplay, etc) i tend to turn a blind eye so i can experience it for myself, so i think i'll do that until i need to research builds/items/etc.
---
There will be addons that show the maps i would think at this point most of us know the way.
---
That's not what it sounds like from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exibv36/?context=3)
---
Played many mmorpgs the only game I remember where warriors sucked were conquer online and runes of magic.  My warrior in guild wars 2 was op as fuck
---
During wrath I would 2 man it as a rogue with a resto druid buddy
---
That was me.  Six months into the game, my Warrior was barely 40, and couldn't afford a mount.  Ended up quitting in despair for a while.  Came back months later and had to roll a different main, just to not be instantly burned out again.
---
A website makes you go outside the game though. It's not as convenient.
---
Rushers will rush and you can’t change their minds. People taking their time will take their time. I don’t understand this desire to remind people not to play the game a certain way. Let them spend their 15 bucks a month and enjoy themselves.
---
The true classic will be the private servers after Classic. Those who grab the Blizz data and make an actual replica of Vanilla. This could have been the thing if Blizz put a little more effort in it.
---
 Note taken
---
Tackled this one in Zepplin style:  https://imgur.com/DkIUKtn
---
False if you're being serious, Stupidnoob if you're memeing, and Destiny if you want to remind people of a bad video game.
---
This is a very good and reasonable bit of discussion on the subject, in my opinion.
---
Therefore, it will be (almost) completely ignored in favor of the giant circlejerk that's happening here and on Twitter.
---
Or explore them to find their nooks and crannys
---
i remember making a pretty penny off a purp staff that dropped off the trolls in the hinterlands. several hundred to 1k gold (it was so goddamn long ago. i know it was a lot of money at the time)
---
Doesn't matter you won't get past the queue to use them anyways.
---
We see them as big strong, hard working, honorable, fight to the death type.  I think of Guts form Berserk
---
Looks like the Hall of Explorers is quite uninteresting. Interesting.
---
The drums of desu thunder once again.
---
Also removing the ability for addons to auto-invite, which is pretty important for making 40 man raids..
---
you just learn them pretty fast
---
if you plan to tank id watch a run of every dungeon 
---
some of them are rather confusing 
---
in fact most of them are a bit confusing first run
---
Played warlock to 60 as my first 60 back in vanilla, made it to rank 10 then hard switched to druid and spent the rest of vanilla playing druid. (I guess it was middle of AQ I made the switch), never going back to any other class.
---
The way the druid plays and feels in my hands after so many years, cannot replace it, nothing ever compares. (It could be just the class)
---
As for your situation, feel free to look into a mage, might be an interesting change of pace, but never know what's goin gto happen with your group of friends, many might not even make it to 60 as a warlock.
---
\*Blammo
---
Yeah I found the same thing when I was looking up Leatherworking. They use recipes that are now learned by trainers but used to be world drops. I'm working on my own now to turn it into a video

You take both and fishing all 3 are extremely beneficial.

Yeah I’m pretty patient with new players, but if I tell a hunter to turn off auto taunt on pet, or a dps keeps pulling etc. that’s what I’m referring too. 
---
I wouldn’t just kick a person for a mistake or two, just attitude and ability to not make the same mistake
---
I played Mage way too much so Shadow Priest would seem fun to me since I never played one.
---
They are face melters in PvP, especially in 1v1, but from a lot of footage I’ve watched, I found their lack of mana efficiency kind of annoying, like you have to drink after basically each fight and once you’re oom you’re fucked.
---
Mages are GREAT in PvE and very good in PvP. Versatile and survivable. You can always outplay your opponent, and they’re not that hard to play at a casual level, you’ll still be useful even if you haven’t mastered your class.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Cheers
---
Stop, you're turning me on
---
Idk where I’d find this information, but I’m on the east coast on the fairbank server which is pst. Do you think I’d have a hard time finding people to do dungeons and raids with on EST times?
---
\&gt;moving the goalposts
---
Not even sure how that would make a difference. I played vanilla, and it was on a PvP server. Not sure why it matters that I played on a private server instead of "2004".
---
I’m going to take it slow but I do want to get a good grindsworth headstart so I don’t fall so far behind, I know the no lifers will do there thing tho 🤷‍♂️
---
Until the instance/raid is finished.
---
But man does it suck to go through all the respawn of an instance, because you wiped shortly before the end boss
---
I was trying to use the orc clan at one point. Zurgo
---
I don't know about others, but I never did this back in vanilla and I'm not going to do it in classic either. After you have run dungeons a couple of times you will know where you need to go. Even the huge dungeons like BRD you would know in and out after a while. The map isn't really important or needed. I don't even use maps in the retail version either, not even when a new expansion launches and I'm a tank. It doesn't take long to find out where you have to go.
---
Honestly, looks like the server needs more alliance. Seems like every pvp server needs more alliance.
---
Nope. That's why addons like Atlas came to be. They were invaluable before Bizzard took everything from Atlas and turned it into the dungeon journal.
---
What if a warrior rolled need on nerubian slavemaker because it’s bis ranged damage for pulls with crit and ap as well.
---
Ehhh. I moved. ALL of the names I couldn’t get were available on these brand new servers. They’ll all fill up on Monday so I say it’s good to hop and get your names now
---
These type of addons existed back in Classic, and it did not ruin the game.  
---
They also exist on Pservers, and guess what; they did not ruin them either.

Skinning knife with +30sp and a Wedding Dress with +4stats are the original heirlooms

---
As a casual player you probably won't be able to afford respeccing 2-3 times a week. Listen, Classic/Vanilla WoW is a huge time sink and from the sound of it you haven't really done much homework about this game (which could be a good thing). You should probably read up on the game a bit more or simply not worry about such trivial things atm because you won't even be experiencing raids/pvp for several months (as a casual gamer).
---
No you can‘t, it requires i think 250 first aid
