Healer here. Couldn’t farm effectively either. Healer and tanks have an alternative farming options, such as fishing. There are always areas with good fish that aren’t too mob-ridden.

Trouble is with gold buying is that it destroys the economy, breaks the balance and affects the prices of commodities. And that many gold sellers don’t just use bots - they’re into phishing for user credentials and hacking accounts to steal gold. 
---
I got hacked once in 2007. Before that event I was more understanding towards gold buying players. Now it’s 0 tolerance.

Ahhh didnt think of how drastic things could be, thank you for pointing these things out!

Long time wow player since BC, been playing retail and vanilla servers since. Planning to main a holy paladin through classic for both PvE n PvP. Looking for a social guild who enjoys both raiding and PvP. Aswell a good social leveling experience. Please hmu EU open most week day evenings (incl sunday) for raiding and other such group content (dugeons and wPvP).

**Leet**

Leet (or "1337"), also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet. It often uses character replacements  in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many dialects or linguistic varieties in different online communities.

I only play on RP served and refuse to break that policy. I don’t actively RP too much, but I find that the number of immature players with stupid names like “lololdruid” is much lower on RP servers (even if Blizz won’t actively enforce the name policy rules). Also, I’m a huge lore fan and RP servers have more like-minded people. 
---
My greater concern about server choice is that I’d have none, and there won’t be RP/RPPVP servers at all for Classic. When they launched Australian servers, they chose not to add RP ones either. This could make or break classic for me. 
---
Not warlocks. Life Tap + Drain Life = Zero Downtime!
---
I agree. They aren't there to rack up KBs like a warrior with a pocket healer. They're meant to lay down flares, wyvern sting casters, put their pets on DPS casters for knockback, etc. As a healer, if I have a hunter next to me that knows how to scattershot, feign, and trap a rogue who opens on me, I feel comfortable doing my job and my team is probably going to win.
---
Be nice, these videos are for people who are...slow...They need to have someone else do thinking and reasoning for them to know how they should feel about another video.
---
&gt;their fans might camp World boss spawns and try to let them get it for attention
---
The streamer is such a bad player he can't even kill a world boss, and needs an army of fanbois to tag it for him?
---
The fanboi's would spend hours of their own time to camp a world boss for someone else to kill? Someone who is making IRL money off it with subscribed viewers etc?
---
I really don't get the streaming culture at all.
---
On the other hand, dps can make a lot of money farming. 
---
Yeah I thought this too, not really because of the streamers tho, but because of the state of the server after those that try it and didn't stick with it have gone.
---
I'll probably roll a few chars for a play around, but not actually roll a main properly till a while after launch, on my final server.
---
If you flasked in vanilla as a non caster dps/tank you were either really rich or really dumb. The consumable grind for someone like a healer wasn't that bad. Full pot speed runs became a thing on private servers, not classic retail. 
---
Pro tip: you didn't need a ton of resist pots for bosses like loatheb if you took it seriously and had a proper strat.  Too many guilds relied on brute forcing shit with world buffs/mega consumables.
---
One exception is a fight like kelthuzad.  Having extra hp on the whole raid was really nice. 
---
Dance studio

&gt; and that price should be nearby to whatever-manna-biscuits-cost (from the vendor).

That is a very good point.
---
I’ve been trying to get this to catch steam...
---
A for Alliance.  If you’re going Alliance, choose the alphabetically first server of your chosen type
---
Nah. Play a class like hunter or rogue, not too much consumable farming compared to a healer or caster.

I never had the chance to raid in Vanilla, so all of them!
---
If you accounted for guilds who stopped at 4horse that number would be way higher. I find the .1% quite misleading.
---
True. I've been convinced. I now realize that it is a system that forces the player to interact with community and that is what made it grow.
---
 Can't wait to have that community back. 
---
You're right, the 1:1 contact is definitely a thing. I remember when raids would go long I would start rationing health stone hand outs to the DPS I actually knew because I grouped with them and they helped me out with things like my dreadsteed quest
---
NE Druid. Then my gnome rogue became my main. 
---
You. I like you.

It wasn't common practice in vanilla to world buff before each raid. That's a private server thing. To be seen if that cancer comes to retail.

I’d be up for it if it took a reagent and had additional cost added to it.

Have you played hunter in classic? Without that macro, the core class mechanics are practically broken and unplayable in pvp

Changing it from a as many as is practical for this attempt on a progress run to everyone has a healthstone for every boss ever. Convenience has now changed how the game is played, not made it any more fun.

Stop trying to fix what isn't broken.

Nothing wrong with phasing, it's a story telling tool. Sharding on the other hand sucks

Made my first character when I was 11. It was a druid named magespark. Terrible choice of name as I would constantly get invited to groups and dropped when they saw that I was a druid.
---
No. Activision are completely merged. It would be like separating the chocolate and the milk after you've mixed them together. 
---
Everytime I see someone mention SWG, i get sad inside.
---
But I was the same, went from SWG to WoW and started as a human pally. And had no idea how to play it
---
Wowfurion, which was my main for Vanilla. Dwarf Hunter. I was enamoured by the name Furion from Warcraft 3 and it was taken when I typed it in. 11 year old me had little creativity and just added Wow (World of Warcraft, duh) to it. And before someone asks, I wanted to be a Nelf but my friend demanded I be a Dwarf to play with him...
---
If it is indeed how it played on vanilla, it is of course good news.
---
PvP-RP servers (hoping to god Activision Blizzard makes them) should surely be safe, right?
---
No way a streamer would play on an RP server.
---
Authenticity is preferred over changes every time. Even though it's a big blow to locks, I agree.
---
And to be fair it's not a big blow to locks because it never worked that way in the first place!
---
The almighty “kek” when Alliance scum would say lol, that’s what it translated into.
---
I used to know a bunch of code words to talk to the alliance but they removed them :(
---
Yes, they have the rares from BC + Northrend and level 85 Cata zones which I still find to be pretty rare, the rares added to lower level zones which are fairly common, and then the rares in WoD/Legion/BFA pretty much aren't rare at all and spawn all the time bc you're just supposed to kill them for a bit of Azerite
---
If you have a fresh 60 or weakly geared tank you will need to drop a significant heal early into the pull when most of the mobs are alive.
---

---
What you're getting into is subjective though like I already said. I don't doubt that your guild didn't use many consumables and there were probably a lot of other guilds that didn't either.
---
But I know for a fact that many of the top / world first guilds even back then min maxed consumables.
---
&gt; When you start demanding that people farm for hours and hours just to be able to do a singular raid night that's when people start leaving the guild. 
---
I mean that's a question of value which each person thinks differently about. Like I already said in my previous reply, you can get away with less consumables if you're in a very casual guild that doesn't mind progressing content slowly.
---
But when you're applying to a very specific guild, I would imagine that the question of how much effort you need to see to things of this nature would be pretty obvious before you even join the guild in the first place.
---
It's not like you recruit people and then start demanding all of these things. People who join decent guilds are typically people who have a likeminded view on the game and don't mind farming these consumables to make the raids faster.
---
Before you join a guild you probably know whether they want you to farm consumables or not, or whether it's a casual guild or not.
---
It would be pretty silly to join a guild and then leave because you didn't know that you had to farm consumables, you typically get familiar with a guild before you apply.
---
Rogues have a lot of abilities.  Really good rogues are a sight to behold.  But even mediocre rogues can be very effective in the right matchups.
---
Forget NAXX, naming a character is the hardest part of the game. 
---
Like a bacteria that has mutated to survive the antidote, so /r/wow is victim of Survivorship Bias.
---
Not only that, imagine following the logic of some of the people in here to its logical conclusion: in the absence of battlemasters, you should have to organize an entire 40 man raid to do AV... it’s completely insane.
---
I also would love if they continued on to TBC and WoTLK. But 1 year is not enough for even one of those alone yet all 3. Maybe 2 years for each installment?
---
My hope is that we are given substantial enough time to focus on just Vanilla in classic (2-3yrs) then TBC is released and has the same amount of time and then WoTLK is released. You would be allowed to copy your character over and continue on without destroying vanilla/TBC server you came from and undoubtedly communities would remain for each expansion phase. Many people like myself are not only excited at the prospect of replaying Vanilla, but also the rest what we think are the best parts of WoW (Vanilla--&gt; WotLK).
---
No.

I don't want to be on a server with any one of those twat streamers but I can ignore them and their twat followers.

"Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from."
---
Yea you've the same fears as me.
---
Outside of a "poopsock to 60 and end up with 8 hunters that are high level for MC" run, hunters aren't going to get the most spots. Even 5 hunters is above average for MC.
---
Exactly what needs to be said.  Thank you sir. 
---
were shadow priest really that powerful in classic? I've joined in TBC, trolled (har har har) myself to a high rating with one, but in that expansion, they never felt *that* OP, just... extremely solid.
---
I'm kinda wary of the classic SP, since they have about 3 damaging spells (sw:p, mb, mf), which seems somewhat boring compared to TBC iteration, as much as I dig messing with people, a role priests excel at.
---
so what I'm trying to ask is, how are they for pvp (primarily battlegrounds), compared to, say, a mage?
---
Stein a Human Paladin on Icedown.. I mean Icecrown server. My little 7 person guild.. Warcrown!! Paladin leveling got me hating life so bad I had a hunter and Warrior to 60 before old Stein hit 60. 
---
Hunter, IIRC. I leveled him until I got to menthril harbor and re-rolled a pally because I didn't know you could train growl (or any spell) on your pets. I found out about pet training around level 40 on my pally. 
---
Doesn't matter. I ended up raiding as a Priest and then switched to my hunter for AQ40 and Naxx. I was lucky that another DPS wanted to switch to healing or I probably would have had to continue as a Priest. I did have decent gear on my Hunter because we were short hunters and I almost always had to get on that toon for BWL drakes/chromag. It was always fun doing 5 man instances with shit gear but rolling the dragonbreath hand cannon from BWL.
---
Forgot the name, but a troll priest was my first.  While I loved the overall gaming experience in the open beta, I didn't enjoy the opening landscape of the horde.  Once launch came, I went nelf priest.  Never looked back, and I'm doing the same at launch.  
---
Starshards master race.  :)
---
The first week of WSG and AV was lit. There was always a swarm of people in front of the door.
---
And then the second and third week were miserable and people literally just stopped doing it because it was so wretchedly inconvenient.
---
There’s a big difference between kinda inconvenient and world building and insanely inconvenient and time destroying.
---
So you’re familiar with all these videos then? Any favorites?
---
omg I forgot about O RLY
---
I was going to say protection Paladin but then I looked again and they have some pretty good skills there.
---
Wasn’t combat swords for rogue pretty bad in PvP but great in PvE?
---
I might just be missing something obvious, but am I not looking at a trading card? Hippogryphs weren't tamable  until Legion aswell. Yes pets aren't as unique nowadays, which is sad, I'm just confused by the post 
---
It was a different time for sure. We were one of the top 100 guilds in the world and the only thing we asked of our members were attendance and performance. On occasion we asked for consumables but that was communicated well in advance. NR pots on Huhuran was one I believe and SR pots on Loatheb. Cheaper stuff like wizard oils I believe was encouraged too but never a requirement.
---
We had some very skilled players, some of them simply preferred to raid log, if we had started setting unreasonable demands the guild would've died and we would never had gotten to the four horsemen. 
---
&gt; Being against everything just because it wasn’t in classic is silly.
---
From my point of veiw you are the one who are against everything.
---
I want to play Vanilla and people like you are against Vanilla and instead want something different.
---
Depends if you're good or bad at the class.
---
PRINTER
---
I still have my Landro unscratched in sleeve, would be cool if I could redeem it come classic.
---
lol absolutely ridiculous.
---
You don't need that much consumables at all.
---
We had a lot of these on my server.   
---
Bucket  
---
Chair  
---
Spoon  
---
Table
---
I guess that is true, however i think it is more due to the fact that they are not very useful for later content then anything else, in MC they are actually the top DPS class or top 3 the very least (right after a server release where u just have pre raid BIS) atleast from what i have seen. But i guess i did play in a hardcore guild (Lupos was a must etc) So we did get a lot extra damage this way. But i think for casuals hunters shouldn't have any problems early on at all. 
---
&gt; It does because I get to spend more time playing the game which is fun instead of doing pointless shit.
---
Retail is right there fore people like you to play. Keep your hands of my Vanilla.
---
Why are you being down voted? SFK is clearly a horde dungeon. There are 0 Alliance quests for it. 
---
Most private servers I've played on, even with progressive patching, didn't have mages making 2 water at a time like in retail. They did change it to 10 but that was way later in the game. It's not fun to have to create hundreds of waters 2 at a time.
---
Mage tables require reagents. What's the difference between a Shaman carrying ankhs and a mage carrying a reagent to make a table?
---
What's the Shamans burden? Carrying Ankhs isn't a burden it's a bonus. Making 20 stacks of water 2 at a time is a major burden. Warlocks are really the only class that carries the same burden with soul shards.
---
Having a mage table or soul well isn't some game changing feature. ANY retail player would have loved this feature in Vanilla.
---
BatmanMug
---
Yep and then sit there at full HP no mana with a Renew ticking and are allergic to Life Tap.
---
&gt;but you say thats wrong?
---
Yes, this is definitely wrong.
---
If you expect easymode as a Vanilla Rogue in PvP, you will get to know the Spirit healer very very well, very quickly. Vanilla Rogues are amazingly cooldown dependent (and the cooldowns are much longer than what you are used to), squishy af and entirely reliant on stealth and restealthing.
---
Want an easy class to have fun with in PvP? **Play a Hunter**
---
Dwarves get no love bro. Meet you at Kharanos for a drink
---
You may want to consider including a druid in your trio.  That one class can absolutely dominate WSG, and their enhanced mobility makes them great in AB too.
---
First character was a male orc shaman. Only got him to lvl 7 or so before I learned more about the classes and switched to a male human mage.
---
Listing for a price is not the same as selling for a price. I can list my box for $100K but nobody is gonna pay it, just like nobody  is ever going to pay $6K for that listing.
---
I see this shit all the time. Well XX is going for $200 on ebay so that must be the true value. You look at completed listings and the last 5 of XX sold for $4 each.
---
I did the work for you. WoW collectors editions are SELLING for about $12-$30.

Human Paladin. I was pretty bad for quite awhile, but that bubble is very noob friendly and means you can do some stupid things and still survive.
---
&gt; ANY retail player would have loved this feature in Vanilla.
---
Obviously...
---
counterpoint: Had you guys given more fucks about consumables, you could have gotten more tanks easily and completed the game for even more fun.
---
Learn to love Gnomeregan.
---
Prot Paladin is a very strong counter to Rogues
---
Warlocks are mushrooms
---
Fair points but don’t you run a higher risk of your first point picking a server on launch day?
---
Why does everyone think Activision are the ones being twats and it's not Blizzard that is doing all this themselves?
---
&gt; Paladin - Best tank healer
---
Why do people make this claim all the time? Its just not true i Vanilla.
---
I hate Gnomeregan enough to not care about the damn Pummeler.
---
It is a loot card from the WoW TCG. Using the code that his finger covers up gives a one time redeemable follow around pet from this card.
---
There were loot cards of various rarity and uses such as mounts, follow around pets, consumables/clickable things.
---
It was one of the best ways to make money from enjoying the TCG as a hobby.
---
Enjoy being a resto druid if you don't want to grind gnomer
---
Another douche bag that blames everything on Activision. 
---
Floorfries was my favorite name i ever made
---
I have literally never seen streaming neckbeards and their flock "bottleneck" an entire server. Ive seen them be annoying in single areas and spam some chat. But thats not really much different than normal. 
---
I mean these guys werent even very annoying when we were limited to a single zone in the demo. I hate the streamers too, but you guys sorta overblow how much "damage" they do. Unless you plan on following them around, them and their retarded legion of followers aren't going to seriously effect your playtime.
---
Human Warrior Narutokun who was also my main until TBC 
---
^ this
---
If you roll a feral druid your best role is going to be PvP, not PvE.  That's just how it is.
---
all of them. i didnt hit 60 until like 2 weeks before TBC so i never really got to raid in vanilla :'(
---
just don't tell blizz shhh 
---
Combat was pretty good in PvP when played properly.
---
Weird.  People on my servers didn't like to use pots in duels(cost issue), but banaiding was normal for duels.
---
lol one dungeon per night in 2018 vanilla that's hilarious.
---
HoJ run usually takes about 45 mins tops.
---
Dal'rend run less than 25
---
Full drek bout 45 mins.
---
DM etc are even shorter usually just kill one boss.
---
strat/scholo maybe an hour for a full clear.
---
I hope for populated servers for both of you guys. The worst thing would be for us to FINALLY get classic, then have you be forced to play far away servers with bad pings. Thats just cruel.
---
A better question would be what is the worst class in PvP using the best spec.
---
We had all the geared tanks on our server on the alliance side. If Blizzard had even given even a hint at needing more than 3-4 tanks prior to the four horsemen that's what we would've built the guild towards but no for the entirety of vanilla you needed a certain amount of tanks, we had no reason to expect that to change drastically.
---
&gt;Also, why was using pots in pvp looked down upon, but using eng wasn't?
---
I used pots all the time in PvP.  Not typically in dueling just due to costs and the fact I never really took dueling very seriously. 
---
I raided up to 4H in Naxx and it was stupid having such a small portion of the population being able to see content that the devs spent hundreds of hours building. 
---
They should have had starter raids during Vanilla so more people could experience it. They did this with LFR but they should have been giving out greens not epics. You weren't accomplishing anything just experiencing it.
---
I honestly think the downfall of WoW was Epics. They should have stayed 100% in raids and never from 5 mans.
---
Awful ping is actually not that bad in world of warcraft from my experience. Sure if you wanna be a master at PvP you’l have some issues but otherwise you’re fine playing with 200~ ping.  
---
Or you can just be an officer in the guild and nobody really cares :D
---
Love the overediting and absolutely dogshit 200+ ping players he fights. Woop-de-doo
---
it's more likely the vanilla TCG items will be in a cash shop
---
Pfff fuck that. /sit macros have ruined Warrior and Paladin builds. 
---
For PvE I never made it far enough into AQ40 to really say (my server was way behind, no organized Nax attempts other than pugs).  However, I picked up Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting in BWL and I went from a pretty good PvP hunter to a fucking god in places like AV.  I once fired a multishot and killed 3 casters who were at half health or higher.  It was amazing. 
---

Roflmao
---
As a bg class they are the most op thing in the game. Keep in mind when I say that. I am not saying you can roll any one 1v1 like they are a joke but, they are one of the strongest at that as well.
---
What makes them so strong of you can tab light people up with dots. So even though it's not focused damage. It as an unreal amount of total damage over time. 25% of that will come back to your entire party as heals. Remember tab dot locks from your tbc days? Remember them bg numbers being like 2x every one else's? Imagine a class that does that but also heals each member of their party for 25% of that.
---
Sprinkle on that shit the fact you are a cloth wearer who has what are plate equivalent DMG reducers with one of the highest hp's Oo what's that sir you mean that's not All? You are also one bad mother fucker who can cast power word shield and, dispell magic. Also incase you did not know this cc lasts for 45 fucking seconds in classic. Your friends will not be dealing with that shit. Not while Big Papa is on the job. Dispell magic is the strongest spell in classic for that very reason. Oh shit I almost forgot. Other then devouring plague which is an undead Racial and, complete gravy. Your longest cool down is 45 seconds. Meaning your shit is spamamable. Not waiting for your 3 and 5 minute cds to come up. No sir your the fucking chosen one and, you won't be waiting to let people know. 
---
That dude was a confirmed pedophile though.
---
I awed at the end
---
&gt; it was stupid having such a small portion of the population being able to see content that the devs spent hundreds of hours building. 
---
I don't think it's stupid at all, because it mirrors the real world, just as he pointed out in the video.  Only a tiny fraction of people will ever see the top of Mount Everest, or drive a Ford GT supercar, or pilot a space shuttle.  Is that unfair?  Or does it give people something to aspire to?  Any rpg is a scaled down, simplified, "easified" version of the world with amplified results of work versus reward, and as such, there is nothing at all wrong with creating portions of it that some people will simply never reach.
---
Doubt it highly
---
Rolling a warrior will probably result in limited amount of raid gear because everyone is going to roll a warrior and there's only so many warrior drops in a raid.  On the other hand gearing a warrior is a lot easier than other class due to the ease of getting dungeon groups.
---
Chuck Norris counter to infinity... twice.

The collectors edition you linked is not the original 2004 collectors edition and it is not factory sealed (still plastic wrapped from the factory).

For me it was warmode.  I turned that on for leveling and 45 levels later I've never even seen someone from the other faction.  I spent almost half my time PvPing when leveling in Vanilla.  Retail wow is garbage.

That would destroy me.

If someone has spent the time to get to R14 then they should have done enough PvP to know how other classes work. I'd take the bet that he couldn't even 1v1 a R14 in blues, let alone 2 R14s.

Killing a showd priest as a Hunter is gravy but surviving the DOTs is not.

Good luck wearing a weapon outside 2 bone slicing hatchets. That is until ZG is out and you can roll on weapons again.

This is how I got Tusoph, my mom had her schedule by the computer and for Tuesday it said off so I just combined the words to get Tusoph

He's a screaming manchild, that has a few good points, buried in a stream of bitching.

Yeah, no joke. I'm pretty sure my guild went something like this through bwl
---
- stuck on razorgore for a couple weeks
---
- stuck on vael for a month
---
- all the way to chromaggus, one shotting all except broodlord
---
- kill chromaggus the next week

- Stuck on Nef for a few weeks, because the fight kept bugging out on us

Hey bc was a good time. Loved it so much. I really hope they make some legit servers in the future.

"kek" was orcish, "bur" was the common equivalent.

On that note, the rhok delar quest demons. Got the bow on retail and on a private server. And both times it was incredibly fun

Dwarf paladin, male. I got to level 2 then went druid to level 8, then paladin to 29, oh lets bounce around some more to shaman to 33, then finally an undead mage to 60.

Because they run out of arrows.

thats not the kind of crowd you want though
---
and it may be heavily one sided 
---
I'm okay with sharding for level low level characters in friendly territories. If there's 1,000 level 1-20 characters in Elwynn split it up. Higher level characters should never shard.
---
I think it’s just a scaling issue. They have good base damage without much gear, but they don’t get as much damage the better gear they get.
---
Or, as Pserver players would say, it because they’re too good at solo leveling and it’s part of the balance to not scale well
---
You sure it was after google? Seem to recall "great googly moogly" used as some kind of expletive similar to "holy crap".
---
The hunter abilities mostly just add extra damage.
---
Whereas other classes have lots of abilities that work off % of weapon damage.

The answer would not be brokentooth for all, he's purely a pvp pet.

Going to be rushing 60 and gearing up in pre BiS gear asap to hop right into end game content.

I pvped and raided a good amount towards the end of vanilla, did both A LOT during tbc, same with wotlk and mop, then for me the game was starting get too noobified and starting losing interest.  Ready to get back to the fun/hard game that wow originally was
---
Yes. The proc is for the spell, the amount of damage or time is irrelevant. 
---
My dad, two uncles, and all of their friends are like little kids they're so excited to play the game. We've already decided on 2 different groups for horde and alliance, what the makeups are, professions we're each picking and etc. I was pretty little when classic launched, but that doesn't mean that I didn't have some of the same awe-inspiring moments that many of you had. 
---
My girlfriend is just gonna have to deal, she knew what she signed up for
---
Take a talent like flurry.  This means that DPS warriors scale well as the more crit they get the more likely they are to have permanent 20% flurry haste.  
---
Warriors get 2 AP per strength point, hunters get two AP per agility.  So they scale the same in that way.  
---
BUT not having an additional type of scaling ability means that hunters don't increase at the same rate.  
---
IMO the lack of armor penetration hurts hunters too.  There are a few trinkets that apply it but it's a marginal effect.  
---
Mana isn't typically a big deal- you can chug mana pots and easily have enough to sustain your DPS rotation for boss fights.  Arcane shot is not a part of hunter's rotation in end-game (useful in PVP though) so the only uses of mana are aimed/multi shot, occasional rapid fire, feign death/trap, etc.  YOu also will get some "5 second rule" ticks during most fights so you regen OK. 
---
Helped write it 10 years ago. Riveting.
---
Vanilla had only the first set of cards before TBC was released.
---
GreenDinoRocker  pretty sweet name, I got lucky
---
In person it’s actually quite stylish.
---
They should make you lose 5% current exp, and a 1% chance of dropping one equipped slot of gear. Make it fucking mean something!
---
You could sell those cards for a good bit of money, Magical Ogre Idol and Spurious Sarcophagus are both worth more than $100 each I believe.
---
Because they can heal a single target with incredible mana efficiency, and Holy Light is the highest HPS single-target heal in the game.
---
And they scale incredibly well with gear.
---
I think they should just release classic wow, because everyone has there own tweaks and nobody will agree on them without it turning into a psycho internet social media shitstorm of crybabies 
---
In a top tier rush guild. Your only choice will be Restro.
---
But if you get in a good friendly guild you can most likely OT for them through most of raiding and as long as you are a frequent raider and are helpful (rebirth, innervate) you could probably get first pick out of other druids in your guild. Feral is great and I plan to role Feral for both PVE and PVP. I dont plan to do NAX with him simply because Ive been lvling a priest on a Pserver and Im enjoying that enough to make that my main for PVE. But Feral can still be helpful in any raid. Just make sure  you are prepared with pots and whatever else and youll be fine. Play what you want! You wont get server first, but we have something like a year or two until NAX. Plenty of time to build up a reputation in a guild to be first or second pick when it comes to druids. 
---
Time for group to form.  Time for group to travel to instance.  Time to let the healer deal with kid aggro for a few minutes.  Time to corpse-hop into the instance because you're on a PvP server.  Time to do a few corpse runs if you wipe because the hunter forgot to dismiss his pet before jumping down a ledge.
---
It is kinda related to Classic WoW , i am looking for people to form a group with , people who would eventually shift to Classic WoW with me.
---
Reddit and Sub-Reddit rules are usually maintained as community for the right reasons .
---
My post while not starting a discussion (or even getting much replies) is a post that does not affect the community negatively , so no idea why people keep jumping out citing rules.
---
with pally whilst it may be slower dps their downtime isn't as big and they basically cannot die, it isn't worse than warrior.
---
Thing is, unless they are working for Blizzard, specifically on Classic - nobody has any idea if it will work. Ill go out on a limb and say 10+ year old TCG codes are very low on their priority list. Stay tuned for the release of new Classic TCG items. Lol

I was using information I gather from videos guides and asking max level players on private servers.
---
Hunters aren’t really all that gear dependent. It’s great for levelling and they start off ahead of most other DPS at 60. But once the other classes get geared, they quickly outdamage hunters. It also doesn’t help that the only skill that hunters get from AQ40; Serpent Sting (Rank 9) would add 37DPS to Hunter damage, but they can’t use it in raids because of the debuff slot limitations.
---
Dwarf Priest...
---
&gt; Imagine now if there are 3 more tiers beyond Naxx.
---
I think the best solution would be to *not* add more tiers beyond Naxx. They would still add more raids and gear, it would just be at the same difficulty and power as the existing raids and gear. A new Naxx-tier raid could introduce new tier sets for the specs that don't have them and a new Legendary item to work towards, without making Naxx or Naxx gear obsolete. There will still be some power creep but to nowhere near the degree that adding tiers beyond Naxx would cause.
---
Resistance checks can be used to maintain the feeling of gear progression. Also, for the really high-end raiders they can introduce things like the Ulduar Hard modes or the Zul'Aman timed runs.
---
I think Grim Batol could be made as a 40-man raid on the same tier as Naxx. I wonder if Karazhan could work well as a 20-man raid or if 20 is too many for the size of the boss rooms.
---
Waiting for WoW Classic news is ruining my life.

I should take up something less addictive, like heroin.

magiccard
---
Removed - rule 1.
---
Which classes carry the hardest in this bracket?
---
I'm guessing undead shadow priest would probably the best 1v1, but not great in bgs b/c of mana issues?
---
What kind of gear did you have on your warrior?
---
I had unscratched Magic Ogre idol sitting in my wallet for years, lost the wallet recently
---
Let me borrow it when you’re done
---
His kickstarter mentioned plans to have it on Amazon in 2019. 
---
I think our was exactly the same. I think we two-4 shot BLLL, rolled through the loot dragons, and went on to Chrom and Nef basically in the same time frame.
---
We would still occasionally wipe on Chrom or Vael, but when you go through the entire raid until the last boss a few weeks in a row, your raid really does receive a gigantic power spike. Tanks with ERB’s, Priests and Mages getting tier 2, the Untamed Blade.
---
I just loved BWL. That is the time I’m looking forward to replaying the most.
---
ni hao
---
Yes got them reversed by accident!
---
The tiny spirit gain you get might gain you what? One extra spell in a fight where you go totally OOM and use every consumable possible? A situation that will rarely occur and almost never be important.
---
Fear Ward makes an enormous difference on the encounters that it is important for. Dwarves are also way ahead in terms of PVP racials.  Objectively Dwarf is far better.
---
Hunters are great in PvP. Lot of controls, good damage, survivability and the fucking per.
---
In PvE they lose dps compared to other classes, probably due to different gear scaling and because hunters can't really use pets in most of raid inc (due to mechanics that make pet dangerous or just because they die shortly after the pull. Moreover, pets doesn't gain any sort of bonuses from Hunter 's gear, so they don't scale at all (btw they are truly beasts against low epic geared cloth and leather users)
---
Levelling with an hunter is like playing wow on easy mode.
---
I feel like it is more a result of being the last class added to the game. So they weren't fleshed out like others. I mean, so many abilities literally don't scale at all
---
- pet damage
---
- all stings
---
- all traps
---
- mongoose bite
---
- arcane shot
---
- counterattack
---
The only abilities that scale at all are auto attack/shot, multishot, aimed shot, and raptor strike. 
---
On a side note, being a hunter when the 2.0 patch came out was so awesome. I only had a mix of tier 1/2, 2 piece blue pvp gear, and rhok delar. But even still, my damage went up a shitload. I can't imagine how godly a naxx geared hunter was in pvp at that point. 
---
You also get another multishot, but it doesn't add a ton of damage.
---
Stockades is an alliance levelling dungeon too. And Alliance run SFK as well. Paladins have a class quest in there iirc, and it has great gear for clothies. 
---
One of the best Starcraft 2 players in the early years went with that tactic.
---
WoW token confirmed
---
RIP Classic 
---
Better to get a money alt, not only do you enjoy a second class, you can farm effectively. Get some profession you need like herb alchemy combo. It’s much better than whatever gimped farming method you have on tank or healer.
---
Hunter maradon 60g per hr lol. Mage aoe 50-80g per hr easy. 
---
Shadow priests are very strong in duels but mediocre in premade BGs. Dots are easily dispelled. Mind flay, fear and silence have a gimped range. You run out of mana in half a minute. Destro locks and mages on the other hand have long range nukes, CC and very good sustain so are more valuable in group fights.
---
In pug BGs noone heals or dispels and everyone's randomly scattered across the map, so shadow priests do very well there too.
---
I still want that gd Chromaggus crossbow. My biggest fantasy in vanilla wow was using the zg trinket to launch two back to back multishots into a group of alliance. 
---
Apparently Americans are weird and don't use months like the rest of us. 
---
2-4 and eastern standard time
---
Looks edited. 
---
&gt; I know in my heart that I want to roll feral druid again. I'm just worried that I'll fall into the same trap as before and be let down and not get to experience everything I could.
---
I mean this in the nicest way, but you have to always remember that when someone says “I really want to play [memespec]” what they're really communicating to everyone else in the game is: “Please carry me so I can have fun.”
---
&gt; There are 0 Alliance quests for it.
---
1 ish, paladins have a class quest in there. 
---
Does it usually go to warriors/rogues?
---
Unless you wanna join a competitive guild that clear contents in the first week of it's release, you can really play almost anything in any spec if you understand your class and it's mechanics.
---
For PvP it's more about player skill that race/class. Sure, some race/classes are better than other, but only if played well. If you aren't a super competitive pvpve guy, you can pick what you like.
---
Ps. Dwarven priests are the best in a raid-guild friendly prospective simply because Alliance lack of tremor totem, but 2 or 3 dwarf priests are enough for a raid group, so yess, all priests are wanted (usually)
---
I just think adding two additional 20 man raids would be cool. Just so if you had a 20 man guild you could have your own progression track and if you're a 40 man guild, you have even more supplemental sources of gear.
---
"How do I do _____?"
---
"ALT-F4"
---
Kargoz has some amazing leveling guides that are unfortunately ruined by the fact that many of them assume that the /sit exploit that only exists on private servers will somehow make it into the Classic.
---
Other than that, they're really, really good.
---
lmao hunter weapon was the best OG meme
---
Playtime really isn't everything. Many streamers playing 12+ hours a day will take longer to level than someone who is focused and has a rough idea of what zones to go to, they spend a lot of time entertaining, reading chat and other inefficient things. They aren't going to outlevel many of the "elitest" players who will have fun trying to gank them.
---
You want to roll feral so roll feral.  
---
As someone who plays private servers, content is easy. The skill and knowledge of players is much greater today. Content is cleared as soon as it is released. If you can farm all your consumables, learn the encounter mechanics, and play your class well, you will not have trouble finding a raid spot at all.  
---
Remember, these are 40 person raids we're talking about. There will be room for you so play what you want.
---
On the contrary, I'm worried that by playing my favorite class, Rogue, there will be a lot of competition for spots. Guess I'll have to beat out that competition because I'm playing MY class.
---
/sit is not exploit, it’s absolutely legit way to be critically hit.
---
1 2 3 4 5  
---
  
---
rogue rogue
---
I think this is what the whole community fears.
---
I agree.
---
Nope. It isn't. 
---
It was patched halfway through Vanilla and all private servers based on 1.12 that have it are wrong.
---
It's more fun for Alliance to have to travel to hostile lands for dungeons. (As long as we're not bringing xp/hr into the equation)
---
You *could* also be an SM/Ruin Warlock, but the better guilds will have a much higher ratio of DS/Ruin.
---
&gt; One exception is a fight like kelthuzad. Having extra hp on the whole raid was really nice.
---
Funny you use that as your example because KT is the only fight where you don’t want to have extra HP on anyone because of Frost Blasts. 
---
Ahh that's true. Verigan's Fist
---
I didnt know Feral tanks used the crowd pummeler?
---
Mara is 40-60g/h and you’re rarely going to hit 60g/h unless you get a ton of weapons to drpp from Princess/Rotgrip. 
---
Thats a pretty good backup plan!
---
Easy : cat durid is 4 fite! 
---
You get a book for multi and AOTH. Granted, these barrly do a difference but at least they're always used unlike SS. 
---
Alliance players:  
---
Night Elves named Legolas and Elunaria.  
---
Humans with quirky two syllable names.  
---
Dont even get me started on Gnomes.  
---
You are objectively wrong and won't find yourself lasting long in a successful raid group now days with that play style.
---
I remember that 'Training my horny bitch' video by Athene in which he tries to level his girlfriend irl in his backyard lol. Unsure if it was vanilla or a bit later though.
---
Also, internet is for porn.
---
I just leveled a warlock to 37 in three weeks. It's kinda thing where you are doing the same series of moves over and over, but the survivability is nuts if specced properly. 
---
Even def capped tanks received critical hit if they sit. As far as I remember it was still the case in TBC.
---
Even if it got patched, that’s game mechanics change, such things are called “clever mechanics use” by Blizz, not exploit.
---
Anyways, it should be in patch notes. I’m not going to play a warrior this time, but I’ll check change logs out of curiosity. Don’t you remember version number when this change was implemented?
---

---
According to this it should only work off of yellow hits and not autos.
---
&gt; Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?
---
&gt; Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting. 
---
Because everyone has and should have the mentality of a world first raider. Go back to retail where you belong to drool on your meters or progression or whatever it is you obsess over.
---
[here's the bluepost showing this was fixed long before 1.12.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; “Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”

&gt; “**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.** However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.”
---
Lol have fun with your memespec! I'll check in on you in a year and see if you put your money where your mouth is.
---
less QQ more pewpew!
---
If you're going to attack the pet, I can't see logic in this. The power of Serenity tactic was in Soul Link dispell when you're attacking player before that tac was "fixed".
---
If you'll attack Voidwalker, warlock can at(mostly) any time use Sacr or re-apply Soul Link(after sap fades).
---
So tactic with killing demon is much better than attempt to dispell Soul Link from pet.
---
I'm playing Rogue, like I have in every patch since 2004.
---
I have a discord with around 900 people and I'm sure I there are people who are going to come back to vanilla and want to raid if you guys wanted to try to get something started rather than keep looking

I agree that if you buy a porsche just so you can brag to others that you are better than them, you would be a shitty person (and I guess that's what you're trying to say). But enjoying something because it's special is not shitty, that's just normal, everyone does it. Just imagine you are the only person on earth. In world 1 like this one porsche is special, in world 2 all the cars are prosche or even better than porsche. It's completely normal to enjoy driving the porsche in world 1 more than in world 2 (because in world 2 porsche is a bad car).
---
Rogue in Alpha.  Sword and Board baby!
---
Damn. There should have been an instance in Duskwood... 
---
I never experienced anything beyond MC in Classic.  I want all the raids and I fully intend to see Nax in its Vanilla glory.  I want to tank on my Warrior and DPS on my Rogue.  And even try the oddball Feral Druid as my third alt.  
---
Warrior can play dps too...
---
There aren't that many consumables for healers. You have mana pots, wizard oil, mp5 food, optional flask because it just gives a bigger mana pool which isn't directly tied to performance... and that's pretty much it. DPS and tanks need way more consumables in order to optimize. Healers just get some extra mana out of theirs, and as soon as content is on farm status and you breeze through the fights, they aren't even necessary anymore. You don't need Flask of Wisdom when you finish every boss with half your mana left, but DPS are still expected to push their output, perhaps even moreso when the guild is just trying to get shit done as fast as possible.
---
If you want a guaranteed raidspot roll Paladin.  That will guarantee it.
---
I think Tips is going on a pvp server horde side, Esfand and Staysafe are going Alliance on the same server. As of now asmongold is going on alliance on a PVE server while leveling a horde character on a pvp server off stream.
---
For real, that’s literally the exact same model the game has had since it’s inception. To say that it’s a “new thing” that ruined the game is just ignorant and silly
---
Remember the Alamo
---
Honestly, yes. The only 2 things I'm worried about is picking a server that won't die after 2 months and picking a server with terrible faction balance. 
---
I really hope Blizzard implement a system to keep faction balance even.
---
Given that their reference client is 1.12, must have happened in BC
---
Would you set a Discord server up, pre-emptively?
---
A bit more convenient than Reddit PM'ing potentially 39+ people lol
---
It's also gonna be a giant hassle when you can't just camp out to get moved to the entrance. A lot of farming methods are only good on private servers for this reason.
---
The main thing I'm most concerned about is ending up on the realm that is heavy faction unbalanced.
---
I mean, let's be real, there WILL be that kind of realms, that what people likes the most. Look at the current retail stats: 
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/us
---
As you can see, all the large realms has like 95/5% ratio. That means you'll not be able to get in any fucking dungeon or somewhat contested area (felwood satyrs, for example) without being killed several times.
---
It's not like i'm against pvp realms, but going PvE is not a solution either, you don't know which faction will prevail beforehand, so you might end up with a very little group of people to play with. 
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/eu
---
EU stats, same shit. Most of the populated realms is 80/20 at best. And I REALLY WANT to go alliance this time, but people generally like the horde more, not to mentioned that we'll have WotF and undead rogues in classic, so yeah... :) 
---
Gotta hope that they'll add transfers. Put it on cooldown like half a year so people can't abuse it, but it really would seem like the only chance for people that haven't been lucky with their initial choice to have a play after they hit 60 and could evaluate their surroundings.
---
Finally, someone halfway sane on this sub! Most of my downvotes have come from me calling out people’s toxic attitudes and the constant shitting on a game they’re still paying to play. It’s infuriating.
---
On the one hand, I can see what you mean. Yes, the game has changed a lot since then, but on the other hand it has to.
---
If things didn’t change for the past decade and a half the game would’ve been shut down a long time ago because everybody stopped playing. They’ve brought in a lot of great features over the years that I think have helped tremendously. MMOs need regular updates and content to keep players engaged. Otherwise you might as well play single player games.
---
Sure, they don’t always implement everything the way/time people want them to be, but WoW has become an absolute titan in the industry and it takes an incredible amount of time, dedication, and work to keep it going.
---
I also largely feel that people need to take a damn chill pill. It’s a video game.
---
You will need a Lot of tanks for 5 and 10 man dungeons  the entire time.
---
Well what if you name an item of gear to remove from the character before I log out so it's missing in my armoury? That way you know the toon is mine ?
---
Does anyone remember that wow forum post about why ret paladins are so awesome in pvp and just goes into detail about how you can basically be afk while playing arathi basin? I really wish I saved it back then because I remember it being hilarious. 
---
Your abilities dont scale off your gear (it doesnt make the damage higher cause it is flat values) and also your pet damage doesnt get any higher with better gear. 
---
Everyone wants to play a warrior, nobody wants to tank.
---
Feral tanks use them to get high threat really fast to let the dps go ham without worrying about pulling aggro.  
---
Bear off tank is preferable to warrior since they deal more threat and can pull some good dps after their tanking duties are done. If I am min/maxing, I wouldn't bring a cat druid, but a bear off tank brings unique things.
---
we could all come together and start creating guilds ahead of time. These guilds can then discuss their goals of what they want in the game.

I've played 2 classic private servers... theres never enough warriors
---
While I don't have experience with vanilla so I can't speak to the extent of the impact of these consumables, looking at it from a retail perspective makes this appear as a difference of guild caliber. For example, if you take a high level guild like mine, which clears the raid in a couple of weeks in relatively low to mid level gear, and compare us to a low level mythic guild that might struggle their way through at a higher gear level than we were when we were in that position, the difference there wouldn't be put up to consumables. If we'd been in the position of that guild with their gear level, without any flasks or pots etc, it's pretty likely that we would still roll through at that gear level simply out of a difference of ability, and likewise here. 
---
Your guild might have had a higher consumable requirement to fill in gaps created by, for lack of a better phrase, a lack of skill/ability. In the end both guilds potentially end up clearing the raid, but one requires much less of their raiders as far as consumables are concerned because their baseline capability is higher and it isn't needed to substitute the extra damage/health/healing etc to overcome the fights.
---
Even for raids when there's two tanks among 40 players? That seems insane to me
---
Maybe your thoughts would be easier to figure put if you fired up a new char on the release date of a new pserver... let's just say 25+ people camping ONE respawn was a reality. And WoW Classic will see more than the private servers did. I'm all balls Fucking out for sharding, at least 1-20
---
I really dislike the blanket statement about retail players here needing to adjust to doing things because they are fun, there's already plenty of people like that in both camps, and plenty of people who do things they feel required to do in both camps. Do something because it's fun isn't an exclusive part of vanilla wow
---
Rogues are fun.  Plain and simple.  A tracker probably optimizes damage, but I wouldn’t let your decision be based on addons.
---
I refuse to use healbot yet love healing.  I haven’t used omen or other threat tools either and I enjoy tanking.
---
I wouldn’t feel pressured by this optimization.  Also, when you master your class without it and find you want to still improve, then you can implement it.
---
Well yea but if so many players are rolling warrios it feels natural that some would go tank

---
So many people want to play warrior but most want to dps probably 75% of them in my experience.
---
A lot of people who say they will play end up quitting because the leveling is kind of boring they say. (I love it personally)
---
Usually more raid spots are available for warriors because they do good DPS and can off tank.
---
That usually works itself out. Not that many people actually want to take on the pressure of tanking. If anything, you'd still struggle with warriors actually wanting to tank. 
---
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a big issue when the game launches. It won't just be a matter of too many or too few servers, either. It'll be about the fact that many of them will turn out horribly imbalanced, and it won't be apparent until you've invested enough time to feel bad about rerolling. Getting to level 30 only to discover that your server is 75% enemy team is gonna be a nightmare. A half-empty server at least carries the possibility of a merge. A full server where one side is totally dominant is just unfixable, and WoW is a way worse game under those circumstances unless you're strictly PvE and on the populated side.
---
Back in the day, people didn't know starting out that alliance had huge mechanical advantages over horde, so people picked one or the other pretty equally and often stuck with their choice throughout vanilla because all their friends were on whatever team they started with. On private servers, since there's only one server and the statistics are usually shown on the website, people are much more conscious of their choice and will try to balance the population for the sake of competition. 
---
I don't think retail Classic will be anything like that. People will have to blindly pick a server and hope for the best, and a *lot* of the top tier players will gravitate toward alliance because it's simply better. There might be a few servers that become the designated home for a given private server's community, but most of them will be a total crapshoot. It's a lot easier to justify rolling horde as a guild when it's because you know which members of the community are going where and you want to compete with a specific alliance guild. When you go in blind, alliance will be a lot more appealing because it's the safe choice.
---
There will obviously be people who go horde just because they prefer it. There might even be servers where horde is dominant. Unfortunately, I think the vast majority of them will be 60/40 or more in alliance's favor, and most of the hardcore PvP guilds will be alliance as well, creating an extremely lopsided world environment on these servers. The factors that helped to equalized the population in original vanilla and private servers won't be there in Classic, and I predict that a considerable majority will make the safe choice of going alliance.

Levelling a warrior to 60 in vanilla is the toughest test you will ever undertake in an MMO
---
Lol. 
---
This is the worst healer a tank can get, coming from a tank. 
---
When your ”smart heal” finishes Ive already taken more damage. 
---
I was there, and yes it got messy, especially when you had to grab a quest item and wait for the respawns while the masses just increased around it. Some players argue that IS the experience though. It's those experiences where you socialize and memorable/goody stuff can happen.
---
I think some people plan on being ahead of the pack, and when a majority of players are getting bogged down it gives them a chance to pull away. But that's the negative way to look at the more elite playerbase.
---
Evilboi
---
Sodapoppin says he's going PvP anyway and is just gonna "stay ahead of the curve." Asmon said he's going PvE. I dont know about anyone else thus far.
---
I don’t know about that either. Hunters can deal devastating dmg in teamfights especially against casters. It’s not a 1v1 situation and they are rarely focus target due to mail and beeing hard to pin down so they often can cause havoc at will.
---
Ahh you stole my idea! Lol

Streamer servers will have extreme faction imbalance and most people on that server will want to be in the streamer's guild and is basically just there for the streamer and their following.
---
Aflorction
---
While it can indeed work it is far from optimal and as you already mentioned requires a lot of effort. How likely do you think it is for someone not knowing fully well what they get themselves into to enjoy their time on a feral druid?
---
I offtank some of our mc/bwl runs on my druid alt. I'd rather run twice on my tank warrior (bound to another id so can't) but as support for the two excellent tanks tanking those runs it suffice's and I make it work but a dps warrior could do the same job while providing more dps across the run.  
---
Feral druid is not a good choice for anyone unsure about what it entails or not very familiar with vanilla. On my the current server one of my friends actually quit because he found his choice of feral druid to be utterly insufficient in performance and reward for the massive amount of effort he put into it. He could have been an extremely solid warrior or rogue instead.
---

---
Grimlock, me king!
---
Streamers cause severe faction imbalance, and just because you won'y pay special attention to the streamer doesn't mean others wont.  Most people on the server will want to be in the streamer's guild and play with the streamer and will have their own inside club instead of a bunch of smaller/medium guilds /friend groups.
---
The initial rush of 'first' chars is going to be epic... and the people streaming their speedruns will get ahead of the pack regardless - I mean, I have to work, and launch is close to opening bow season. Lots of people will reroll around 20, I might be one of them. Months after the announcement and I'm between recreating my rogue, going shadow priest, or going hunter to grief the shit out of people. 
---
Sharding to 20ish - OK. After that? Facing down raid vs raid in ashenvale to get across a beach? Fuck yeah, welcome to Vanilla.
---
So I can /pat you 
---
PvP and arena was unbalanced as hell, but Wrath gave us Ulduar, a raid most people agree was the absolute pinnacle of WoW raid design. It looked amazing, the encoutners were varied and fun, it was accessible to all at the start but got hard enough to be a challenge, and it was the first raid to have the Hard Mode system which really satsified the hardcore players.
---
Couple the "best raid ever" with a storyline that most people were invested in (compare the levelling story to eventually reach Arthas vs TBC where you never even had Illidan mentioned until 2 minutes before the Black Temple raid) and you get a mega popular expansion.
---
Actually it was the EXACT raid AFTER Ulduar, the repetitive, grindy Trial of the Champion, where I felt WOW took it sfirst downturn and started becoming the please-the-masses gear treadmill grindfest that it is today. PVP Aside, Ulduar-era WoW was the best its PVE has ever been.

enough tanks or enough warriors?

Have you ever levelled a warrior in classic? Most will give up early.

---
TWO tanks? Think again.
---
40-man raid encounters needed regularly more than 2. Heck, the Four Horseman in Naxx needed EIGHT tanks. Virtually every encounter even the easy Molten Core ones needed 3-4, some more.
---
You'd generally have one MT (usually specced Prot of course), a couple of primary offtanks (prot or hybrid spec, arms/fury was fine to tank as. Any Prot here would probably be a Nightfall Axe spammer when dpsing) and then a handful of DPS warriors who could throw on a shield when needed.
---
Hey!  I remember your story from awhile back!  Sadly I have nothing to contribute regarding your question, but I remember seeing this photo as it was all you had left of your character’s photos.  (iirc)
---
A lot of times there’s room for 3 or 5 tanks.  A lot of bosses in MC have more than two adds.   As long as you’re consistent and attend all the raids you will be needed at one point.  You could even host your own ZG a couple times a week as the main tank.

I loved Ulduar but, when I quit which was around TotC I remember feeling Ulduar was the only part of the expac that didn't suck. I would honestly say the end of tbc with raid finder killed wow for me. The move away from cc based focus fire and, agro content. To instead be aoe dps crap packs in dungeons they felt like they needed to do to make dungeon finder work killed the game.
---
I'm my opinion making a party member that easily replaceable. Is a huge part of what made the game go down hill for me. 
---
both on nostalrius i remember scuba cops looking for a feral druid off tank and they were like the top 3 guilds on the server for pve. also ridin dirty from ed had a feral off tank and they were the best pve guild.
---
and if you look at the raid logs feral dps is actually pretty good when the realm is pre aq40. the top feral dps is right up there with mages,locks,hunter above spriest, and blows paladin and shaman out the water
---
As a vanilla Druid I was rank 12 in PVP and farmed all the end game raids both a resto and feral Druid. I would highly recommend you consider playing resto and getting in a good raiding guild. 
---
This will open up the end game raiding for you and allow you to accumulate all the best end game Feral Gear. 
---
There are really only one exception piece of Feral gear per item slot in vanilla and it will be difficult to accumulate them. 
---
To get a weapon with feral attack power on it you will only have 2 options in the entire game. 
---
Hammer of bestial wrath which has an insanely low drop rate. Lower than what any site I says online and only drops off of world dragons.
---
Option two can be even harder to acquire because it requires a lot of AQ 40 runs, a Hilt has to drop and when it does it’s not just for druids its for multiple classes and most raids will make the feral hammer a low priority.
---
I don’t want to get into to much detail but you will want to be farming all the 20 man and 40 man Raids up through AQ 40 to really give this its best go. 
---
After raiding a lot as a resto Druid I was allowed to MT these raids with few boss exceptions (resist armor sets required) but it took a lot of raiding to get the right gear.  
---
 I really encourage you to go feral and have fun but consider splitting time and your feral play time will be so much better!
---
You're probably overthinking it. Leveling dungeons aren't that difficult, so tanks that fall at them are probably few and far between. Just play whatever you want to play instead of being overly concerned about whether there will be a need for it or not.

Ah you're probably right, I just need a nudge in one direction or the other for choosing a class  because I love both warrior and mage. 
---
That will be the day when there are too many tanks or healers.
---
Wait so feral dps is competitive pre-AQ?
---
just level as dps spec you dont need to be specced tank when leveling
---
Buzzkill
---
Feral is a top tier dps you baked potato.
---
90% of those who pick warriors wanna be "big dick dps". There never was and never will be enough tanks.
---
Well yes of course, you should never level as prot. The question is whether I should play warrior so I can tank on the side, or mage since that's where the sweet nostalgia is.
---
I keep hearing hunters gear doesnt scale very good so other classes are stronger? What would u say to that? Can hunters hold thier own against most at end game pvp?
---
After the Assassin NPC who used to hang out at Kurast Docks in Diablo II. Would have been tough to name her after Nattie 3+ years before she got the name!
---
well its up there with mage/lock/hunter pre aq. ive heard someone say druid loot is sick in aq so why should they drop off well the other classes just scale way better and your bis weapon is a lvl 30 gnomergon weapon so obviously your not going to scale as well as others. 
---
Don't make your class depended on a raid spot.
---
I played rogue in world of roguecraft and never had problems with raids or dungeon groups.
---
If you can play your class on a high lvl, if you make connections and have a good reputation. If you are always on time, if you are pleasent in ts and don't become annoying. 
---
You always get a spot. 
---
Bumfacemeat.
---
We are in the same boat when it comes to the possible tank populations.
---
A new warrior (or from retail) might struggle learning to hold aggro, especially with packs. You might even see the retail mentality of the dps just flying in and going ham. Great warriors will build a rapport with the community and become highly sought after. And if you enjoy it you are already doing a good job!
---
As a mage on the other hand you can help the warrior with sheep and Frost Nova, possibly saving a wipe by giving the healer a chance to catch up. Or kite the mobs after the warrior dies... And big numbers on your screen.
---
Good luck choosing!
---
Undead rogue on a friends account. Played at nighttime, when my friend was sleeping, then I would sleep during the day, while he took over. His PC was on for about 2 months straight.
---
Why would that suck? I don't see streamers bringing a lot positives to a server tbh, whilst their fanboy's generally cause a lot of shit. Then again, i think quite a bit of EU streamers played Vanilla, think of Kungen, Sco and more of the method roster iirc, its not known though if they will play Classic (although i bet kungen will show up). They might not be as big as Soda / Asmon, but i would also not rate ppl like Esfand, Staysafe as Famous (yet).
---
well mage is boring in pve imo at least until you get fire spec in aq40. warrior you can get a fun weapon setup like felstriker and ironfoe for fun fury procs and also get a tank spec to be an off tank in raids. also pvp you can own as arms but if you really want to rape youll need a healer
---
mage you can just rape by yourself in pvp. personally i would go warrior unless you like the idea of controlling people with sheep and frost nova and really having a lot of control in the battle. if your horde you can counterspell a paladin for 10 seconds and he cant even cast anything or do jack
---
No, but my current goal is that, and I'm working towards it as hard as I can.  
---
Or ... that depends on what you mean by publishing...

And my San Andreas mods also brought in like \~90 USD.  
---
Sadly the other ones didn't make profit. 
---
Oooor... If the youtube money from the videos I made about those projects count ... Then I can also say that I earned a total of \~200 USD over 4 years.
---
Yeah, I know it's not a lot, but I'm still proud of it.

---
 Most tanks will be fine for leveling dungeons
---
Doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. Having a tank that knows what they're doing is invaluable. If you want to spend a bit of time doing pug 5 mans than go for it.
---
Would also make it pretty much impossible to queue for multiple battlegrounds at the same time and join the first one that pops up. You'd just have to be lucky to choose the right one with the shortest queue if you just want to play a battleground,

If you are losing people to frost blast because they have a titans flask on you need to either fix your strat or get better healers. If rather have extra hp for an o-shit someone missed an interrupt moment or for the extremely hectic phase 3. Not required on either case though. I'd  rather spend my coppers on demonic runes. 
---
This is not Legion anymore. BFA tanking is actually pretty hard and you can't pull more than one group at a time. Tanks will be fine.
---
I think there is an achievement for it in retail, you might be able to make a list from that.
---
But I'm speculating
---
From your post, it sounds to me like you'd enjoy tanking more, so I'd say roll warrior.
---
The majority of consumables with the exception of stuff like Wizard Oil only increases healing longevity, not output. When things die fast you dont need the consumables.
---
The only boss I use Major Mana pot on in current content is Nefarian, and maybe one during supression room if we dont get take breaks.
---
I also lead the charge clearing trib which means 2-4 Major Mana every MC and BWL. Multiply this with months of content and I have my a bankchar stocked with Major Mana. They also dont cost a lot if I need to replenish my stock.
---
There is no expertise in vanilla.
---
You want to kick players from your guild who want to run the most optimal content to farm gold so they can flask in your raids instead of doing 3hour BRD runs "for fun"?
---
Hunters have the lowest crit per agility from all classes. Mages and priests get more critical per agility point than hunters do. A lot more. No real explanation why of course.
---
Also, they have no procs. When a warr crits, they procc flurry. When a rogue attacks, they procc poisons. When a hunter crits or attacks, nothing happens.
---
Finally, the pet is a good chunk of the hunter's DPS but with no avoidance, in PvE it will die early in the boss fight.

Exactly! Even though some tanks have picked up some bad habits, I would venture to say that 90% of the tanks you encounter in classic are gonna be at a much higher skill level than the tanks we had back in vanilla.

I hope not.  World buffed full potted speed runs? Yuck.  I'd rather take longer gold efficient runs any day. I expect decilsaur wars and lotus camping  to be a thing though. Hopefully spawns are adjusted depending on server pop caps.
---
&gt;You might even see the retail mentality of the dps just flying in and going ham.

after wiping the group a couple of times they will understand. Those kind of problems usually adjust themselves

Yo thanks a lot. You confused me a bit but I think I know what you mean!
---
I played the first 3 months of BFA as a Paladin tank and it wasn't easy. I'd say tanking in BFA is harder, but vanilla is more punishing (longer corpse runs, respawning mobs, repairs etc.)
---
I wonder if it will be the same quality as this one or some cheaper soft cover version.
---
I think up to level 30 Alliance zones are more fleshed out yes, Barrens is a pretty blant zone. But on the other hand I feel like (subjective) that leveling to 20ish feels faster on Horde side. Also I like running RFC although it is not time/xp efficient
---
Resto shaman is the easiest class in the game to get a raid spot.  There is no contest.  Horde raids can and will stack far more shamans than ally will stack pallies, or they would except sham are always underplayed. If you want to be valued for your class before they even know you, play resto sham.
---
Said no HORDE player ever
---
Solution: play as a mage tank (its a thing)
---
Just to add on to this, the achievement in retail does not have every single book - sorry I cant be more insightful on where to find them all, I just know there are indeed more out there 
---
well you could attempt to bring down that emerald dragon :-)
---
i'd say a lot of the probably wouldn't because they were added to the game after Vanilla. Some from the first set might work though.
---
Yikes, makes me want to tank now lmao
---
DAMNIT I DUNNO WHAT TO ROLL AGHHH

I expect to see more feral bears and protadin's, especially with the recent discoveries in theorycrafting. We also might see the occasional shaman tank.

Oh well, I guess I will just have to keep an eye out while playing the game then.

yes ive seen his videos but when other classes can start reaching 1.5k dps you dont see druids reaching that. raid logs is all you need to see their dps gets out competed

wasn't their guild Elitist Jerks, the guild Ion played with?

&gt; or are they going to opt for the "pserver" route of "massive" (possibly overpopulated) servers

Doubtful, the world clearly isn't designed for the 10k server populations of private servers.

---

---
Shield wall!
---
They could have easily addressed those issues over the course of vanilla. The reason they did not do so is because of a more fundamental issue, which is that hunters scale almost identically in PvP and PvE. Fixing the scaling problems means Hunters would become extremely broken in PvP.
---
Other classes can use various PvE-only DPS increases, like Rogues using Slice &amp; Dice and damaging poisons, Mages/Warlocks using long cast time spells, etc.
---
Hunters use the same set of abilities in PvP and PvE, as they don't really require the Hunter to ever stand still. The only DPS increase is in being able to spam Aimed Shot (which is used semi-frequently in PvP regardless by a good hunter who knows how to trap), as well as being able to manage your auto shot cooldown better.
---
The real solution to hunter DPS wasn't the lack of scaling, but actually just Steady Shot in TBC. It gave Hunters something exclusive for PvE that could elevate their PvE DPS significantly above their PvP DPS.
---
Or they leave and either blame the healer or the tank, lol
---
yep and they're still hosted, so if you can remember your login details or URLs then they're still there

---
&gt; How has it been on private servers?
---
THE TOTAL OPPOSITE, most warriors are leather-wearing DPS whores.
---
I started on a 10k pop pvt server in November, hit 60 over Christmas and was shocked at the lack of warriors willing to tank.
---
The shortage of tanks is so extreme that a warrior/druid willing to tank can reserve the first Righteous Orb that drops from Stratholme Live (worth 30g on the server).
---
I also got paid 100g by people that needed to run DM:West for quests.
---
And then you're like WTF what are the chances? So you make a minor change and test the availability. It accepts it then you're like damn I don't want this name. So you DELETE and recreate the character while thinking of a new name. And so the cycle continues.
---
It's not a particularly smart heal if you don't take into account incoming damage during the cast time now is it? 
---
A good healer calculates expected missing health and picks a heals for roughly that amount. If you've taken 2000 damage in the last 10 seconds I choose a heal with 2 second cast time with a rank that heals for 2400 or more.
---
Not at all, but if they start complaining that they're the only ones doing it and try to change the guild they're gone.
---
I've been playing on a private server since November.  People are a lot more accepting of feral druids with 1.12 talents.
---
I've seen feral druids off tank in ZG, MC and BWL
---
All these Pserver hunters are in for a hell of a surprise when they find out real vanilla focus regenerating rates.
---
Lol at lightning noodle.
---
Pretty sure pets with be somewhat normalized depending on their species.

&gt; There are really only one exception piece of Feral gear per item slot in vanilla and it will be difficult to accumulate them. 
---
I saw 3 draconic mauls drop from BWL trash in one run
---
I’m not a private server player but I am a dedicated lurker who also plans to main hunter. From what I gather it’s mostly a pve concern since hunters main strength in pvp is their ability to kite melee and outrange other ranged classes, as well as their vast toolkit

It can add to the immersion. If you do a quest to burn down a village for example, if that village is no longer burnt the next time you go there it's pretty weird. Without phasing you're limited to creating content where nothing ever happens that affect the world.

I hope so, i wanted to play a hunter but everyone kept saying other classes do much more damage, i thought this meant other classes do better in end game pvp, hopefully someone can fully clarify.
---
Hey, i made that post to get as much information as possible, the fact that they tested it and got it confirmed that we were wrong is what i wanted. It's awesome to read that they are testing the things we wrote down, like the warrior charge not initializing combat unless u auto attacked at the end.
---
don't quantify a cooldown like that as uptime, it's a counterattack that can be used to break fear, sleep and charm so it will be used when needed to be used, perhaps not on every fear but it means you have to debate whether the fear will even help when a rogue just wotfs it and kills you
---
This Hunter gear at end game question keeps popping up. Most players will not have naxx gear. And skill is still a factor in pvp.
---
Play whatever entices you. Don't think about endgame, you may not even see it
---
In my experience in low level dungeons. Having decent damage dealers that cc stuff and focus damage on one target is more important than having a good tank. 
---
A good tank can reliably hold maybe 3 mobs at most at a time. A bad tank can hold one mob. But even for a good tank if damage is all over the place he will loose aggro a lot, and tanking three mobs at once hurts quite a lot either way, resulting in a lot more mana breaks for the healer. 
---
I kinda like tanking, but my concern is that its probably hard to be a casual tank player, whereas it feels like you have more room to move as a healer or dps. 
---
Any thoughts?

One shotting clothies with an Aimed Shot crit is fun.

I played mage on a vanilla server and i really enjoyed pvp. 
---
There are some mechanics that make 1v1s very fun, for example popping a reflector and blink to hide the animation.
---
The crowd control is just amazing!
---
When it comes to pve frostbolt is everything you do until ZG launches. 
---
That's quite boring but the damage is nice, at least you can decurse/sheep sometimes.
---
I can't say much about hunters as i don't like the class as a whole. 
---
The attacking deadzone, carrying ammo, not outperforming anybody... i don't see why there are more hunters than warlocks.
---
atm i am playing a warlock and it turns out that i like the playstyle even more than the mage.
---
Not really. Solo pvp is really dependant on gear, skills, consumables and opening. Also note that some specs (holy for example) while having (s)low  kill/burst potential, they counter some tradicional strong solo pvpers like mages and rogues
---

---
When u say outperforming anybody u mean pve right? Im looking at a pvp perspective. I feel like mages might be to squishy but i hear hunters can be to

What does your comment mean?

Unless of course a couple of streamers of equal appeal go on opposite factions on the same server. This will ensure that a healthy population exists on the server. E.G With Tips going horde and Staysafe/Estfan going alliance while it will be busy and full of the fanz it will hopefully have an even balance which will be good for game play. I want to be on a streamer server to ensure that the server population of the server I pick will remain high throughout the life cycle of classic. 
---
As an EU player the EU has streamers like Preach, Bellular, Taliesin and Evitel and Nobble which appeal to a different fan base and I am hoping these servers will be fun to be on.

---
&gt;  we wiped so many times in raids. Trying to brainstorm what went wrong or what to try next,
---
that's exactly how it should be when nobody has beat the encounter before.
---
My retail guild had an early Rag attempt where the adds bugged and didn't spawn - we still wiped.
---
This week on a pvt server the guild I just joined him downed him before the first add spawn, and cleared MC/BWL in 3 hours (which isn't even that fast by pvt server standards)
---
Aside from other points, being reliant on a weapon is tricky. Specially when you have to wait 2 full raids to get something better. 
---
PvE-wise hunter weapons available are scarce, it is just:   (pre-raid)-&gt;Rhok (domo, MC) -&gt; Ashjre'thul (Chrom, BWL) -&gt;Nerub Slavemaker (Kel'Thuzad, Naxx). After Ashjre'thul you don't get a weapon upgrade until the actual lass boss of the game. AQ? nothing. Naxx? Just at the end. 
---
Compare it with rogues or warriors and AQR, MSA... They actually get to upgrade their main weapons (melee ones in this case, compared to hunter's ranged one being the main), they get some ramp up. 
---
Nah, server merges are inevitable. If there's a server named after my main one from modern I'll likely play on it otherwise I'm going to choose whatever sounds cool and hope for the best. Might just choose what sounds cool anyway cause there's no real point to playing on my original server seeing how none of my friends are planning to play classic anyway.
---
Dungeons and raids are more difficult in BfA than in classic. At least the way people play them. You could cc every pack and be super careful about pulling in retail too, and it would be easier. But we have abilities to aoe tank now so that's how we do it, and keeping track of the abilities of all mobs and stuff in a pack takes a bit of skill. There's way more going on than in vanilla, where it's easy to keep track of everything happening. 
---
It's only the casual content like levelling, warfronts, island expeditions, etc that is 
---
easy. 
---
Which is a shame because the early part is the worst. Only gets better by the level :)
---
Same. People say "just play something you find fun". Well, yeah... I find EVERYTHING fun lmao
---
My guess is no better than anyone else's, but I'd be very tempted to put my money on them reusing the server names they had at launch as homage.

---
Hunters don't scale well in PvE for various reasons. To skip a long explanation, their PvE DPS is limited by their PvP DPS due to a class design flaw. As such, you don't need to worry about your PvP DPS. It's just your PvE DPS that is suffering.
---
As for advice, unless you have a specific idea of what type of class you want to play it's really difficult for people to give constructive advice to you without writing a wall of text, and even then, just trying it out will tell you much more.
---
It's not nonsense. Classic is better. I personally believe so. It's most certainly the game FOR ME, just as it is the game for many others.
---
BUT: Classic is NOT going to be the game for the masses. It's a game for the fans but not for the (free) achievement hungry mindless zombies that play "videogames" nowadays.
---
THAT's why retail numbers will be bigger. Surely, active player times on start of classic are surely going to exceed everyones expectations but things will settle down the coming months.
---
There's a reason why private server numbers aren't up in the millions and it sure as hell isn't because "it's not legal". 
---
I hate retail myself, but that doesn't stop me from being realistic...
---
Poopfeast420

&gt; . To be seen if that cancer comes to retail.
---
Why is it cancer?  I've been playing on a pvt server since November and some modern things have surprised me e.g leather wearing dps warriors, 30 minute MC/BWL clears etc

But world buffing before raids seems like a perfect "why didn't we think of that"

---
I want to go hunter because i like the idea of it, moving while doing damage, long range, the only thing that was worrying me was the gear scaling i thought effected pvp, and the deadzone.
---
See my reply above. I fully believe that classic is the better game for myself, as it is the better game for a lot of hardcore fans of WoW and certainly those who have been playing WoW since Classic/TBC.
---
But it's not a game that's gonna please the whole playership of WoW.
---
People on this sub are becoming so retarded downvoting everyone that says something realistic just because it may appear "anti-classic" at first glance when people aren't thinking about what's actually being said.
---
If classic numbers are higher than retail numbers after like half a year or so, then that'd hell of a surprise.
---
So what you do is you make friends with the competent people and try to play with them more, and eventually don't have to deal with many trash players.
---
On pvt servers I see raid guilds advertise as "competitive" (eg 30minute clears of MC/BWL), and semi-hardcore.
---
In my brief experience semi-hardcore means still buffing pre-raid and stockpiling consumables

To be honest. I hope that the next thing we hear is:

Female Night Elf Hunter named Ringo or Appletree/Apple with red hair. It was made on very popular back then, polish private server where you had to write your own, convincing backstory in order for administration to accept your request and create account for you. It was great experience even though I sucked dick really bad back then and went only up to 28 lvl as Hunter. I fell in love with Rogue afterwards. I tried Priest in Cata and Shaman in Mists of Pandaria as well but the only class I can play and never get bored of is Vanilla/TBC Rogue.

From my pserver experience yea. Most pug tanks will suck. Will you be able to get through the dungeon? Yea of course. Will it always be a seamless smooth process with no hiccups? Hell no. Especially once you get geared and you have to start holding damage for threat it can become frustrating dealing with noobs tanks. This is why it is so important to find a good guild and make friends in vanilla.
---
If you get a raiding guild as a lock you will gear up pretty fast.
---
As an example raided till Sapphiron in Naxx during Vanilla and we had a lock, A SINGLE LOCK since  BWL days, he alwasy get all the loot due to being the only lock. He was there mostly for summons or healthstones.
---
This is more of a PVE saying, but it does slightly apply in pvp too. A well played hunter will remain very strong in pvp even at the top gear levels. However, they are stronger towards the beginning of a servers lifespan when you opposing players have lower life pools. Hunter pvp is extremely fun and worth playing one for if you are interested in it. Just make sure your guild likes you as they have to bring a couple hunters to raids for tranq shot anyway, and reap the benefits in PvP :)

Pet resource for abilities is Focus (same as energy for rogue and cat drood) but it's well know that on nearly all Pserver the regeneration of pet's focus is badly scripted and thus increased compared to blizzard's vanilla wow
---
In my experience, there's no such thing as good and bad tanks in vanilla. All tanks are bad. They can barely hold aggro on 2-3 targets, so they rely on the group to manage the threat as a whole. By focusing one mob at a time and using CC, for example. 
---
There's good groups and bad groups, but all tanks are bad. Tanks are bad by design, I'm not saying that the players are necessarily bad, but the threat generation tools are too underwhelming to leave threat management in the hands of one person. 
---
People on pservers cheese the fuck out of tanking mechanics just to avoid the threat issues, too. Like, dual wielding to generate enough single target threat for your dps to be able to go all out.

I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
You can, you go to the Pet Trainer and he can untrain your pets traning points
---
I'm in a similar boat as you. I absolutely love tanking, but between my full time job, part time school, and spending time with my wife, I don't think that I will have enough time to dedicate to being a decent tank. I'll probably end up playing a rogue or resto druid because I enjoy those as well but they won't require as much time investment to still contribute to the raid.

And weapon skill for melee is broken

Rogue T1 has some decent pieces.

---
Leveling dungeons in vanilla are really, really easy compared to say tanking m+ dungeons in bfa (I play both).
---
That being said, the really casual playerbase in bfa struggles with those. But thats part of the experience, befriend the good ones and run with them.
---
Mining + herb on a rogue made me a ton of gold.  Doing rounds around winterspring for thorium and any herbs I saw (to include a pretty good count of black lotuses) was super easy with stealth/sap.

Modern macros is the opposite of a QoL change. Modern macros don't allow you to do things as complex as the old macros. Being able to make a "if x then y" macro means that you can basically turn playing your character into one button.

---
Well your pet abilities need Focus to be cast so slower focus regen means less damage from your pet.
---
It's more noticeable during the leveling cuz you want to spec beast for that and your pet will do significantly less damage on mob with high hp (low/average hp mob die pretty quickly to a leveling hunter so the regen is not very an issue).
---
Does it affect pvp? Yes, your pet does less damage.
---
Is it significant in pvp? Not really, against good player your pet will be most of the time out of touch and most of your dps doesn't come from the pet.
---
Are hunters as good as mages at pvp/1v1 do u know? 
---
Mages can easily AOE farm with the correct build, and if the tanks suck you will still be a killing machine while questing. If you want to do every single dungeon then I would go a tanking class. I’ve run into tanks who have no idea what is going on, and it sucks when it happens. Bottom line if you want to do every dungeon I would go tank class, but if you just want to have a god complex, you could play a mage and AOE farm like Sylvanas at the Wrathgate.
---
yeah.. Everything from bfa tanking being difficult (at least m+ and raid), to stuff like older playerbase (lots of people where kids who had no idea what they where doing back then), less disconnects and/or fps/computer trouble and there will be guides and streams everywhere.

My friend ran some macro program to farm the grubs I think? in EPL for their ichor/elixir whatever drops.  If a GM pm'ed him at any time (from people reporting him), the cheat would instantly DC him.  He did it for about a month, had a handful of GMs that messaged him once he got on after school before he stopped.  At that point he made enough money to where he maxed out gold on his main + 2 alts.  Grinding was definitely an easy way to go...  
---
Then my account was hacked in late BC when I didn't buy WotLK for a while and I found my warlock in full farm spec/gear with a ton of gold when I got it back.  
---
Gold farming was for sure common and I saw far more suspect players (with how they moved to/from places, etc) than heard stories of people getting hacked and having gold stolen..

---
Use it for what?
---
yeah, if anything. While the rewards are a joke (someone doing literally free content can get the same gear), the challenge is real... Just check out the description of how to beat Siege of Boralus this week:
---
" This dungeon is an exercise in risk and reward this week. To beat the timer, our Expert route is built around an ambitious strategy of Bolstering an [Ashvane Spotter](https://wowhead.com/npc=138255) to mythic proportions, and then using that Spotter to one-shot almost all the enemies in the area. The route skips much of the trash in the first half of the dungeon, jumps ahead to a Spotter, then returns to clear out [Bilge Rats](https://wowhead.com/npc=129366) with it. The Spotter is then kept alive through to the final boss, where it’s used to one-shot all of the Tentacles during the fight - this is tricky because a misplaced shot can kill the friendly engineer before it gets the chance to repair the cannon, an error which will force the fight to be reset.   
---
The other challenges with this strategy come from Explosive orbs, which will continue to spawn from the Spotter and other enemies and which are not damaged by her artillery, and from the enemies which aren’t damaged by it, such as [Ashvane Commanders](https://wowhead.com/npc=128969). Our plan for the final Ashvane Commanders of the dungeon is as follows: pull all of the enemies in the room, then [Mass Entangle](https://wowhead.com/spell=102359) the pack, which will not affect the Commanders, who can then be separated from their friends to prevent Bolstering and Explosive problems. This strategy saves a bunch of time but it is very challenging to execute and is only recommended if you are trying to defeat a keystone at a level where the timer is too tight for more cautious pulls. "

There will be too many people who wants to tank in 40 man raids (mostly because you literally only need 2 in 40 to be prot), and to few people to tank dungeons.It was like that back in vanilla, it is the current situation on p-servers and highly likely to become the situation in dungeons. 
---
GRATZ!
---
What do you morons not understand about the fact they aren’t changing anything.
---
Human Warrior, but I notices pretty quickly that this wasn't for me. When I started I had no idea about wow lore and was just a big lord of the rings freak and thought aragorn was the coolest dude. So Human Warrior it is. By now Warrior is probably one of the least interesting classes for me.

The problem is if they don’t shard and millions quit early we will have no community and the game will die early.

My classic warlock was Cigolx... Cool name right? Atleast 14year old. Me thought so...

It's Xlogic backwards. They were my speakers at the time.

&gt; Mages and priests get more critical per agility point than hunters do. A lot more. No real explanation why of course.
---
Hunters get 2 AP per agility, that's why.
---
I dunno how I forgot that lol, I almost never played warlock. 
---
Though TBH it's only really a mechanic used in MC, MAYBE you have to banish once on goblin packs in BWL, but after that IIRC you don't have to. I'll edit and add it, thank you !
---
i will be so fast when servers go live. just to make sure i get my name :P
---
I am tearing my hair out in frustration for WoW to come out, which leads me to make this post just to scratch the itch. 
---
So in my situation I will be levelling with two friends, the most likely classes they are going to play are feral druid and priest. This means we will have a tank and healer for most of the content, leaving me with DPS. 
---
I feel like Mage has way higher utility for levelling, water/food is great, portals can speed up travel and since we plan to hit literally ever dungeon, poly is invaluable. The cons of Mage are that there will be more of them than Warlocks, especially since we plan on going Alliance. Also their end game seems a little mechanically boring and I am worried about the chances of getting a raid spot. The other thing is I am a little bit of a hipster when it comes to classes, and it just feels worse to be one of many, rather than a rarer class.
---
On the other side Warlock does offer summoning portals and healthstone; plus an off-tank if we ever need it. I have managed to do any end game content in vanilla so I would be learning all the raids once I get there. Our play time is limited by work, so there is no need to speed to 60, but I will eventually want to raid.
---
Are there any factors that I am missing, or any advice that can be offer?
---
This explains nothing. All physical dps classes get 2ap from str/agi. And they get much better critical also. The decision on hunter made literally no sense.
---
If you level somewhat fast you will be in a group of players that play a fair bit and typically know what they are doing.
---
I remember people trolling the raid lead by saying "zoh my god" (zomg) after he said something obvious in vent. resulting in an angry RL :)
---
No?
---
Warriors don't get AP from agi, rogues get 1 ap from str or agi, and druids get 2 for str and 1 for agi. 
---
Hunters scales amazingly on agility.
---
Hunters are very strong in pvp even late. They have really good burst, the problem is sustained dps especially because pets don't scale with gear.
---
If you don't farm pummeler then do the feral druids out there a favor by not rolling one. It's absolutely mandatory, sorry.
---
Really hope so, I didn't buy on Kickstarter because 30+ USD worth of overseas shipping fee for a book is a rip off

The whole reason there is such big debate about WotF is this. People pick either BG’s or wPvP as their viewpoint and argue from that.
---
In BG’s paladins and dwarf priests are a bigger threat. Lower CD and paladin cleanse also cleansing DoTs.
---
In wPvP it is a different matter. You are not locked into a small instance so encounters are further apart giving time for the CD IF WotF to reset. Furthermore you don’t have any objective so people can just choose to run away until WotF is ready again. Most encounters in wPvP wont have a paladin or dwarf priest with them either, unlike BG’s where there is a much bigger chance to encounter them. Should be noted that the problem is smaller in random than vs a premade which always have paladins and / or dwarf priests.
---
It depends on what type of PvP you want to do. Vanilla is famous for wPvP, so choosing a faction specifically to not get frustrated with UD is totally valid.
---
To be fair, as a mage standing in IF making portals you can easily get the gold for buying your mount though. Saves up on grinding time to offset the sitting down time drinking again.
---
In Vanilla, as opposite to ALL other expansions, the success of a smooth 5 men dungeon run is less dependable on tanks. The Vanilla tank does not (and should not) tank more than 3 targets at a time, because of the strains put on the healer. Vanilla dungeons are CC heavy, and everyone have almost an equal role in the success of the run.
---
Yes, the tanks are the most important, but not as important as they were in TBC and after. The AoE tanking capabilities are limited, and while Paladins can, in theory, AoE tank...they don't do it unless they are outgearing the content or the healer is outgearing the content. 
---
A Vanilla tank should NEVER tank all mobs. EVER. he should only tank the hardest hitting mobs. If there is not enough CC, or a CC breaks for whatever reason, and the tanks is already tanking 3 targets, the one that is lose should never be tanked. The DPS will take care of it.
---
Kiting is very important in Vanilla, and any rogue, hunter, mage, warrior (dps), warlock (with Void), shaman (EB totem) can easily do it and SHOULD do it, on every lose mob.
---
Even without kitting, any class can "tank" a non-elite or a weak elite mob in 5 men dungeons long enough for the tank to pick it up once one of it's tanked targets is dead.
---
In other words, since AoE tanking is basically non-existent in Vanilla, the tanking role, while important, is not as important as it was after Vanilla. Every single member of the party are almost as important.
---
&gt;  Will vanilla launch with maybe the worst tanks being weeded out in DM and WC, and the rest will be filled with mostly competent people? 
---
No. Due to talent system in Vanilla, up until lvl 30-ish, tanks are limited in what they can do and can't do. The weeding out will start around lvl 40-45, when most tanks (and especially Warriors) have the proper kit to handle 5-men tanking. I would say that the best dungeons to see if the tanks are good or bad is Sunken Temple.
---
Sunken Temple is the first place that will clearly show if a tank KNOWS his shit.
---
However, a lot of tanks that don't have Vanilla (or TBC) experience, and will start tanking in Classic, will probably stop tanking around lvl 30. Only a small part of them will be able to cope with the VERY DIFFERENT style of running a dungeon.
---
Best tanks will be those that are playing, or played, on private servers. I started a new Warrior, just days ago, on a private server, and my first dungeon run was WC and second one BFD. Both runs were "by the book", but not exclusively because of my tanking experience since Vanilla and on private servers today, but because ALL members of the party knew their shit.
---
We didn't marked anything, we over pulled...but everyone in party was proven to know his class AND what other classes are capable of.
---
Thing is, when Classic hits, 90% of the player base will be from OUTSIDE private servers, and their gaming mentality (gogogo, Vanilla is easy peasy and tanks are first to blame) will be a spectacle.
---
So, there you have it.
---
There will plenty of bad tanks, and they will be weeded out starting with ST. Expect plenty of shit 5 men runs (because of inexperienced players, tanks included, but not only because of them) until lvl 50 dungeons.
---
Yes, the Vanilla dungeons are EASY...if everyone knows what to do. Which is linked to experience. A private server player who played Vanilla for years, will obviously be far more experienced (hence, BETTER) at tackling the content.
---
But since 90% of the players will be coming from outside private servers...
---
It depends on two factors : gear &amp; skill.
---
At lower gear hunter will be better than mage, mid gear mage are better and late-game gear my opinion is that hunter are better but at this point it really come down to skill.
---
Given they both have engineering, I'd prefer to play a hunter in a pvp scenario.
---
Mage are good cuz they can do a lot of damage but they are squishy while hunter have mail gear and more constant damage with instant cast and pet.
---
IMO hunter is the best pvp class if you're skilled enough to avoid taking damage from your opponent. 
---
It's hard to go back though, people want to win and they're are so many easy resources to look at.
---
With good leadership a casual guild will clear a lot of raid content of they are just persistent.
---
And I'm all for being an inclusive guild that allows different specs just to make it a little bit harder when you are finishing the first 2 tiers in 3 hours or less. That kinda why pservers were fun in the end, players were just kinda like, "whatever, we got a body, just don't wipe us"
---
Yeah, this will happen most of the time.
---
Followed by a quitting Classic.
---
Thank god they will do after first Wailling Caverns run :)
---
How about waiting for Classic to release, then logging a ticket and asking a GM?
---
That is route for top 0.5%/competitive and has nothing to do with SoB difficulty. Doing M+ at average difficulty (for max chest or little above) requires very little (just know your spec well and do mechanics) and many people still fail to do that. Doing deadmines in a good pace without deaths would be a lot harder than doing the same in relatively lower key M+.
---

---
Sound good until you lose all the rolls 3 months in a row to someone who raids once a month while you are there for every raid.
---
Wound poison reduced a flat amount of healing iirc in vanilla, so it's pretty much garbage, it's not a % like it was in TBC and onwards.
---
Uh, no. Rogues/Druids get 1 AP/agi, thus higher crit. Strength classes get no "free" crit at all, thus 2 AP per strength. It makes perfect sense.
---
It was later changed(In TBC maybe)? so Hunters got 1 AP/agi but increased crit per agility.
---
I highly recomend that you aquire the Traveler book series. It's childrens book, but hot damn do I love the stories in both books! =) The story follow a young man and his first journey outside Lakeshire. It rewards the feeling of awe, and does a great job exploring the world seen through curious eyes. Just like we did in 2004 and beyond
---
Remembered this [comic](https://i.imgur.com/B7ZPRx4.jpg)
---
Well it's true but there is a really small chance to happen. And if this happen, you can blame yourself for bad luck ! Or, in the end, noone will want the item you want and you will finaly have it. Right ?
---
In leveling dungeons druids can be good tank too. Ah, even voidwalker can be good tank. But at 60, warrior - the best
---
Nice one! Where did you get it?

Cause it's not in this interview or video.

So, in your oppinion, what's the worst class/spec for solo world PvP?
---
Guldamn
---
I think people at disadvantage would still win the rolls a lot more often and leave the player with advantage feeling salty. 
---
I am curious to where you could sell this kind of cards. I have a Netherwing rocket from BC and that might be worth some money. 
---
&lt;Playable Pandaren&gt;
---
😂👍
---
...but not on anything else. If it made sense for the hunter to get gimped on agi, they wouldn't be the laughingstock of dps classes now would they?
---
But by statistic, they cannot win more often ? With the DKP it's the opposit, hardcore raider will loot everything compare to another hardcore gamer but with less point arrvied recently in the guild.
---
Rogues, druids, warrs, paladins, they all have a way of getting ap elsewhere. A hunter does not.
---
yes but what's the point of leveling a mage quickly to 60 if there are no tanks at 60? spend an hour in lfg looking for tank?
---
It was ment as an example off complexity good bfa players are used to. Of course you can run a 10 as long as you have a good rotation, don't stand in fire and use interrupts .
---
To be honest, if you want to time anything that's a 15 SOB or higher you pretty much have to abuse spotters,  witch is closer to what top 5% of players (CE raiders) do... Not 0.5%.
---
Where can I get one of these? I live in Europe and can't find it on Amazon
---
there's a difference? /s

&gt; Where do you even store 40,000 STACKS of linen bandages??
---
Storing that many stacks is not as difficult as you think it is. Each character, with 16 slot bags, in both their inventory and (maxed-out) bank, can hold around 2000 stacks of bandages. That means you would only need around 20-25 people participating in this to instantly complete that requirement. This is just under *half* of one raiding roster.
---
It only became a baseline spell in 1.11 iirc. Before that it was the 31 talent of the resto tree.
---
Well in a large sample size yes it makes sense that a lot of the time it would work. In raids there are usually only a handful of BIG drops that people will fight over. So if person rolls low on their bonereavers edge and loses it to someone who under-performs and barely shows up it will cause some drama. In classic there will always be drama. Maybe I am wrong, but I'm fairly sure raiders would argue against it after this happened once to them.
---
As a human, you will go for equipment that gives you more than 264 spirit. For even darkmoon card to be bis you need mote than 300 spirit. Any spirit no matter how small, will still be better than fear ward for any boss fights except the 4 that has the fear mechanism.

Mage every time.  
---
Have you considered a hybrid?  A shaman/pally (faction depending) will cover you for dps, and let you fill gaps when one of your buddies has other commitments. Or just when one of them needs a break from their "role".
---
Where exactly does Warriors and Paladins get this "extra" AP from?
---
Rogues and Druids can get a couple extra AP from errant strength, which adds up to about 5 DPS.
---
I still can't decide on warrior, paladin, or druid. Horde or alliance. Normal or pvp realm. Herb/alchemy or mining/eng.
---
I want to be able to tank dungeons while trying to be realistic on the raiding with the gear and consumables, because I hate farming. 
---
Alliance will be Human or Nelf (for druid) 
---
Horde will be Orc or Tauren (for druid)
---
As a Human I would be a lot more interested in the lore behind the gear I collect and theorycrafting. Horde will be a braindead "gimme dat upgrade."
---
And I kind just feel like I'll be at a disadvantage on a  PvP realm since I don't see my friends playing as much. And I never have been the type to go out of my way to wpvp. Though I've always had fantasies about being in stealth groups with rogues.
---
And the professions are pretty much PvP or PvE stuff. Until I get an alt to switch stuff up or have farmers.
---
I'm in  NA and will possibly have the chance to nolife the launch.
---
And I'm kinda waiting for a friend to make up his mind. He either wants to be an Orc shaman or Human warrior/paladin and I'm pretty sure he's leaning towards a pvp realm where we have always played. He's a bit more aggressive in the pvp scene 
---
The struggle is real.
---
Probably because some other hunter (a good one) was doing the stuff you should be doing.

I can guarantee most tanks are going to be bad. There is a lot of players that used to play warriors as kids (because it was the most straight forward class design back then) and they will absolutely suck. It is a case in all private servers as well. Having a noob DPS doesnt hurt as much as having a noob tank.
---
I think this is a very clever idea for a loot system. While I always played on the side of the long-time, high DKP players I recognized that it must feel awful joining a guild as a newer player and looking at the accrued DKP in the guild to realize that they are basically not going to get loot for some time. Your system gives people hope, which I think would both encourage newer players and might also encourage higher-DKP players to bid more often instead of hoarding DKP, since they no longer have any guarantees. 
---
The one modification I'd want would be added "-(100*X)/18)" to recent winners with fewer than 9 points. By this I mean that your 5 points player in the above example would have between 1 and 23 chance if they'd recently won loot. This would add some protection to the core members, as a particular less active player would have very low odds of snagging consecutive pieces of loot with extreme luck. 
---
Ignore leveling dungeons and pick what you want to play at 60. A lot of retail tanks will suck because all they know is pull multiple packs and AoE, but that's if you're unlucky and even then leveling and especially dungeons while leveling is a very small part of your time compared to end game, so you should pick based on end game only in my opinion. 
---

---
Warrs/paladins can get 2 ap from str and 1 crit per 20 agi.
---
Hunters get 2 ap from agi and 1 crit per 58 agi.
---
Hunters are in a disadvantage compared to other physical dps classes. The change was done so that hunters don't just stack on agi ad infinitum, but they were not compensated in any other stat instead.
---
I should've said it sucks in my opinion,because I personally would like to play on streamer servers because I know that the server would never die.
---
This is the first time I've seen that cover design look nice. It looks great on a bookshelf next to other large hardcovers. I guess context is everything.

---
Prolly not the right sub no. However, there is a MTG mmo in the works by Cryptic Studios. There is no information really on it beyond that the project exists. 
---
Few warriors want to *only* tank, so it's not an issue. In the case where you have too many tanks you just have them go dps instead. Which is the role most warriors prefer either way. 
---
My friend wrote her PHD paper on naming practices in games like WoW if anyone is interested:
---
[https://artifex.org/\~bonnie/Crenshaw\_Nardi\_names.pdf](https://artifex.org/~bonnie/Crenshaw_Nardi_names.pdf)
---
Only warriors see the difference
---
Having STR on an item means it has less AGI, it's not just free stats.
---
&gt; but they were not compensated in any other stat instead.
---
They were compensated with higher crit from agility. The change was made to make them similar in itemization to Rogues.
---
you should play what you want to play, not "what the server needs". also, if you don't play a tank yourself, just group up with warriors/druids that you trust. besides, tanking in 5mans is not that hard. even the lvl 60 dungeons can be tanked by DPs warrs with a shield on (as long as DPS respect threat)
---
You are playing it wrong in this case. Yes it is hard, but not as hard as people tend to interpret it
---
For really rare item like ZG mount or legendary item, I stated to use a more traditionnal system like loot councill to decide who get it. For other item, if you happen to have bad luck, well then lose it, you'll get it next time if you attend often (by statistic again).
---
Even if someone get an item with very big luck, well anyone can be like he is a god of luck and laugh of it instead of drama (I might be a bit optimistic :) )
---
Probably prot tank, prot pally, resto druid, Resto shaman
---
You got it backwards.
---
If you got a bad dps that think they are hot shut it won't matter how good the tank is because it is mathematically impossible to tank well if the dps players don't let you.
---
Tanking on low levels is actually very easy because shouts generate a lot of threat early on. Every dps attacking another target, generally too early, or constantly using aoe however...
---
Which human were you? IIRC there were humans, short humans, shorter humans, and tall sickly-looking hippie humans.
---
Resto Druid and Resto shaman can hold their own pretty well with kiting and not so bad damage.
---
Prot Pally also has some pretty good skills (like reckoning). Prot Warrior? Maybe yeah
---
Is cutting edge really 5%? But anyway, I believe core/majority group of players (not casual, but nor super hardcore also - regular raiders) do not push M+ to that level and instead play below it, so that example does not really work.
---
You can easily check CE (but not fast CE) guilds on rio and see that majority of people are not pushing 15+
---
SM/ruin is nice for tank group, due to fire shield (just a little perk) and stamina bonus of the passive imp you can leave there (due to phase shift) , unlike a DS lock.

I am not really worried. If in 2 weeks my server goes low pop, I reroll on a high pop one.

Just do a GKP system - auction all loot. Even if you dont get the loot, at least you get some gold. Nothing worse than doing a hard nights raiding only to end up with nothing - particularly if your piece dropped but you didnt have enough points for it, then realise how much your consumables and repairs cost. Good way of keeping geared people coming back and making sure people stay til the end of the raid. Does a good job at sharing some prosperity, no work on maintaining some point system or seeing everyone forego upgrades coz they dont want to "waste" their points. No drama over the ins an outs of loot points or kill point decay. 
---
I'm Currently debating warlock vs warrior myself, Warlock got tons of value aswell. and also alot of fun in PvP! 1v1 it might be the best dueling class in classic, Healthstone for the party, summon, debuffs to increase others dps, Fear (instead of sheeping you can fear and dot up the the target for extra dps/without breaking the fear) and ofcourse the big value of having a warlock on MC to banish on Garr.
---
Tbh, in pre \~L60 instances the tank just needs to keep most of the mobs for reasonable time on him. And make sure they dont attack the healer. Anything beyond that is on the DPS'es themselves. You cannot tank the mobs if mage just aoes. You cannot tank all adds if someone does mass cleave damage. 
---
The thing is, then the dps will just "handle it". Either face tank the mob they pulled, CC etc.
---
But to the op, i dont think the tanks will be bad in classic, i think the DPS'es will be the full retard ones. No cc, just looking at dps meters. They will make tank AND healers life a hell.

That's more due to their abilities than their scaling from gear. Hunters essentially use 2handers with their slow bows, they cap at 9% hit and can't ues weaponskill. Even though this seems nice since you can easily achieve hitcap and such, the math just works out to scale worse. Hunters even have amazing tier gear to help them, and they get way way more AP than any other class, but their abilities and math just doesn't add up to the craziness of a geared rogue or warrior. Another big factor is of course their pets. They do base damage so it does not change from fresh 60's to full naxx geared. Hunters damage is weakend to balance around having pets, but pets don't benefit you much in the raiding environment especially not in aq/naxx.
---
Depends on the guild, hc guilds might require PoM. But yeah ice barrier helps outside of the raids
---
LEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY MMJEEEEEEEEEENNNNNKIIIIIIIIIIINNNSSSSS
---
&gt;yes but what's the point of leveling a mage quickly to 60 if there are no tanks at 60?
---
Gather lotuses, arcane crystals when there is very low competition. Grind gold and buy off materials you know will raise in price off AH from other classes that DONT have that kind of gold. 
---
It will set you up for a LONG time. 
---
It was a bug? I always thought it was it was a RP thing, it would make sense if someone came up and bopped you while you were chilling ündefended it would be a critical hit. 
---
The nice thing about Druids, though, is that there usually aren't that many rolled, so it kind of balances out.
---
Some blizzard employee said that TCG codes are only for the retail game, i.e bfa. 
---
You mean the lowest crit per agility?
---
Inb4 sub only guilds. To apply link ur donation
---
2 tanks? Sure, AFTER overgearing the content.
---
Progressing guilds will use 3-4 tanks. Once ZG is out, every guild will have 4 tanks, you know, 2x20 men ZG runs.
---
BWL progress is 3-4 tanks.
---
Also, one VERY IMPORTANT thing to consider for Classic: Main Tanking is a stressful job, and plenty of Main Tanks aren't running previous raids, letting guild OT's to MT previous raids. Many MT's are burning out, and they will have to be replaced by OT's.
---
A guild that doesn't have AT LEAST 5 tanks, and make ALL of them a priority in gearing, is a guild that probably won't make it to AQ40.
---
If your guild's MT is poached by another guild, you must have a replacement, instantly. And that replacement is an OT, but if that OT is not geared, your guild will suffer.
---
Actually, there won't be TOO MANY TANKS, there will be LESS than needed.
---
What? After it was changed to 1 AP/agi, they had the same crit/agi as Rogues.
---
Systems in general are always exploitable. The reality is that what matters far more is having a culture of trust in your guild, where people know that loot is being allocated fairly, also that raids are fun to do either way. Focusing on making the perfect system is fun at an academic level but you need to consider the human element. If raids are fun and the officers of the guild have a good reputation among the raiders, then even with LC the loot will worm itself out.

Except EvE is a totally different MMO. Also, there are no lvls in EvE.

Honestly it's not that bad, as long as you know what you're doing.

I think it depends on what you're trying to do. Paladin leveling is cheese, it's just stupidly slow. Shaman leveling can be fast if you feel like drinking after every two mobs.

Generally yes I'd say so.

As much as things change to keep people around I truly believe the game industry can look at this like a phase and go back to its roots of making good games if given enough vocal people remind the player base they are getting had. This might be wishful thinking as cash shop, no matter what game they are in seem to rake in billions... it might just be human nature to take the path of least resistance for most. In which case good games have died and they are NEVER coming back. 
---
nah, I don't really enjoy tanking.....I was a healer in retail and am focused on raiding now.

Haven't respecced away from feral yet though

Who cares if alliance is better, just makes horde accomplishments more rewarding
---
I would say PVP wise, rogues do well at nearly every experience level for pvp, you really get out of what you put into them. At lower gear/exp you can easily pick your fights and make sure you win, at higher skill caps you can be extremely evasive and make peoples lives a literal hell of stuns, then extremely high skill levels you have at least a 50/50 shot of winning a 1v1 against just about every class in the game.
---
It's mostly about picking fights against people your skill level in the early days though, that rank 14 guy who has been playing vanilla for 14 years is gonna know just about every common rogue strat instinctively. You aren't gonna kill him with a standard stun rotation/restealth. Thats when the mindgames come in, reflector shields, peasant callers etc.
---
But for every pvp master like the above guy, your gonna have a dozen other characters that someones little brother picked, and your gonna make them hate the game, OMG rogues so unfair.
---
Or just take private loot from retail.
---
This actually happened to me. I was making a gnome mage and I couldn’t think of a name for the life of me. I looked around the room and saw a bottle of vitamin c sitting there, added freez onto it because frost mage and ended up with Vitaminfreez (character limit)
---
Easier to find guilds and raid spots as a mage unless you know people. But if your end goal is just a character to play around with in dungeons, I'd say play tank because it is much quicker to fill a group when you already have a tank. Mage, from what I hear boring to level, while warrior is difficult.
---
Looks cool
---
So sad but so true...
---
It sounds like a Chantix-like product
---
Tanking in Vanilla DUNGEONS is not the hard thing, and as a Vanilla healer, it's fairly easy to work around a bad tank. In fact I'd rather have a top notch DPS crew than a top tank. Also it's a bit boring running dungeons with a TF geared tank tbh :P
---
Tank is really different in raids when compared to later expansions, mostly due to taunting bosses just not really being a thing. Mitigation was actually less of a thing back then, most of that came from clever gearing. My good IRL mate who played warrior made our Patch kill insanely easier, but that was because he worked out better gearing strategy, not because he pressed his buttons better.
---
The skills of vanilla tanks aren't harder, they're different, and those differences don't come out so much in dungeons.
---
I've got two names that nobody has ever used besides me for over a decade. :D
---
Of course, I won't say what those names are so others don't steal them from me...
---
¿Goblins?
---
&gt;there are no lvls in EvE.
---
Sure, but there is general progress measures, like getting several usable alt, a decent killboard and a vouch into a corporation that isn't shit or a big catchall blob like goons or horde. Somewhere on the road you will meet harder trials than leveling a warrior to 60 in vanilla.

Plenty of tanks fail in low dungeons but it's because vanilla tanking is more difficult than other iterations of wow. I talked in actual vanilla but did it as arms most people don't get how to tab sunder. But I feel with it now having plenty of years on private servers most of your warriors are going to be a little more veteran. So you're probably fine. Also play what you want to play for late game not based on low level stuff is going to be more difficult sometimes even an easy dungeon can be hard but that's what makes it fun.

Weren't these added in tbc? In vanilla if anything it was like only 3 items.

---
I was a tank on Nostalrius. There will be times when you are fully geared, waiting for the next raid, bored. You will think about PvP, but you just can't do it, because of the lack of dual spec. So tanking is probably the most fun in Vanilla, but you miss out on PvP. So I'm rolling Mage on Classic, that can do both, however the PvE is boring with it.
---
Just adding lol to the end of your name when it already was taken
---
Look again, it's absolutely shocking
---
Well, technically only 4% are CE at this tier given how Ghuun was stupidly overturned until they nerfed the boils mid season, and last week they nerfed his HP again so a lot of "CE guilds" are still stuck at 7/8M will probably make it this week.. so the number might go up. 
---
\&gt; even at that level, are not pushing 15+
---
yes, because some don't enjoy that type of content so they run a weekly +10 and do high lvl PvP or just play a different game in-between raids. Anyone at CE who enjoys M+ push 15's.
---
If you can't no life don't go fury warrior they require the most time. You need so much for preraid bis a tanking set and then after that the incredible amounts of consumes for the week of raiding. For casual play choose a warlock. They are always needed in raids because there aren't enough of them or if you want to heal choose a druid because they are a dime a dozen. 
---
I all depends on how controlled your pulling is. LoS can bring all those casters to you and many tanks don’t fucking do this. Honestly, doing that and your group ccing mobs, it’s not very difficult.

Quite undecided. I'm someone who started WoW during tbc (around BT release), stayed until early Cata (left when they nerfed heroics to the mindless wotlk-like level). 
---
My most played picks were: Druid (diehard feral (cat AND bear), even if I spent more as resto due to guild conveniences - *phew*, loathed it- ), shaman (split between ele and enh - enh during wotlk mainly due to MW-, resto was a nuisance I tried to avoid) and pally (tbc shocka exclusively). 
---
As you see, pure hybrid focus. I look for a similar approach, but PvE-wise feels healing is the only choice (and, bluntly, I'm quite unwilling to roll druid or shaman due to it) so gearing will be a struggle for a PvP non-healing approach of any of them.
---
Atm I'm looking for a similar hybrid feel. I'm open to occasional healing (I just refuse to be doing it full-time when grouping, be it PvP or PvE). I lean towards PvP side, but I don't neglect the PvE side. 
---
Class-wise I've tried many up to lvl 30 or so. This has made me keep 3 out: shaman (resto is a no-no, PvP is mostly ele as an offhealer-support with burst, not engaging. Also willing to jump the alliance side... ), mage (just not my cup of tea, too squishy) and priest (only non-healer is shadow, which I don't mind...).
---
Overall I'm leaning towards either pally (yes, blame me, another retlol, lolprot... but it's the one which feels closer to my style) or hunter (their endgame feels more reliable due to being dps-only, but my tests were a bit tasteless, but I presume PvP without scatter and most PVP tricks is likely to feel this way, it must be better around max level). 
---
Any advice? I'm open to suggestions, though, on any other class. 
---
&gt;For the first few months you should put 60-80 if you ask me
---
I just hit 60 on a private server not to long again on my warrior, in the first week i logged 3 days played.  By the end of the second week I had 7 days played. I was pretty close to Pre-raid BiS by the thrid week. I person dont think this was a lot of play time too, and I could have easily done more.

For tanking Warden's Staff is BiS until life halfway through AQ40 iirc. For DPS the vid shows Shedo doing \~1000dps with full buffs.
---
I think about playing shadowpriest. I dont remrmber / know how good they were for leveling and thd very very later endgame content. I think they will be good enough healers while leveling and turn into interesting dd st 60. Any opinions?
---
Better late than never, the game's been in decline since Wrath. I quit just before Cataclysm launched most of the community I was apart of just vanished after 3 months. The biggest EU RP server became a literal ghost town.
---
It's been some time... are you ok? Your face looks like it's on the verge of frostbite

Old system. Bonus rolls were one of the earliest systems in Vanilla and slowly faded away. They are still used in PUG private server groups. They will give bonus rolls to tanks, people with douses etc etc etc. Not a great system and has been done before.
---
Name, definitely name.
---
I think thats a great system. Doesn't allow tenured players to horde points, gives newer players a chance. Rewards players based on contribution. In the end, law of large numbers should distribute loot pretty fairly, there will be some outliers but it works itself out in the long run. 
---
So I’ve been pretty conflicted, very torn between 3 hybrid classes because I like healing.   
---
   
---
 
---
I have always mained priest in BC, Wrath &amp; Legion. So about 4-5 years of experience with priests and I love them to death.   
---
My buddy who I plan duo-leveling with (who may be inconsistent) is playing a warrior, he wants to go horde. I’ve always mained alliance, So I am gonna miss that.  
---
As for classes and specs I love I wanted to either go:
---
Troll Priest, tri-spec, disc build, holy late game. (dwarf if ally)
---
Druid tauren or NE (alt w/ my GF most likely). Feral early game, tank dungeons and offtank/dps MC especially if itemization is broken.
---
Troll resto shaman. For the most part 30/0/21 spec unless guild asks me to go mana tide, which I will.
---
History:
---
I have played all of these classes before. I mained priest in raids and casual pvp a lot. For druid I went feral twink at 19, 29, &amp; 60 in wrath, SUPER FUN, I love feral druids although it was BC talents. For Shamans I leveled a ENH shaman to 80 in wrath and found them very fun for enhance w/ wrath talents.  
---
Now here are my Pros &amp; Cons:
---
Priests: 
---
Pros:
---
Love playing them, used to them. Love healing.  
---
Love the talent trees, So many ways to pick your talents.  
---
Dwarf and Troll racials, shadowguard blackout procs.  
---
Mind control is so unique.  
---
Easy raid spot.  
---
* Variety of healing spells.  
---
Cons:
---
Can’t dps or tank if I wanted to.  
---
Same class I am used to, even though I love it. No flavor change.   
---
Could be a lot of priests on RP-PVP server.  
---
Rogues/melee gimping me all the time. (blackout + shadowguard will help).   
---
* Prayer of healing  heals only in group.  
---
    
---
Druids:
---
Versatile as any spec.  
---
I love tanking and feral dps, Want to prove I can make it work (dungeons &amp; MC, Early game).   
---
Love Druid HoTs, would turn to healing after MC/BWL maybe.   
---
Stealth runs, can choose pvp.  
---
Not as valuable in raids, need to earn my spot. (especially on horde).  
---
Farming consumes and pummelers as feral.  
---
No consistent rez.  
---
moonkin sux
---
Overcoming stigma/prejudice.   
---
Shamans:
---
Chain heal and Chain Lightning are satisfying.  
---
I love buffing, not crazy about the timers on everything, fun utility.    
---
Super valuable in raids, can be up to 20% of a raid, 8 shamans. Easy spots.   
---
Fire totem aoe pulls with warrior duo level.   
---
reincarnate.  
---
* Chain heal heals outside of group.  
---
Ghost wolf not instant cast.  
---
Limited healing spells.  
---
So many totems.  
---
Limited talent tree differentiation.  
---
* I'm bad with shamans at pvp.  
---
Basically what is your opinion on the matter for classic. Druid seems to be my first pick if I were alliance. Priest abilities and healing spells are awesome no matter faction, also always needed. Shamans just sound so damn useful for raids but I don’t know how crazy I am about the play style however I am intrigued by the class.
---
I can't wait to get my copy, also you seem to be missing volume 3 of the WoW Chronicle.
---
I typically tank dungeons as a hunter... Works just fine for me and my friends from 1-50ish. First dungeon I struggle with is Sunken Temple.
---
It's one of the reasons I'm thinking about playing a 1/29/21 Druid and tank 5-man, heal raids and PVP
---
It wouldnt matter if 90% of the server rolled warrior, only about 10% of the server would want to tank and only about 1% of the ones that want to would be any good at it.
---
i have a mirror in the right, I call it dissapointment
---
MCP is better than Atiesh for feral DPS :/
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3_FkK_Fsfk&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Sad that BfA is dead and noone is almost playing it anymore ;( like they used to.
---
&gt; Because they can heal a single target with incredible mana efficiency, and Holy Light is the highest HPS single-target heal in the game. 
---
Ehhh what? If paladins use Holy Light they go oom super fast... Only time a paladin will ever use Holy Light is with Divine Favor or if it's really needed to help keep tank up short term. Other than that they will spam Flash of light on the raid.
---
The POINT is that paladins are not the best tank healer in vanilla. They are the best raid healer on alliance in vanilla with their fast effective 1.5sec heals while druids are the best tank healer who only have a 2.5sec heal as they can't really spam hots, and hots doesn't stack... Even priests are better with their 2.5sec heals to heal tanks.
---
Poor scaling.  "is it a mana issue" not at all. " is this just a pve issue?" They have NO issues in pvp, ever. I also wouldnt say its a PVE issue...
---
Leveling hunters are the best. Soloing the world hunters are the best. Grinding gold they are just beneath a mage but can solo dungeon bosses for gold. Dungeons while getting pre BiS they are the best. Tier 1 MC they are the best. Tier 2 BWL they are very strong/best until youve cleared and your guild is geared... They fall slowly in AQ and drop off in Naxx.
---
I mean... Hunters are THE BEST for 2/3rds of the game. Arguably the best in PVP (warlocks edge them in a lot of gear tier2+ but hunters offer the single best value ability in game for group pvp - viper sting). ALSO, in PVE for quick clears, many guilds dont track the overall meter but hunters do insane on trash with sapper charges and aoe trap. They can also feign swap trinkets and tend to do better in quick clear guilds who need high burst for bosses that are dead in seconds.
---
There are 9 classes in vanilla. All of which can DPS. Hunters are the BEST dps class for 2/3rds of the game... I dont know why people think they struggle?
---
WARRIOR WEAPON!
---
MOAR DOTS!
---
Yes and no, there's a few good videos (on mobile rn) talking about how botting software reduced the cost of gold because the gold sellers no longer had to use people to farm. More than likely botting software will be made for WoW Classic, woukdn't surprise me if it's already available for the 7.2 engine so they could just apply it to Classic wit minor tweaks.
---
&gt; PvE-wise hunter weapons available are scarce
---
Hey, now!  
---
Every weapon is a Hunter weapon, everyone knows it!
---
Tyriel was d3 i think.. 
---
Not only hacked accounts but also botting still happens. There's a really good talk at Defcon about the old days of botting and circumventing the anti-chest measures.
---
Locknkey 
---
Because people that aren't successful irl want to be successful in a virtual world.
---
I got mine before the year ended. I flipped through a few pages and put it back inside it's green sleeve and out of sight. I wanna give it a proper read not skip around.
---
I'm not saying you should or shouldn't avoid them, but the biggest two as far as I can tell will be Asmongold and Sodapoppin.
---
My staff is a good one
---
Thats so funny, because its true!
---
I disagree, same item don't drop on every raid like let's say I need the Band of Accuria, I'm here for all raid for 4 months and it doesn't drop then one day it drops and a newby whose it's first raid roll and won it. Maybe it won't drop for another 4 months and who know maybe I won't get it again.
---
If you plan on using that kind of loot system, make it clear with all raiders before they invest time in your guild.
---
It was just too good! Too bad they never had armor like the mountaineer.
---
I dont like to stress the fact that the warlock rocks, but he jus does,So, for all you staff users out there, feel free to come in and post, my staff is a good one, but here is how it goes
---
1. post message in the room 
---
2. LOOK IT OVER 
---
3. dont report anything, i might get in trouble :) 
---
and 4. Have fun!!!
---
I'm remembering bits and pieces here, but I remember there was a gnome who would shout in ironforge that he needs to sell gold to feed his family. 
---
Buzzkill. Legendary warlock and my former ingame inspiration...
---
I'm always surprised to hear people say that levelling dungeons are easy. They are easy for a fully geared played, but at lvl19 with white items and maybe 2 or 3 greens, deadmines is a slog and a challenge even with a half-competent pug. You should reasonably expect 2 hours of dungeon crawling and at least 1 wipe for this entry level dungeon. This is based off of my TBC memories and recently private server experience. 
---
The closest virtual equivalent for these would be a loot box, with a random chance (equivalent to the percentages used back in the days) to get an item. "Loot box", my spine shivers when I write the words of this unholy concept.
---
But I think it would not feel right. What would you get in the majority of cases if you don't win a WoW item ? An Hearthstone card ? Not really the same without a physical item.
---
Don't use this as your metric to decide. I can guarantee you, you're going to have people who screw your groups up no matter what role you're playing.  
---
A part of a person's success in vanilla had to deal with their ability to identify and make friends with quality players. The same will be true in Classic no matter what class you're playing.  
---
I'm playing a warrior in Classic and I plan on tanking my 5 mans to get pre-raid sets for tank and fury. If you're a great mage in my runs, I'm going to ask you to run with me again in the future. That's just how it is. The same will be true of you for a good tank on your server.  
---
Choose the class based on other criteria. This criteria is impossible to determine anyway.  
---
look it over.....
---
Tanks are the rarest role on the pserver that I'm on now.  Healers are easy to come by, but not tanks.
---
I've seen two flavors of bad tanks:
---
* The ones who are not situationally aware and do not attempt to recover loose mobs.  These guys usually have bad gear also.  Not uncommon for them to need a huge heal when all the mobs are alive  at the start of the pull.  Heals go out, healer gets threat, whole pull goes haywire, tank does not protect healer or DPS.
---
* The ones who try to skip the entire dungeon.  One wipe loses more time than killing every pack you skip.  You don't have to clear the dungeon but you need some room to play the game.  Wall hugging all the time puts everyone on edge that they might be the one to accidentally pull the group and wipe us.  If your group has good gear and can handle a second unintended pull then fine, but when you're mostly quest-greened guys seeking pre-raid BIS, don't do that.
---
Hey how was Fire and Blood by the way? I bought a copy, but haven't geared myself up to read it yet.
---
This site is a super casual site. The person who was doing the interview very likely never played Vanilla and just knows its a old Version of this WoW thingy.
---
Distribution of items (and the impact on price).
---
With cards, the supply/demand dynamic is different than with the virtual shop. That has a consequence on how often you'd see the items ingame, and therefore their rarity and coolness.
---
I don't say I disagree or agree with your idea, but that's one difference.
---
Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Swifty, Hotted, Shroud etc. will all stream Classic at launch, but I only expect Asmongold to stream it continuously instead of switching to other themes/games after a couple of streams. Sodapoppin is all about doing variety these days. If anything, we can expect to see new streamers emerge from Classic.
---
There are obviously other streamers that are exclusive to Classic such as Esfand, Staysafe, TipsOut, Alexensu\*l and they may gain a lot more popularity than they have at the moment except for the last guy. He'll probably figure out a way to fuck things up.
---
They were a perfect example of storytelling through the world, instead of forcing a story through melodramatic events and cinematics that your character may or may not be an integral part of. This latter type only makes the world feel smaller, like there’s only a few things going on at any given time. The former, environmental storytelling, makes you feel like you’re just scratching the surface of a much bigger world.
---
My favourite little touch is the museum in Ironforge’s Hall of Explorers. It has fossils and skeletons with little plaques you can read.
---
I think you greatly underestimate the rarity of item when bosses drop 2-3 items you have to split between 40 players.
---
ZG mount, Binding,.. are not rare, they're legendary loot. Some people raiding MC once a week since vanilla release have never seen them drop.
---
Band of Accuria seems to be a 40% drop rate on Ragnaros. Don't tell me it'll drop only once on a 4 month raiding all week. You reasonning seems fair for rare objects, which as I stated will be treated differently.
---
I'll be paying attention to where streamers are rolling.  
---
From what I hear, Asmon/Soda are rolling on a PVE server together so I won't need to worry about that.  
---
I've been told by one of the three that Tips/Staysafe/Esfand are rolling the same PVP server together, so I can avoid three streamers at once with that.  
---
After that I will be keeping a close eye on where private server NA guilds are rolling and most likely roll on that server if they gather on one server.  
---
I really don't want to be caught on a server that's all tourists, so the most reliable way for me to avoid that is the make sure I'm rolling with people who I know aren't retailers. The only way to do that is to go with private server players.  
---
Wtf
---
Ok maybe, then why is it not a great system, in what ways ? I try to get a better system.
---
Didn't play retail since WOTLK, can you axplain a little bit what it is ?
---
Main the mage. Get greens, gold, and consumables and feed the warrior after. Should be smoother and you do both.
---
Did John Staats eat his hat yet? Asking for a friend 
---
Feral druid is possible for pve, bear are great offtank and actually better than warrior on a few boss (every guild bring at least one alliance side nowaday, horde side it seem rarer). You can also compete even with top dps alliance side but be aware that in order to do so you will have to master the powershifting rotation and farm the gnomeregan mace.

---
The Nicker
---
I see you're a fan of Alex. :'D
---
I would prefer to DPS in raids and Pally (we are rolling alliance) is normally suited for healing, which both of them will do once we get to end game, just seems a little redundant.
---
I don't know from where you're getting your infos but BA is nowhere near 40% drop, it's more like 6%.
---
Oceanic server if one exists. Easy.
---
Wårløk. 
---
I remember getting destroyed by 3 39 twink druids..
---
They get an xbow in bwl which is great. Then after that they get no ranged weapon upgrades until literally an xbow from KT. Basically thwy get fuck all from bwl right until literal endgame. On top of that their T2 is only about as good as T1, T2.5 isn't any better, and T3 is a small upgrade.
---
I'm positive nobody wants them if they haven't already taken them.  
---
I may be wrong, I did only a quick search at the moment. So yeah it may be a problem for low drop rate item. But the problem with dkp is that it'll be the old veteran that will get all the awesome loot. That's why I search an alternative.
---
Don’t know, don’t care, gonna tank anyway. For me, it’s the role I choose and want to play. Whether it’s the FOTM or not.
---
Ist du kranken mann
---
Bob
---
Good point. It could be a nightmare to end up on a pure streamer server.
---
PVP server for streamers is going to be a clusterfuck too, especially while levelling.
---
My housemate's main is called Vaseline because of this
---
Basically, all players get their own loot pool.
---
Part of pre-loading and trying to log on is making sure you reserve your name ASAP. 
---
Can't wait!
---
If you’re really worried, grab your toon name on 3-4 servers on day 1, and don’t play much that day, wait for the dust to settle and see who’s gone where. 
---
I had a Rogue named Scissor on a RP realm before, was reported.
---
I remember on my rogue, if I saw anything wearing plate, I'd just sigh and move on.
---
Well, you know it's not applicable for wow classic then...
---
Roll PVP and try to avoid sodapoppin. That's bassicly it, every streamer will play on PVE servers as far as i know. Also people really underestimate how many will actually play classic wow. A lot of other streamers that doesn't normally play wow will join in (League, variety etc)
---
For EU i think the only one you need to avoid is Forsen the rest won't be that big. For NA there will be like 10+ big streamers, but like i said so far the only one i heard that wanna go PVP server is Soda.
---
Magical Rooster worth over $700 damn. I got that on my retail account for like 200k gold in MoP.
---
Esf, stay, tips will probably be pretty big. I expect ClassiCast will gain a lot of popularity much closer to launch, and as they are so knowledgeable about vanilla and so early to the party with their content they will likely be at an advantage. Also will likely end up stacking a PvP server entirely in favour of their faction, so definitely to be avoided.
---
I never played tank, but I am very much interested in tanking this time around. I mained healing all this time, playing a support-class in every MMO or MOBA or Hero Shooter I ever played, so I'm very much eager to try out something new for a change. I'll still probably end up maining a priest though...but if I do plan on trying out tanking, which class do you guys recommend?  
---
Generally speaking, I won't count on tank/heal role to be overpopulated. Statistically speaking, in every MMO with the Holy Trinity suffers from lack of people willing to play the minority roles: Tanking and Healing. More responsibility, therefore more stress, therefore people are reluctantly taking up such roles.
---
Almost no upgrade in naxx so dps stay the same post AQ while other dps improve.
---
Soda said he really wanted to play on PVP server, but he was at the same time scared it wouldn't work. 
---
But i think the reason he decided to go on a PVE server was because he wanted faction balance and him rolling the oppesite faction then Asmon would make it closer to 50/50 balance (Asmon = Alliance, soda = Horde)
---
Aw the books of trudi are amazing!!!
---
Jizzsock uses grounding totem!
---
Yeah. I was getting ready to post that I'm more worried about getting a Warden's Staff then farming Pummelers. IIRC the weapon from Dire Maul is similar but not quite as much +armor.
---
Haha, i just found my old original WoW vanilla discs and box yesterday. Aswell as the TBC one AND the coolest of them all, my original cd case with the WoW Beta key in it! 
---
The nostalgia trip was real.
---
And why is that, exactly?
---
It's a better system. DKP is straight up ancient, even the need\greed rolls are outdated. Why does the loot pool have to be shared between 40 people?
---
People game the system the same way. The "best system" rewards time invested but also wont deter new members from joining. You would likely want to use DKP for tier pieces, rolling for shared items like rings and trinkets and loot council for exceptional items.
---

I played horde warlock, and yes there was a little chaos going on. Not sure I would have enjoyed it if we had fear ward, the difficulty was part of the fun (and frustration).
---
Whats the name again?
---
Link?
---
Add the druid and rogue one due to frontstabbing and frontshred, i never remember that being in real vanilla
---
Warrior. There will be too many mages and there will be so few tanks.
---
Not sure if this counts for what you're looking for, but the book, [For The Light!](https://www.wowhead.com/item=20009/for-the-light) was one that always interested me. I'm a huge fan of Paladins and I always kept this on my main for "rp" purposes, I thought it was pretty cool.

[Like this? ^ ^](https://i.imgur.com/Cm2dFYW.png)
---
I don’t think you’re wrong necessarily. But your analysis makes it sound like pretty much every class is a bad choice, lol.
---
This is going to be funny as shit come classic. So many delusional lolrets banking on stacking charges from mobs being a thing.
---
Naming a character after the weight of your last poo in grams using the resulting numbers in alphabetical order.
---
I did not understand the system then. All player doesn't share the loot, how can you make this on classic ?
---
I think it's less to do with it being the last class added into the game, and more that at launch Blizz gave 0 thought to late-game scaling, and it shows given the itemization of the time. Then later as you pointed out, Hunter mechanics simply did not scale well given their itemization.

What are some of these books that you have in your bookshelf? I've been interested in starting to read these "WoW" books for a long time and always enjoyed the short stories and stuff that comes up every now and then on the WoW website. Where would one begin? Which book(s) should I start off with? What's the logical chronological order? 
---
“Nothing worse than doing a hard nights raiding only to end up with nothing - particularly is your piece dropped but you didnt have enough points for it, then realize how much your consumables and repairs cost.” 
---
That’s literally vanilla though. And that attitude is literally what vanilla isn’t about. 
---
Good.
---
My favorite in this thread
---
By your thing, I'd go Shaman. 
---
Well. Easy. You just replace the vanilla loot system.
---
Keklord
---
Thank you for responding, at first I was deterred by shamans with the buff timers and totems. However the more I think about them the more I am intrigued. My priests play is 10 out of 10 for PVP and pve. However if I go resto I will pretty much only want to pve, unless I get good at PVP. We'll see. It looks like I may main shaman tho
---
A shit idea, but hope the naming doesn’t stress you out you don’t want the weight on your chest
---
That actually sounds brilliant, I'll give it a read. Thanks!
---
I was a Kickstarter back of the project :)
---
I haven't been subbed since RDR2 released but I've decided to make a return to BFA soon. I miss it, even if its just the music in my favourite zones I'll hang out there talking about Classic until release!
---
I wanna heal but not sure what class honestly. I like Priest for its wide kit, smooth levelling and cool abilities like Fade and Mind Control. Looks quite squishy though, and not a fan of the tier aesthetics.
---
Shaman seems like a fun healer due to the buffs it provides, meaning you add more than just heals, plus it has great fantasy. Not sold on all the keybinds though, and the talent options seem quite limited. 
---
Paladin seems very solid, very useful and you get to wear plate which looks cool. However, you don't really wear plate and I worry it may be boring/annoying with the levelling and short CD buffs.
---
Druid looks like a very simple raid healer, has lots of options and probably best levelling, was my first main back in proper classic so I have special affinity for this. However I am worried about not really being viable for dungeon healing due to lack of proper rez, and I wanna do dungeon healing. 
---
The game will be diffrent from back then and yes the game will be more serious for many. But not for everyone, if you want a more fun/more chill aproach go on RP servers, there will be more "less serious" people there. But it's exspected, video gaming is way more competetive nowadays then back then, back then gaming was "only for fun" and nothing more and the whole "social online" aspect was new, which it's not anymore. But the game will still be the same in many ways and i don't think it's as bad as u seem to think

As a big fan of the Targaryen family, I loved it cover to cover. Also much easier to pick up and read on the commute due to it being more of a historical retelling in story format instead of the style of the main series.

I don’t know anyone who didn’t just get a guildie to help them.

Currently levelling my 3rd warrior. If I never roll another class in vanilla, I’ll never know what I’m missing!
---
Around the time you get Whirlwind axe and WW itself, things do start getting a lot easier. Especially if you’re arms after 40 with mortal strike etc.
---
While there certainly will be quite a bit of elitism when it comes to effeciency there will also be quite a decent amount of laid back guilds for beginners and veterans alike.   
---
I joined a guild where the goal is just to experience the world as it was at our own pace, no rushing or anything, just to enjoy the game for what it is with a relaxed non-hardcorde mind set.  
---
It sounds like you might need this kind of friendly and relaxed guild where we simply enjoy the game with a friendly atmosphere.
---
Actually i got a better idea, listen: Fry your ass cheeks on a grill to make a rorshack pattern and then let elderly people guess what it is as you moon them through a window, gather five results and name your character after the first character of each result in order.
---
And that's a 7 day MC clear without: Tanaris pirate cove quests, added Hinterlands quests, added Silithus quests, and most of Searing Gorge's quests.

Similar to you, I played wc3 and mained orc. I believe I was 15 when I purchased vanilla. I made a troll hunter because troll berserkers were my favorite unit in wc3 and I saw that trolls has a throwing weapon specialization. Was deeply disappointed that the wow hunter didn't fit the headhunter aesthetic.

laughable if you think it worked with nost

I know I just said it jokingly  
---
its still mtx essentially  
---
You probably aren't going to be using a dozen totems in one instance, I am considering shaman too and I am thinking of having a series of relatively easy to reach buttons like say, Ctr 1-6 or something, and just placing my most commonly used ones. If my group or raid situation changes it, just swap one out. 
---
I don't imagine that all hunters have all their things like pet feeding, calling etc on easy great keybinds, I imagine they do some clicking. So I don't think clicking should be such a dirty thing, especially in classic. For example, I doubt I'll need a frost resist totem at all times. I think I'd just stick it on my bar off to the side for now. 
---
Solid book, glad I backed this one as well. Been reading it a little bit every night, hoping to make it last. As an indie dev I love being able to relate to the team's struggles on a smaller scale. Seems like Team 2 would have been awesome to work with.
---
Also, I enjoy the spot varnish on the pictures way too much.
---
Christie Golden is my favorite writer for the WoW books. I read Arthas, Rise of the Lich King as my first book and enjoyed it.
---
Thinking something like FearFactorc
---
How is it?
---
A bit like the Souls games are presenting their lore to the players. I love it.
---
As a tank your repair bills should of been covered by the guild bank. 
---
Also stats have shown that while few make it to max level, fewer still attempt being a DPS. Most warriors are tanks, most tanks are warriors, the minority are DPS. That even holds true on retail.
---
Sounds like a guild that I would be happy to join as well\~

Your vetrans are your cream of the crop. They are the guys that you want to appease. Sure the new guys get screwed but thats the life of a new guy. Your base 20-30 raiders NEED to be kept happy. THEY are the ones that you need. Sure you want to appeal to new members, but there will always be a rotating door of players in a 40 man raid. The typical loot systems cater to the vetrans, and that is by design.
---
Absolutely fascinating! I keep getting super hyped with waves of love for vanilla hitting me. My GF is sick of me telling her the 'interesting' facts about the development process of vanilla over dinner.
---
People need GY for the quest though
---
The photo of Team 2's building / office area from 2004 made me stop and appreciate the gravity of the whole thing. Team 2 &amp; Vanilla are inspiring!

Just wondering why servers with streamers are being avoided? Is it because they'll be bringing too many people with them (viewers) that will clog up quests and such? Or is there another reason?
---
How many of us already have names picked out?
---
Depends on gear, they have great spell coefficients, and limited escape options. If you have good gear you can stomp nearly any class that you get the first cast on. The weaknesses they have are curse of tongues, mana draining effects and no hard ccs. You can counter the mana drains with earth shock or poison cleanse respectively. Curse if tongues hurts though. Luckily shaman are horde only and there are less locks on ally. You will also have problems against freedommed warriors ( but who doesnt) lol
---
Combat swords was ok for PvP.
---
Combat daggers was terrible though
---
&gt; You just seem very very angry and very much like no matter what they do, you won't be happy with it. 
---
I'll be pretty happy as long as they make Classic WoW the same as Classic WoW was back in the day.
---
that's kind of the point of Classic isn't it?
---
if you make it Classic but with retail add ins, defeats the purpose.
---
Plus, no one can deny that this new system gives a greater incentive for ninja looting vs the old one.
---
So, objectively, it is a suboptimal solution and therefore a bad decision.
---
To get the pet by activating the code, obviously.
---
AmySchumer
---
Not in the new system. In the new system you can trade a Bind on Pickup.
---
It gives ninjas a greater incentive to Need because now they can sell the item
---
When Aq opens, there are a lot of items which are good for ele. Do u have any list which items to get for the time before? Like Pre raid bis pvp items?
---
Most of them will play together so it should be pretty easy to avoid them.  
---
wrong, there are tons of us left, thats why classic is being made, its just that we don't have a sub or place to talk about it without the fucking casuals coming in by the hordes because BFA failed
---
The good; Leveling isn't terrible after you get improved wand + keep the best wand you can. You can heal all content up to 60 but the late dungeons require a decent group. You aren't gonna be power healing through fight mechanics. Pvp you are a powerhouse early and stay competitive for all of classic ( although you will drink ALOT)
---
The bad; you will never outdps any real dps class in raids and usually speaking you are only brought to a raid for shadowweaving ( which bleeding edge guilds will have from a hybrid specced healer). So there is generally only one brought to a raid. You will be nearly constantly out of mana past BWL.
---
we don't know how they are going to handle itemization progression yet so any BIS list is flawed until they announce it.
---

I got Cata and MoP beta invites back in the day, no special requirements, just had an ok PC and the box ticked. 
---
I only found the emails way after those games released and I had stopped playing, and didn’t participate in the betas.
---
Yes. But they are mainly support cuz they don’t do that much dps and they run out of mana quick if they don’t bring mana pots / dark tunes etc. hence raids will usually have no more than one shadow priest in it
---
I love your collection, FOR THE HORDE! 
---
It will likely have an impact on server balance
---
I'm not a fan of DKP, I think the dkp system has a lot of flaw.
---
I mainly raided with two guild, both using Loot council and this is the best system imo IF the loot council is not a group of dumbfuck.

Lots of posts in this post but someone nobody has really mentioned level. Your tank and dps's level is by far the most important thing in the success of a pre60 dungeon. You want a tank that is no less than 3 levels lower than the final boss. Misses/resists/getting crit is all more likely when your tank is significantly lower level than the boss. 
---
When I create a group(and I ALWAYS create my pugs), I first try to find a tank within 3 levels of the final boss. If I can find a tank that sees the boss as yellow(2 levels) I know that I can get a dps that is equal to that level or below. Threat becomes an issue when your tank is missing a third of their attacks and a dps of higher level Will Pull Agro. As far as pulling trash mobs, either get a mage for sheep, a ret paladin to off tank, or a druid to main tank and you will never have a problem with larger packs. 
---
Priest is more survivable than shaman if you aren't getting chain dispelled. Never healed on shaman or paladin.
---
Druid is fine for dungeons, get jumper cables if your feeling generous, there is never a, shortage of dps shaman, pally, priests that can res but healers are always in high demand for 5 man's. If your a good healer you will never be turned away because of res.
---
If i was a veteran of a guild using a system that gave me a chance to loose an item i've had my sights on for months to a new member i'd leave immediately. Loot is the biggest reason to raid in vanilla(it's old content) and you have to treat the more active raiders to more loot, else they\ll just leave and youre stuck with beginners. You need a core raid, you need to keep that core happy.
---
;) Yeah, but you're still pumping damage with your ranged and there's few useful ones. Most are just either too fast or stat-wise are weak. 
---
Melee ones aren't that much of a trouble and the same can be said about rogue/war ranged ones: they're just there for stats. 
---

---
My problem with loot council is that I feel like we lose a lot of time during raid. You need 3-4 peoples discussing of loot attribution (kind of pause the raid because of that) while other systems is quite straitforward. 
---
&gt; The former, environmental storytelling, makes you feel like you’re just scratching the surface of a much bigger world.
---
The world is prefab structures and the majority of zones have no history because they didn't even exist before wow.
---
Lore book delivery, that isn't even written from the perspective of a fictional historian, is the absolute lowest form of lore.
---
Dipindots
---
 The term *pwn* was around a lot longer than WoW was.
---
RP-PVP first, I've heard they have a better community than non-RP servers, and I like the idea of RP. PvP because world pvp can be really fun, and I feel like I'd be missing out without it.
---
Past that, I'm planning on finding a guild before classic drops so that I can narrow down what class I play and what specific server to join.
---
Ele is pretty fun because lightening bolt + chainlightening + shock is insane burst. Afterwards you are toast though... Biggest problem is that your offensive and healing spells are from the same magic school.
---
Ele shami is one of the few classes that does not struggle against frost mages, unless you get counter spelled. They are weak against chain stunning rogues and warriors though since you have basically no way to get away from a warrior once he has Hamstring up.
---
Mail gear with spell power is a bit lackluster, but there is some stuff and in PvP you want the higher armor from mail and not only wear cloth. Always take 1hd and shield.
---
Sounds like a plan!
---
The WoW Chronicles are great imo especially the first 2
---
Ret paladin is genuinely terrible at keeping up the nightfall debuff compared to any of the other options, it's nothing like an enhancement shaman doing the same.
---
Nobody really knows, they haven't announced much concrete info on pvp
---
All we know is that PvP system won't be there on release. We don't know if they are planing to tamper with it in any way, but Ion said that they are aiming at recreating the original game, so most likely the same way as it was on 1.12.
---
blue pvp gear is nice, high armor and stamina and spell power
---
I’d like to know this too, I searched a little while back but couldn’t find anything out about it!
---
BenAffLock is better
---
Oh i agree but the totems the totems can just instantly wipe you.
---
Why shouldn't the Vet get the awesome loot? They are the reason you are where you are at. Your system encourages anyone who intents to be serious to look for a different guild where they will be rewarded for helping the guild progress. Only to use your guild as a stepping stone till they can find another serious guild.
---
Last i heard, they all are rolling on the same pvp  server BUT Tipsout will be horde and esfand and staysafe will be alliance.
---
Yeah bud, it’s all pixels and every inn is the same, I get it. All the fidelity and unique assets in the world didn’t make any post-Wrath expac feel more immersive or alive. 
---
honestly mages are probably THE most sought after DPS class. Sure warriors and rogues do mroe damage, but both are melee and have no CC, so don't worry about that.
---
In your group warlock offers - in my opinion - even more utility unless you want to just aoe everything down. 
---
Honestly play what you want, both classes are great for leveling, grouping, pve and pvp. And raiding is equally exciting for both (spam one button and watch KLH).
---
There is 2 sets of gear. The blue set is obtained around the ranks 7-10. Rank 11 gives an epic riding mount to become available for purchase. Epic set is obtained from ranks 12-13. Weapons are high warlord or grand marshal only. You do need to maintain rank to use the weapons/gear. There are various other useful pvp items available through ranks also. It’s a very Grindy system, requiring many hours to hit rank 14. 
---
Wow now is far more advanced in terms of the resources and guides available , not to mention how far mods have come , the raid fights are far simpler, MC is so easy naxx is the only hard one but compare to raids these days it's really not that complicated, you will do fine. 
---
he is talking about mage vs warlock ;-)
---
nevertheless the warrior vs mage question is also interesting, but it boils down to if you like melee or ranged gameplay more. Mage is the better farmer and less gear dependant (thus less time consuming) while warrior can tank to get instant dungeon invites
---
&gt;hope there aren’t TOO many servers to choose from. I get they need to accommodate for the mass amount of people coming to play classic, ESPECIALLY at launch, but I would honestly rather play an overpopulated server than an underpopulated server. I feel like a few of the servers will die out after a couple weeks or so.
---
Sharding will be here to address  this specific problem, that what most people don't understand, thinking that blizzard wants to implement it just to piss them of or some shit
---
Just go through the periodic table of elements, none of those are ever taken. 
---
Tanks are wow celebrities. Very few.
---
IMO we had a disc priest that was probably strongest.  Huge hp pool and we were horde side, so didn't have to worry about shaman purging all the buffs off.  Was borderline unkillable, and pws / renew were both instant cast that returned a lot of hp.  damage wasn't GREAT but the sustain was nuts, and holy fire/smite + swp still did strong damage.
---
My MS Warr was pretty mean but obviously without a healer it was limited.  Still easy to kite/etc.  
---
I also had a 49 'tank shaman' that used a 1h/shield but had clearcasting , 1 sec ghost wolf, and nature's swiftness.  Geared him pretty straight stam/int with a level 48 rare mace I think bonesnapper or something like that.  Big slow mace, so wf procs were still ridiculous.  
---
As far as gear goes, I don't recall but it was all blues, level 45+.  I don't recall anyone doing research and finding any higher level quest or whatever that would have rewarded something crazy we were kind of lazy in that regard.  We had a few 60s obviously and would run sunken temple and Princess / landslide runs.  I remember my shaman had the stam/int/mp5 shield, warrior had a big 2h level 48, though I also used a shield occasionally with a good 1h since the bracket had a lot of rogues/hunters.  We did get enchants but not crazy stuff like crusader or 15 agil, just extra hp mostly.  I think the mage did spring for 40 spellpower on his staff just cuz.  
---
Once WOTLK came around, we could turn XP off and spam lfg for all the random rares that'd drop- that was fun =P  We grouped as 3 or 4 sometimes and would just obliterate the content.  Anyone could tank it since we all had like double or even triple the hp that a usual mid to high 40s would have. 
---
We quit in cata. 
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
When it comes to PvP, I'd say the scaling issue is mostly noticable in AQ because you get few upgrades compared to other classes, if you get T3/Slavemaker you'll be one of the best classes in PvP. In PvE hunters drop off but in PvP rogues and warriors have significantly less uptime on targets while hunters can do everything on the move and has the longest range in the game and great burst. 
---
Also, other dps classes scale better off world buffs. 
---
never use anything other than double crippling for pvp
---
Nref teh palydan
---
Only reward Vet' is fine for a guild aiming at world first or a guild that is really hardcore. However, for more semi-hardcore guild it doesn't seems appropriate for me to only favorise the same guys just because they play more than other people. I feel like semi-raider can also get awesome loot if they try. The weight are here to give a bonnus to Vet' and hardcore raiders but let semi-raider to have a chance (which is fewer).
---
DKP only long time people can get awesome loot and even if you are hardcore raider but join recently you can't compete.
---
if you plan to nolife the launch you should be ahead of the pack and a speed leveler will usually not engage in pvp because a corpse run ruins your xp/hour. So the question is rather: Will you buddy nolife as well?
---
Another thing: Duo leveling is pretty safe on a PvP realm, almost no class can 1vs2 if the levels are roughly equal (apart from maybe an undead shadow priest against no heal/disspell).
---
If your buddy goes horde warrior, pick the shaman. With WF totem and your heals you will smash mobs like no tomorrow.
---
If he goes pally warrior sounds good but has some drawbacks (same items and you are slow), while druid should be solid although the druid will always have to wait for the warrior to catch up.
---
Check this great video by Kargoz out, it goes in depth about the best duo leveling combinations out there: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4)
---
I agree. It looks prettier but they've never had environmental storytelling as a high priority unlike the Soulsborne games which place a very high priority on linking areas together through geography, structures and enemy placement.
---
&gt;The fact it was lore you would find rather than lore you were shown is what’s important imo. 
---
You mean you found a book with a lore dump written by the writers which breaks the 4th wall.
---
What, no love for Drakedog ?
---
Getting the pristine gem drop for my paladin charger mount , before the drop rate was buffed I think they would go for  100g or 500g on the AH, maybe 500? Was one of the most expensiver things on there do was glad I got mine, some rogue tried rolling on it too but lost. 
---
Getting the 4th ever kelthuzaad kill in Europe . Was not long after nilhilum got there's, like 30 seconds after the kill I was getting texts from lots of random people on the server congratulating us and asking to link the loot that dropped. 
---
Ah ok, I was wondering, I’d heard them trying to convince guests to go one or the other but I just assumed they were all going ally.
---
Because I don’t want to be on a server where a bunch of fan boys worship someone who plays video games for a living. It’s honestly embarrassing. Lol
---
I want to avoid the celebrity culture they will bring to a server.  Eventually it will cause a faction imbalance (even if there is one big streamer per faction - eventually one will have more groupies than another).    
---
People will be rolling the streamer's side to try to become buddies/guildmates with them.
---
People will be rolling the opposite faction for a chance to form a hunting party and kill them.
---
Well I will never in my guild put loot at the first priority. I don't like this mentality. So yes if loot is the main reason, so DKP make all sense. But not for me. Loot is great, anyone with this system can have it, but if a guy leave just because he doesn't have one loot, then...
---
Ret can be fun in PvP, be sure to get enigneering though since you lack a gap closer. Until you get some gear you can heal some dungeons and afterwards you should work towards the blue pvp gear, which is pretty obtainable if you invest some time.
---
If you want to raid all three classes will be healers, period. Yes I have seen the occasional bear tank but the gear choices are so limited and there are some fights you just cant tank. Bear tank means investing a lot of time and bringin tons of consumables to make up for the weak spots in your kit
---
Well it depends of the loot council.
---
In my first guild, the loot council was made of shithead, taking 30min after each boss to discuss the loot and giving most of them to their friend, lot of drama, people leaving the guild cuz of that, etc.
---
In my second guild, the loot council was made of the guild leader and a master for each class. They knew every raider, their gear, attendance, performance, investment in the guild, ... loot distribution was completed in 2min, never had a single complaint from anyone.
---
It was two really different guild tho, first one was for casu, they never completed BWL (mainly due to the poor management and lake of skill from leaders). The second one was semi-hardcore with own ptr to test strat for hard bosses, 30min MC run, excel spreadsheet for placement during boss fight that would be updated weekly with the name of every raider participating to the next raid,etc.
---
Find invested people for your LC that will prioritize guild progression over their own progression and your loot distribution will take less time than the /roll
---
&gt; I'd rather have extra hp for an o-shit someone missed an interrupt moment
---
The only thing you’re kicking is the Frostbolt cast on the tank. You can’t kick the volley.

Oohhhhhhh now I get it, I thought he was talking about hunter pets. There are still plenty of unique companion pets nowadays but I see his point, with pet battling there's just so many pets that its diluted.
---
I think the only reason sometimes you see bad tanks in leveling dungeons is that they're a bit ignorant and think "oh, I'm a warrior (or druid or pal) I can tank" when they haven't actually done it before.  Tanking is a skill, obviously not the same as just going out and grinding mobs.  Some folks simply haven't learned and then try to do it = no bueno. 
---
Leveling is solid, not very exciting though. In PvP shadow is really good. In raids shadows are a non factor dps wise and are generally only brought as hybrids to buff the warlocks
---
Awesome - thanks!

Prep the Honor Grind Montage...
---
I’m not mentioning any of the names I want to reserve for fear that someone will take them.
---
Yes, they will be bad. Assume that.
---
Yes! This is exactly what u had to plan out. I tried this out on an instant 60 server and found a way to keep the major totems on close keybinds (earthbind, strength, grounding, tremor, windfury, cleansings, stoneclaw, Mana spring). Those are all pretty close to my wasd. Stuff like resistance totems, Grace of air, healing stream are all on the side and I can just swap them out per fight or instance. Ive been finding a good comfy flow to the keybinds on shaman I just want to find a group on that insta 60 server to try out the healing. Maybe do a diremaul or scholo run
---
Why? 
---
Yes I watch kargoz religiously as well as his streams. Priest warrior and shaman warrior we're on his tier 1. I only prefer hybrids except pally, so shaman works great. 
---
That isn’t an option 
---
There's a bow from 4 horsemen as well that's actually quite good. 
---
It's like a simple tomato soup brewing in a pot and people wanna throw in 300 ingredients to 'enhance' the flavor.
---
How hard is it to understand?
---
Before TBC we would clear naxx in one evening even with pickups so it's possible. 
---
Even DKP guilds typically dont bid on ZG tiger... Its a vanity item. Why would you dictate who got it? It should be 100% random with everyone getting a chance... Maybe you arent qualified to try and figure out a loot system... Have you even been in a guild?
---
This might be server specific but DOTS DON'T CRIT was a meme for a bit.
---
Fair on the first part.
---
I’m not following you on how they broke the 4th wall. Maybe some specific examples of inexplicable content? Is it the lack of a credited author? They always seemed like they were written from an in-universe perspective to me, even if that perspective remained undefined. You can say it’s the laziest form of storytelling but it would be even more puzzling to not have them.
---
Finding a book in the library in SW Keep or in a mage tower never felt out of place to me. The other example, of the hall of explorers museum, had a perfectly diegetic context also.
---
It’s also not like it’s the only way lore was established; it was very much tertiary and optional. Quest text was probably the primary means, and some of those were quite strong. The characterisation of different NPCs across The Missing Diplomat chain, for example, or the cohesion of the political story across the 1-40 “human zones”
---
Really? I thought it was because the class revolves around having a pet and you can't gear it up. Warlocks on the other hand can sack their's for a damage buff. 
---
Anyone else remember how amazing reading video game manuals in the back seat of the car while your mom drove you from the game store was?
---
Never heard of this. Can you share the context?
---
I love...lamp
---
Real talk, how do u handle dust? I have a good collection im too afraid to take out of the box
---
I was a perpetually broke troll hunter engineer. I used guns instead of bows because they were cooler and I could make the ammo.
---
Think that may have been the point of his joke 😋
---
Nooe. Mini tyrial came from the 2008 blizzard invitational. Apparently people got codes there. It was in france. The only way to get it which is kinda lame for such a cool pet.
---
Most people are hot garbage at raid leading and tanking.  It won't be a problem.
---
Very likely, but it’s hard to interpret that kind of stuff over text.
---
Ah, yeah that might be it.
---
All of this.
---
Also, as a rough guideline, a semi decent player can make it to rank 10 without a crazy time investment. At around rank 10/11 is when the system starts scaling exponentially upwards so that you will start needing to put in serious hours, likely with a pre-made group.
---
So if you want to collect the blue set, I’d say you can reliably do that. If you put in a bit more time and effort you can also get the rank 11 mound which can save some money. Otherwise good luck.
---
I'd love to tank. I just don't want to play a warrior.
---
Why don't you just use DKP with decay?
---
Compared to the raids in wow in later expansions , naxx is easy . Everyone was a noob in a way back in vanilla. Now i don't think 40naxx will prove much of a problem. I was in one of the guilds that cleared naxx and compared to raids now it's a peace of cake. 
---
I enjoy the lore. I've been watching videos starting from the VERY beginning. I've even read some of the RL books. But I didn't really read the in-game books. I will definitely make that a part of my journey. I plan on rolling a gnome lock. Are there any specifics I should look for in-game?

You can use whatever you want in PvP against the opposite faction, but using any consumables more than bandages/food in a duel is pretty lame, you'll get laughed at unless it's some kind of super serious duel tournament.
---
Prot warrior is hands down the worst in solo PvP. All the heal specs can survive and slowly grind people down, but prot has zero healing and bad damage, and most of their mitigation is useless against magic damage. You might be able to beat other warriors/rogues, but that's about it. 
---
Yes.
---
I listened to the (two?) Classic cast that John was on, super interesting. 
---
I hope there will be German servers in EU. That should suffice. 
---
Sounds funny, what is this from?
---
Agreed and a fair point 😊
---
If you want to tank and still do well in world pvp then you want a Heart of the Wild spec Druid.  You can wear people down in a battle of attrition, and if the fight doesn't go your way then seek the nearest body of water and haul ass.

Warriors are still top dps horde side at this point.

I think that vanilla tanking is just different. You don't have aoe tools but you still need to keep aoe threat at least from healer, so you have to learn to tab and keep some threat for all mobs, not something you would do in modern WoW. Threat generation is very low compared to modern WoW, so while you still need to care about threat in modern WoW, it's not a big issue. Damage profile is different as well. You're expected to tank with your face. If you fail to position well, you'll die. If you lost aggro to a ranged DPS, you can't taunt it, because taunt is melee spell, you don't have combat charge and you can't turn your back to other mobs, so unless dps is smart and will kite that mob back to you, it's very little you could do.
---
All in all, I don't think that classic tanking is so hard, but it's something different, so even experienced players will need to learn a thing or two.
---
This one wins guys
---
All right, thanks a lot :) 
---
They already said they are doing shared loot. It will be even better to game the system with. Makes it easy to bid for my friends, which I plan on doing.
---
Well for whatever reason people like WoW pets. I am not really into that myself so I can only imagine.
---
I guess it's part of customizing the character. Having a unique pet distinguishes you from the masses.
---
You don’t think seeing the same 5-10 characters involved in every cutscene and dramatic event feels more like the narrow, directed plot of a book or TV series and not the developing history of a whole world? 
---
That works for you and your friends because you guys can coordinate tactically for that strategy.  A pug trying to use a hunter as a tank would struggle.  Like it has been said here, the DPS play a huge part in setting the group up for success.  If the DPS each pick a different target then there's no way a hunter will be successful.
---
&gt; So the cheaper BFA servers can't handle an open world 40v40.
---
Even if those servers were cheaper, they'd likely still outperform old servers, that's how technology works. A ODM's goal is to make better servers for cheaper. 
---
However that's likely not the issue. Issue appears to be related to the server architecture. Going from dedicated HW for a server, to using a "cloud" structure for pooling resources to power all servers + the new sharding/crz systems.
---
So server performance in Classic will likely depend on whether it has to use that same architecture as Retail (possible). At the very least, it looks like the underlying issues of the lag is something that can be optimized and improved with iterations. Unfortunately we don't know what that state might be by the time Classic launches.

Like I said I can try to get a good size group but it’s far from a wow only discord lol.  I’ll set up wow channels and everything if this is the move

I'll kill the suspense - it was the point of joke

Hoping for a compilation of streamers closer to release if/when servers are revealed before launch. Luckily EU doesn't have too many big names as far as i know, although I believe Nixxiom lives in the UK now
---
If it turns out to be a shit show people will just leave. And then blizzard will say, "I told you so."
---
Didn't blizzard make the statement about the BFA zones actually use a lot of the server stuffs and that's why it happens. Funny cause it was pushed as a PvP expansion. But maybe the classic assets are easier on the servers, we'll see. 
---
If Blizz needs the subscribers they better do what's necessary to keep them there. Right blizzard? RIGHT!?

Yes, 1 shadow priest for shadow weaving

It's not elitism, it's reality. I've been in many types of guilds. Super hardcore, hardcore, "casual hardcore" and just plain casual. Like as much as i enjoy a lot of the posts on this sub there are so many posts where people think classic will be some form of utopia where things that were bad then won't be bad now!
---
Loot has always been the #1 reason for guild drama, always. The same will go for classic. Loot is reward, loot is character progression, loot enables new playstyles - looting is central to WoW and raiding. In every guild, casual or hardcore there is a core of raiders that always show up and always bring that little extra. Every guild is reliant on this core to actually do any form of progress, casual and hardcore alike. There are several reasons why putting new players on a level playing field with guild veterans is a bad idea. The one i mentioned before, people being downright annoyed by it is one thing. The other is progression, you want gear to go as much as possible to your core in a fair manner because they are the ones that will show up meaning the loot wont be wasted. The third is a very common occurance: new player joins a guild, gets lucky and recieves some loot fairly quickly, promptly leaves for a guild with better progression since now he has some gear to actually join it. This last one i've seen happen tons of times and it makes your veterans even more bitter because loot that they wanted went to this guy who just left after a month.
---
Shit like this happens in every guild. Even if it's a guild full of IRL friends this shit like this will happen and people will be annoyed by it. But hey by all means make your own guild and run it, nobody's stopping you. But if you think caring about loot is elitism then i don't think WoW is a game for you considering it is one of only two ways to actually progress your character.
---
1!? Does that mean it will be difficult or not so much since it was generally underrepresented?
---
Thats exactly my Plan for vanilla too! I love the flexibility of a Druid, and in Vanilla doing multiple things with different gear sets without having to respec is invaluable! And Hunter is also fun to level and farm but I feel because of that theres gonna be a lot of them and chances to get a raid spot will be slim (while as a druid you get decked in epics ). Oh man I am so hyped for classic
---
Why not even simply just, Dotdotdot

Chuck Norris chat comments.
---
But that's not Anathema.. 
---
Handleet - Moredots 
---
Benafflock. Or Harrydotter, even better
---
A little bit of both. My suggestion is to learn to play both shadow and holy. You will probably get in more raids as a holy priest, but also a better chance to acquire great shadow gear.
---
I raided in Naxx in vanilla and this is what our shadow priest did. He had to heal occasionally in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair, but once he got his gear he was the best geared shadow priest and was able to fill that dps slot.
---
Im gonna guess that most warriors are going to suck for launch.
---
I imagine its going to be similar to the way pservers were back in 2010, with a majority of warriors saying "im fury/arms, I cant tank". ie. dont know how to play warrior. Pservers have gotten a lot better since then, but I imagine the retail babys are going to come on and flood the game with classic launch.
---
&gt; DKP only long time people can get awesome loot and even if you are hardcore raider but join recently you can't compete (which also doesn't seems fair).
---
Why is it not fair? You are a new person who is joining a far progressed raid environment? It isn't like you helped that guild get to the point. It is not fair to a veteran rogue who helped the guild work all the way through Molten Core to have somebody they only brought after they started Rag attempts to get Perdition's Blade over to the Veteran. There is a reason on why DKP is such a staple for so long.
---
BfA server clusters were likely designed with sharding in mind. Heavy loads were likely thought to be pushed on to multiple shards and able to be ignored. The servers themselves likely slaughter the originals in terms of specs on literally all fronts. The modern server clusters appear to not be able to balance the load of a single shard very well.
---
This is all guesswork on my part.
---
I think a good tank will have a bigger impact than a good dps, though. Marking packs and calling out cc makes a huge difference, along with not breaking cc constantly. Anyone can do that, but since the tank is pulling, it is best that they call those shots.
---
Mostly it is when not marking that the problems of focusing occur. 
---
The BFA zones may or may not be worse, but it happens in other zones too. Even instanced things like the Southshore vs Tarren Mill pvp brawl can get really bad.
---
At the end of Legion, I did a For the Horde run. The entire raid experienced the same broken server lag while killing Anduin. That was just one raid too. Maybe just 50-80 players in total.
---
My level 60 plan is to spend hours slinking around every alliance town and city on my sub rogue. I will be sapping anyone with pvp flags.
---
I always name my orc warlocks Narghuul.
---
If you are in a serious raiding guild, they will only want 1 Shadow Priest per raid and even semi-serious raiding guilds tend to stick to the meta. You can definitely find less serious raids that don't mind an extra shadow priest. Also, Shadow Priest isn't as popular as mage, warrior, rogue and every guild should grab 1 so you can still find a spot if you try.
---
I think you hit it right on the nose when you say that the DDers need to 'FOCUS' on one target.  I've played warrior since beta and I'd rank the reasons tanks fail like this, and they are kind of in categories (Content Knowledge, Pulling, Agro, and Sustain).
---
Reasons for failing:
---
1) Pulling: I mess up my pull and bring back 2+ groups of mobs
---
2) Content Knowledge: I don't know the content and fail to adjust the party.  Such as deciding to tank a group in the middle of a patrol path's.
---
3) Agro: I fail to secure agro.  Maybe I thunder clapped too early.  Maybe a caster got eager and started in before the pull clumped up enough.
---
4) Agro: All 3 DPS pick a different target, and all 3 DPS are standing in different spots so I end up struggling to get agro on one target while another DPS is getting hammered several yards away.  Why can't you all attack the same target?
---
5) Pulling: The party isn't ready but i still pull.  The healer isn't full mana, the hunter isn't setup to freeze, or the mage doesn't poly.
---
6) Sustain: 3 DPS killing 3 targets will take as long as one DPS killing one target.  3 DPS killing 1 target takes 1/3 the time.  The raw amount of damage taken by party is reduced by DPS assisting the tank or at least attacking the same target.  This will quickly eliminate one source of damage and make healing 1/3 easier.  Its not that the fight is quicker this way but overall the damage is greatly reduced.
---
&lt;Back to the Future&gt; 
---
We go back in time to save the future of wow
---
I've only read about the story of retail since I quit back in Cata but, seems like the whole rapid fire change of Warchief hasn't gone over well for anyone in the Horde :(. 
---
I'm still sad about Thrall stepping down though...
---
It's been over a decade lol  If raids 39 people can't kill onyxia cause of 1 shadow priest it is the least of their worries 
---
They are literally copying and pasting from a 1.12 client. 
---
Catch that druid
---
I've been back and forth on several classes, races, etc. I'm playing a bit on pservers just to get a feel for the class again and make sure that my memories of the last time I played WoW (12 yrs ago) don't do me a big disservice. 
---
My goals in classic is do casual raiding/dungeons, and do Wpvp and bg's. I'll focus on raiding and dungeons first, and hit pvp more as I get a more complete set of gear (like no longer wearing lvl 40 greens, etc.). I don't really care about professions, other than the 
---
* **Druid**: I like the jack of all trades master of none play-style. I think their leveling is a little boring, I've played a druid back in the day to like lvl 25 and now just recently to lvl 14. 
---
   * I don't want to be resto in raiding. If I wanted to heal I would go priest, but I'm not really interested in healing after maining a white mage in FF14. 
---
   * So a feral/resto build would be fun in pvp for flag carrier/point holder. Would I also be able to tank lvl 60 dungeons with that spec? 
---
   * I also don't like being the weakest of all the classes. I don't want to spend a lot of time learning how to pvp with my kit just to be on par with someone who facerolls their keyboard. 
---
* **Mage**: I would probably go alliance only here. I leveled a mage to 20 just recently on pserver. It was fun and the frostbolt spam isn't actually that boring to me. 
---
   * I tried aoe grinding but realized I fucked up my talents, so I may respec just to give that a shot and see how I like it. I'll need to watch some vids on that also for tips. 
---
   * PvP seems fun on the mage, as their seems to be a lot of room to grow and potentially outplay others. 
---
   * Raiding seems meh. Lot's of summoning water and people just opening up trade expecting X stacks of water. Frostbolt spam seems alright, but not engaging. 
---
* **Hunter**: Never played before pserver. Just got my orc to level 10 and will get beast mastery shortly. I watched Joana's stream on speed leveling to 60 and the kit really stood out to me as being a lot of fun. 
---
   * I know (I've read) that hunter in PvP can be really effective, and there is a lot of outplay potential here. That is very enticing to me. 
---
   * Raiding seems okay, although it is disappointing that damage falls off for hunters. I could do engineering to help with pvp and potentially save the raid with FD/jumper cables. Could be fun. 
---
   * Leveling seems chill, I mean... it's a hunter. I enjoyed kiting mobs from 1-9 as I leveled up my orc on pserver. Just getting one or two more autoshots in gave that sense of pride. I don't know how I feel yet about the pokemon/beast master mini game. 
---
* **Warrior**: I played warrior almost exclusively in classic/TBC. I did prot for heroics in TBC so I could craft my deep thunder, and then hit about 1980 (20 away from gladiator) in arenas. I had a blast with both prot pve and arms pvp. If I rolled warrior, I would almost certainly focus on tanking, as I find it difficult and challenging and I know how it is to be in a group with a mediocre/incompetent tank. Not that I'm saying I'm great, just aware. 
---
   * Unsure about raiding. I never did that 12 years ago. I don't have the schedule to be a main tank, but possibly an off tank. Any former off-tanks that can tell me how that went?
---
   * Leveling is whatever. I played UD warrior and cannibalism helped a lot, but bandaging and eating can be done. I would try to run instances a lot as well leveling up. 
---
   * PVP: this time around, I would probably not really focus on pvp with warrior. And therefore, I would likely bring a second class up as a follow up to focus on pvp and farming. In this case, I would go hunter probably. 
---
   * I am turned off that warriors will make up 20-30% of the server population (based on polls). 
---
Classes listed in no particular order to preference, they are all current considerations. Any thoughts?
---
Well if the issues could be optimized/improved, why hasn't Blizzard done that for BFA? The server issues have existed for a few years now, so there's no way it's gone unnoticed by Blizzard.
---
If they do use that same architecture for Classic, they will likely continue to do nothing to improve it.
---
I honestly had the most issues like this with warlocks. They will
---
- not dismiss pets when jumping down just as much as hunters do
---
- dot everything, making cc worthless 
---
- aoe things, causing aggro and breaking cc
---
- fear the mobs they aggro, bringing more adds
---
As bad a rap as hunters got, locks have the potential for such group destroying shit when played wrong.
---
Nothing at all, I think everyone here probably wishes they played video games for a living.  It's being a "fan boy" of one such person is what is embarrassing.  
---
Made a human warrior to start and got him leveled up and walked into redridge mountains, before I even made it to the bridge to lakeshire I got oneshot out of nowhere by an Undead Rogue who proceeded to cannibalize me to my horror and amazement. I immediately deleted my character to reroll a UD Rogue and lived the douchey UD rogue life until around cataclysm when I went alliance. I miss you Thrall, come back to the Horde and I will as well.

I remember people flooding to WoW because it was the easy MMO, I mean, no loss of XP/gear on death! Sign me up on that basis alone!

&gt; Well if the issues could be optimized/improved, why hasn't Blizzard done that for BFA? The server issues have existed for a few years now, so there's no way it's gone unnoticed by Blizzard.
---
I'm a little confused about what server issues you're talking about. We've been experiencing issues in BfA lately, but I'm not aware of any issues before that in recent history. 
---
Or if you’re in a min/max guild they will just make you go Shadow Weaving/Holy and heal while keeping the debuff up. Which is terrible btw, you’re talents are middle of the pack for both so you don’t deal damage or heal very well. 
---
&gt;Rank 11 gives an epic riding mount to become available for purchase
---
Refresh my memory if you don't mind. Did you have to be exalted w/ a specific faction in order to buy and ride the respective PvP Mount of that faction? 
---
For example, I was Forsaken but I wanted to buy a raptor rank 11 mount, so I'd need to be exalted w/ the Darkspear trolls in order to ride it. 
---
I want to say that's the way it was because I made it to rank 11 in Vanilla, but don't remember getting the Raptor mount until after patch 2.0 was released....but now I'm second guessing myself. 
---
Most groups/guilds would prefer a holy priest who knows how to play shadow rather than a shadow priest who refuses to play holy. 
---
i hope so because my poopsocks are all clean and ready to go.
---
Not nearly as accepted as it is today, in general raids might be willing to take 1 or 2 hybrid dps from each class but no in general you will not be welcomed with open arms as shadow.
---
...
---
Noggaholic - Such a vanilla masterpiece.
---
Not sure where people keep getting this idea from, retail servers can handle large populations just fine.  It's also not like vanilla servers handled it very well to begin with though....
---
Benediction Cumberbatch.
---
It could be that my memory is foggy, who knows. I've definitely had a lot of issues in BFA, and I had issues when I tried to do a big pvp event at the end of Legion. I remember having other issues, but I can't specifically pinpoint *when* I had those issues. "Issues" being completely terrible server lag that makes the game unplayable.
---
When did they change the servers to the cloud thing though? If it was towards the end of Legion, then perhaps that was when things started getting really bad.
---
Bought a copy for my brother for Christmas, and I read the ebook.   Fantastic read.  I plan to buy a hard copy as soon as they are available.
---
We've heard nothing about the pvp system but presumably yes if they are going with patch 1.12.  
---
As for rank no it doesn't need to be maintained to keep using the pieces but since you can only go up one rank a week and rank also decays you're basically looking at 12-14 weeks to get to rank 14 and the last few weeks will require basically 80+ hours per week.
---
Shadow priests have to try hard, which most dont.  You gotta flask for every raid, bring 15major mana pots and 20 demonic runes.  Constantly have to prove yourself, and take gear from classes that do more damage.  Aq40 gear is for sustain and not more dps.  Good luck
---
Do we? Would you be so kind to link a source for that statement? 
---
Exactly why my first ever screen name was kingsizebd
---
I wouldn't hold my breath. This isn't like when they schedule the launch of an expansion and give themselves a window of time to develop the content - they've made it abundantly clear there are many technical challenges they need to overcome. They've given us a very limited demo of a single zone, running on a stripped down version of the modern client against a 1.12 server. That's a far cry from all the work needed to get the entire game with all zones and events running, verified for vanilla authenticity, thoroughly tested (as there are bound to be mountains of bugs with the approach they've taken), bugfixed, QA'd, and finally released. From having been tasked with refactoring large legacy codebases in my career, I can say safely say there's no science to their estimate, and it's wildly speculative. That said, it is likely that Blizzard is aware of this and padded their deadline significantly to account for the unpredictable. In the end there's a chance it'll be late, or a chance it'll be early.
---
Uhh no they can't
---
So basically, they would need a completely different server design for Classic? Would that be something they would be willing to do? I don't know much about how servers work in general, but if it would cost them extra money to do that, then they might just stick with what they already have.
---

Rank 11 has no reqs at all. No need for reputation.
---
No even racial reqs (you can be a Tauren and ride the rank11 Raptor/Undead Horse).
---
And I THINK (not 100% sure) there's not even a requirement for the "epic riding" skill, but by the time you are rank 11 you'll probably have it already.

is that you?
---
Based on what their technical lead said in an interview, a lot of the work for it was done when they added CRZ around Cataclysm/MoP.
---
Sharding started in Legion. Which can be an issue within itself. I admittedly didn't see a lot of 40v40 world pvp happening in Legion, but I never encountered issues often back then. In fact while shading seems to be affecting our large raid scenarios, it is what inversely helped with a smooth release of Legion. It's weakness seems to be when players congregate for large event and raids.
---
Current issues in BfA I'm having is lag even when there's no raid nearby, yet my latency reports appears normal. That issue is documented in the Blizzard support forum, but it's been several months with just the occasional blue saying "We're still working on it."
---
We should put a wall around darkshore.
---
you were supposed to say "reported for reporting"
---
I wouldn't raid with you.
---
Chances are I am probably raiding for you for 5 months with no luck at all in drops, and then my tier set/weapon drops and a noob that just joined the raid rolls higher than me and wins the item.
---
Hell no
---
resist, my friend. Resist.
---
The issue is most players cannot bring flasks as the spawn rate in retail for black lotus will be WAY down.  Most guilds will not be able to flask before raids.
---
They can't handle any medium-large scale pvp. Even if it's just one raid attacking an area near members of the opposite faction, the servers melt. I've seen it happen with just one single raid camping a Flight Master.
---
It's something I've experienced firsthand along with hundreds of other people. It's something which has video documentation via Twitch/Youtube.

---
Retail servers can handle large populations, until that large population congregates on a single shard via raid groups and start duking it out. I think that's the OP's concern, based on this details of his post. 
---
Old servers could also struggle with similar scenarios. I certainly remember rubber banding and long delays in Hillsbrad at peak hours. Yet there's some anecdotal experience, by myself included, that makes it feel like this happens with fewer people present on the retail servers right now. 40v40 in Hillsbrad seemed OK back then, aside from the FPS drops. 40v40 in Nazmir seems to disrupt the network performance for everyone in that zone.

Hows druid in pvp is it strong and viable? Or is it rather mediocre, ill be going for a dps hybrid build that is.
---
Why replace a vanilla system in vanilla, if you can just pay retail and have said system?
---
If you want the new systems, balance etc you can play retail, stop trying to ruin classic.
---
I am afraid you have misunderstood warriors. DPS warriors are top notch in vanilla. Shadow priests have some utility. There is room for odd specs, it is much more limited than in wrath or live but there is room, but you would have to expect to do alot more work to make them viable, and there is alot of discussion on this forum about it.   
---
But in regard to warrior, they are the melee dps class, but you should expect to off tank to be the most useful on some bosses.
---
Name checks out
---
I listened to one of them and he is an interesting dude, also comes across as super genuine and doesn't give a fuck says it how it is but in a nice way 😂
---
I'm going to have a Rogue bank alt called Leeson.
---
Ive tanked for pugs many many times. Do it regularly on pservers, especially in ZF. As one of the quicker hunters to level, its tough to get a tank in the ZF ranged because they already fall behind a bit. Very very easy to do, especially as BM. Boss fights can be a bit tough, but trash is WAY easier. The pet pulls SOOOOO much more threat than a warrior.
---
stop
---
If they're going to have battlemasters they should just allow people to queue bgs from anywhere in the world.
---
I for one am fine with traveling to the old bg areas, it can lead to wpvp raids on the enemy queueing area while you wait for the bg to pop.
---
Honestly now that I think about it I’m struggling to remember. But it let you charge multiple times without having to go into zerker stance. 
---
Warrior dps is in fact one of the strongest dps in the game so no its not just tanks.
---
Regarding itemization and stat allocation, classic is a lot more "free grounds" theres plenty to choose from and plenty of freedom to allocate those stats to your desired results. Compared to other expansions where gear was something that was dead set, you raid, tier gear is a definite must and other drops are just added to the BiS lists.
---
This is the core reason I'm asking. Healing as a druid is a no-go, I've endured it enough. Shaman was the one I enjoyed the least in the past (I've played some priest as well, just on pserver wotlk and quite briefly). Any hybrid feel is bashed by a healer-only tag and poor gear choice and little chances to get most non tier stuff. 
---
Have tried the alternatives but... they feel lacking imo. Hunter was the one that felt like the next best thing but still... Such a tough deal. 
---
On the other hand, enginnering was already considered ;)
---
With late meaning late summer. Pretty sure they wouldn't have announced summer as the release window if the chances were bad.
---
I keep my gaming office pretty clean, best way to deal with the dust is to hoover the carpet, close the doors off and let the air inside settle then I wipe the surfaces (and any books that need it) with a magnetic dust cloth which is seriously cool as far as cleaning products go!
---
Repeat every 2-3 weeks 😊
---
I've seriously considered druid too. I recently played one just to lvl30 on a pserver and really liked it in dungeons. They really are the veteran's class. Healer dies? Kite and heal yourself. Wanna do extra damage in easy fights? Throw on cat form. Tank dies? Take over. Even in a leveling cat form spec, you can tank and heal pretty decently if you maintain the gear for it. 
---
I am in the same boat. Got mine right after Xmas and have been enjoying 20 or so pages a night when it's time to wind down for the day. Been loving it so far, so glad I backed this book 🥰
---
Watch the Blizzcon panel.
---
The rank 11 mounts didn’t need rep and only needed the basic riding skill to use. 
---
&gt;No even racial reqs
---
This is not true, that was changed in wotlk.
---
&gt;there's not even a requirement for the "epic riding" skill
---
This is true. Only 75 riding is required.
---
Physical server location for me. Having low latency make a massive difference. 
---
Ah, the classic NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Sure. No changes. Which means, no classic.
---
QOL improvements will not ruin anything, they'll attract more players and keep more players. Pure vanilla is bad, grindy and outdated. Classic needs to be a remaster, not a reboot.
---
I think not being underleveled and having some offtank capable classes helps a lot. We ran DM recently on netherwing with a Druid tank, my wife on a ret pally and me on a hunter and we dumpstered it in like 30 mins no cc. Druid was 21 and we were 22ish. Healer was an 18 resto druid. None of us had much gear. I can see it having been a slog if we were all 18 though.
---
When I did wailing caverns as a warrior on LH it was a lot harder but I was 18 going in. First run was a slog, but I had no offtank capable classes and was pretty badly geared at first. The moss walker mobs hit like a truck. Once I started kiting everything I could it got a lot easier. I think just waiting a few levels makes a big difference and having a good hunter / warlock / warrior or Druid to offtank in a bad situation helps a lot.
---
Ok, it's been too long and I couldn't remember. 
---
I do remember how excited I was when I finally got it though. Rank 11 was no joke back then, especially when you raided too!
---
Most of your statements refer to end-game raiding or pvp. Most real "new" players who need advice won't care about those things at first.
---
Warlock and hunter are good at pvp in pve spec. Druid and paladin are decent too, so is WC mage during early raids. All classes except warrior and rogue have at least one spec that can pvp and pve just fine, considering you're not in a hardcore guild.
---
Yes, there are lots of posts filled with misinformation, but yours is not an exception.
---
The world does seem smaller, because you are bigger. I think the books fit well with vanilla in that you are small and there would be absolutely no point being involved in these upheaval events, so the only place to learn about them, like any (literate) peasant is in a book.
---
well in the german youtube scene there are a few streamers who mostly play LoL but when BfA came out they all started playing WoW (although they have played it before they became famous) and their fans too. They played 24/7, rushed to 120, did all the lategame content and then quit pretty quickly. With them, their fans. They already announced that they will play classic aswell.
---
It's already expected that many people leave after a short while, but on the servers with the streamers, it will probably be many more, so these could end up as dead servers after the streamers are gone. Exept for that, streamers might only start playing WoW classic for the views and their fans just because of them, so they aren't really passionate for classic.
---
But that's just what I think.
---
Someone else here mentioned that it seems like the servers are designed around sharding. Like they don't actually expect people to group up in a raid group and do anything in the world. They expect the automatic sharding system to spread players around.
---
So to me, it seems like they would need a different server structure in general for Classic. They said they would have sharding at launch, but they won't be planning on using sharding after the first few weeks. If they use the current BFA server structure, it will be a guaranteed bad time.
---
I have no idea what they will do though. If they are going to plan on using servers that aren't designed around sharding, then I feel like they would already be using a structure like that for BFA since it's currently not even working *with* sharding as it was intended to. 
---
They absolutely will need servers that can handle massive pvp world boss events for Classic. Maybe they will just have new, strong servers for Classic, but continue using the sharding ones for BFA? idk
---
I don't dislike Sylvanas' new model (wouldn't want it in Classic), but I do not like where they're taking her character in modern WoW, but then again I've felt that way about the overall story for quite some time now.

2H Fury is a thing, too, if "Warrior + 2H" is your thing.
---
While draconian Maul is a great feral weapon it just isn’t too tier since it doesn’t have feral attack power on it’s still I would rather have it if I couldn’t get either mace.
---
I've been in all types of guilds too (outside of super hardcore I guess) and funny enough it was the more casual guilds that experienced the most loot drama. People would come in with OP's mentality and get all pissy because they didn't get DFT after being in the guild for a month and it instead going to the #1 dps rogue who hasn't missed a raid in 6 months. So many entitled people would come in with subpar gear and minimal consumes and not understand how much work the rest of us put in to get to the point we were at and just expect to get an equal opportunity to get BIS loot after only a few weeks. 
---
In the more hardcore guilds people seem to actually understand the work that goes into setting up a stable raid environment and why you need to wait your turn for gear and how the guild progressing through future content is the most important aspect to consider. 
---
I don’t recall and AQ 20 feral attack power mace?
---
All specs have their place.  Just because not all of them raid doesn't mean they are broken.
---
Vanilla is broken with who can do what in each class. It feels like there wasnt enough time to balance it out until TBC. You should try one of those servers if you want the more playable old wow experience.
---
some of the blue gear is decent for pvp, a lot of T1/T2 is also good because it's just big chunks of survivability. weapon-wise you'll want a bonereaver's edge from ragnaros ideally for a long time, or an arcanite reaper/unstoppable force (AV exalted) at first.
---
getting bonereaver's edge is easier than you'd expect. especially on alliance (horde-side people play 2h slam fury with windfury totem + BRE in PvE so it's a more contested raid drop). it's mostly a PvP weapon ally-side so you can get away with snagging it if you're in a guild that does MC (rag/MC will be pretty easy especially once BWL and later are out).
---
the rest of your gear should basically just be a mix of PvP gear, tier gear, and other good strength/stam plate gear from raids/high level dungeons. 
---
If you're worried about specs, you can tank every 5 man/UBRS with arms, and offtank raids like that too with enough gear. it's not the ideal PvP spec but if you wanna PvP while still farming gear it works for tanking (did it on the L word server). to really get the absolute most out of either though, you will definitely need a dedicated spec for tanking and pvp separately.
---
Is the 2nd BIS cat weapon (unless you want to repeatedly farm pummelers)

The in game books are 2 or 3 pages max. They are all interesting because they give an impression of the original lore direction. The old gods and the ordering of azeroth is interesting and there is a book about how molten core came into existence, these two kind of tie in together. The old gods stuff is so subtle and ominous, it really built up well for the opening of ahn Qiraj

---
Was TBC allright.
---
I completely forgot, thank you I will look into that, boy.
---
I hope they have it out before bgs like they originally did. That was the golden age of world pvp imo
---
&gt;So basically, they would need a completely different server design for Classic?
---
Not necessarily, it could be a really simple fix, or something that is far more involved. It would require more knowledge of how their servers work. It could be as simple as changing some variables in an .ini file somewhere (like changing "max_shards = 1000" or whatever the limit is to "max_shards = 1") and then everything would run wonderfully, or it could be much more involved.
---
&gt;Would that be something they would be willing to do? 
---
Given Ion's apparent dedication to a single world (outside of initial starting zones immediately after launch) I would be very surprised if they haven't already done a feasibility study and are willing to do it. It is possible* that the changes might be more involved but could be ported to retail, meaning that retail would also see benefits from the tech, and that would dramatically change the perceived benefit of making those changes.
---
*I see this as possible because I would be very surprised if Classic wasn't always "sharded" with there being only one shard. The same tech that lets you deal with all players on a single shard is likely very useful for situations where you have one shard that has a lot of players forced into it. Although, I could be totally off base here.
---
&gt;if it would cost them extra money to do that, then they might just stick with what they already have.
---
Blizzard isn't scared of spending money. They are scared of spending money that won't see a return. Ion himself appears to understand the value that no sharding brings and, as game director, it is likely he who has to communicate that value to the people who control the purse strings if this is a major financial decision.
---
If you are a serious tank in your guild and apply for maintank, they will want you to get raid plate DPS gear for tanking with high TPS.
---
For example tryhard guilds on pservers give the full conqueror gear (t2.5) to the maintank in order to push the DPS of the tank.
---
Everything the tank can survive with shaving off tank gear, is gear that can go towards DPS and increasing his threat. 
---
Onslaught, DFT, ony neck, nef ring etc. are all great tank items due to their offensive stats. 
---
R10 gear is good too for PvP and most 2handers are PvP weapons anyways like Spinal Reaper, Earthshatterer, OEB, Ashkandi, DEoI, MoM etc.
---
There's never going to be a perfect system but;
---
Loot Council is the best when done right, but is prone to corruption and someone's always going to feel like they 'deserved' something more. (especially with 40 man groups you're bound to have a few snowflakes)
---
DKP breaks it down to attendance and currency which is fair, but you rely on the individual knowing what's best or being fair. 
---
Rolls are not bias, but random is random and anyone can get anything, or nothing. RNG comes with it's own bundle of issues as retail shows. 
---
Both arms and prot are viable in raids.
---
For pvp you should go plus nature damage to get off some sick thunder claps
---
You can keep MS and have an OT build and be perfectly fine tanking 5mans and OT in raids. As arms you probably won't be a great full dps in raids but a willingness to OT will help you get spots and any spec can tank 5 mans.
---
Ahhh man forgot about roguecraft. It's what made me start playing rogue.

---
Mmm sweet yams 
---
SFK, RFK and SM are all horribly out of range, doesn’t even almost match nearby leveling. The closest is SM, but it’s one hell of a walk since it’s pre-mount. 
---
Just because someone do them doesn’t mean it naturally fits the zone progression.
---
Based on a thread here a couple months ago, it seems to be more of a configuration issue rather than a 'capacity/performance' issue. The shards/servers are not configured to handle alot of people in one area, they are configured to send them over to another shard. Sounds like they just need to configure the 'shards' to handle more people.
---
I played Warlock in vanilla.  
---
No need to respec usually for PvE and PvP.
---
Great utility, banish/fear/shackles/health stones/soul stones/summoning portal.
---
Good DPS, your biggest enemy is threat if you don't have a good tank.  DoT everything unless they can't keep aggro
---
World PVP is a blast, I spent a lot of my time outside dueling and BRM PVP between raid nights, once again no need to respec.
---
There were some fun farming spots that I could solo for decent money.
---
There wasn't really anything negative besides needing a million soul shards to create health stones, etc.  Warlocks provide enough value there was never really a cap on the amount my guild would bring to raids.
---
Vanilla was meant to be a world and not every spec was supposed to be perfectly balanced or viable in all situations.  And items were handcrafted and designed by hand, those items with odd stats are there to provide flavor and uniqueness.  Changing classes is a huge endeavor and opens the door to more problems.  Vanilla is a time piece and should remain untouched, its not a remake, it's a rerelease.
---
This is so great. 
---
I always rolled ally but was very interested in trying horde for the first time EVER. (A traitor, I know). 
---
I’m inclined to believe that most people who played in the early days, have to be up early for work now (including myself) I think the 6pm - 10pm PST raid time is decent. 
---
I was definitely a ‘casual’ or ‘normie’ and played on and off through BC and WOTLK, (I was relatively young at release) and never spent the time to really complete end game content and really wanted to try with the release of classic. Would there be room for a first timer MC etc.? 
---
&gt; getting bonereaver's edge is easier than you'd expect. especially on alliance (horde-side people play 2h slam fury with windfury totem + BRE in PvE so it's a more contested raid drop).
---
That's a very interesting piece of information about Classic! Thanks! I mean: Thank you, boy.
---
Ah yeah, I was also thinking about going for an off-tank position, so I could be more flexible - so thank you for that too, boy.
---
This game is going to have growing pains no matter what you roll. If you go tank, there will be times your dps is lacking. If you roll mage, there will be times the tank doesn't understand how to hold aggro. Make one your main and one your alt. 
---
Side note...I am a prot warr main since 06, and reading this post reminds me of what tanking used to be. I thought it was a lot more fun, and more strategic. The tabbing targets, rotation, and holding aggro. Having cc's to help and position so you don't break cc. Oh the flaming when you broke cc lol Pulling one mob at a time. You really did lead. Now you just pull the everything and it all just gets aoe'd down. It's become so boring, I play my mage more often. Yes I play BFA, don't judge me.
---
I wouldn't change a thing.
---
&gt;For pvp you should go plus nature damage to get off some sick thunder claps
---
I need to tell people this. You are a genius.
---
Shit that's really good!
---
Alliance has more? That’s a good one. Running to SFK at level 25 or WC via Theramore at 20, that’s just a lot of time. But I guess it counts as “easy” for you?
---
Oh shit! We got some tiny totems too!
---
if your horde, as ally dw is way better
---
and op at least on alliance all 2 handers are pvp weapons. so you get an equal chance at rolling with whoever wants it. if someone went arms or ret pally to raid they dont automaticly get that over you if your fury unless your in a crappy raid
---
This is true of 1.12. Which would be awesome. However if blizz goes the 1.12.1 route, we will need 150 riding skill. Hopefully there will be clarification at some point.

This format popped in my head, saw it on r/wow a year ago and was hilarious. Thought I'd pick a zone I couldn't ruin too hard. Left the good zones up for grabs if competent people wanna whack at it (stv, tanaris, barrens, hillsbrad, elwynn, etc...).

My dad is a software engineer who loves google lol... he used to name a lot of stuff after google.. however I was like 8 or 9 at the time when I made my toon and he gave me the idea of mooglly... so I went with that. 
---
This is the main thing, since I've played vanilla recently I feel like I can act as a guide for people who are new to vanilla dungeons, and the best way to do that is to tank. 
---
One suggestion I really liked was to actually go druid. This way I can wpvp and tank. Even if I go into a dungeon as a non tank, if the tank sucks I can quickly take over when they die. Same with healer to an extent.
---
I like how you start with the now typical “I raided up until 4H” even though it’s completely irrelevant for the rest of your post.
---
If the do server xfere like it was in vanilla I think it was limited to the same faction, not from pve to PvP and no race or appearance change. 
---
This ain't a game lil whoadie
---
I don't agree. Pet scaling was also added, and tbc added arcane shot scaling which was huge for pvp dps. Even steady shot was useful in pvp at times where you weren't being focused. I would hardly have called it a pve only ability.
---
They just didn't plan scaling well. Even with steady shot in vanilla, most abilities wouldn't scale at all, and the ones that do would be out done by other classes having percentage based scaling. Steadyshot might make hunters even better in MC. But they would drop off just as bad in Naxx.
---
&gt; so you have to learn to tab  
---
No more difficult than Horde getting to Deadmines, but those actually have quest content available to Alliance where Deadmines doesn't have the reverse, which is my main point.
---
Totally can see that.  For me, at least, I just enjoy the implication that I’m done and like seeing other people come waltzing into the same area.  Easier for me to offer help or get help when there’s multiple people in one big instance of the game instead of a piece of it.
---
Do you have salted ham?
---
np, lemme know if you want any insight into that process. spec'ing as someone who enjoys pvp and pve as a warrior is a difficult choice/kinda nuanced
---
people also tank full-fury specs later on for more threat/dps, it's a weird time all-around as a tank if you're looking to be optimal. not required at all but definitely fun/interesting if you're into that kinda thing. another thing i'm pinning on is that some of the T0 good is good for PvP; the shoulders stand out to me, for example

Varied responses here, a short answer is to just go for the best, slowest 2h you can find (damage range and being slow is more important than DPS) and try to get the best mix of str/stam/crit as you can.  You also need to get hit for PVP as well, nothing worse than having a miss ruin your chance when you get in close. 
---
Crit is very important for PVP, you have limited chances to get hits on people and also get various bonuses from critting.  In this way, often a piece of gear with Agil might be better than just stacking strength.  Let the deep wounds flow!
---
TUF as well.  AV weekend can get you at least halfway to exalted and make sure to do all the quests / turn in blood and armor scraps and you'll be exalted before you know it.  TUF is a great early power spike and very attainable for MS warr, Ret paladin, enh shaman etc. 
---
I have no idea where you got that from. the 75 skill requirment lasted well into tbc and wotlk at the very least. Having them need epic riding would defeat the whole point of them.
---
Sucks when warriors with dark edge of insanity start showing up when aq doesn't even have a weapon upgrade for hunters
---
Druid Hunter. Leveled him to 25 then realized I made a big mistake going pve and not pvp. Switched servers and played a human pally all thru vanilla. Some say my dwarf huntard is still level 25 to this day
---
Came here for this
---
Yeah, I'm not sure this guys played through earlier expansions when they were progressing if he thinks this is anything but the norm. 
---
Everything. You grow up with no life skills what so ever.
---
You're not trying to do dmg btw, i raided as that for a while. Main strategy was to conserve as much mana as possible while building/maintaining the buff, and healing like normal. If you're good it wont impact your healing all that much since the only thing really important are the mana talents which you get along with shadow.
---
I went trihybrid for mana reg while casting + 15% off heal + inspiration + shadow weave
---
Hey all, 
---
Can anyone shed some light on Shaman 5 man healing? is it pretty good? 
---
I'm really undecided on what to level in classic at the moment, it's between tank warrior, healer priest or healer shaman (I abhor the alliance side leveling, it feels awful for some reason) 
---
I plan to raid, so given the - at least in theory - large number of tanks that will be around, I am concerned about getting a spot, thus a healer seems like a decent choice, especially shaman. However I'm worried about my ability to heal 5 mans.
---
Also as an aside, although pvp won't be there at the start, I would like to do that, how does R shaman compare to a priest for healing in pvp?
---
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks :)
---
It would be a safe assumption that resource scaling will be configured differently than retail servers.
---
I love Mulgore. If I was ever Hansel and Greteled into a video game character I would live there. 
---
It's less about the strength of the servers, and more about the strengths (and weaknesses) of the architecture. As we've been batting around, BfA sharding tech focuses on handling natural flows of players moving around multiple points of interest randomly, while struggling to deal with players congregating into large raids in one area.
---
Classic servers had a hard time with certain high-pop servers reaching a maximum capacity of players, but a single 40v40 raid fight wouldn't cripple the world server in most cases. 
---
These two things will likely continue to be true regardless of the "strength" of the servers. They could use identical hardware (likely they could have changed to more specialized systems for cloud/sharding tech), and still have these opposing strengths and weaknesses. 
---
I think the issue just boils down to whether or not if Classic servers, even without sharding enabled, will be using the same base technology as retail servers on a software level. I wonder if Blizzard would have to do some additional work to create two different types of technology running in parallel running in their data centers. 
---
raids will NEED 1 shadow priest for all raids if the debuff cap is going to start at 16, there will also be a pretty big lack of shadow priests so it should not be too hard to find a guild, but for sure harder than a standard dps.
---
You gotta mention the Swoops. Any hunters bane.
---
Am I the only one that thinks Thunder Bluff is the best city in the game
---
Yeah but like they said, the hardest work by far was to get the version to work on the new infrastructure. But that has been done for months now (hence the demo at Blizzcon). The rest of the work is basically just to make the items match the vanilla stats, balance the mobs, make sure instances/raids are running smooth, graphic glitches, etc etc. That's childsplay to actual professional developers with a team that guides them backing them up.
---
I personally think they won't miss the launch day and delay classic WoW simply because launching a game like this in the summer when all people in school are off for the summer, adults can take summer vacation and so on will benefit classic to the fullest. This is the reason they chose the launch date and that's the reason they will do everything they can to launch classic this summer.

---
Based on how the current servers haven't been improved since Legion, I feel like that is an indication that it's not a super simple change. I don't know how any of that works though, plus maybe they have specific reasons for not changing it.
---
I'm pretty confident that Ion will try to get Classic right for us. It seems like Classic will be held to a different standard overall. Maybe it depends on whether or not they view server lag caused by large raid groups to be a major concern for Classic. It's clearly not a concern of theirs for BFA. I guess we just have to hope.
---
It's a really tough call for me though. There is a lot of basic content in BFA that clearly wasn't even tested before release. Such as Timewalking Dungeons feeling like 5-man Mythic Raids.
---
Ion states there that they'll release the PvP system with the second wave of content, no mention of any changes.

---
&gt;It makes the game ~~easier~~ quicker -&gt; 
---
I have a lot of thoughts, some of them conflicting, so bear with me:
---
**Thought 1:  All Systems Are Good, Why Do We Need a New One?**
---
There are several different systems I've seen used:
---
* /Roll (with no modifiers)
---
* /Roll with reserved items
---
* Loot Council
---
* DKP
---
* EP/GP
---
* DSK
---
All of these systems have the potential to be fair or abused, depending on how they're implemented and how up front the Master Looter is with the numbers.
---
I will say that I have been in guilds that use most of these systems, and have found them all to be fair and seen minor bits of abuse.
---
* **/Roll** is technically most fair, until the GM says who can and can't roll.  Some guilds will put a restriction on new members (i.e. Trial Members in their first 2 raids can't /roll unless all veteran members have passed)
---
* **/Roll with reserves** depends on how much is reserved.  Is it the Legendary item and a few specific BIS pieces for the most important roles?  Or is it every BIS piece for the officers?
---
* **Loot Council** is the best way to distribute gear for the good of the raid, in that you treat the entire raid as one entity to gear up.  It can also be the best way of giving loot to the officers and the girls willing to talk dirty in Discord.
---
* **DKP** \- I've heard that DKP is impossible for new players to gear up or to catch up.  But I've been in guilds where shortly after joining, I'm bidding minimum on items that nobody else wants (so gain 1000 DKP in the raid and spend 250 DKP on 5 items) and the others who have 5000 DKP are bidding 3000 on an item.  I quickly caught up.
---
* **EP/GP** \- Basically it's like DKP, only instead of spending it, you gain a denominator.  So if I earn 1000 EP and get a piece of gear worth 250, I have 4 EP/GP.  Someone else who has earned 500 but the piece of gear he got is worth 100 has 5 EP/GP.  Even though I've earned more, he has loot priority.  There is also a decay built in to prevent EP pooling.  (Effort Point / Gear Point).  
---
* **DSK** \- Drunken Suicide Kings.  This is essentially a line.  Start with all players randomly assigned an order.  If 5 people want an item, the person with highest priority gets it and goes to the back of the line.  So if you have 40 players, and players who rank #3, #7, #15, and #24 all roll on an item, then #3 gets the item and changes to #40.  The nice thing about this is it's simple to track, and efficient.  The problem is that you might raid for 3 months without getting loot and be at #1, but then one item sends you to #40.
---
DKP and EP/GP can be abused, especially if the GM gives out extra DKP under the table and doesn't reveal guild DKP records.
---
DSK can be abused by a GM taking things for "off-spec" when nobody else rolls on it, so he can keep his spot in the queue for main spec.
---
EP/GP and DSK both solve your need to give veterans priority while still allowing new members to get gear.  (And looking at your idea, EP/GP actually answers a lot of your questions).  In fact, all of these can technically do that, as I mentioned with my anecdote in DKP.  So why do you need a new system? 
---
**Thought 2:  A lot more thoughts need to go into this system in order to make it work**
---
1. Decay - Linear or Half-Life?  Do you lose 1 point per week, 2 points per week, or do you lose 20% per week?
---
2. Item Cost - Is there a cost associated with rolls?  If I have a 50% chance of winning by default (i.e. if I have 8 points and the others going for gear have 4 points) am I going to win more than half of the items I go for?  Or do I lose points for winning an item?
---
Once those are answered, there are probably other issues that will come into play.
---
Dan'gul
---
Seems likely. The only thing right now is I don't understand why they don't configure the current BFA servers the same way we assume they would for the Classic servers. The current issue has been in the game since at least Legion.
---
I also feel like no matter what, the newest expansion will be their "main attraction", so I find it crazy that they are willing to just let the servers continue the way they currently are. Since it's only damaging the current game experience.
---
When you’re leveling, a non-prot speced warrior will do just fine provided they play as if they’re prot warriors and the dps aren’t clowns.  
---
Same can be said for priests - you can heal a leveling dungeon as a shadow priest as long as you play like a holy one. 
---
Why is DW better as Alliance, but not Horde?
---
In PVP and in solo, 2H &gt; DW.
---
You're acting like waiting for food to be handed out was a core tenant of classic, which it wasn't. If they added a table in 1.12, it would have been a very welcomed change. 
---
paladin has some of the best uptime for nightfall as both seal of righteosness and judgement can proc nightfall
---
Except for the problem that warrior dps is shit pre-60, what limited utility warriors have is also covered by the tank, and given how high demand tanks are, why the fuck would a tanking warrior drag along the most useless 5man dps class when you can just sub him in with any other class that would be better and not roll on his loot?
---
I was just thinking of this!
---
Also the beutiful green theme unlike the eye acid orange

This is wrong on so many levels it can run Naxxramas.

This needs more up-votes, it even got a cameo in the release trailer for Arenas!

Have you by chance heard of, and bear with me here because this can be quite an abstract concept, a joke?

You understand there’s these things called jokes right? And people some times tell them.

*swooping* is bad. 
---
I'm not in college(UK) and single anymore so I hope not lol.  Once is enough for me. Kudos to anyone who attempts it. 
---
There is no aoe pulls for the most part so tanking is easy if dps isnt stupid, knows how to cc, and can focus fire the skull target.
---
For every good paladin there are an UNREAL amount of bad pallys on pservers. The amount of crazy gear they need to be mediocre is crazy. If they do happen to lose threat? They have a REALLY hard time recovering. There are about 2-3 people who have consistently managed to pull of pally tanking in dungeons that I have played with. PLEASE, if you were considering this, dont do it, you are probably one of the bad ones.
---
Shroud!?  I'm generally not a stream watcher, but that might actually be entertaining!
---
Yes you are.
---
Hopefully there will be some kind of improvements or changes to the system. It's just not a fun system if you are going for rank 11+.
---
The difficulty modes are the raids themselves if you can’t manage to play on hard (Naxxramas) then you can’t manage to play on hard.
---
binding light trinket from bwl + holy light = beast mode topping healing meters. and with enough crit and world buffs and a few pots you aint ooming unless its like a 10 minute fight
---
Y'know I think you hit on a point of why it's not necessary in vanilla to have lower difficulties. There is no story arc. The raids are essentially end game challenges. Ragnaros? A minor side story which you stumble into on your way through a few high end quest lines. Nefarian? You see him once in ubrs? Onyxia is tied in with huge quest lines though, and luckily one of the easiest and most accessible. Only when we get to AQ and Naxx do we start seeing any issue. Even then I'd say AQ is the only storyline that you would have worked on.

But they didn't.

2h benefits from windfury more than DW.
---
Yeah I'm concerned to say the least. 
---
I hope the current game is just laggier (is that a word? lol), because of all the sharding and cross realm bs. As others have said though, the Southshore vs Tarren Mill brawl is unplayable and that is 40v40 and INSTANCED. I remember having large scale battles around black rock mountain, Hillsbrad Foothills, Crossroads, and almost every dungeon entrance. Of course, back then there were times of lag, but most of the time it was fine and not unplayable. It felt like it was more about my individual connection and not the servers. 
---
I hope they take steps to make the servers stable enough for large scale battles, and I hope they ditch sharding early on after release.
---
Because winfury.

---
That’s a good point! I thought he was asking if the entire system would work, I didn’t think of each individual card. Good point’
---
that works fine, but most people use improved hamstring because that one 15% chance can win you a fight alone 
---
[this is cookie cutter](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxbNboxuE0zu0x) but there's nothing inherently wrong with yours.
---
Seriously though, how could the swoops be forgotten? That swoop on the path between TB and bloodhoof village has killed many fresh young tauren
---
Yes, and they are one of the best levelers in the game, probably top 3. 
---
End game raiding you can either heal or off tank as well. 
---
It's been a while, I've only leveled through mulgore twice. I forgot about swoops woops. In hindsight I'd probably replace the yams, but the yams showed up on Google images for some reason and I found it hilarious
---
I can't speak to warlock, but there are tons of quests that are easier as a rogue than almost anyone else. It is extremely fun and cool to sneak into a dwarf fortress/pirate town/ogre tower with clever positioning and sapping, making your way to the boss room, sapping him and looting his chest for a quest item (and every other chest in the area for good measure) in a few minutes, while on the way out watching a solo or duo team fight through dozens of mobs with runners and respawns. It's a really special feeling. Steath changes solo/group PVE and PVP so much. As a rogue you get to think really tactically. OK, there's a three pack of mobs here, I'm going to sap this one, Ambush/Evis nuke the clothy, then go toe to toe with this third mob and hopefully kill him before the last wakes up. And then there's WPVP. There is so much to be said for stealth in wPVP, whether it's avoiding enemies, being choosy when you want to attack, or stalking and camping the one guy who ganked you, never giving him a moment's rest because he's always wondering if you're behind him.
---
Definitely slower leveling than warlock and many other classes, but it's so engaging. The feeling on a vanilla rogue is probably my favorite video game experience of all time. Also, if you so choose you can do crooked things (if you so choose) like pretending not to have leveled lockpicking when the dungeon group comes to a locked chest, and sneaking down afterwards to steal the goodies for yourself.
---
The thing that makes it really uncertain for me is that it's been like this since at least Legion. They will always want the newest WoW expansion to be the main focus/representation of the brand. However, having the servers crash because of largescale player events doesn't seem to be something they view as damaging to the brand.
---
The main difference between BFA and Classic is that in Classic, players are expected to be involved in massive raid vs raid content for things like World Bosses. So I guess if they expect it to happen, they will be prepared for it. 
---
Still though, if they are willing to do it right for Classic, why not also do it right for BFA which is currently the face of WoW? 
---
top tier flag defense too (more so if night elf)

This one.

It will drop, but a ret pally will win it.
---
&gt; The premise is that WoW was originally released broken. 
---
That's like saying a Picasso painting is broken...

Maybe just do the chill part quick and let her sleep to Netflix after?

Keep the alcohol for yourself then. Will make the dungeon/raid so much better.

&gt;  It is nostalgic for veteran players 
---
Oh... Sooooo I started to play Vanilla in 2015 and have played almost daily since. I think Vanilla wow is the best game I have ever played. What gives?
---
Retail WoW is long in the tooth. I'm overall ok with sharding 90% of the time I'm playing. I've expanded who I play with beyond who is on my server, which was pretty much dead/dying before sharding and CRZ anyways. I'll be happy to return to a server community in Classic, but Retail WoW just has it's own problems from years of wild player fluctuations. Sharding is the most elegant solution, as opposed to constantly merging servers until we all end up on one or a few mega servers anyway. 
---
used Turnsignal* once for a mage that never went anywhere, but for a lock... I'm coming up empty.

Weren't these one of the main way for Chinese farmers getting gold so they got nerfed? I vaguely remember something about it.

Nyquil would be easy to taste through the wine. Better to lock her in a walk-in freezer with a hardwired laptop, blanket, wine, and charcuterie board.
---
Level both. You have like a 10 character limit. Pick the fun one first. 
---
The yams are the funniest part of this.  Fuck those birds
---
yeah something like that, and a 6 month cooldown i believe. Pretty strict all in all, thats why i think the restrictions might be lowered. 
---
Absolutely. We all raided MC for the first time at some point. 
---
So far as time required, even when I was in a pretty "hardcore" guild we rarely spent more that 4 hours on a raid night - early on, you can split instances like MC into 2 raid nights (clear half each time). The instance is "saved" for a week, so any progression doesn't reset for 7 days, so you can come back in later and pick up right where you left.
---
Once the guild is better geared and everyone is familiar with the fights, you can clear a full MC or BWL in under 4 hours. Naxx is another story, but we can cross that bridge when it gets here in a couple years. 
---
The main time sink is when you're trying to be amazing at PvP, raiding, and have time to farm all your raid consumables. Then you can easily find yourself spending a few extra hours a day. Prioritize your time well, limit farming to consumables for raids and only grind rep you need to acquire some BiS gear (like AV weapon or off-hand). If you do that, you can successfully raid at a pretty high level without spending 20+ hours a week gaming.
---
&gt; **Charges** will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.
---
So I strongly prefer a loot council, but yes, it could be prone to corruption, or a perceived view of corruption. 
---
I remember in vanilla we ran for awhile a Zero Sum DKP system with Decay (and a Bank). Each drop has a fixed price and is given to the person with the most DKP that wants it. DKP is  removed from his total (going negative if needed). That fixed dkp is evenly split across the other 39 members of the raid (plus a "GBANK" member). GBANK member won most/all? BOE items to sell to replenish the GBANK. A "loot council" was in place, preventing a rogue from winning cloth pants "because he wanted them". At any point in time the sum total of all DKP would be 0.
---
At the end of each week, a decay "tax" is put out that removes a percentage (say 10%) from any DKP points, bringing both positive and negative points closer to zero.
---
Vanity items were basically straight rolled based on the member status depending on their rarity (excluding newer players)
---
Certain items were straight awarded (thunderfury and sulfuras, and iirc, trinkets come to mind) by a "loot council".
---
As new content came in and old Content became trivial, the fixed prices were affected by a multiplier (ie at some point BWL loot was full price, MC gear was .3 except rag loot). This helped gear newer people without dropping them too far down (attendence and decay helped bring them up).
---
Downside of this system is it rewards DKP on loot, and not on attendance. Pushing new content rewards little rewards.   
---
This guy gets it.
---
I'm planning on tanking simply because I enjoy more or less being in charge of the run.  
---
I leveled a lock as my main from vanilla through wrath, but then picked up a DK and found tanking to just be much more satisfying.  As you say, having a competent tank can make or break a group, and I found that I really enjoyed being that one that made everything go smoothly.
---
But then again, I'll likely end up with both, with my tank going mining/blacksmithing and the lock going herb/tailoring.
---
i think i got confused looking at too many levelling builds haha
---
sick thanks for the great guidance
---
There are two possibilities here.
---
1) They know the servers are broken, know Classic will be broken and hope that they can convince people it's good enough, while having influencers claim this is "Blizzard like" due to videos from 2004-2006 with fraps and PC's that couldn't even handle recording single player games well. 
---
2) They know BFA is broken and will never, ever say this. No business in their right minds would trash their current product to promote a product released in half a year. 
---
Burt yeah everyone is concerned and Classic will be a huge failure if the servers don't work like they used to. Example of how they used to work and this was back in 2011. I would also post videos of Nost performing even better with large battles but that would get removed by the mods. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-jv1orcCVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-jv1orcCVQ)
---
Anyone selling that current servers work as well as they used to though is either a marketer, influencer, shareholder or simply delusional.
---
Druid is hands down best leveling tank by far, its miles ahead of warriors until they get defense gear which is much much later into the game
---
dwarf prot warrior, way back in the shield discipline days. Which is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad choice for leveling
---
Yeah I mean you shouldn't use it all the time obviously. You can do a lot of quest content that doesn't affect the world or it can affect the world for everyone.
---
For example if you're tasked to collect bear asses for some farmer his pile of bear asses would grow, and so would it if any other player did the quest so when you first got to the farm there could already be a huge pile of bear asses there.
---
It should only be used for landscape altering scenarios or if someone dies. But it can also be terribly confusing. For example should Garrosh be warchief in Orgrimmar prior to you defeating him in Siege of Orgrimmar? What if you never do that content? Can you run into the scenario where you have Thrall, Garrosh, Vol'jin and Sylvanas all standing in Orgrimmar as warchief?
---
Windfury is not a factor in solo leveling.
---
PopDropnLock
---
There will be tanks that ding 60 within a day of the first mage. Even if your in the top 1% of leveled there will be 5 man groups for dungeons the second you ding 60.
---
In vanilla wow, it's NOT ABOUT YOU it's about the group. The game was designed to limit individual players' ability to prevent any class from being the best at everything. A strong raid dps/healing spec might be terrible for farming, or pvp. Other specs are purely made for group synergy, so in a solo setting, you might be garbage.   
---
This was what made Classic WoW such a great game, it required more interaction to progress, it encouraged group PvE as well as PvP, and the rewards for doing so successfully yielded the best rewards; and since itemization and random stats early game are pretty useless, it made the journey that much more worthwhile. In WoW, you earn your gear, you don't get a pat on the back and a free trophy for reaching 60.
---
Thanks, didn’t realise that. 
---
my reply is in how op is talking about gearing for pvp. so that means raiding content duel wield is best as alliance. also from the looks of it arms is a better leveling spec then 2 handed fury when you cant crit yourself for enrage 
---
&gt; Having decent damage dealers that cc stuff and focus damage on one target 
---
...do you think most dps will do either of these things? Unless you use those hilarious raid icons there's no way one of the dps isn't going to break cc on accident
---
Wait, everything on the internet isn't true?
---
Im going to make you luck my fucking balls and ill cum all over you nostrils and you won't be able to get it out and everyone will knows you're my lil bitch ass sweetie pie boy
---
[Yes! How was this not on the list?](https://youtu.be/uLDytJC655c)
---
I don't see them making new content, but how cool would it be to retune Karazahn and throw it into classic down the road. It would fit in perfectly in that world.
---
Heck yea...what you described in the first paragraph sounds exactly like the fun I want to have.  You're awesome, thanks for the perspective...I'm 95% sure I'll go Rogue.
---
That's generalizing it for no reason, no one is talking about adding every and any idea. There's no harm to the game if instead using the same button 20 times, you could hit one that's 20x the reagent cost and 20x the cast time. I see people trying to argue it "helped the community", but that's nonsense. Your guild was your community. Trade and general chat are your community. Nothing about trading a few biscuits and exchanging thanks is dire to the survival of the community. 
---
&gt; and as they are so knowledgeable about vanilla
---
I'm often getting the idea though that they aren't that knowledgeable about Vanilla, but that a lot of their knowledge is either based on or blurred by pservers. 
---
I thought it was interesting from the Nost AMA that their answer to if they could have changed one thing about vanilla, it would have been the honor system.
---
I by no means here to judge. To each their own. I've been playing Wrath content for past 7 years and cleared full Heroic 25 Icecrown Citadel - but it is a private server and some may discredit it. Whatever, I am used to that content and balance. 
---
Ultimately, looking back at Vanilla from where I stand, it was broken. But it doesn't mean it was bad. People played and people loved it regardless. Nowadays, on live servers, the majority of people have joined after Vanilla and they will struggle A LOT in Classic. But I am really considering giving it a shot as a forever private server player.
---
&gt; Nothing about trading a few biscuits and exchanging thanks is dire to the survival of the community. 
---
Did you read my post at all?
---
I will repeat:
---
&gt; I can also think about 1 or 2 tings that would be nice but the problem is that there are 10,000 people will 10,000 different ideas about what should be added. 
---
Do you get it now?
---
Yeah. People like this seem to think that other people feel the exact same. "They know I was helping out on this particular kill, so I deserve it just as much" and not considering all the work that went into getting the content on farm in the first place.
---
And one thing I've noticed is that everyone cares about loot, no matter the level of play.
---
not a meme, but the Hunter vs World videos were great
---
good music, a little RP thrown in, strong abuse of game/class mechanics
---
Shit, that's clever.
---
RP servers(they don't have sharding) aren't that much better to be honest, they still lag out with 100+ players
---
And what are those smaller books , with white backside and yellow and orange, they look like pockets from the  seventies , but they are bigger, given the size of the mug. 
---
I miss how you could have surnames in EQ.
---
Things like l2p, pwn, and 1337 weren't WoW memes. It was online gaming lingo that predated WoW.
---
That's because it only got popular around the time of sharding.
---
You’re not wrong, but in reality most of the differences will be minor. Most of the important principles will remain the same. They’re also aware of and have addressed said differences; incorrect mob armour values, item proc and drop rates, boss damage, /sit macros, server populations, and so on.
---
It’s all relative anyway; what I should have said is they’re more knowledgeable than asmon and soda, and other content creators who are more focused on retail.
---
Well if you quit your job and leave your family it is fair.
---
&gt; I've been told by one of the three that Tips/Staysafe/Esfand are rolling the same PVP server together, so I can avoid three streamers at once with that.

That's good news!

WHY DON'T YOU JUST DOWNLOAD VANILLA AND TRY IT BEFORE MAKING SILLY CLAIMS?
---
How was the O RLY owl a WoW meme?
---
You know nothing about Vanilla and still you claim it is "broken". Why are you even posting here? What is your goal?
---
Ele is fine in PvP, but there are a few things to know.  The PvP gear sucks. It's actually freakin worthless. You HAVE to heal and raid to get good ele gear. You simply are not viable at all as DPS until AQ after collecting gear to get past boss resists and you still are not viable in Naxx, so it's pointless.  I don't know why people keep saying it's "viable". Yeah it's "viable" if you want to DPS old raids that have gear you no longer need.  Also make a mage friend because you blow through mana just as fast as one.
---
Counters? Good rogues, good mages, Good Locks. Spriest is close. Druids are hard to finish off.  You are going to dunk on bad rogues though. They have to be exceptional to win. You can also beat a lot of bad mages to. SL Locks and Spriests can be played by drunk, blind people. Always should be a hard matchup unless you just heavily outgear them. 
---
Jointhedots
---
It is possible they are considered "sharded", but all players are always put in the same shard. That would explain why RP servers aren't much better as they likely run on the same hardware.
---
Again, that is just speculation. We have no idea what we're gonna get till Blizz says something or classic launches. I do hope they'll somehow launch with hundreds if not thousands of players being able to be in the same zone without server-side issues. Then again, it is possible they already have that and this is a bandwidth problem of some sort. Although, I think that is unlikely.
---
Shamans are great in 5 mans.  You bring tons of utility with different totems for different encounters, plus Ankh lets you rez yourself so you save the whole group time in the event of a wipe.  
---
You're not as mana efficient as a priest so you'll have to drink more and pay more attention to down ranking and trying to maximize your mana regen with the 5 second rule.  Plus laying down unnecessary totems is going to eat your mana very quickly.
---
Overall, I would say that the priest is the easier healer to run 5 mans with since you have HoTs and better talent specs for healing, but the shaman is a great 5 man healer and will be much more engaging.  A good shaman can really shine in a 5 man, whereas the difference between an OK priest and a really good priest is much smaller in my opinion.  
---
We could all play video games for a living. Quit your job, and stream 5 days a week. Live with your parents you’ll be poor for the first year. Then you’ll start getting subs and eventually make enough to move out. I mean just don’t be a complete dumb ass and your subs will eventually flow in through repetition.

Anal \[Beads of Ogre Mojo\]

Have I ever played it - yes I have. Blizzlike private server. Leveled and did early raiding content. I've never played it on retail, correct - which I have specifically stated it in the topic. But have I been interested in patches and contents? -  Absolutely. There are 1,000s+ of videos on lore, content, question, pros and cons of Vanilla WoW vs other expansions. I do not know tactics for Naxx40, but I do know a good amount about the early stages of the game that I have dedicated 7 years of my life into. 
---
The fact that you are so offended by it, makes me wonder how much you know about this game, and whether your memories of it are appropriate.
---
And as for what my goal is, read the thread again. 
---
Tranquilizing shot was such a great asset to a raid.   I remember being on TS cooldown rotation during boss fights with another hunter.   For fights that benefitted from it, we had to watch our mana and pop the cooldown when ready, which kind of meant we had to drop off the damage chart a bit.
---
Try /r/wowserver , you aren't supposed to advertise private servers on this sub.
---
I'll freely admit back in Vanilla I was a bad hunter and carried around a lot of cheap botton tier ammo and only used the good stuff when I really needed to.
---
I love lamp.
---
Take my upvote for the DAO/WOW Crossover comment. Alistair is *such* a human pally. 
---
Wouldn't call it fair, but it would be achievable to get to the top rankings then yeah.
---
If they keep the original system with no changes I can imagine a lot of account sharing/botting happening, as it's really not possible to achieve those top ranks without grinding battlegrounds 24/7.
---
Well, ranged weapons are not itemized well enough for Hunters to be competetive in comparison to rogues and warriors. Rhok'delar? 44 dps for their main slot, the comparative tier weapon would be Vis'kag for Rogues/Warriors sitting at 55,2 dps and then they have an offhand piece as well to add in on that.    
---
Then we can look at the abilities used. Hunter's have Multi-Shot (normalized damage + static additional damage) and Aimed Shot (normalized weapon damage + static additional damage), so in essence the main hunter abilities used when raiding is based around added static damage. The same abilities have longer cooldowns as well, whereas rogues in comparison have instant spammable abilities that scale with their gear.    
---
Combine all of this and it's apparent why Hunters are superb to sport in early content when progressing on server release, but quickly fall off against the other DPS classes as the end game progresses. The gain that a hunter gets from gaining 1 agility/rap/crit/hit is simply not near the gain that a rogue or a fury warrior get - and their pets are static meaning once you've mastered controlling your pet it wont get any better.
---
Angry neighbors should be centaurs imo
---
Good points here.
---
You do raids as fury then respec to arms for the rest of the week.
---
Oof
---
Shouldnt be hard to acquire it in the day and age of 15 minute emp runs.
---
Picked up ironfoe on my Tauren warrior on a recent private server.  Took hundreds of runs. 
---
Funny thing is the run before it dropped a buddy of mine told me to get it, you have to disarm emp before he dies.  Disarmed him at 3% and killed him and bam there it was.  Went back to test and found the disarm did not make it drop was just insane coincidence haha
---
Yes I agree, it's one of the many changes I think should happen. However if you try and promote that you will be shut down and shunned in this sub.   
---
Even Nano stated in his latest AMA that the PVP ranking / honor system is unhealthy for the game and IRL.   
---
I however will piggyback anyone who gains enough traction in asking for change because the system is completely unrealistic. If you aren't rich/don't have a job or family then it may be even slightly possibly to get r 14, and that still only a maybe. Thats pretty sad to think those items you will never get to wear even if you PVP for years
---
Saving them for desolace
---
&gt; many hours
---
Understatement to say the least. You would need to play for 10-12 hours a day for five days a week for about 10 weeks with no weeks off and that's assuming you have been able to put together a premade that is able win battlegrounds in less than 10 minutes (10 minutes for WSG, 6 minutes for AB, 7 minutes for AV). If your group cannot do these sub-10 minute games and/or you run into significant pushback from the opposing faction for a significant time of the week then you're looking at 10-12 hours a day for all 7 days of the week. It is a grind that is neither healthy mentally nor physically. It really fucks people up.
---
You meant /r/wowservers

Ahh Roar. I still have a copy of retrodruid's mental breakdown in ventrillo.

&gt; Because winfury. It's way more valuable to big slow 2 handers.
---
The most frustrating thing is being a warrior in group 1, while the only shaman is in group 2, and you can't get whichever pug wound up being the raid leader to move you into the same group
---
why would a ret pally want a one handed weapon?
---
It's not vanilla, it's Classic, and I'm ecstatic about it. Classes today are ghosts of what they used to be, and that's the largest draw to it. If classes play like they used to in combat, then it's a successful remake. 
---
&gt;I can also think about 1 or 2 tings that would be nice but the problem is that there are 10,000 people will 10,000 different ideas about what should be added.
---
Again, you're making mountains out of molehills for the sake of being stubborn. No one is taking about any other ideas. The only reason you're arguing against it is to leave in redundancies where it unnecessarily slogs the game down. Im not taking about anything else other than mage tables. Spamming biscuits doesn't add fun. It doesn't add socialization. It doesn't add role playing value. It doesn't add a sense of reward. It doesn't add a sense of nostalgia. It'll be fun the first few times, then it's just reminder of a terrible oversight. No one cares about the other 9,999 ideas that have been thought of. 
---
TB is so much better than the chaos of orgrimmar, and the ugliness of undercity.  By far the best horde city.  I guess stormwind would be better, but if blizz had spent as much time on TB as they did stormwind, that might be a different story.
---
&gt; You do NOT need to maintain rank to use the weapons/gear
---
When the system was first introduced you HAD to maintain rank to use the gear. Not saying they will go back to that, however it's worth remembering how ridiculous the grind was.
---
You don't understand my point. If they had added pet scaling/arcane shot scaling in vanilla, it would only have served to make them broken in PvP. It's not a question of whether it was needed or not, because to begin with the PvP balance at the time did not allow for Hunters to scale better than they did.
---
The planning error wasn't in scaling, but in not building a moveset that allowed PvE to scale separately from PvP.
---
Thanks for the link, yeah I've definitely kept up with kargoz and a bunch of others.
---
Haven't figured out about my buddies schedule. But I doubt he's willing to put as many hours a day as me.
---
Yea the plan is either warrior/ shaman, warrior/ paladin, or paladin/ paladin. The Druid is just something im into for a pvp  realm to have stealth and utility.
---
Yeah it was just something small that made you stand out. Sitting in iron forge with a turtle mount and a hippogryph hatchling would turn a lot of heads in vanilla. 
---
You lost me at 7 minutes per vanilla AV. Seriously, did you even pvp in vanilla?
---
Yeah, changes or no changes is such a heated topic it rarely gets any actual constructive discussion sadly. 
---
I totally agree, I managed to climb to rank 11 in Vanilla, but I would never even try that again if I had to go through the same system. Which is a shame, as PvP is really the only thing I really enjoy.
---
I would very much welcome some changes, or even an arena system. But yeah, just mentioning that usually gets you slaughtered on this sub.
---
I think I might just play a druid. It looks so much fun in pvp and has a high skill ceiling from what I've always seen. 
---
I'm stuck on what spec, though. I see a lot of people going with nature's swiftness and heart of the wild, but omen of clarity looks like it would be great. I'm sure I'll end up respecting a lot and watching druid pvp videos to decide
---
&gt;To clarify on this issue, the PvP mounts only require the Apprentice riding skill AND move at a 100% speed increase. This essentially makes the price the same as before. Now, the Rank 11 mounts will cost 10 gold, plus an additional 90 gold base cost to train in Apprentice riding. I was wrong about them not moving at 100% speed unless one had learned Journeyman riding. I sincerely apologize for this miscommunication, folks. I only learned the details about this change when I walked in the office this morning; and, apparently I misunderstood the riding skill in relation to the riding speed. 
---
Right at the bottom.
---
&gt;It's not vanilla, it's Classic
---
I honestly stopped reading right there and there is no point in continue this discussion.
---
Of course isn't there a limitation. It's just what most raidleaders want to see in their setup. You also shouldn't distinguish between PS and Classic. It makes more sense to split WoW now from WoW 15 years ago. Back then there were more Druids than today on PS because ppl weren't minmaxing that hard. (I played WoW in 2005, when 50% of players were Ret Palas, hunters or rogues)
---
&gt; just makes me realize how terrible Vanilla actually was.
---
The biggest problem with vanilla/classic is that for quite a number of classes their specs are utterly useless and theres no getting around that(ret paladin, shadowpriest, balance druid, more than 1 enh shaman). The saving grace is that with 40 man raids you can have 2-3 handicap spots for lack of a better word.
---
It would actually be pretty interesting if caster-geared hunters were a thing.
---
Uldaman is the vanilla dungeon where Shit Starts To Get Real. Things start taking an upturn in difficulty around Scarlet Monastery, but those are so short it almost doesn't matter.

First lock's name was midivh...you know, like medivh, but with an I... Next lock's name was devihm...god I suck at coming up with names.
---
I mean, yes, and I've also won 7 minute AVs multiple times... like in the triple digits. AV wins are faster than WSG wins if you have a premade of 40 that knows what they're doing. The hardest part is getting everyone queued and into the same game. Once you've got a relatively significant portion of your premade in the game (like 25+) then it's just a matter of riding straight to the general, having a geared out tank with 2-3 dedicated healers take all of the warmasters/marshalls while the group goes in and kills the general. 7 minutes flat if done correctly. Of course a lot can go wrong and about 1 in 4 games will get cocked up either by too much opposite faction pushback or a key player in your premade fucking up their role. Then everyone afk's out and waits for the debuff until the next one. Still more honor-efficient than sitting in a 2hr turtle game.
---
I was thinking of Tauren too, probably Druid for me because I love their lore.
---
Mulgore is my favorite zone aesthetically, but the quests are literally all grind quests and they suck lmao.
---
They'll always have private servers for vanilla. 
---
I hope they allow server xfers or something to deal with this issue. In some cases, no matter how much you plan, you may just have poor luck and wind up on a dead or horribly imbalanced server after a couple of months.
---
Wow that’s super interesting, thanks for sharing.
---
It'll be fine 
---
That's not even the biggest problem - it gets even worse.
---
Even if people treated battle grounds the same way they treat a raid - they plan ahead and have a full team ready to go at a set time and everyone makes their way to the battle ground location, you still have a problem that makes it different from raids. Raids you get there and go in. Battle grounds you get there and wait for an entire team of the opposing faction to do the same. Imagine if every time you go to do AQ40 or Naxx, you have to sit and wait for forty people on the opposing faction to get there, to the same raid, and be ready to go at the same time you are. It would be impossible. People would get fed up with waiting and leave, then the opposing faction is waiting on you to replace the leavers. BGs and raids are fundamentally different and BGs absolutely necessitate the added convenience.

---
Because this paladin believes in Ret tanking! 
---
I used to raid with a warrior who would say at least 3 times a raid over Ventrillo "This is the earth. That is a sweet earth, you might say. Round?" 
---
At the time I knew what video that referenced, but now the saying just sticks in my head every once in awhile. When I think of the sentence, I can almost hear that guys voice in my head. Like what, 14 years later? creepy.
---
Also not super related to WoW, but the "my spoon is to big" video was a huge hit within my guild during vanilla. There were a few interesting stick figure videos that went around during that time . . .
---
I totally agree about the quests in Mulgore. I love the zone aesthetically, but the quests not at all.
---
I never played a shaman properly. I leveled one up to level 30 once back in Burning Crusade, so I'm considering give it a try again.
---
I enjoyed the Arathi Battlemasters - beacuse it meant there was always a huge group of Allies within throwing distance that you could gank, fight, or otherwise provoke until you got a huge world pvp battle going on.
---
Point being I was able to PvP while in queue to PvP, and sometimes it ended up being more fun that the PvP I was queuing for.
---
&gt;Leveled and did early raiding content. 
---
And still you make the absurd comment that warriors are tanks... You didn't have warrior dps in your raid? You know, the best dps class in the game? Of you just forgot?
---
&gt; The fact that you are so offended by it, makes me wonder how much you know about this game, **and whether your memories of it are appropriate.** 
---
Dude, you are super weird. In my first post, that you responded to, I was pretty clear that I started to play Vanilla in 2015 and that I never played retail Vanilla. And here you are AGAIN using the stupid nostalgia meme.
---
So here are you question you asked in your post:
---
&gt; Is there a list, as of yet, what *quality of life* changes will be made? 
---
No, Blizzard said they will not do that. Pretty weird that a guys like you that watch 1000+  vanilla videos didn't watch the Blizzcon 2018 videos about Classic...
---
What makes is bad for Rogues? Ive exclusively played casters so my knowledge on Rogues is lacking. 
---
So is that with ranking and the dreadful R14 grind or the patch where we could buy gear for honor points?
---
Not necessarily "bad" per se, but swords are better long term.  Ironfoe would be best for a Warrior, either Prot or Fury
---
Bra tiltak! Nice
---
I apologize I missed that. You are 100% right.
---
But they'll have a horde (no pun inntended) of people helping them powerlevel.
---
To answer your question, and sum up the majority opinion here: no, there hasn’t been speculation about balancing every class and no, people don’t want that to be the case.
---
People didn’t min/max the way they began to in TBC.  People played what attracted them and made it work.  Raids were big enough that you could bring non-maxed specs because they bring one particular buff/debuff/curse/proc.  It made certain challenging classes in-demand because they took real dedication to play.
---
Want to be a spriest? Get real fucking good at it, nobody is gonna turn you away.  Really into disc?  Cool, I’m really into getting PI, c’mon in.  Now if you want to prot dps because FUCK YOU ITS WHAT I WANT, yeah, your gonna lose your spot.  Enh sham who wants to shock spam out of melee range because he’s scared of dying, gtfo.  
---
My personal favorite is the 2 handed mace that has a really low chance on hit to stun someone for 8 seconds. The one that does an aoe knock down is cool too
---
Haha same, well, whenever I remembered to buy ammo that is.
---
*gets to ubrs* fuck! Sorry guys forgot ammo! *hearths*
---
Dude, don't be an idiot. Blizzard said they will not add these changes to Classic. They said, to people like you, that if you want that you can play BfA.
---
There's also a difference in a clever joke, and an overdone "lol my waif dun like me 2 play." 
---
Good call. I completely forgot about this one. I don’t think it ever dropped for us. 
---
Another one is to stuff your mouth full of donuts or other bready product and say "normal" names like Matthew, Eric, Tracy and end up with Mahhew, Herith, Tazzy. Or at least a starting point.
---
Its not "bad", its just a complete waste on a rogue as Ironfoe is bis for fury warriors at least until Naxx. Rogues have a plethora of options that are better for them than Ironfoe.
---
Maybe tables aren't what's different in bfa.
---
Well duh, Ret Prio
---
&gt; This is not true, that was changed in wotlk. Only gnomes and dwarves can ride the battlestrider etc.
---
IIRC in WotLK they removed the restrictions of all classes. But those rank11 mounts were already not restricted (same thing with the ZG Raptor/Tiger) and could be used by all races.
---
Ah yes, the Earthshaker.  Drops in ZG iirc. 
---
&gt; Classic needs to be a remaster, not a reboot.
---
No it doesn't.
---
If anything, Retail's next expansion could be a remaster.
---
The whole point of bringing vanilla back is.... bringing vanilla back! 
---
I mean, if you want changes, retail's got them. You want to have 2 wows that are basicaly a copy of each other? What's the point then?
---

---
Yeah, the bosses are a bit more difficult in SM, but I think after the first two bosses of Uldaman things start to mold into what the end game is like 
---
Hahaha no I'm serious though. My husband sent me a photo of himself after a walk in the snow last week and your photo made me do a double-take.
---
Troll. 
---
I love the lore, but the way they move and hunch over bothers me so I couldn't level one. I'm glad it's in the game, just not for me. 
---
True.
---
I don't care what gender my character is, but for trolls I just can't force myself to play a male one.
---
Night elf for me is the least played. I don't love basically the entire upper left side of kalmidor. The colors mess with my eyes. I only ever played as a night elf past like level 8 because my buddy got his warrior to 58 then quit... Our guild needed a tank so I swooped up his account.
---
 P.s. if you're reading this blizzard, hahahahahaha you'll never catch me!!!
---
I was originally a gnome but never again... race gets dismounted when passing through the shallowest of waters. Nope Never Again.
---
Go back like 30s, buddy. They're taking about making changes to class specs. Which class specs will be 100% in line with 1.12. Mage takes aren't a spec. 
---
Those are some small sample numbers if I gathered that correctly. For my BA we were required to have a least 150 participants, and we were unpublished. 
---
Still a very interesting read. Thanks for the link!
---
I'm super into this book, been blasting through it.  
---
Unfortunately, it's also caused my hype to kick into overdrive and now I want classic more than ever :(
---
Next time when you decide to comment on someones post, even if it seems absurd to you, show respect to others. Seriously, you are 1 major dick right now. My apologies for not being as nerdy as you are - but guess what, this is precisely WHY I posted here. 
---
You stole my comment!
---
Night Elves, because they're ugly.
---
Awesome idea. Running to the bakery now. Brb.
---
I tried making a thread about it with the main point being nano's input about the PVP system. Automatically shut down by try hards.  
---
I can't wait to enjoy premades that stomp through ABs in 4 minutes and people Dodge battles
---
Didnt someone do it with 5 or 6 people right before TBC release?
---
My wife is the one asking to run it.
---
BFA DansGame
---
Guildbank, because there are so many problems with ToS and guild management.
---
Hairdresser, because I want to spend my gold on changing harstyle on my female characters all the time.
---
No, he is right. An addon can identify certain spells such as Winter's Chill, Sanctity Aura, Leader of the Pack, just to name a few. Tools like that should have no issue to differentiate between specs.
---
I would agree with this - i can imagine following the only quest and then reading it ends in a raid being a little disappointing if you didn't/couldn't raid, but it was arguably very accessable and one of the first raids that was made easier by later changes.
---
I think by tying the expansions and the storyline to a big bad guy there is the inbuilt expectation of seeing the story to the conclusion, raiding can totally be something else than that entirely and I wouldn't be arguing so vehemently for difficulty levels. It's probably also why I have little motivation to raid in BFA, at any level, the storyline doesn't make me want to go into any of them (maybe the new one but I think it's too far gone, I might run lfr once if I have the ilevel) 
---
Distance raiding from the story so you get a decent enough conclusion (that could even involve elements like cutscenes from the raids) and I think that would be a happy medium for WoW going forward - shame that it seems like there is very little imputus from the device team to bring back wow - it doesn't have to be the perfect game, very few are, but how it is now isn't fun. 
---
If you LOVE playing Warrior and you LOVE tanking, you're going to have no problem getting a tank position.
---
If not, she'll come back. They always do 
---
Troll and Dwarf.
---
The trolls mainly because of the armor on the feet and how some helms fit their face.
---
And dwarves because they are short and stout/fat. Though they have some of the best /silly in the game.
---
More like a hunter will need on it because it's epic and then realize he can't equip it.
---
I actually like FemDwarf because of that... 😅
---
that's a keeper!
---
Not about troll, undead, gnome, dwarf.
---
Hunterweapon.
---
TL;DR: he got a vaginaplasty
---
Hold your tongue and say pirate ship. /giggle
---
Bullshit.
---
How the hell can you expect respect when you tell Vanilla fans that the game they play and love is "broken" and a "disaster" and that it's "nostalgic for veteran players" and that "your memories of it are appropriate" AFTER I told you I started to play in 2015.
---
Your an idiot. There is no way around it.
---
Do you think people would show respect to someone went to a Wotlk forum and told everyone that the game you play is shit and broken and that it's only Nostalgia?
---
So no, I will not show you any respect.
---
No changes so the answer is yes. Close topic.
---
Gnome, in all my time playing WoW I don't think I've taken a Gnome past level 12. I don't think they're cute or funny, I find almost everything about them annoying, and I seriously don't think Gnome Warriors should be a thing.
---
flawed logic, 
---
Ret can't Raid but Ret can pvp  (ret valid)
---
Prot Pally Can't raid but Prot Pally can tank and aoe farm (prot pally valid)
---
I could keep going but there is validity in ever build for some part of the game.
---
A lot of the guys from Recoil ended up in Insomnia, might be worth checking out.

“You're much less likely to encounter wandering monsters while following a road.”
---
This tip makes me think of Mulgore.
---
At what level range? The more zones to go through, the more spread out people are going to be. 
---
Not a copy.
---
I want vanilla content with SOME of retails improvements.
---
Those memories will never die Haha

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18243/black-battlestrider#comments
---
There are multiple comments from 2006 on both noting that they were race restricted during vanilla, the switch might have been in tbc instead of wotlk however. The dropped mounts did not have these restrictions.
---
Do some dungeons, do some quests and do some pvp. 
---
yeah i dont know much about hunters but it is crazy to see them blowing up clothies in bgs but doing mediocre pve dps. i guess the same could be said with elemental. even outside of their mana issues they have poor pve dps but they blow fools up in pvp 
---
Sorry, I thought Inner Fire gave a damage buff like in WC3, so I needed it on my melee priest.
---
Use Strength on the Truck beside the S.S. Anne and Mew will come out.
---
Im 99% sure we'll see a token. And all hypocrits will buy that shit.
---
I don't like melee Gnomes.
---
Caster Gnomes, sure, those are sorta cool (I like the idea of a magical pint-sized powerhouse), but melee... Nah dude
---
Why is the cover this ugly?
---
Game was broken and highly unbalanced. Players found a way to coop with that tho, but it doesn't change the fact that a number of aspects of the game did not function properly. 
---
And if someone would tell me that they don't like Wrath content, so be it. Why do I care? I might give them counter arguments of why it is good or better than they might think, but I will never call their believes absurd or call them idiots. 
---
Take some Manners101 or something. You clearly got mommy issues. 
---
Byeeeeeee
---
I mean I have literally experienced this in my life but if you want to call bullshit for whatever reason, that's fine lol.
---
Yeah, I don't like Darkshore and Ashenvale either. I'm okay with Teldrassil, though. 
---
idiot
---
Thank god for loot sharing 
---
Thinking about playing as org bank dweller. Jumping around the roof from morning to night. How difficult would it be to find a slot in a competitive raiding guild?
---
Popnlock
---
Byeeeeee
---
Not counting Alliance, as I was a horde player for my time from late vanilla through Cata.
---
Weirdly enough, I largely avoided Orcs.  Not a fan of the model and their animations.  My only one was a DK that I only used as a Mining/Herb farming alt to support professions on my other classes.
---
Best thing you have said so far. You will not be missed.
---
Blocked. You are rude and annoying. Unable to express proper opinion and actually rationalize what you think, but only call people names and shit on them. As I said, you need to learn some manners.
---
Just get out and never come back.
---
From top (never played) to bottom (most played):  
---
Troll.  I hate almost everything about their looks and stupid jamaican accent.  Will never play one.  
---
Undead.  Also hate how they look. Never played one past lvl 15.  
---
Night elf.  The ears are too long, but I have played one  , but not much.  
---
Tauren, I kinda like these so now we are into  the 'ok' races. An alt could be a tauren, or even a next main.  
---
Human.   Ok race, nothing special. On alliance I usually make a human alt, for the quicker rep gains.  
---
Dwarf.    Beer and guns, nuff said. Always a lot of lore around dwarves is my impression.   
---
Orc, my favourite Horde race.   Original vanilla character was orc warlock.   
---
Gnome, by far my favourite race.  Warrior / Mage / Warlock and Rogue are also my favourite classes if I had to pick 4, so that is perfect for gnomes.   
---
When I got these mounts in vanilla they were not race-restricted. I aimed for rank 11 since I suck at making money and that was my only chance to get the fast mounts, and I had to sell off a large chunk of my inventory to be able to afford them. Instead, I think the comment on taurens being able to ride raptors had to do with the fact that taurens could only ride kodos at the start due to their size (if I remember correctly), same with gnones and dwarves being tiny enough to ride the mechanostriders. I vaguely remember this being a thing.
---
Spookyshrek.
---
A loot reel (sort of like suicide kings) might work too, if you would want to consider it. 
---
Like others have said, you want your system to reward attendance and effort put into the guild. In vanilla WoW we did a standard DKP system. As the loot officer I sat at loot tables before we started each raid zone and I assigned DKP values to every piece of loot. After all officers discussed, the prices were put up on our website. Then at raids, the people who want the item express interest, and it goes to the person with the most DKP. If there was a tie, the people who were tied would roll on it. People only earned DKP based off of items getting looted, so it encouraged people to use DKP so they could earn DKP, but it lacked incentives for showing up to wipefests or content on super farm.   
---
This was very data intensive for me, as I handled all DKP transactions, but people did not complain. We always deferred to the DKP for every piece of loot. There were several times where people grumbled about the player who go the item, but we said the DKP is the end all, and it avoided squashed some drama. As we progressed, there became veterans with so much DKP that they could purchase 3-5 items before falling below the next relevant guildmate and we found that new people would go so negative picking up gear no one else wants that it became laughable. So short term, during progression it worked really well (as long as we weren't wiping all the time) and long term there were definitely some visual issues, but it worked in allowing players to have a choice in what gear they want and feeling safe that they will get it when it drops.  
---
I feel a loot reel (which I used in TBC, 25 man raids) helps to keep players feeling like they have some control over which loot and when they feel they can get it, but it cools the extremes of the issues with DKP. You will still have people holding out for their prized loot, but each player can only get one "uber" loot for their efforts of waiting it out (vs many eventually), and new players just stay at the bottom of the reel with each purchase, so when they stop taking loot no one wants and the rest of the guild starts taking the newest and greatest loot, they will move up the reel like everyone else and be eligible for l33t loot like everyone else for their time spent in the cutting edge raids. There is no long lasting penalty. A loot reel is also a system where you can just let the loot system dictate who gets what and not have to deal with special cases, rarer loot etc. If you are at the top of the reel, you haven't gotten loot  in a long time and therefore you deserve whatever item you want.  I think a reel also encourages the middle and the bottom to gear up and not really hold off for that \*one thing\* Over time, with this system too, it favors the vets because once they have a certain gear threshold they wait it out to be on top, while newer people need the gear and get the scraps while they are on the bottom. But it is an organized hierarchy and one devoid of opinion and therefore leadership bias.
---
Duskwood does have that open dungeon with the ghoul crypts, though.
---
Trust me, as a Horde going to DM/Stock is plenty adventurous
---
I read your previous posts and replies...damn man, you are one rude asshole to everyone. 
---
&lt;Sylvanas Is Gay Again In Classic&gt;
---
Troll.
---
Can't stand the barefoot thing and I play Alliance so if I'm making Horde alts I've got much better options available.
---
I plan on maining troll for classic. At first wanted to go priest cause troll racial, but now I'm thinking shaman. However I can go Tauren for shaman now, Soo.....
---
I think tauren look awesome, especially in plate. I cant play them though for the same reasons you mentioned as well as their prodigiousness which makes them feel even slower than the starting area.
---
For alliance I dont like playing NE because of how detached their start is from the rest of the allied world. It makes early leveling feel lonely. 
---
Yeah in a WotLK+ AV. I'm calling bullshit on it happening in vanilla.
---
IDK.
---
[Did you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnnodvQgpI)
---
Hilarious raid icons? Marking is pretty common even in low level dungeons.
---
At least the names would be easier to understand than OP's method.
---
alright im rolling hunter when classic comes out
---
Mage or hunter for 60 pvp? I see a lot of people saying mages are better, and you cant really go wrong with a mage, but im worried about how squishy they are. Ive played a hunter on retail so i might be more comfortable with a hunter, but then again ive never had to deal with deadzone issue, and i feel like a good mage is better off in pvp then a hunter? Race wise ill only play dwarf or human. 
---
I have tried a mage on retail during wod as well and it didnt go well. So im confused.
---
Oh ya totally, it's hard to take charge of a run if you aren't the tank, and I just really don't wanna sit back while some nub scuffs it knowing I could have made it run smoothly as warrior
---
Friends and Acquaintances will find a server with good ping and good population. I will get a great name regardless of the server because I have played WoW for over a decade and have about 30 names I am okay with using.
---
Here is a list of the changes so far, these may still change with Blizzard listening to the community.
---
1) sharding in 'early zones'
---
2) modern water texture
---
3) modern vegetation
---
4) loot trading
---
5) no spell batching
---
6) bnet features
---
7) grouped content releases
---
8) no progressive itemization
---
9) modern API 
---
They may be other things on this list (like the wow voice chat) and people can add to it if I left something out, but the game will be as vanilla like as possible on the modern engine.
---
QoL features can have a negative effect on the community based game that vanilla was, so everyone really wants to limit them because of the unintended consequences.
---
And balancing brings a whole new set of possible problems and changes, so you will probably not see that. Though some have tried SPECULATING possible work arounds. 
---
Would be SO good if we could get all the pserver veterans together. Every. World. First.
---
I think you must have misunderstood the point of race restrictions, the entire point was about if Taurens could ride the pvp raptor or not. It's not about races being locked into their race specifc mount at r11 or anything like that.
---
That's pretty much every starting zone quest, but mulgore is better spaced out
---
I have tried a mage on retail during wod as well and it didnt go well. So im confused. I just remember i couldnt do any damage as mage because i was  interrupted or some melee was on top of me kicking my ass, in retail, im worried that will be me playing mage in vanilla as well. Idk.
---
Good plan. BUT WAIT, theres more! Getting a hunter into an MC guild is EEEEEEASY because they do SO well in tier 1. Probably the EASIEST class to get into a raiding guild imo. Hope you like winning every 1 vs 2 you encounter in world pvp while leveling because the enemy faction are simply a bump in the road!
---
Alright dude. It happened in vanilla. That's a fact. Don't know why it offends you so much. 
---
gnome, cuz their fookin geh
---
beaten up by gnomes in WSG  a bit too  often I guess....  
---
Didnt you block me?
---
A liar that demand respect...
---
Dwarves and Gnomes. I never could get into being short, and Gnomes in particular I have a hard time taking seriously, especially warriors and rogues.
---
That said, I am warming up to the idea of Gnome Warlock for classic.
---
I had once Ironfoe on private server. And it's funny what I got it before HoJ, and had to go 10-15 times more for HoJ. Played rogue btw.
---
Wherever payo is
---
i remember when people showed me "lava runs" after playing wow for many years...
---
i was blown away and i still flip/flop on whether blizzard actually predicted people would take that route...
---
the whole way down i was spamming my jump key and thinking "omg this is fucking amazing...."
---
BRD emp runs used to be a multi hour grind that resulted in the group falling apart at the fucking room where the forgemasters are because mechanics are hard
---
then i found out you could do like 3-4 emp runs an hour....
---
Not hard if you share your gold with them, i'm sure they'd let you into their guild.
---
Dont worry about the raid spot.  Theres 40 of them, and if you come in a set with your healer friend youre good to go.  The one that should be worried about a spot is the feral druid.  Mages can kill on the meters with relative ease and if you come in with tons of food and water for people, they'll love you.  Pay attention when someone needs a port.  People notice that stuff.  If youre quick and prepped with food, water, and ports, that'll put you ahead of the lazy mages for a raid spot.
---
I agree with the above but his takedown of the hamstring method is retarded. As long as you don’t run into other mobs, which is not a problem I have faced as you only need about 5-10 meters of kiting space to run back and forth in, you can mitigate a huge amount of damage, take on harder mobs, and reduce your downtime. Don’t overthink it, just stay out of the mobs range during your swing timer. Against any high attack speed mob you cut your damage taken at least in half.
---
No they are ESPECIALLY talking about class specs.
---
The patch to buy stuff with honor points and badges was 2.0.1-3 the pre patch to TBC which was in vanilla for a full month before the dark portal opened.
---
So people are assuming it will be the rank grind, but we don't actually know yet.
---
Idk why exactly, but my guess is that it doesn't interfere with most people's gameplay experience.
---
The only time I've seen that many people in a shard causing a server freeze/crash is during a faction city raid which is something that very few players seem to do these days.
---
In Classic the problem will permeate the entire gameplay experience, forcing them to find a resolution. 
---
darkshore is one of my favourite zones
---
couldn't you just war stomp and run away, even as a young tauren?   I don't remember any beast there being a real menace.
---
Haha you’re spot on mate. I wouldn’t tell anyone I play WoW unless it was necessary. It’s not like they’ll care or be impressed. I see it as equivalent to any other vice, just a bit more wholesome. There’s probably worse stigma associated with it than there is with being an alcoholic.
---
Little late to the party but mages actually want int and stamina gear for aoe leveling. Because if you oom in the middle of a pull = dead mage. Also + so gear doesn’t really increase your aoe spell dmg - mainly for single target spells. There was math done on the internet but essentially fireball and then frost bolt benefit the most (something like 99% and 84% of added sp). 
---
no, ham is from pigs, they are bovines (=beef)
---
Bruh shadowguard and the hex are insanely good. shadowguard will do more DPS at higher levels than devouring plague because it has a 32% spelldmg coefficient per tick
---
Agree. 
---
The hints are there for July 16 release. Exactly what you said + the 2nd character was Osconty which if searched on YouTube was a video of patchwork being downed. posted July 16, 2006.
---
I dont think there is any doubt July 16 2019 is our anticipated date.
---
What a fucking baller
---
But do you have McDonald's i have a lot of guess coming soon
---
Perfect! 😲

I think Gnome Rogues make sense from a lore perspective, but if Gnome Warrior is just a meme. If Taurens can't be Rogues, then Gnomes shouldn't be Warriors. If you want Gnomes to have a 4th class, Hunter or Priest makes more sense. 
---
oh hey warlock
---
Did you put on your fedora before typing this?  This is the Internet in 2019.  Is this your first day?
---
When Classic is closer to release there will likely be a thread dedicated to which streamers join which servers for people who want to follow/avoid them.
---
Taurens. They are too big. I prefer throlls or undeads.
---
I've always played pn RP-PVP servers and can confirm that the community there is superior.
---
I'm going for Warcock.
---
They just as badly hunched as all the Horde males, IMO.  My biggest complaint about horde is the ridiculous hunching.  I'd be thrilled if the 3 non-Tauren races had an upright option. 
---
Hardly, I just dislike overly cute races.
---
I'm sure in the future there will be many debates on either to have the 1.12 honor system of needing rank and competing with other players 
---
VS 
---
The 2.0.1+ system where you used your honor points and badges to buy gear. And have the PvP tittles still the same grindy way.
---
Let the games begin.
---
yes, maybe I was unclear , but the pile up + damage gear is purely meant for single pulls.   The transform to aoe is more about the talents (if you are frost you can already build towards  a hybrid or aoe
---
 build before you start with it) but indeed you would have to change (some) gear 
---
and make the night elves pay for it 👌
---
Well the dark souls series is my favorite, but I've been playing divinity with friends alot lately since we all just got it in sale.
---
I'd recommend vermintide to anyone with a group of friend looking for challenging coop with a high skill ceiling! 
---
No. Warlocks have no native movement abilities in Vanilla.
---
&gt; **The development is definitely moving along but it’s a complicated process and I don’t have any specific details to share at this point.** We know you’d like to have a Q&amp;A and a variety of things answered, but we’d prefer to have concrete answers to give you guys or new information. I’m personally very opposed to doing a Q&amp;A for the sake of doing it without saying anything new. For everyone’s sake that’s just the better choice when it comes to these types of things.
---
Tauren, feel so sloooooooow....
---
Yes I've been theorycrafting like crazy for troll priest. Blackout shadowguard sounds so fucking tantalizing. At first I was 80/20 priest vs shaman now it's pretty dead even 50/50 for both. I've always mained priest and never get tired of them. Made a shaman to 80 in wrath, enh was super fun, however feels super clunky in classic. Pve shaman sounds fun tho, and totems are just so useful in raids.
---
Bersorker
---
What the fuck is a subfaction. 
---
&gt; Vanilla was meant to be a world and not every spec was supposed to be perfectly balanced or viable in all situations. 
---
It's understandable how players have come to believe this, but the fact is that the devs have never stopped talking about all the ways in which they wanted to balance every spec. They left it half-assed because it was taking too much time away from [developing the first expansion.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.”
---
Orc, Tauren, Troll, Undead
---
3 x hunter dominates any bracket. 
---
it's like a faction, but smaller
---
Sigh, true. Hunching is a real problem in the horde.
---
Horde females have good posture if you're open to that. Undead female is still fairly hunched, but not as bad as male. The rest have perfect posture.
---
i am somewhat still up in the air how i am going to handle classic. in my early teenage years in vanilla i never had the time to play a lot. never got 60. but STV and tarren mill PVP was enough for me. in my early 20s private servers (feenix) allowed me to get 60 fast and did much raiding in MC, ZG, aq 20, and BWL.
---
as much as i want to dedicate the time to raiding, and PVPing the whole time inbetween. classic might just end up where i started, world pvp and seeing what havoc i can wreak and maybe never getting 60 as long as the world is filled with people its filled with fun. 
---
but if i do ever raid again. my favorites were always MC for me. BWL was intense and a lot harder. ZG was always a BLAST. hated aq 20. had the gear for aq 40 but never did it. and only farmed naxx trash. MC i think will always be my favorite raid. with rag being my fav boss
---
Do Kul'tiran humans really have a role in Classic than being quest mobs? Unless you count Theramore in.
---
&gt;Not necessarily, it could be a really simple fix
---
Then why don't they fix it for BfA?
---
Activision Blizzard can't handle "large" amounts of players in their retail WoW while private servers have 100 vs 100 pvp battles at the entrance of ZG.
---
What is it other than extreme optimism that makes anyone think that Activision Blizzard will "fix" their servers for Classic when they haven't even done it for BfA?
---
During this time good was still hard to sock away. We had people lending money to HWL’s so they could buy all their shit in the one week time frame they had before they lost their rank.
---
That is absolutely completely and totally the opposite of what happened in vanilla and on all the private servers. 
---
Im assuming there will be regional servers, so I'll roll a PvP one for my timezone and then look into other factors like potential faction disparity depending on who plans to roll.
---
&gt; It would be a safe assumption
---
Why would it be safe to assume this? Activision Blizzard hasn't "configured" the retail servers to work without terrible lag. Why assume they'll do it right for Classic when they haven't even done it for BfA?
---
Deadmines with a group of 19's is similar in difficulty to a Mythic 10. I specifically know cause I was doing both sometime during Legion within the same week.
---
1+ year and nothing to show outside of two zones? And they're supposed to have it ready and shipped in summer.
---
I'm very certain that a good margin of the game is complete. They're just ghosting on us at this point. No reason why. It's not like it's gonna be a new and mysterious game.
---
theramore and menethil harbour were both built and filled with kul'tirans 
---
Troll and Gnome. I never actually got a lvl 40 Gnome mount. 
---
Why not just have a separate dkp system for each raid? 
---
That way people hording the dkp can't try to dump it all in the new raids. But their attendance will still pay off if that sweet sweet epic finally drops.
---
Female dwarf &gt; all races  
---
Never played human for some reason. Neither any of the new allied races in bfa
---
Well to many healer is a common thing on pserver
---
&gt; If you need to leave the city, you can jump off.
---
lol
---
This is true. In PVP a hunter (in Vanilla) has to do lots of CC and kiting. They are actually pretty bad ass and can solo 1v2 in some cases, but they have to be played tactically, which most people don't take into consideration.
---
The hair animations!!!!
---
Pretty much gnome and to a lesser extant Night Elf. 
---
Gnomes are kind of annoying because the items are hard to see on such a tiny model, and they feel like they run super fast... which makes all the other characters feel slow. It's all the same speed but perception matters. Mostly, gnomes looked like colored blobs moving around instead of a character.
---
Night Elves... the male animations look like a cartoon clown. Can't deal with it.
---
Funny enough, Mulgore is one of my favorite places and Thunder Bluff is my favorite city...
---
Yea. My mindset is more similar to the people I've met on private servers so I'd prefer to stay in that climate. 
---
You said it yourself. Its not like its a new and mysterious game. The only things they could even really tell people is "does it have sharding?" "how many servers / population?" and "everything is working as expected/we've made some bug fixes". None of that is crazy or exciting, not sure why we need a Q&amp;A so badly when theres not much to talk about.
---
Pet scaling wouldn't have made them over powered in pvp. It would have been a great way to increase damage without overly buffing burst. 
---
And the scaling problem isn't pve specific, either. There is a reason people mention hunters shining in early 60 pvp. Once the best gear starts coming out you simply will not do the burst of mages, locks, warriors, rogues, or elemental shaman for that matter. As a freshly dinged 60 you will easily out damage all of those classes in pvp 
---
You forgot to mention the gnoll hunting humans
---
http://i.imgur.com/lXjyUmX.jpg
---
Gnome and Troll are two I've essentially never played. Can't stand either.
---
This is one for John xD
---
I'm just going to keep my answer short as other people have already stated what I would say: Vanilla WoW was imperfect, but that itself is perfect. There's no class or build in the game that can do everything. The world is dangerous, big and immersive. In Vanilla, people specialized. 
---
Oh man, what an attention to detail! I remember this post a while back. That would have been perfect for this post but I'm happy with the panels I chose
---
Well he's not wrong... 
---
You forgot the turds behind the tents
---
Idk, ask the one who got it the one time I saw it drop, lol. Luckily, I was a hunter and didn't need it, but our rogue was fucking pissed.
---
If it cant then Classic will fail.
---
There is also a problem people seem to forget. People need more tanks to dungeon groups. But for raiding, there are fewer tank spots available. Sure, you can tank 5-mans all the time, but getting a tank spot in a raiding guild is tougher and requires high attendance on raid nights. It is a lot easier to be dps or even a healer because raiding spot is easier to get.
---
Or when people roll warriors they want to swing that 2-hander into opponents instead of trying to be the leader of a dungeon group.
---
To be honest they could totally fuck it up and Classic could be a failure based on what we see, OOOOOOOORRRRRR.... you could look at it the way I do. I see retail and the future release of classic as two separate entities entirely with different teams with different visions for what they are trying to accomplish. Try to be optimistic, as hard as that can be at times, because as far as what the actual people on the team working on classic have said there is really nothing to get worked up over. I say we just wait and see what we get on release. Until then, everything is just guessing and speculation.
---
Those clips were amazing.  I cannot wait for world pvp again
---
Drops from Magmadar*
---
The Forsaken could easily have been a third faction, allied with other denizens of the dark and/or unbiased forces.
---
I think including other forms of an established race is overdoing it (Kul Tirans, Maghar, Highmountain, etc).
---
If you want to tank raids, warriors are way more sought after but you can play druid, too. Either can tank fine in dungeons. Paladins are less viable than warrior or druid.
---
If you want to have options, you could try druid and have the ability to heal or tank.
---
or just go for horrible, hard to understand puns, like Turnsignal for a mage... &gt;!because they are *blinkers*.!&lt;
---
Wouldn't that be human hunting gnolls?
---
I absolutely agree, the Raven Hill Cemetery could have been a dungeon.
---
Because you dont have the faintest idea of how server architecture works.
---
Retail shards sucking does not indicate classic servers will suck, it just shows that they could. You just gotta hope they know what they doing. As far as we know, it could be a very minor tweak to ensure that never happens with classic server hardware.
---
This is true for almost all issue people in these subs have seen. Most of the issues people have seen seemed to be very minor work that a single dev could knock out over a week. ie regen would probably take a dev an hour to fix, validate, and pass on to QA. The only issues that we saw that would take a long time to fix are the issue like batching that require business meetings to determine if they are even worth doing.
---
People dont want to hear objective truth.
---
Troll priest named Troll. I'm gonna hang out by the ramp of BRM and mind control people into the lava all day.
---
You will felt maces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
Hunters are stupid OP in classic. Especially if you get Lupos (Though I think blizzard may nerf this earlier than they did at vanilla release).
---
However, if you do roll NE hunter be prepared to get made fun of all the time. Hunters in vanilla are the OP class for sure, but they all develop inferiority complexes. And Nightelves are the worst.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Where did you get that cool emblem to the right of the mug?
---
Hunters are kings at world pvp through leveling. Rogues are only good at ganking people but if you’re caught with your pants down you’re fucked.
---
the tauren and night elves could have been a third nature based faction too, angry at the other 2 factions for destroying nature in an attempt to destroy each other 
---
Vanilla is broken and you guys want that. I dont even understand the nerd rage over this. You cant even admit what you want.
---
Leveling dungeons may be harder in vanilla compared to retail but they were still designed for new players. They require attention and patience but that's about it.
---
More than skill level I expect character level to be a problem. It's hard to get through dungeons when half or more of the party are under level.
---
Now say “apple”.
---
I posted you a video of AV being done in under 4 minutes (6 minutes if you count the 2 mins before the gates open) done before the TBC patch and you ignored it. Stop plugging your fingers in your ears.
---
So just another useless community manager attempt to appease people. Waste of time.
---
Definitely. Much more level-headed expectations and seem to have a better grasp of the reality of Classic.  
---
I played one on Ascension WoW
---
https://project-ascension.com
---
I want authentic Vanilla because its the best game that I have ever played.
---
Whorelock
---
Blood Elves, I guess. That was one thing I missed going from WC3 to when I first played WoW back in like 05 or 06. Playing through their Starting Area was a huge highlight of TBC for me. The music, the environments, the zombies, all that shit was great.
---
Human. I always find it boring to play humans in a fantasy game and would rather play as a different/interesting looking race.
---
Well they didn't exist at the start of vanilla so I assume they won't have them so we get the real experience. 
---
Plus easily defended with a knockback or two ;-)
---
I'd *really* like them to open up discussion about the content release schedule, for one. I'd like to hear their reasoning behind only 4 stages, and why they decided to put certain releases together in stages. That's something that could easily (and deserves to) be a Q&amp;A.
---
[Watch ClassiCast's video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUTkeX0ubVM) They sum it up the issues with it pretty well. 
---
My man.
---
Those hips, them tits!
---
I'm fine with them just ghosting it, we already know what the game is like, just let the development process play out quietly. The only pressing questions we have is best saved for closer to release.
---
Or they add in some world epic they found/had equipped just to tease you, then close the window.
---
I think you overestimate the streamer fanbase compared to regular wow fanbase, m'dude
---
Cheers!
---
Empty 1 gallon bottles of green tea work so good. They have big openings which come in handy. So I heard.
---
I can only speak for my own experience, but quick AV games did occasionally happen on my server during Vanilla. I distinctly remember one game lasting 8 minutes and I was utterly gobsmacked (because we got so insanely trashed). I also remember a 13 minute game for the same reason.
---
Most games weren’t like that for me but rarely they were
---
it's actually really good cause of 5% more intelligence. More int = more mana &amp; crit, both of which a raid-aimed WL really needs. I feel as if Warlocks go oom pretty quickly, even with BoW.
---
This would be so detrimental for classic I might unsub if this turns out to be the case. That being said, I'm pretty confident they're not doing this. They changed how their servers work in BFA because they want sharding to save them energy and money. 
---
However they aren't going to shard 99% of vanilla, besides the opening few weeks. Therefore they HAVE to use different server tech. I'm confident they aren't going to shard after the opening of classic, because they said they won't.  The know that sharding classic would kill one of the fundamental reasons why people are playing classic.
---
If they shard classic, I'm unsubbing and never giving Blizzard another cent. 
---
I kinda like the BfA Void Elf aesthetics, but I quit WoW with Cata, so that's that.
---
Your dps is low, and one handed weapons swing quickly.
---
Low dps not only means you will have slower kill speeds, but you will also take more damage (even with your shield) and you'll have longer recovery time, using lots of consumables. You also don't have a good kit for dealing with multiple adds.
---
The best way to level with a warrior is to hamstring kite, so that you take as little damage as possible. However, this is easiest and best with a slow weapon, e.g. 2 handers. With faster swing times, it's a lot less effective.
---
Hearthstone was a very small team that started out as a side project. Heroes of the storm failed to compete and it’s only natural that it eventual began phasing out.
---
I don’t see how this has anything to do with the Classic WoW team in relation to the Retail team.
---
Look on the talents: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#L
---
You dont get anything you need outside of raiding. Warriors can tank in any spec so its a waste to use prot talents for leveling and dungeons.
---
As prot you do much less damage and that means that you take more damage. Its just bad unless you really need it (end game dungeons and raids).
---
If you haven't played rogue, it's so much fun. If you like toying with people, sap is fantastic.  Distract changes their direction, and you have vanish, should anything go wrong.
---
Gnome warriors are certainly not a meme in PvP.
---
The answer remains unchanged though.
---
You can't compare retail and classic since they aren't even the same game design.  It could be like comparing a 32 core processor with slow individual cores compared to an 8 core processor with very fast individual cores, they will react different under load depending on the purpose of the program.  They're planning the infrastructure out with the exact needs in mind, they even know exactly what to expect besides having a new engine that will add to the overhead.  They didn't mess it up with 14 year old server technology with 8+ guilds PVPing their way into BWL/MC.  Add leaps and bounds hardware and technological based advanced I would be blown away if they somehow screwed to pooch on it.  AQ40 was the only time I can remember the server just taking a complete shit with the entire server in one zone.  They were probably all on the same exact hardware though, before the days of load balancing and nodes reporting to a single source
---
Fury will tank better than prot to level. Prot has TERRIBLE leveling efficiency. There is NO point on going prot pre raid. Should probably play fury/arms to level and look at going prot if you are planning on raid tanking. Otherwise, prot is useless. You're simply gimping yourself for the sake of gimping yourself.
---
Tri-faction is a tried and true way to balance factions on servers to keep power in check (see dark age of Camelot and planetside).  In some ways it’s disappointing there’s no 3rd faction in this game, but that’s a rabbit hole of “what ifs”.
---
I guess Mulgore just has really bad drop rates then because I hate it :/
---
This is a big concern for me about Classic. The horrible performance in BFA is not a good sign.
---
I agree with others, the way the game runs right now it doesn't even feel like an MMORPG anymore. This has to be fixed for Classic or it just won't work.
---
I think Rogue would be more enjoyable cause it's so much easier to Fk with people in Wpvp while solo, in the short run both will be fun for Exploring and Wpvp but I there is just so much more you can do as a Rogue to mix things up and have a good time :) 
---
I'm answering a question?
---
' Is there any reason why Blizzard wouldnt be able to operate 2 dev teams at the same level of quality? '
---
That is the answer. Whats the point of your reply?
---
&gt;they want sharding to save them energy and money.
---
I don't think anywhere in the mission statement for BfA did they write "laggy, unstable servers where large scale wpvp is impossible."
---
In fact, their goal is the exact opposite of that. And yet they can't accomplish it.
---
There is absolutely zero reason to think they'll do it any differently for Classic.
---
This isn't about sharding. It's about their current server technology not being able to handle 'large' amounts of players in the same place. Something that private servers run by Russians in a basement can do.
---
Historically Blizzard doesn't give a ton of details outside of events like Blizzcon.  Why would you assume this would be any different?
---
Blizzard "Soon^TM" is a meme for a reason
---
Well my experience of online gaming for almost 20 years now says the one thing about the subject. 
---
No matter how peculiar your nickname is, the first thing you got to consider is how the short version (3-4 letters, 1-2 syllables) gonna sound like. 
---
Try to predict the result and imagine people call you like that every time in voice chat. 
---
When you're ok with the result you ended up with, go on and take that name.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
There is no sharding here whatsoever. It's a large group of players trying to raid a city, and everything crashing.
---
I will raid, however probably not very often. I'll probably be a backup raider in a guild I think. Also in raids, rogues have to contest with more classes for gear than hunters.
---
Also, I am almost certain that Lupos will be nerfed in Classic as he was never intended to be so strong as a pet in the first place. 
---
I quite dislike Gnomes. Too small.
---
I rarely play Dwarves because I find their casting/melee animations to both be quite bad. 
---
I'm maining a Troll priest named Troll. Going to spend all my time camping BRM mind controlling people into the lava.
---
I only rolled a human once in beta to check paladin/stormwind out. Humans just never tended to be the min-max race for me on all the classes I decided to play on alliance, so no real malice just a coincidence.
---
AV's are super quick on private servers.  The honor per hour is wayyyyy better even if you lose quickly.
---
Can't bring myself to play a female character.. breaks my immersion for some reason
---
Oh yer, Hunters can 1v2 people if played correctly. But they lack the exploration possibilities that come with a rogue. A rogue is free to explore freely as they can always vanish. A hunter always has to watch his back.
---
Hehe. The bear would be a problem.
---
Yup, I did main one for several years. Probably in MoP or something. Very fun to play for sure. 
---
What's the point with this thread?
---
We are getting the ranking system.  Honor points as a currency system didn't exist until later.
---
This is pretty much where I'm at. I think I agree with your logic. all I have to do is survive the leveling experience :P
---
My hope is that less flashy animations and skills used in General, as well as the old simpler version of the game should have an easier time running with new Server tech than it did in 2006 where have a 100 man fight wasn't great but it was possible
---
People will tell you not to level as prot because it's not as fast as the old min-maxed builds. If you don't mind taking longer on each fight then go for it. It's game, the point is to have fun and waste time.
---
It's not designed to necessarily be "fun or fair".  It's a hardcore achievement for hardcore PVPers
---
looks like the horde could use a few more subfactions
---
They changed their servers in BFA, they are worse, and it's all for the sake of saving money. That's just a fact, the old servers could run raids like this no problem. I used to take part in 80 man raids in MOP and it was beautiful. It's not like they don't have the ability, the reason they don't use the old server tech is because they think sharding would be enough (it's not and was a greedy terrible thing to do). However, since they aren't using sharding in classic they CAN'T use the BFA servers, since the BFA servers require sharding to work.
---
All you can upgrade is STRANGTH?!
---
Gnomes.   
---
I just can't do it. I like to take the plot seriously, and establish headcanon for things. I can't take gnomes seriously.
---
In North America, everywhere else they are Indicators :)
---
I always play horde, and the answer is Troll. They look dumb to me, and that Jamaican dance is retarded. Also, I don't PvE so where's the benefit.
---
Most likely the average raid will want Druids to heal. There's always the chance of finding a group that's willing to be more flexible for one of their dedicated players.
---
Outside of raids a Druid can do pretty much anything they want.
---
Cool thanks
---
I don't understand how Blizzard develops games. They probably use some agile method and not the waterfall model, but I feel like it's dishonest to suggest that they have nothing major to share. Surely they must have decided upon some major design decisions by this point. E.g. progressive itemization, spell batching, etc.
---
Gnomes. I don't like getting lost in a small bush. Goblins ears at least stick out!
---
I main tanked mc as a Druid and I main tanked bwl as a Druid. It can be done and it can be done with ease. I get it warrior is better but ffs I did a fine job and my raids weren’t always top tier. I was able to easily acquire a fr set of 315 with and without buffs. Again you can do it with ease. Are you a shit Druid? That’s the real question. Know your role and you will be fine. Try and out tank the offtanks and you will do better. 
---
Dotty McDotface
---
Hi, /u/Greebsman
---
Ugh blocked at work, what was the main gist? (Or copy-paste?)
---
&gt;They changed their servers in BFA, they are worse, and it's all for the sake of saving money.
---
And why would one assume that they won't save money with Classic in the same way?
---
Absolutely every *change* to Vanilla we've heard about so far has been a cost cutting measure.
---
Loot trading to cut on customer service costs.
---
Right click report and automated silence to cut on customer service costs.
---
Fewer content patches (only 4) to cut development and rollout costs.
---
I'll second this - I played a Troll Hunter on a pvp server, and with Track Humanoids on, I pulled off some ridiculous world pvp fights off. Being able to detect nearby players, come up on an blind spot (via large trees or terrain) and start killing them through terrain.  
---
I remember pulling off a few 4v1  in STV by coming up behind a group and shooting through a tree.  
---
Some Modern mods may counter this, but hunter pvp was always fun for me.
---
For me even to this day I can’t seem to play undead. For some reason they just seem too evil. As far as alliance goes I’d have to say gnome. Their movement always seems so clunky I have never liked their mounts.
---
Is there even any knockback spell in Classic ?
---
You forgot to mention worst drop-rate quest in the game.
---
I think you could only link items that existed on server since it reset. You could even fish for raidid with specific items in it if you logged first after the reset.
---
Blood elves were a great addition. Unfortunately Draenei were a stupid one.
---
How are you main tanking BWL when Nef exists?
---
Chromag would also be a pain in low gear.
---
I’ve really only played NE, and it’s because I think all other races are ugly. Female human is ok, but I feel weird playing a female in an rpg. 
---
Because to cut this cost, they HAVE to use sharding. Again, if they shard vanilla, people are going to be so pissed they'll just leave. Blizzard is very aware there are functional free alternatives people could easily go to. They have stated multiple times they are very aware that community servers with 0 sharding are a core feature of vanilla. This is one cost they can't cut without sharding, and if they do introduce sharding, they'll lose people to the free and very functional pservers.  
---
Yup. If Classic runs as poorly as BFA then it won't work.

And uh... lots more.

But I'm unsure what got popular in TBC, it's been so long now.

Also!

Gnomes. Because they are for punting not for playing. 
---
The thing that kept most hunters from having Lupos was general ignorance and spawn timers.
---
With the number of people that are going to play WoW I wonder what spawn timers will be like, and general ignorance will cease to exist.
---
You gotta raid at least until you get Rok as a hunter.
---
Breh we have months before the games out, they don't need to talk about any of that at this moment because it can be done near launch.
---
Fuck this suggestion in particular 
---
[I provided it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/agp4yl/blue_post_from_blizzard_community_manager/ee7ulyo/)
---
I was thinking the same.
---
One thing I really would've LOVED to have seen would be different playable "races" under the Forsaken banner. They all have the same racials a typical Forsaken, but some would be gnomes, or dwarves, or (blood) elves. 
---
Humans, why play boring humans ?
---
Oops my bad, thanks
---
You are seriously foolhardy in this. Adding 50 DPS to Naxxramas-level pets wouldn't have made them overpowered in PvP. Adding 100 DPS would be a stretch, but lets just say this is still somehow acceptable.
---
Except Hunters aren't 50 DPS short, or 100 DPS. They're over 200 DPS short, closer to 250. There is *no way* you can buff their scaling that much and still expect PvP to be in the ballpark that is balance.
---
So yes, you can add some pet scaling, or arcane shot scaling, or whatever the hell floats your boat within the realms of not breaking PvP. You can do all of that and it **wouldn't fix the problem**. Because in the end there is absolutely no means of increasing the DPS of hunters in raids by over 200 without also increasing the DPS of hunters in PvP by at least 75% of that amount, if not more. So again, without a mechanical change or addition to the Hunters toolkit, you can NOT fix their scaling.
---
&gt;the tauren
---
Eh, they owed a debt to Thrall via WCIII when the orcs and them fought together against.....harpies? I forget exactly, but the Orcs helping the Tauren in the WCIII campaign is why they're allies. 
---
Any software dev company will be using some form of agile, waterfall is very inefficient with projects of this size. 
---
Blizzard is being quiet because its the smart thing to do. They give us any scrap of information and it will get torn apart or theorycrafted without the rest of the context.
---
They have months of development left for the release, the stuff you posted is easily done near the end.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't High Elves the Blood Elves before the Scourge decimated Silvermoon City? 
---
Pick whichever talents you want based on the weapons you wanna use most. Prot is the slowest to level but not as slow as people say. Plus it gives you time to learn the prot talents as you level to better know your role as a tank for end game.
---
While leveling just keep different weapons for tanking and dps. This is much more important than the talents.
---
Hmm good point . . . The Moonkin don't get their typhoon do they? Do shamans get whatever theirs is?
---
Im not sure what your point is. People did GKP runs in vanilla.
---
What do people complain about in end game. Raid loggers, no loot, grinding for consumables, people leaving raid once their content was done, argumemts about dkp loot prices and decay rates, new recruits taking forever to get anywhere near dkp parity and thus only getting stuff no one else wants, not being allowed to roll on certain items coz they are better for someone else, changing dkp systems once they are already instituted, mistrust over over dkp recording/transactions, geared people leaving guild, people guild hopping once they get gear, combined guild runs ending in drama and bad blood.
---
All tha stuff is avoidable through gkp. Loot goes to hughest bidder, everyone gets an even cut. 
---
&gt; Breh we have months before the games out
---
I have PTSD after the entire community said the GCD change was bad for 6 months before the game launched all throughout the beta. 3 months after the launch they finally listened and only *began* to revert it.
---
Remember this is Activision Blizzard we're trying to talk to here. If you don't complain early they won't listen, and if you do complain endlessly odds are you'll be doing it for over half a year before they do listen.
---
This is the blue post I was reference when I made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ag2b1f/how_ive_felt_ever_since_the_end_of_the_blizzcon/ee33opv/), and I totally fell for more "click bait"......damnit 
---
Can you make a post close to launch when their servers are decided please (if they release names beforehand). I haven’t been keeping up and would love to know that info!
---
I like using strategies like this as well. It's more fun that what I used to do as a teenager which was to open a book upside down, turn to a random page, point to a word with my eyes closed and see how cool it is. It usually took many tries to find something acceptable.
---
I’ve always said that Nightmare Dragon release day on Nostalrius was absolutely the most fun I’ve ever had on any video game. Still get chills when I watch the footage.
---
This type of PvP is pretty special, I really hope we get decent size servers with NO sharding on Classic.
---
As a rogue who played in Retail vanilla I can say that the class offers both, emphasis on the exploration! There would be times when I would stealth around looking into enemy cities or made my way up to Grim Batol without taking any damage/fighting any enemies. 
---
WPvP is fun too, especially when farming, 
---
All we needed was the ability to reskin our characters. I see no issue with a Dark Iron Dwarf skin tint, or Zandalari troll etc. Hell even in Vanilla we decimated a plethora of troll tribes, I would imagine many who worshipped specific loa would look to join the Darkspear, especially with all the "good" Hakkar was doing.
---
The new racials are out of control.
---
Well to be fair, they do end up having to do mechanics that might be hard for the average button smasher. So while they are easy, they are also kind of hard and screwing up can be really bad.
---
Having played a warrior recently on LH to ~ 40 the number of good hunters I've run into is about zero. From not off-tanking mobs in a bad situation, to not wing clipping, to having no idea how to trap anything. Breaking sheeps with bad pet management, serpent stinging sheep targets, etc. 
---
Foolhardy... what a fucking dork you are. You have clearly done fuck all as far as pvp goes and don't have a clue what you are talking about. 
---
You know what I always loved about mulgore? It's so open and vast. Every other zone in the game is so clustered with npcs and stuff all over,  rocks, trees all over the place but mulgore really feels like it has plains as far the eye can see. Easily my number 1 zone in the game . 
---
Should begin to say that by launch, I'll def be a casual. Won't have time to be a hardcore player to this game. Mostly into PVP BGs, maybe dip into some raids here and there. 
---
Heart of Wild Druid
---
Priest or Warlock
---
Played Druid in TBC, did boomkin. I been spending a lot of time into this HOTW druid spec for classic. Looks really fun but requires a lot of maintenance with macros and indefinite choices in regards to rotation. Think it'd be fun for pvp, I hear they're really good when played well. Feel like I won't get in a raid at all though? Think people will be more accepting this time around?
---
Priest has always been one of my fav classes. I really enjoy healing so I can do that at endgame, I also still like shadow and I hear shadow is really good. Not sure how priests are in classic. I'm kind of a religious person so I've always had an appreciation for the priest class. And they are the ultimate healer. 
---
Warlock, I played this on Nostalrius when it was out. It was fun, I just pumped damage in dungeons. Didn't do incredibly well in pvp, the cloth gear is really soft. I did well just because u fear and dot up, and then sacrifice minion and get a bubble. Was a noob but it was fun. 
---
Basically, I have 3 choices in terms of classes. I'm leaning druid but I fear that is a class that requires someone who has more time to invest into the game. I'm a veteran healer as a former Druid and Paladin healer (never healed as a priest before). Have noob experience as a warlock. Given that I will be mostly limited to casual commitment, just want to see some outside insight. 
---
It's more than just having slow clear speeds. Slow clear speed means more monster damage, which means more consumables used and downtime spent eating/bandaging, as well as being even more screwed by extra adds. Also, you're worse at pvp, so for PvP servers you're at higher risk of corpse walking. On top of that, you can easily tank 5 man leveling dungeons as arms or fury, so there's literally no upside to going prot, at all.
---
People don't say "don't go prot" because it's not optimal, they say it because it's generally not fun and you will not enjoy it unless you really know what you're doing and want to challenge yourself. Otherwise, you're shooting yourself in the foot, for no reason.
---
They've shown time and time again with this project they're sticking to as close to vanilla as possible. The things that are vanilla outweight the things that aren't. They've even found out things private servers have gotten wrong all this time. 
---
They've shown they're combing through the old build to insure they get the mechanics right. Its fine that you don't trust blizzard, you shouldn't trust any company, but getting more information won't change your outlook. 
---
with banjo playing in the background
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted. Fish schools didn't come until patch 1.9 which was almost 2 years after launch. That's a significant amount of time. You will NOT have schools at launch. 
---
help me out here, I'm in the smack dab in the middle of Europe, so my English is more-or-less a mangled mess of pronunciations from all over the world I've picked up along the years.
---
which country uses which? 'cos there are 3 different words with the exact same meaning.
---
This is pretty much what I'm thinking. Even if you take away the PVP side of things, there's something fun about sneaking into the enemy factions villages....just for the fun of it.
---
Fun is totally subjective. They should try it if they want to.
---
Yes it's inefficient under most circumstances but we already told them all of that stuff.
---
Ya... this happens a lot. Also people will tank until Pre-raid BIS or close and than not tank anymore.
---
It does help that fury and arms are both decent for tanking 5 mans, so at least you don't have to respec for most dungeons to be a good tank, but a lot of people just don't want that kind of responsibility and more so for random players. Add in that the tank is the most likely person to die in a wipe, while DPS might will everything and live, and plate is expensive to repair and I can see people not wanting to tank if they don't have to.
---
as it turns out, the horde are a lot better at making friends than the alliance: https://imgur.com/gallery/YKCZTfr
---
Yeah, they can just talk about their awful plan for 4 stage content release near launch!
---
That'll give us the least amount of time to give feedback and for them to change anything. 
---
I never really played a human, but helped level my brothers mage through STV... But I am not a fan of the night elves. I would more rather play Tauren
---
Tauren 4 life bro. Definitely remaking my tauren hunter from 2006 &lt;3.
---
My first character as a total noob was a Tauren warrior on a pvp server with no real friends in the game. Man that was a rough 3 months to level. I had zero idea what to do at that time and just winged it.
---
My shadow priest friend would regularly 4v1 alliance and I would struggle to kill 1 mob, let alone 1 player.
---
Having just done it on LH recently it's honestly not that bad as long as you make friends with a mage or buy some food / hp regen pots and hamstring kite 1-30 or so. ~30+ with WW axe or a corpsemaker is a lot easier.
---
The Staff off the vine boss in WC with a ton of Spirit is actually really good for its level, even though its a staff.
---
Spirit is super under-rated on a leveling warrior.
---
Yeah it was such a dirty spec I remember there were times where the person would die before being able to get out of all the stuns. I remember it being not the greatest damage but the CC made up for it. 
---
UK for sure calls them indicators, as you are indicating which direction you are turning. 
---
I'd never heard of the word "blinker" till I moved to Canada (and even then maybe a year or so after I'd been here - it's not really a word that comes up much in normal conversation).
---
You clearly dont know the fundamentals of how sharding works. They are in a shard while this happens, just because they dont phase into another one doesnt mean sharding isnt the cause.
---
Shards are given x-amount of resources from the hardware the software resides on. They likely have a metadata file somewhere that says something like "when a new shard is created allocate this much ram, CPU time, and network resources to this shard". 
---
Instead please continue complaining about a topic you didn't even bother to understand beyond "lagging is bad and that game lags so why wont my game lag?". Does 40v40 AV lag like this on retail? no and that's because those instances are likely allocated more resources to handle the expected loads, where as home towns are not. 
---
They could make classic a laggy shitty mess, or they likely already understand that large openworld pvp is a much more common experience in classic and will dedicate hardware are such.
---
It's the trade off for most mid-high level quest zones being in EK right next to ally dominated zones.
---
Depends what your expectations for exploration are. NE hunters can use their pet, feign+shadowmeld (every 30 secs) to push through any content while resetting NPC's. Questing as an NE hunter is significantly easier than any other non-stealth class. Hunters also have the capacity to easily 1v1 / 1v2 in world pvp and can solo most elite NPC's and some bosses. Obviously a hunter wont be stealthing through a major city ganking
---
I'm very sad that wow / GRRM doesn't have their own section.
---
The honor rank system in classic wow was inspired by Dark Age of Camelot. Both had 14 ranks and titles. In WoW you earn gear through doing battlegrounds, while in DAOC you earned talents/stats through World PvP
---
If you love World PvP check out DAOC Phoenix. Server just launched. Highly Populated. https://playphoenix.online
---
 Centaur were hunting Tauren and decimating their numbers iirc.
---
I did get to rank 11 in vanilla back in the day, but they changed it shortly after that so I never got to see if would be able to keep rising.
---
I was not playing 80 hours a week in premades though, that is for sure.
---
Assuming they bring the old system in, what happens when you get rank 11 but dont play enough to rise to 12 etc.?
---
Did you just stay rank 11 forever or would you go down even if you played the same amount?
---
My old GM/Main Tank in Classic/TBC was named Ushikawa.  IIRC it is japanese for "Cow Hide", which was perfect for a Tauren tank.
---
Dude took us all from MC to Naxx, and then from Kara to Sunwell in style.  
---
I leveled a prot warrior! It's very painful playing solo, there were times when I did so little damage that a single mob my level would kill me before I could kill it. But I spent most of my time with friends, and there I had a lot of fun. My goal was to be a dedicated tank for my friend group, and leveling through the entire game in that spec helped me created an identity in my mind for that character. I wasn't just "a warrior that could tank", I WAS a tank. If that sounds fun to you, you should go for it!
---
they will use the 1.12 system with ranks 100% 
---
Their most valuable tool to bring along is the [Pocket Healer].
---
I know a lot of it was just down to sheer luck, as you needed attack speed and the proc is only 5%, but when you were lucky, it was a nightmare for the enemy.
---
If we want it to be a truly classic experience , then we need to make sure servers have a 50% chance to crash when large numbers of players enter an area..... because that’s what it was like .
---
I think people who played on private servers have a skewed view of just how limited and unplayable large scale pvp was on official servers back then.
---
Night elf because the way they use 2handers and sword and shield is just awful man like fuck thats bad 
---
Having more information can always change your outlook... 
---
Same. Tauren and hate the starting zone. Also have seldom played troll because I hate the posture and how the feet are always showing.
---
That's correct.
---
&gt;Then why don't they fix it for BfA?
---
Because there might not be a fix to allow shards being able to handle more players, but instead a server with fewer shards could handle more players per shard. If it is a situation like, 1 server running 10 shards can handle X players per shard, a server with 1 shard can handle 5X players in that single shard, then in BfA it makes sense to support more total players per server, but in Classic there could be 5 times as many players per zone as in BfA and that might be just fine.
---
I don't know if this is the case, I don't know how Blizz's server infrastructure works, I was only pointing out that it is a possibility.
---
&gt;Activision Blizzard can't handle "large" amounts of players in their retail WoW while private servers have 100 vs 100 pvp battles at the entrance of ZG.
---
The server backends are likely designed to handle two entirely different things. Retail WoW probably has some maximum amount of players they target being able to support per shard on which they based their assumptions when they upgraded the backend. For example, why should they try to support 100 vs 100 pvp battles when they are under the impression that it'd be sharded into 2 50 v 50 battles or 4 25 v 25 battles?
---
Private servers on the other hand don't have to worry about that, they are just trying to cram as many people as possible into one shard, which they then throw resources at until it works. They also have the benefit of not having to worry about crashes the way Blizz does because it is free and no one will be complaining that WoW was down during the time they paid for their subscription. Private servers are also probably expending a lot more money per player on hosting costs than Blizz is as a direct result of this.
---
You already know they will re-release them for classic for more dollars. 
---
Draenei make sense, but them aligning with the alliance is beyond reason.
---
Guldaniel
---
Does seem weird they dont have anything to show or tell 15 months after the initial announcement. I'm getting a go fuck yourself vibe
---
I bet they are a little afraid of posting anything without concrete answers yet because no matter what they say or show us it will trigger an avalanche of arguments and hate from #changs, #nochanges people.  
---
Interesting what can happen when you put OP gear in the game. And overshadowing raid gear is a bad thing? I don't think so when it is exclusive and hard to obtain.
---
Well they've shown and told quite a bit. But there's no denying that there's a lot left to work out. They did explicitly say they wanted to "work with the community" on this one and they sure haven't done any of that.
---
Based on the public-facing information we have about Classic, it seems like they have the right people involved with it currently: Developers who care about sticking to the original game as much as feasibly possible for the benefit of us, the fans.
---
I think this is probably because Classic interest is dramatically underestimated by Activision-Blizzard. If I’m right, and if Classic exceeds expectations while Diablo Mobile crashes and burns, you can bet there will be high-level discussions by a totally separate group of people about how to squeeze Classic for more revenue.
---
&gt; Hybrid classes like Pally and Shaman should never get the same quality of performance as a pure tank or pure healer, their advantage is utility.
---
Agreed.  They shouldn't be as good; however, they should be an acceptable substitute for any role they've got access to.  This is not the case.  Further, in the case of paladins at least, they *are* as good as a pure healer (this is putting aside the fact that there actually are *no* pure healers in WoW), and nobody freaks out that they're as good or better than priests at it like they do in defense of the poor, poor under appreciated warriors any time them being made adequate tanks or dps.
---
&gt;  I don't understand why they don't configure the current BFA servers the same way we assume they would for the Classic servers.
---
One theory: they could, but don't. Reason is to distribute load as evenly as possible, in order to keep utilization up. Better to have smaller servers and utilization at 90%+ than larger servers and 50% utilization.
---
Why would smaller shards yield higher utilization? That depends on a lot of things that I'd be guessing about, but given how distributed systems work these days, its possible. Really depends on a bunch of factors like their load balancing and whether or not they can use temporary servers and pay by the hour, etc.
---
Gnomes. I've had goblin priest alt that I got pretty high up, so it is not some sort of bias against smaller characters, something about the gnomes just completely ruins it for me. Never got fond of them. 
---
This is a brilliant idea! I’m so doing this.
---
Consumables can cover that to some degree. Invisibility potions aren't too expensive. 
---
Giving it is one thing. I imagine that would be very rare - you generally aren’t allowed to bid on items you don’t need/can’t use, and who would give up items they need and spent resources on for free?
---
But what if you try to sell it? Then you’re basically trading DKP for gold and undermining the DKP system. 
---
Alternatively, it goes the other way - a rich guy can pay offer to pay more cash-strapped guildies to spend their DKP, thereby saving his own for future items, meaning he gets twice the loot. DKP basically becomes an alternate currency. 
---
I wanted to play a warrior. Settling on a resto/ele Sham.  Easy raid spot and a hybrid pvp spec. Save on the gold. 
---
I feel like those questions are gonna be solved last, after all the gameplay stuff working correctly. Also a reason why they are silent
---
Don't discount Feign Death. If it's used correctly with some strategy, it basically amounts to stealth in dungeons and PVE.
---
Has Blizzard made any comments regarding this issue? It's been feeling worse and worse...
---
The best in between world that could work even for nochanges people is the ban / making impossible to do / giving a status of deserter when queue dodging and so on.
---
They can easily scale it to handle as many players as they want.  They already turn off sharding for Roleplay events and there is absolutely no problem.
---
The original wow server blades had a weak (compared to now) CPU and only 6GB of RAM.
---
Hunters are easy for sure, but a lot of the time that player games to end game and realizes they have to do some things they are just not prepared for and really should have gone mage or warlock.
---
My wife's first char was a hunter, and while she did hit cap, she quit the char soon after, because she was not ready to actually play a hunter, she just easy mode leveled.
---
Ended up re-rolling with her as a priest and had no issues.
---
With how long it takes to level, most new players would be better off just grouping up while leveling and playing mage or warlock.
---
Unless you want to maintank which you need prot spec for, you can relatively easily tank in arms spec. More than respecs you will need a different gear for both situations.
---
I like how this sub is so hyped about it to plan such things in advance. I will play just one alt but for example, I am not planning on race yet until I know for sure whether it will be the new or old models (fingers crossed on on former, the old models had like 5 pixels and everybody had to share) 
---
This system is shit. And it's very unlikely it's gonna be fundamentally changed.
---
**However, a good in between that could work even for nochanges people is the ban / making impossible to do certain abuses of the system or even giving a status of deserter when queue dodging and so on.**
---
At least this would limit the mafia and toxic aspect of the grind, which in the end affect all the server, since as a casual you will meet hard premades more often if they keep dodging / arranging between them.
---
If they were the Draenei from WC3:TFT I would have fan-boy jizzed all over the place.
---
Instead we got a retcon of aliens crash Landing on Azeroth. Bleh.
---
that was never really do-able during classic unless you played the auction house, or no life'd it all weekend to farm gold
---
&gt;They have stated multiple times they are very aware that community servers with 0 sharding are a core feature of vanilla. 
---
Can you link those statements? Because it could be very useful to shut down even more people accusing Blizzard of lying or betraying them eventually in every thread.
---
You should not be missing anything really. Dumb question but is the sword youre trying to offhand, mainhand only? \^\^
---
Some weapons are 1-handed, some are main-hand only. Only 1-handed, and off-hand weapons can be held in the off-hand.
---
I sure hope so. I just miss the good old days of playing a bg, having a solid close match and actually playing out fights. I remember even back then there were still stomps happening and you would just sit around til the game finishes. It's fine, that happens. But when you have people trying to replicate that over and over with no real PVP, its just sad to me.   
---
Luckily I like pve more but I think the rank / decay system only will allow people without jobs or responsibility to even think about items above r10
---
Awesome video, thanks!
---
OcrDemonHorn

Abolish
---
A bad hunter will still do above average dps though as most of the damage comes from the pet / auto shot. I'd recommend the class for people who are awful. At the top end a good hunter can stand out really easily.
---
Thanks Shedo, I appreciate your reply. When you put it like this, it doesn't seem as bad as grinds others have to do. Maybe I will go for it. May I ask if your feral build is also capable of doing other thinks like healing and tanking in 5 means with the right gear? It would be a pity to lose the flexibility as a druid. tho i think you can perform a lot of things with the right gear. But maybe since you try to minmax your dps there is no room for resto talents with OoC etc.). And how is kitty viable in 5mans - without using the pummeler? Or are you always expected to heal/tank because you can?  
---
I really like your guide, keep up the good work!
---
How would they get more money? The cards are out of print. The Card game was cancelled some time ago.
---
This is not lagom...
---
Raid and dungeon finder.
---
Also cash shop.
---
It was even worse in BC when warriors got their hands on Stormherald.
---
The mace had a 4 second stun proc, plus the warr would spec into mace spec for an additional separate 3 or 4 second stun proc.
---
Yeah, I looked up the prices but I'm curious as to if they'd work in vanilla - if so it would increase the price and better that I wait.
---
Either; one of the weapons are for mainhand/offhand only  
---
or; one of the weapons are for mainhand/offhand only but you cant tell because of some itemization changes made during vanilla. So the game is telling you its "One handed" when infact it is "mainhand" or "offhand" only. Usually fixed by deleting either your cache or wtf folder in the WoW directory.   
---
This is mainly caused by joining a server with a certain patch itemization, and then later joining a new one with a different itemization, but the game still has the item "stored" as the older version.
---
They have a TCG "loot box" code it has a VERY small chnce of dropping any of the various TCG mounts, normally just gives crap items from other sets though. Landro's gift box I believe.
---
I'd rather just ask here instead of bogging down GM's with small questions, especially during a launch where they're bound to be busy. That's why.
---
Have you guys not seen all these dads trolling their children by asking them to head into the hardware store to buy blinker fluid?!
---
Will stick with the name I've had for 16 years across multiple games
---
Currently on a private server and am frequently messaged by people wanting to know if it's me
---
Funny as that name was originally given to me by the SWG random name generator
---
Human. BOOOORING!!!
---
Night Elf would be next. 
---
I believe the only reason the card game folded was because it was licensed out to a different company for design and print, but that company then folded years later.
---
If you don't like the rough edges you don't like classic.
---
It's not being overhauled or "improved". Blizzard have said they intend to recreate the game as it was then, warts and all.
---
I already strongly think the system will work- my question is more based to if future sets are locked. 
---
In Classic, these type of servers would ruin the entire game. Almost anything outside of instanced content will be unplayable.
---
The reason they get away with it in retail is because hardly anyone is affected by it.  Idk anyone who raids cities anymore and I guarantee these people only did it because Asmongold was bored and decided to start a raid. 
---
It's all about the ratio of how much damage you deal vs amount of damage you take. 
---
Dealing less damage because you're using 1hander means that the mob will stay alive for a longer time and keep attacking, and the shield mitigation just does not even it out. If you want a smooth warrior leveling experience you should take a look into Hamstring kiting method (there are enough guides/videos/etc. on that topic).
---
That's fair. 
---
I imagine there will be a lot of casual hunters raiding MC forever poorly, or just not raiding. It's a good class for someone who is new and wants to be casual. 
---
It can also be a harder class to play at a high level, so for a lot of people mage or warlock might be a better long term class.
---
I'm planning on playing hunter on classic, and have since Cata at a high level, so for sure the class is very playable, just maybe not the best choice for everyone.
---
It's a good starter class for new players, who can then use that experience / money on their alt / new main if they don't love the kite play style.
---
If they had these sub factions at vanilla, it would've been cool. The racials &amp; starting area would remain the same, just visual changes.
---
Also something to note is all the specs mentioned here are amazing for PvP. Just not dishing out the most in raids.
---
That was it... main-hand only. Been playing retail vanilla and then private vanilla entirely as clothies.. first time as melee dps class, thanks
---
thanks, main-hand it was
---
What comic is this?
---
I'd say that this is some "unofficial internal release date" - they're PLANNING to release it then, but they're not certain - something might still change. And, in order to avoid postponed releases, they prefer to not say it unless it's certain. Especially for such hype-sensitive release - people've been waiting so long without any hint, and once hints started to appear, they were really sparse - you see, that 2021 speculation seemed realistic, from the perspective of amount of information we knew.   And again, this is something people've been waiting for since Cataclysm. And if that was not enough, there are private servers that let you play it early and for free, and Blizzard already made mess around Classic players and private server communities. If this release gets postponed, Blizzard will lose to private servers.
---
Not to mention that it would be the first time that Blizzard postpones release.
---
So, Blizzard really doesn't want postponed release, therefore only hint in such way, without saying for certain. And, since it is relatively early in global calendar summer, "summer 2019" would give them some window.
---
I believe that July 16 is when they're planning, if everything's done within the project deadlines.
---
And additional possibility - they were planning to announce the July 16 release date, but just before BlizzCon, business problems started to happen, so they quickly changed it "on the knees", just in case. I'd say that the "diablo immortal" was too a last-minute movement - it seemed that they were already prepared to announce diablo 2 remaster (Diablo 2 music playing in the background), but it got cancelled again due to business problems.
---
But other way, I'd say it'll "most likely" air on July 16th, and there are no chances of it airing before. I'd treat it as "on or after July 16th".
---
It just frustrates that in order for me to be excited about this I need to hold the expectation that I want it to do poorly.
---
I like the idea, but it's a bit too much in my opinion.
---
Given the history and context, it should only be Human Forsaken. The Scourge devastated Lordaeron for the most part. Technically High Elf Forsaken should work yes?
---
Weren't they murdered by Orcs in Draenor? Couldn't that give them a bias or reason to not side with the Horde?
---
None whatsoever. We are just to have faith in Activision Blizzard in making the best decisions with the players in mind,
---
like Diablo Mobile, or shutting down an entire game's esports after lying that it will continue, or focusing on policing speech in games over other priorities.
---
Surely "you think you do, but you don't" Activision Blizzard has a great track record and deserves our trust.
---
I kind of figured this would happen in BFA. The Orcish Horde would be pissed off at their Forsaken leader for starting another war.
---
How many shards did the Classic demo have?
---
There are Orcs... But there are different kinds of Orcs.
---
Orcs, Trolls, Dwarves, &amp; Elves are great examples.
---
Lmao
---
Almost every alliance guild have at least one feral tank now, it might be more rare horde side it should still be possible to find some.
---
The hardest part is finding a spot because feral are becoming popular but guild only want 1 or 2 at most.
---
Shadow Priests are the best pvp BG class. Your first statement and, last paragraph also contradict themselves... Just saying lol
---
While true, this assumes that private servers got armor values correct... Which we don't really know for sure.
---
Likely they are close and warriors are gods still.
---
It's better than fury being awful and having zero tanks running around I guess.
---
&lt;Druid&gt;
---
I don't doubt that they can make it work, but I believe communication is VERY warranted regarding the issue well before this game goes live. There really aren't a whole lot of significant issues at this point, so it shouldn't be difficult to communicate on them.
---
* Loot Trading
---
* Starting Zone Sharding
---
* "Catch-up" Items
---
* Server Stability
---
After all that, they simply need to release Alpha/Beta &amp; look closely at the community to find random old pieces that can be fixed. Like how this and that ability function, sounds, graphical stuff, etc.
---
How about Orkthar?
---
Could've added a long grind that let you unlock a new character as a non-human forsaken
---
&gt;On August 23, 2013, Blizzard Entertainment announced that the TCG would be discontinued, and that they would not be renewing the game's license.[4] In March 2014, Blizzard released Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, an online collectible card game featuring many of the same characters, abilities and artwork.
---
From the wikipedia, I never knew the details but your comment inspired me to seek them out!
---
That sounds like too much responsibility for me.
---
Frostbolt
---
Zzzzzzzzzzzz
---
In what way is that not a bug but an intended feature?
---
I was just going to choose the one with the name I liked the most. I am assuming other people will do the same so it will all work out in the end.
---
I'm fine with them battening down the hatches and not worrying about PR at this point. People are worried that if they can't see what's going on they can't 'correct' the trajectory, but I think those people overestimate the effect that community has on this sort of thing.         
---
            
---
At this point I'm content to say, "Classic WoW will either reflect the proper elements of vanilla in my eyes, or it won't. If it does I'll play it, if it doesn't I won't," and ultimately leave it at that. I'm not under the delusion that having regular, deep insight into their process will in any way positively impact or sway development.
---
Illidan corrupted the orcs with Fel magic. But the Alliance has no shortage of warlocks either so...
---
In germany its Blinklicht (blinking light) or Blinker for short.
---
This seems like a pretty good guild!
---
What about if they go survival with Lightning Reflexes? 15% agility seems pretty awesome with scaling.
---
Personally I am super excited for wow with no BG's and, almost no raids. ERHMERD thats gonna be warcraft. I'm getting excited just thinking about the war zones.
---
Because human history/lore in Azeroth is interesting just like IRL?
---
Doesn't seem to stop warriors from being 30% of any private server pop. lol
---
&gt; have no CC
---
I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure rogues used to be able to chain cc someone for up to seconds back in the day 
---
Penismaster is penismaster in english
---
Commonly played class so lots of competition and  feeling pretty generic overall. Generally  boring playstyle outside of PvP. I'd throw being a walking vending machine in there as well. 
---
I mean I don't think it's as good as a proper shadow priest. The reason why in my opinion is that being a priest makes people wanna kill you. Shadow is the best way to not die with a bunch of haters on your jock. All that being said. I would so play this. I love it because it looks like it can pvp well and, still get Holy Nova to farm dire maul.
---
But Kamehameha!
---
based on what you've said I think your best fit is Hunter unless you were to change your mind and try PvP with Warrior (it can be a great time). Druid would take you too much time investment for the slight payoff, on the Mage side even thought they might hit harder in a Raid Hunter will probably be more enjoyable with the little extra things they have to do witch makes them feel special as well as necessary for a raid and you dont have to make water for everyone, for Warrior I think you'd really enjoy the PvE side of it but if you really wouldn't give PvP a try it's probably not worth the time if you could just role something different instead :)
---
Noob
---
Yes, 10% of the high elf population survived the Scourge invasion and out of those 90% took the name blood elf in honor of their dead.
---
The only "pure" high elves in game can be found at the Quel'Danil Lodge in the hinterlands
---
I am 100% sure there will be tons of non-classi players. I'm sure it won't be a problem.
---
There are methods to farm gold from 30g to 300g per hour. Even with 30g per hour, it would only take you a few hours of playing to afford respeccing.. its really not that hard
---
Hand of Justice + Ironfoe?
---
They aren't stupid. It's the hard Alliance and Horde divide that is stupid. 
---
they can only do one role (dps), they got no self healing, drinking all the time is boring for some ppl, they got minimal impact in raids (i mean you cant really carry a raid as mage), always kiting in pvp isnt the most enjoyble playstyle for some ppl, they arent tanky at all and rely on not being touched, hunters pop you, warlocks.
---
It doesnt matter how many it had. You are comparing apples to oranges. Diablo3 had error 34 login issues upon release. How do we know we will be able to login? 
---
How laggy was the full shard during the demo? 
---
I usually go with a legend or god of some sort. Just type in "gods of healing" or somrthing to that effect and puck an obscure one. My priest is named after a Egyptian half god
---
For instances, druids don't have a hard res, so you would need to have either a priest, paladin, shaman or engineer (rng) in the group. Only a problem if you wipe I guess.
---
I want to say priests are the "best" 5 man healers without a lot of gear, as well as being in demand in raids. Shamans are really strong with a bit of gear and in zerg runs (mostly all melee).
---
NE priest can shadowmeld by the horde camp in Felwood and MC people off the cliff to their death.  
---
Thinking about making an alt for this purpose alone.  
---
I think you'd enjoy both Priest and Shaman both are fun :) 
---
I hate gnomes, and tauren were always really ugly to me
---
Flat out disagree with 4 and 5. Warlocks are noticeably worse in higher level PvP on Alliance due to every reasonable horde PvPer being Undead. And if you are an alliance priest and you aren't a dwarf why the fuck would I take you when I could take a dwarf instead?
---
Dungeon gear takes longer to accumulate because you are quite often rolling against two other clothies. 
---
The Alliance and Horde divide is stupid from a lore standpoint. Outside of territorial disputes and attacks on the other faction most places would be relatively neutral to adventurers. Essentially, in WoW your job is a wanderer who does odd jobs for money.
---
lol its funny, my most hated race is gnomes forsure. I never understood why anyone would want to be a gnome
---
Yes considering everything it's fairly safe to say Mage is the best all around class in vanilla. Being strong is only one of the many reasons that factor into people choosing a class though.
---
Easier raids - Blessings (Salvation in particular)
---
Dwarfs - have the best beards / pigtails (pigtails move when casting! imo really cool)
---
Fear ward is strong, if not absolutely required.
---
Track Treasure is underrated early on
---
OKAY I've had enough explain agile and waterfall development.
---
Oh the hunter dilemma... It receives so much UNDUE attention. Lets take a look at the life of a hunter.
---
Best leveler. Best solo capacity. Second best ability to make gold (under a mage) while being the only class who farms level 60 group content to generate gold. Best tank from 1-50 (yes, they are better than druids as BM and generate FAR more threat). Best 1v1 potential until warlocks are post tier 2. BEST dps in pre bis dungeons. BEST dps in tier 1. BEST dps during ALL BWL progression. Best dueler aside from late game warlocks, but CAN counter them if you are switching pet between duels (cheeseball strategy). Single best value ability in group pvp - viper sting. INSANE aoe with trap + sapper charges. Best uptime on nightfall... I could go on ALL day.
---
9 Classes. All can DPS. Hunter is the BEST dps for 2/3rds of the game.
---
The trade off? Fall slightly in PVE during AQ and drop off significantly in Naxx.
---
I dont understand why people care about this? Aaaawww you are the top DPS in your full clear Naxx guild when youre well over a year into the character and your guild has the game on farm... That must be tough. As someone who mains a hunter, dont be discouraged by the naysayers. Choose the path of LEAST resistance and choose a hunter.
---
It was a way to keep item details from being known I guess.   There wasn't as much data mining, to say the least.
---
It looks like Classic was running on the same infrastructure as retail WoW, enabling them to "leverage existing technology."
---
It’s hard. But doable. Don’t know why some many people doubt druids in raids. Literally the only thing that holds us back is lack of shield which allows for crushing blows that hurt. 
---
For Chrom you need an ot with you as his enrage will probably crush an under geared Druid or a Druid with a healer not ready for it.
---
You need sands and you need the ot to pick up threat when you lose it.  But again it’s doable
---
For nef, it’s doable again but just not ideal as we are not able to stance dance and we get shape shifted into cat where we get fucked up quickly. But when you need a tank you need a tank. Again doable not ideal
---
Tanking raids with dual druids is really fun, should def give it a go sometime! Druid fetal is NOT a meme spec at all, it’s the only other option available for tanking besides warrior also as paladins cant taunt. 
---
At least hunter is a fast leveler so if you decide it's not the right class for you, you didn't waste as much time as with other classes :)
---
sounds like Shaman is your best option :) (it wont be hard finding a group as any healer)
---
Thats a silly stat. I havent seen a hunter on private without it at 60. In my vanilla retail guild we had about a dozen hunters and ALL of us had it... Has a super high drop rate.
---
Illidan?
---
Mine too, it's somehow the most nostalgic part of WoW for me 
---
/r/biomememes
---
Yes but a horde raid can fit 8 shamans if they want too. I know it's 5 preferably but if you want totem buffs per group, you can fit 8 shamans. It was also be a somewhat fresh class / spec for me
---
I've leveled to max as protection. It depends on how you play. If you have friends and take more of the gimicky talents like revenge stun and shield bash silence it can be pretty fun to play while your friends deal with the damage side of things. In terms of doing it alone, that's up to you, but I didn't really mind it - just a bit boring sometimes.

Here he talks about authentic classic social experiences, and making no changes no matter how small. 
---
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-yRVtNBuI&amp;t=26m49s
---
Here they talk specifically about phasing being off the table in classic. At 28:16 - "We understand completely that sharding is antithetical to the concept of a cohesive classic community"
---
if you really want to avoid healing going Hunter, their PvP feels really good at 60 and there is a high skill ceiling to make learning the tricks of the trade fun and rewarding 
---
Everyone in this thread is giving the conventional knowledge that Prot is super slow and you dont need it for levelling and Arms tanks better yada yada.
---
It doesnt suck, its just different. It's slower to kill, for sure, but keep a good 1h weapon around and it's fairly safe levelling. Strength adds to your dps with a 1h as effectively as it does to a 2h weapon, your armor is huge with a shield, and you get a few more options for damage. Revenge is pretty nice.
---
At 40 you get Shield Slam and anyone who says arms tanks better at this point is incorrect. The threat that Shield Slam generates is really high, the freebie dispel of a buff is a nice bonus, and it helps solo.
---
I've levelled Prot before. It's slower killing than arms but you lose less health per mob and have less downtime. You WILL have higher threat in dungeons once you get shield slam and one handed spec (which in 1.12 should be excellent as I believe it's buffed to a full +10% damage boost to all your damage when using 1h/shield).
---
Only thing I'd suggest is not to start off with prot talents. By all means level with a 1h and shield and swap to Prot around level 35+ so you can get One Handed Spec and Shield Slam, but the early prot talents are pretty garbage compared to getting Anger management or the crit in Fury.
---
All good prot builds will have 11+ in Arms and 3+ in Fury anyway so you there's no harm grabbing these in the early levels.
---
I'm sure this will be downvoted by the people who think killspeed is everything. I've levelled as Prot to 60 and it was fun. Slow but fun. If you're the type of player who enjoys the 1h/shield style and feeling like a brick wall then there's no reason not to level as prot, just be sensible about what talents you take when and be prepared to respec around a bit because the bottom half of the prot tree doesnt really help much on its own. Rage generation, damage/threat and general utility are more important than flat mitigation at first, just having a shield on will make you tough enough without needing the early prot tree talents as well until later.
---
Shit healers tho
---
While warriors might be 20-30%, they will also be in huge demand for raids as Tanks, OT's and Fury. So while it looks bad people will want 10-15 of them in raids if they can get that many (higher on horde, likely), I imagine hunters will also be 20% and people will want 3-4 per raid.
---
Hamstring kiting really helps a lot to reduce downtime and has a similar feel to it as hunter kiting. Just make friends with a mage for food or level with a hybrid / healer and you are set.
---
You can also Tank 5 mans and a lot of OT roles as Fury or an Arms / Fury spec, so you will at least be able to kill things in your raid spec.
---
Hunter is definitely a fun class, sadly there will be a ton of bad ones, making things harder at first.
---
Mage is one of those classes that takes a while to get going. If you aren't going to AOE level, and on a fresh server it might not be realistic anyways, it can be a bit monotonous. 
---
Still a really strong and in demand class, and in pvp you have a lot of complexity.
---
Personally I was torn between Hunter and Warrior, but I think I am going to play Hunter at launch and level the warrior full rested and potentially swap later on. If I was going Horde, I would have gone warrior straight up, but I dislike human warriors for some reason (orc &amp; Human being the best fury races).
---

---
I got that bow off Chromagus or whatever... it was so bad ass. Super slow attack speed, it hit like an absolute truck.
---
I would destroy clothies in PvP with a quick aimshot/multishot combo
---
As someone who's levelled to 60 as prot, this is somewhat hyperbole. It's sort of correct but Prot isnt THAT much slower. Not 5 times slower. It's actually safer, and if you choose your levellign gear well (and wear strength gear and dps-focussed gear where you get a choice rather than levelling in tank gear) your killspeed is acceptable.
---
One handed Spec and Shield Slam are fantastic. You'd definitely want to grab the early Arms/Fury talents FIRST though because the bottom half of the prot tree is rubbish until you stack it with high end tank gear, so if you ARE going to level with 1h/shield, talent early Arms/Fury and then respec to get 1h spec/shieldslam close to 40.
---
Just be prepared to focus more on QUESTING than grinding as a prot warrior. If you're trying to hit 60 asap then dont, just go Arms, but prot levelling isnt that slow. it's certainly SAFE.
---
The original goal of the project is to recreate vanilla WoW for with modern security/tech. Does changing classes so they get an even spread sound like that to you?
---
Dont avoid them, kill them
---
Likening people wanting to get gear easier to communism? what a joke. You can dislike a video game without pretending like people are idiots for supposedly wanting easy rewards.
---
Modern WoW is focused entirely on the dungeon and raid content itself, rather than the game surrounding that content. Over time it cut away all of the time consuming "fat" and made getting to and playing the dungeon content as streamlined as possible. New incentives have had to be created on top of that content to keep people playing, because the older, RPG-like, more skinner-box incentives were smoothed out of the game ages ago.
---
That's the difference between classic wow and modern wow. Classic wow incentived play almost soley through character progression. Modern WoW focuses on the content itself and adds additional incentives on top of that content to keep people playing. It's playing the content to progress your character vs playing your character to progress the content. Not "too much free stuff", holy shit. Too many gamers think these companies are spiting them personally by making games in ways they don't like.
---
Yeah I found it after I posted this. I’m following you and checking out the videos. Doing good work!
---
I had a Hunter, Rogue, Mage and Warlock all leveled capped in Vanilla. Was working on others as well.
---
Yes they understand. But since when have they cared about opinions.
---
mace stun was garbage for a long time cause it shared DR with regular stuns until patch 1.9 [http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch\_1.9.0](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0)  
---
It didn't really take off until tbc when they buffed mace stun proc rates and you can also proc the stun while you have them already stunned by cheap shot or kidney shot making it completely worthless. It's great when it proc's outside of your stuns, but mace stun wasn't wide spread until tbc and the increased chance to proc.
---
As you a Druid 9 times out of 10 you will be healing in raids unless your guild is just facerolling things.
---
&gt;They have the benefit of being real words, so they don't sound too goofy  
---
\&gt;\ Mangangaso  
---
Endgame mechanics for mage are actually much more interesting IMO than those for warlock.
---
The AOE for rotation of mage isn't just one button and the cooldown management prior to becoming a fire mage makes single target more interesting.
---
source: played mage and warlock in hardcore guilds in vanilla pservers.
---
BG or world pvp? You have a serious ability to outlast your opponent.
---
FINALLY SOMEONE HAS WOKEN THE FUCK UP
---
Dont go AR unless you are very min max. AR was good for two reasons. One was it was there were very few alternatives ar the time, second was during that period instant attacks weren't normalized on weapon speed.
---
In classic, both of those are gone, unless they actually dont release AV several months (IBS is free, takes 1 victory, and is 95% as good). Save your 400g for Lionheart Helm, Stockade Pauldrons, or your epic mount. 
---
Bro I came from WC2 and WC3 and I remember when I first read that night elfs were joining the alliance and undead the horde I was like wtf this makes no sense
---
Orcs.
---
Reason: I'm a stereotypical female who chooses a race based more on looks than stats. Yeah, sorry. Undead master race all the way, most badass race for the Horde.
---
Orcs? They're bloody ugly. Kind of the same for trolls, although I have  played a troll druid for a very short amount of time. Didn't like their neon colours in any of the druid forms.
---
I've not played a lot of Alliance, but that's because their races are awful. Normal, boring, generic human? No, there's PLENTY of them in real life, don't need to be one in a fantasy game either. Small fat ugly human? Also no. Even *smaller* human? It's a pass from me.
---
Only classic Ally race for me would be Nelfs. Overall I prefer Draeneis, they're sexy-cute and pastel! (anything purple gets instant bonus points from me). But they're not in classic, so.
---
&gt; 1+ year and nothing to show outside of two zones?
---
Unlike most new game developments, the is not the content that is lagging in development, it is the engine. 
---
WoW Classic is unusual in that they have all the content. What they do not have is a working server-client. They have what is in effect a prototype - in the form of current retail WoW - but there is a bunch of work to be done to make the current retail client behave the way that it used to in 2005. 
---
So they probably could show us the entire of Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor right now, but there would be little point. It is not the content that needs testing but the game engine itself. "Is the gameplay true to the original?" is the question that needs to be addressed and it is really difficult to quantify progress on that front. It is completely the opposite to the 'normal' development process where they will say "we've completed X zones out of the 20/50/100 we had planned". 
---
In my mind, what the WoW Classic developers are doing is more like "we have put the druid talent tree back in, but testing shows Nature's Grace is not working correctly, so we've had to re-code that. Then, the re-code of nature's grace indicated that there were some other issues around how the game was viewing the threat created by HoT spells so we have re-coded Rejuvenation, Regrowth, and the priest's renew spell, as well as some other HoT effects."
---
Night elfs could have also joined the horde just as easily as the alliance
---
They were no more cool with ally than they were with horde in wc3
---
The Orcs slaughtered them way before Illidan was involved.
---
Never played a Dwarf of any class type.
---
Stop this shit honestly. If you listen to that clip for 30 seconds he adds a giant fucking "BUUUUUUT" and details how they plan on implementing it...
---
No worries happy to help - enjoy
---
Both of these were patched early on in Vanilla, and it's a very safe bet they will be patched in on a Classic based on WoW 1.12. I think you could only reset instances 5 times an hour or something.
---
Druids and all healer classes are often forced into healing because it's the role that is least popular end game for whatever reason. 
---
It's not so bad on pservers anymore as it used to be but I still feel like the guilds I'm in are always looking for healers more than dps. 
---
So it's not that druid can't be nice OTs, it's just when your guild is short on healers you will want to do what you can to help them progress which is often times to be a healer. 
---
I'll be playing feral tank as my main spec but I'll for sure be building up a heal set as well so I can help in anyway possible. 
---
