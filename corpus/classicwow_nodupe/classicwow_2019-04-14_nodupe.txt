These mods with no post history besides their copy/paste removal message have gotten out of hand.
---
Why do you dream about being stuck in a queue?
---
Is STV just a joke to you?!
---
Funny story. I sold my account after TBC for a good amount to a website that resold accounts. The website got hit by blizzard and all accounts including mine got banned. 
---
I came back to the game about 2 years ago and asked for the account back. Not only did they give my account, but multiple other accounts that didn’t even belong to me....I ended up getting multiple 60-80s that I had never leveled.
---
Jontron is a guy to thank for it? Am not aware what he did, could you share?
---
That’s why we’re here man.
---
Sounds like more of a nightmare.
---
It was inevitable. The private server scene started popping off like crazy and Blizzard had to acknowledge that they were missing out on a now substantial sized slice of subscribers who want to play legacy versions of the game.
---
That’s a serious equation to decide Horde or Alliance. Most of us flip a coin.
---
Also light feathers are needed for levitate, slow fall or both. Cant remember anymore which needs it, but I remember selling those bad boys for a gold a stack when I was leveling in the barrens in vanilla.
---
Haha, I'm sure I'll be as excited about classic as she was about that black hole. Now, imagine my disappointment if it turns out they will add micro transactions to the game.
---
smite was a valid raiding spec for t4-5 content in TBC it also wasnt terrible at BGs. Though it did get worse after they fixed it so you couldnt crit off of your free smite thus removing the only time a caster has been able to "windfury" a spell for as long as you kept the crit chain going but remained viable for raiding until you got enough haste gear from BT that the free smite that couldnt crit was cutting into your GCD for smites that could crit too much. was a weird feeling having haste make my spec worse. it was also let down by the fact it had no crit damage increase talents like locks and mages.  
---
In Vanilla if you have gone heavy disc with full Force of Will and PI then into holy for Searing Light. you have 10% crit and 10% more damage on smite, 5% extra spell damage + PIs 20% extra damage from talents for a considerable amount of damage but you lack the talents from TBC that made it actually good and you could have put PI on a mage or lock...
---
The answer is going to be both. 
---
As a duo you will be able to hit tougher quests normally requiring higher level or assistance. In Classic, you will also gain higher xp/kill and per red quest than doing then at yellow or green stages. 
---
Look for elite quests like the alliance side one to get brain stems in the entry area for the dungeon in Ashenvale. 
---
Use the duo to your advantage. Don’t forget quests because these will give you both full xp for completing them regardless of duo status.
---
This is a relic of a long forgotten age.
---
Classic until the end of TBC and then alter the entire timeline and create WoW 2 from said timeline with classic systems. Pull a game of thrones and let arthas usher in a long winter and take over the majority of Azeroth or something idc. Post Arthas takeover we are all that's left of the living races and we have to pick up where our  fallen heroes failed when they came back from outland to find Azeroth torn apart by the scourge.
---
Hate it I thanks
---
They all have such weird legs
---
And everyone will be gathering those mats when the game launches. After a while demand will go up and the supply will go down so the prices should increase
---
... so what am I looking at?
---
The two grand marshal warriors I fought against constantly in vanilla, Rawr and Rendz were both undead. 
---
The first HWL warrior on the server was Tauren. 
---
Play whatever you want man.
---
Teldrassil
---
Darkshore to 18
---
Redridge (pick up your FPs as you go)
---
Then Ashenvale
---
Stone talon to get FPs 
---
You can do a bit more in Ashenvale
---
Then Duskwood to 30
---
Like choosing between Rhok' and Lok’
---
Since - stats increase on each tier.  So Tier 1 is weakest, tier 2 is stronger, tier 3 is stronger yet.
---
I don't know Hunter bis enough to say if all t3 is the best. There could be non-tier items that make a better build. Mage bis for example is only 4 pieces of t3, and 4 other pieces aren't even in naxx. And that's just a pve set. You may want other gear for PvP. But if you do get all t3 it most certainly will not be bad and you'll be ahead of 99% of players. 
---
As for looks. I don't think anyone chose something that looked good over something that was better. People did keep "standing around" sets that looked good by the bank. But when it came time to do something they put on their real gear
---
I’ve done a fair bit of levelling. 
---
Yes there are plenty of quests in each zone that people skip. You are right there. 
---
However as you also pointed out there are tons of sections that are inefficient and that are left in favour of getting to 60 in a better time.
---
Engineering is pretty much all BOP stuff, but the rest of the professions have a supply demand dynamic. I see a lot of people bashing blacksmiths( for good reason), but expect the items they DO want from blacksmiths to be a bit more valuable. People over estimate the Force reactive disk also, it breaks super fast, in a matter of pulls. It's good, it really is, but it's a huge hassle to port and summon your tank every few pulls.
---
I hopped on a private server some weeks ago. Honestly it probably did take me 4 hours to get to 10 (i played bk in the day so i knew the zone for the most part, but even so). I did pick human warrior, which is prob the hardest one (no 2hander for the longest time). It was a populated server, that slowed me down as well, and no rested xp. Can definitely be done way faster, i think it took me about 2 and a half hours on a lock. So might be what your seeing is exaggerated, but honestly not by much. Leveling is real effort in vanilla.
---
What I am wondering and what I'm sure is very difficult to predict accurately, is the percentage of classic players who will play both versions of the game vs those who only play classic, this includes: Entirely new players, old veterans who quit in xx expansion and are returning, people who will permenantly quit the latest version of the current retail game when classic goes live.
---
This is relevant because to people on the current version of retail, Blizzard gets their sub no matter whether they play classic or not. However, they are unlocking a whole new group of subs by offering classic as an option. 
---
Personally, I believe the vast majority will be returning vets. Many people who enjoy the current retail version might give classic a go, but there is a chance they find it too tedious, too annoying without transmogs, easy mounts, etc etc. 
---
My point here is that eventually they won't need to balance the two games around each other because they are two seprarate games with a very small overlapping population. 
---
Again, similarities to OSRS which I can't believe isn't mentioned more here. Originally, AFAIK, as with classic, the game was offered as an additional game mode for exisiting RS3 members. I don't think they expected to take off but today I see a lot of people claiming it is more popular than the original and today the two games function as separate entities and I don't know of many people who play both.
---
I believe it's essentially the same, you just don't have CoH, Prayer of Mending, or Binding Heal. It should play roughly the same as a DS/holy spec from TBC.
---
huh. that just changed my mind in this whole debate.
---
I got lucky and followed a Warlock guide in Vanilla and the guy actually knew what he was talking about the whole time. I wish I could remember the name of the author and find it again. It recommended the trinket, but I never took advantage of it. Now I'm thinking about trying to use it in some kind of macro if its possible.
---
I think its because I'm obsessing about the waiting when I'm awake, so that carries over into my dreams. I've dreamed about being in the game before, but as an 'asset viewer', no-clipping around Naxx and looking at bosses, but being unable to interact with them.
---
Yeah, it wasn't a fun dream.
---
Is this the new meme template? I approve.
---
goodbye degree hello tier 1
---
I think the only thing I will be sad to see missing from classic from later expacs is Arena. TBC was a great expansion, but WotlK wasn't my cup of tea. I do hope to see a WoW Classic Burning Crusade at some point in the distant future!
---
The details that are out are at least that it was a class based mmo where you had a job and could interact with other players in a world while also queing for game modes.
---
Overwatch is basically the second half of that. They kept the background lore and all that goes with that but stripped the mmo side of things.
---
o i c
---
Nothing has been confirmed as of yet (that I have seen) but it would make sense for them to at least release the names probably \~2 weeks before launch.
---
Horde ofc 💪
---
Against 5 of the 8 enemy classes you'll never use it besides team fights. Even against those remaining 3, you won't use it all fights (e.g. retri paladin). It's good in teamfights, but I don't agree with people who heavily prioritise teamfights. There's so many deciding factors to teamfights that it rarely ever boils down to 1 thing. So I don't value Hex of Weakness much just because of its power in teamfights.
---
If you smartly choose who to Plague, you can pretty consistently get off full duration Plagues, from my experience, and the mana cost is often covered by Inner Focus anyway. Of course that means you can never use it in some conditions, hence why Shadowguard is more consistent and generally better.
---
PvP trinket is nice and all, but it has a 5 minute cooldown in vanilla. There's a pretty major difference in uptime, and it means you can use it on stuns instead (which are more important, IMO). I do think Berserking is strong for healers, I just don't quite like dropping that low to begin with, but then I don't main a healer.
---
This is like seeing dinosaur bones unearthed
---
Can I ask where you grinded hyenas in Desolace? I can only find a few of them.
---
Get ready to downrank your heals.
---
Cut out the massive amounts of memes and jokes, cut down on the rambling and get to the point faster, make that point clear and then continue to the next topic, jesus fucking christ this video was bad on so many levels.
---
It would be interesting to hear actual Naxxramas stories and reminisce and compare to my own vanilla Naxxramas experience, but no, nothing but condescendence, arrogance and "jokes" that are fit for a teenager.
---
Mark rogues, nuke healers, and apply ranged CC and snares.
---
It really depends on what you're after. 
---
Once you know what you're doing, the difference between quests only and a Quest/Grind hybrid is only about a ~1.5-2 days, class depending.
---
It's mostly a question of how much mindless grinding are you willing to tolerate.
---
I get the feeling a large amount of people are coming back for a lot more then the raids, like the coherent world and the community.
---
Q
---
OSRS surpassed Runescape like 4 years ago, and blizzard was still in denial back then.
---
C
---
Coming back to the game during Mists and being outright ignored when trying to talk to people was the weirdest thing. It reminded me of running into WoWGlider bots back in vanilla
---
Could roll various chars on a private server with the atlasloot enhanced addon.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room this maybe?
---
The title of the post isn't even clickbait. If you're bored of the grind, make some gold with secondary professions. Its not like hes saying MAKE 1,000g/hr with this INSANE GRINDING METHOD.
---
yet its been under dev for 8 years before classics release..?
---
Yes.  I’d actually be more excited for TBC than Classic.  And I’m extremely thrilled for Classic.  WotLK would be cool too.
---
And I ask myself, why do I play this game just to afk the skill leveling if that's all there is to it?
---
nah make Gilneas a raid + zone
---
Private servers if they don’t progress beyond Vanilla.
---
[removed]
---
If they decide to do a TBC classic server; make everyone level up a new toon there.  Keep all the vanilla toons on that server and everyone will experience full leveling again in TBC with a new toon.
---
IMO
---
The cloth turn in quests help quite a bit in this regard too.
---
Only 12% rolling with the intention of tanking. Thanks for helping me make my decision on what I am going to roll!
---
Mained a Human Warlock at launch, I’ll main one again.
---
It is just a dumb theory, you are right lol.
---
Baraka lookin good in the new Mortal Kombat
---
His question is, in classic, will he need to buy mount training for 900g or will he be able to ride the pvp mount without it.
---
No need to get upset, it’s honestly confusing how all the mount changes happened. Not everyone has been sifting through patch notes and wowhead while playing pservers to work these things out.
---
You’re literally masking numbers up out of thin air.
---
So many great memories to try and relive.
---
&gt; https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Hmmm this could be close, but it seems to be modern WoW not classic, unless I am missing something
---
Hell yeah. My nostalgia over vanilla is why I'm playing classic so I'm definitely going to pick up my undead priest as my main. I will, however, be changing my primary alt from a feral druid to an elemental shaman.
---
Hmmm interesting idea, could be quite a lot of work though
---
OP wants to play shadow, the general idea of which is to not have to drop shadowform unless it's dire. If he needs to drop out shadowform to heal, to get back into shadowform is 40% of your base mana. Plague is just another tool in the overall toolkit to help extend the time that you remain in SF.
---
Berserking is also on a 3m cooldown, but again...if OP needs to drop form then berserk a greater heal...better have 40% of your base mana to get back into form.
---
For a Priest who wants to PvP as disc or a trispec and heal, I think troll wins. For pure shadow I'd go undead.
---
i think the weapon skill is worth getting and maybe dwarf healers but other than that meh
---
Not really.  Assuming you’re starting from complete scratch, all you have to do is install the vanilla client, update realmlist to applicable server, install atlasloot enhanced.
---
Then go create your level 1 chars and see what the armor looks like on them.
---
Hilarious
---
Is that not the case in retail?
---
oh ok i see what you mean, what does this atlas loot thing allow me to do anyways?
---
Proof?
---
Nope
---
What technical aspects do u mean? As long as it doesn't change the game (ofc we dont want lag and stuff, if ppl are arguing for that they are stupid or memeing)
---
Alliance was dominated by the younger segment, which will be much smaller this time around. Won't be a problem.
---
It may sound silly, but I had the best childhood growing up outside of WoW. I had an amazing group of friends, was always out playing around, having fun, partying etc...but even In those moments, I couldn’t wait to get home and play WoW. I never played properly after LK for a long time. Now (25) i have an amazing girlfriend and a huge group of mates, as well as finally having some goals to aim for in life(studying for a degree in history). As great as all of that is, I found out last week that Blizz is FINALLY providing us with vanilla....proper vanilla. All I’ve done since then is read through this forum and prepare! It may seem trivial in the grand scheme of things but I have never been so stoked for anything in the last 5/6 years as I am for classic.
---
I know what you mean. In my friends group, there hasn't been a 'new' game that got us all excited and wanting to play together. But Classic did that.
---
Search all relevant gear in the game by set, or dungeon.  And then you just alt + click on whatever you want to see and it shows you what your character would look like wearing that piece of gear.  I typically just do this with the various tier sets, but you could theoretically do it with random dungeon drops if you wanted.
---
Never fished in WoW before, can two people fish in the same pool without any trouble? is there a finite amount of fish in the pool?
---
hmm i see, thank you
---
20% healing defbuff is HUGE, dude. Enemy healers have to spend 20% extra mana. Mana regen isn’t very high in Classic.
---
How did I decline to answer “again” this was my first post on this thread.
---
I said what I wanted to say, not really looking for an online argument.
---
I think you replied to the wrong guy.
---
If you're in Party/Raid just proximity is enough for the HK.   If you heal or remove a debuff on someone in combat with another faction you will also get the HK even if you aren't in party.   You'll do fine as a holy pally in endgame pvp and earn plenty of honor.
---
Why are they better at any of those things?
---
Well after a lot of thinking and pondering, i decided that i will be playing owc warrior again.
---
I’m thinking mage/lock for my alt...hats off to anyone that levels a prot warr or priest XD
---
Dont do this to me... Dont get my hype up
---
If you look down the bottom right of the character pane there’s a HD/SD option, it’s default on HD but swapping it to SD changes the character models back to the old Classic ones. :)
---
My experience as Undead Shadow Priest is that Devouring Plaguw gets either resisted, or dispelled within 3 seconds. It’s the most overrated spell in the game, IMHO.
---
And a large amount of people will leave because of the boring and outdated gameplay.
---
Big up to anyone that levels a warrior, I know it’s not easy haha. I’m taking the easy option with a hunter...sorry not sorry! XD
---
Damn 20 days to hit 60. That’s insane haha.
---
No. Blackout procs on Initial Shadow DAMAGE. Stop spreading misinformation, please.
---
You can disable caps lock function in the registry if you are using windows. 
---
Sort of a permanent thing though (you prob can fix it later but I’m not sure.)
---
I personally don’t have CAPSLOCK function on my pc and I don’t miss it.
---
Yeh I feel ya. I genuinely want to try and relive the exact same route I took in the beginning! Might seem stupid but I want that real nostalgic feels!!

I mean you could use q e r t g f c x z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and any and all ctrl / combos. I wouldn't use it simply because I hate cap typing.
---
I was going to make an Undead Mage like my first char was, but two of my friends are going mage already.  
---
Going Tauren Druid this time.
---
because there's much more to that game than just grinding skills
---
For Horde I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Undead is a fine choice and you can perform great DPS with it, no problem.
---
Like part of me wants to go herb/alc, but mining/engi interests be, they got all fun stuff. Buuuuut then blacksmithing i could craft gear and some other stuff.
---
Why is this so hard
---
Booyaka, booyaka, nixed online!
---
Typical BFA player that doesn't realize he's playing a dead game
---
I ended up using it for years as my interior. My buddy was yelling at me the othe night because he said it was the dumbest keybind ever LOL. I’ve decided to avoid it unless I really need to use it
---
A great staff for a month, or a mild convenience for a year? The choice is yours
---
The fury warriors and rogues are the "savory delight" melee
---
The old bald guy looking at his feet?
---
Meme ALL DAY.
---
That sounds perfectly viable and easy to reach. Middle click is pretty sweet but it's the way I was shown on day one and it's all I've ever known.

We need to summon the date again, as it accidentally declined it.

---
WoW2 already happened it was called Cataclysm it sucked.
---
My friend that got me into WoW was a Nelf Druid! Got a lot of time for people that roll that class!
---
Hooray! Half the reason I made it was to help people make decisions like that; really glad it helped!
---
As horde PvE go orc, PvP go orc or undead. It makes a difference in raids if you want to top dps but at the end of the day, it's for min-maxers
---
I’m tempted by a lock!
---
Yea, man, Classic looks fine. I would be happy if they could increase the view distance and support higher resolutions. (But make those optional)
---
Also, it doesn't feel smooth. Despite claiming 60fps, it doesn't feel like 60 and I don't know if that is a limitation of the old engine on modern hardware. So any under the good optimization would be nice.
---
How much difference? 5%? 10%?
---
What if they added a whole new expansion after vanilla and not BC.
---
I hate it cause my favorite spec has always been ele shaman but I wanna play alli AND DPS shaman seem to be Uber dumpster when it comes to classic, I've been thinking of priest but never healed in an mmo and have no idea how to level them haha
---
Sorry I don't have the numbers on an unreleased game 1 year in the future, I can guess based on a few things. 
---
Like the peak of Vanilla gameplay being just grinding mobs which is a non existant concept in modern gaming. 
---
Or private server populations constantly dying over the course of a year and no private server maintaining a healthy population over more than 2 years, and that's with it being free.
---
Or the fact that 70% of characters created on the most popular pserver are below level 20 with only 5% making it to 60.
---
Or the fact that the last oldschool MMO (Wildstar) fucking failed indicating that outside of ex-wow players there is no demand for a game like that.
---
But sure, lets keep living in this delusional bubble where classic wow is a masterpiece that will once again revolutionize gaming.
---
Careful your insecurity is leaking
---
I’ll be returning to enh shaman because 2h Sham doesn’t exist past vanilla and it was my favorite. I’m so excited to play it again. 
---
That being said. Undead is my favorite starting era. I had an undead rogue and mage but I’m going to play priest which I’ve never even had an alt of to play something different in my favorite zone.
---
Real because it's the TBC prepatch on a time-appropriate operating system
---
No need to apologize, just stop presenting it like it’s fact.  Because it’s not anything more than an arbitrary guess.
---
That’s the other issue...profs! Do you go straight up mats grinding or put effort/money into a profession that you can get gear out of!? Or a combo of both!? Would be interesting to see people prof strategy/ combos!
---
The absolute most important thing is to play a class you enjoy. If the spy/assassin fantasy appeals to you, go nuts.
---
Dude it’s hyping me!! I’m literally shaking today I load in. Run some quests hearth and I’m getting a stupid dwarf on a flying mount as my load screen
---
Very small difference horde side.  Ally side, ive never seen numbers but 5-10% increase for human over other races has commonly been said.
---
If you have a razer keyboard with the desktop application, you can re-route the functionality of CAPS and change it to another.  
---
For example I changed CAPS to CTRL because I struggle to press CTRL where it is now. Now I can use CAPS as my CTRL modifier key.
---
It’s hard isn’t it...stick with what you know/good at...or go down a completely different route for a new challenge/experience!
---
I believe by 1.12 it was changed so 2-4 people can achieve R14
---
This is how I used innervate as a druid in tbc+. If it restored 20% mana for example, I'd use it at 85% mana and by the time it was finished I would have used another 5% mana and be at 99-100%
---
and then I'd have innervate again at the end of the fight sometimes.
---
The problem is that most classes are cool in their own way. So it’s more of a mood if you feel like healing one day and then being a warrior the next.
---
Bein 2 dam gud
---
There’s a ton of in-depth videos, quite enjoyable to watch imo, about class picking.  
---
Rogues are GREAT at lvl 60, both in PvP and PvE, but second to last in terms of leveling efficiency.  
---
  
---
I suggest more research before picking, but actually that’s just me, you could also just say fuck it I’m picking Rogue.
---
Well a normal Mount is clearly superior to one that requires Mana.
---
Lok’ Tar
---
Sorry I must have soaked it up from your own posts :) 
---
I have zero concerns about the population classic will have. !remindme in 100 days so I can say I told ya so 😘
---
I mained gnome warlock in vanilla. I plan to remake him as an alt and go dwarf priest this time since I'm playing priest in bfa now.
---
I always had pet control set to caps lock-
---
Hunter pet
---
Warlock pet
---
Dk pet
---
Hit caps lock twice to send your pet to attack a target and don’t worry about leaving it on
---
I forget the key I had to deaggro my pet tho

Don’t tease me like that!

I would say 2 imo. Herbs are better spread along zones than just the mountainsides that deposits seem to follow
---
Well you made me more confused, so it evens out :P
---
They are around the join on emu forums and stuff. It's cool to whip around the map and see all the stuff that was under construction back then.
---
Twist! This photo is from the future and he's playing Diablo on his phone.
---
40 man raid for level 20s lol
---
Noooooo 😂
---
I had a friend who model swapped undead over dwarves so he could be an undead on alliance. he wore full armor always so it never looked weird but all the other dwarves on his client who weren't looked hella weird.
---
Not agreeing with him is no reason to downvote guys :P
---
It is solid.
---
If your group doesn't know what they are doing then it is also worth to do it because afterwards everyone knows how to clear it.
---
Yeah use numbers at launch to show that the game will be dead a year after that, you will certainly show me. But keep living in your little deluded bubble.
---
I swapped Capslock with Cntrl because I am really bad at reaching that far with my pinky. Just get KeyTweak and it will do all the registry changes quick and easy. I've considered swapping my alt and tab keys as well.  :)
---
Much easier levelling a priest in the later expansions...hope you’re ready for the challenge! XD
---
Lmfao dude
---
My very first character was a dwarf warrior but my main ended up being a night elf hunter. I’m going to be a dwarf hunter on release.
---
I had a chance at both and Spinal Reaper is way better.  Atleast for a warrior.  The rage generation you get when you kill someone in PVP is INSANE.  That thing will take you to High Warlord or Ashkandi easily.  It's one of the best the entire classic.
---
I chose Soul Harvester because nothing beats that badass staff! The looks alone are worth a potential ~5 stat loss (vs the dagger and a really good offhand)
---
Yeah but pally buffs &gt;.&gt;
---
What I remember wasn't threat problems but if the hunters assigned to kiting the mobs weren't used to kiting they would straight up mess up movement. Usually strict PvE Hunters back then had no idea how to kite.
---
But yeah, I can imagine that today people will do more DPS so this fight plays out differently.

Soul Harvester was always an easy choice imo.

Lol. Also why is there basic rotation mathematics on a cartesian plan in a classroom for adults? Are schools that bad in America??

Fuck that, shotgun 5 and be too blasted to play and fall behind, pass out, wake up, regret decisions

All for one soul shard? They’re so easy to get lol

The world seems so huge and wide open. That's an improvement over current WoW
---
I’M OUT OF MANA

-you have died

Wotf has very niche and minimal uses in raids, no where near enough to overshadow a 25% attack power increase. That being said I don't know the exact dps difference, more noticeable for humans who have the weapon skill bonus
---
Whats adorable is you thinking I'm offended by a bunch of deluded kids on this subreddit. I wish I could see you when your bubble bursts.

Why not sell the leather on the auction house? Does it not return as much?
---
I meant on an official server at level 60.
---
As others have mentioned, if Blizz makes a new MMO soon, it should be the Starcraft universe. So many options with different planets to explore, spacecrafts, etc. if done right, could be incredible.
---
Rag/ony yeh

You just start covering that module in high school, bub? Some real iamverysmart vibes coming from you.

The movie lists 32/8/11 at the end but doesn't go into details. Based on the spells used I would guess it looks something like this:

Start grinding immediately and leave the common rabble in the dust
---
who cares?
---
That always brings me back. I wonder if WC2 bnet edition can still connect to bnet. I know Diablo 2 still does...
---
Tauren instead of Troll, but I'll be going Shaman again that's for sure. But instead of taking it super seriously, I'll be trying Enhancement tanking with my buddies in dungeons. Even if I was planning on being Resto, I have no desire to return to the progression raid scene.
---
Originally rolled NE hunter during vanilla.  Jumping sides and going to play a shaman.  Already done hunter. Not much interest in a repeat
---
Can you describe the one you're looking for? I might have it on one of my older machines.
---
Yeah if i play shadow i want to go all the way. I thought troll would be the most useful since it's more mana efficient and procs blackout more than undead for example. I'm open to using either but I'd never try to drop shadow form to heal as long as vampiric embrace can keep me up enough so I can burst and kill me before I get dropped.
---
On a fresh server, everyone will be low level and everyone that knows what they’re doing will be starting with Skinning, so there will be way more supply for leather than demand. Hypothetically, you could save the leather for a few months to put it on the AH for a higher profit, but you’re better off vendoring it for immediate gold so you can buy your level 40 mount.
---
lol @ the water coolers (played mage)
---
I spent over an hour this morning in gadg on a pserver, afk while I finished some work. Throughout that time a 60 mage and a 60 lock (both rank 3) stood at the safe spot near the anvils and nuked every 40-50 horde that ran past. A horde lock eventually turned up and destroyed them, but after he left they returned and were joined by a hunter. Never underestimate the number of mentally ill people  that play wow.
---
Have fun in your dead game 😘
---
I don't know if pserver combat tables work exactly like retail did, but weapon skill theorycrafting was well-established back in vanilla. [This](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill?oldid=349241) archived wowwiki article from 2006 has a pretty good breakdown of what players knew about weapon skill back then.
---
So from what I can figure out since I didn't play classic for a long time just strictly as an undead rogue... shadow priest can fight 1 vs 2s or 1 vs 3s as long as mana is not an issue which it is unfortunately. Locks combined with sm ruin destruction can pull it off or SL locky. Then perhaps the king of them all in these 1 vs 2 or vs 3 situations would be a mage since they have so much control and cc at their disposal.... 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm torn between these 3 classes as well as choosing between undead or troll for shadow but i'm leaning more towards troll because they are more mana efficent and not as cool down reliant since Devouring plague is on a 3 minute CD. If I want to global people I guess destruction lock or mage would be the best way to go for that kind of play style.
---
Yea you should do more research on leveling. Rogues level fastest of all the melee classes.
---
For the Alliance!
---
That's very true unless you have a warrior in your group
---
Dont forget your meds before bed
---
Didn't know Devouring Plague could be resisted too.
---
I think it's true you can survive well but the bear damage is soooooooooooooo bad and all you're doing is waiting for maul
---
Not unlike warriors and heroic strike, I suppose!
---
I'm not trying to knock vanilla/classic at all but as someone who started playing WoW a lot later I have to ask. 
---
Why were mounts so damn expensive back in the day? Like given how rare people say gold was in vanilla, 900g for an epic mount sounds insane. What was the purpose for that besides requiring more grinding after max level for an epic mount? 
---
Or was 900g not as bad as people make it seem now? I'm genuinely curious.
---
Just buy a pc from bestbuy this is really unnecessary
---
Commonly incorrect. Data parses out to about 2-3%. Basically negligible.

Yep staying with a mage, my alt will be a druid instead of a priest, but the mage will stay the same
---
Only you can prevent overhype.
---
I keep hearing those are all fucked up and covered in super glue

Building it is extremely easy. Follow a youtube video. Itll take less than an hour. Itll be a lot more rewarding too.
---
Racials mostly. The wpvp bosses are easier due to zone convenience
---

---
Oh yes makes sense. Thanks!
---
By the light!
---
Monday man, Monday.
---
The guy who recorded this is awful to listen to. Boring and complaining all the time, it was an alpha, what'd expect?
---
No they aren't, The quality of the pre built systems has gone up in the last few years and it would be a lot more efficient to order that and pick it up the next day than outsourcung an entire build
---
Warlocks can drain tank in vanilla too right? I did that when leveling 1-70 in TBC
---
Well great 🤣
---
Blizzard will not go to trial over that. Their lawyers charge 300 an hour at a minimum. Something like this never hits their legal team
---
Well if he is truly helpless and can't watch a youtube video (you would be surprised) then a bestbuy build is the way to go
---
Nope.
---
Didn't really realize how much they botched the plot until you laid it out like that hahaha
---
He’s not *the* guy, but he was one of many. He really just put up a 10 minute rant about Nostalrius’ shutdown. It’s just called “the Blizzard rant”. 
---
It’s not a lot of effort or anything, but he’s a *huuuge* youtuber, with a crazy high sub count and fans checking his page every day for years for new content. So he didn’t really champion the cause, but he was possibly the biggest personality to make a video about it. It’s also a pretty funny and relatable video, you should watch it if you’re a fan of his content.
---
You won't need to worry about zone congestion with sharding, that's the reason they're implementing it in the first place, so no need to rush.
---
Everyone knows you pick the names first then you log on to level :p
---
I mean either way smoke breaks are very disrespectful.
---
Lol whoops!
---
Aight you got me that's pretty fucking funny.
---
You just took a picture from the Instagram account rigsofdad and photoshopped in a WOW screen.
---
I’m in the same boat. I hope they tweak up Wrath a little bit though. It could really benefit from a Mythic difficulty for 5 mans, heroics are a joke. The content is *greeeeat* but it’s too easy to be fun. 
---
Also, if they were to make the LFG tool just work for 1-60 and let the higher end content stay community driven.
---
There's a couple of versions depending on preference/gear.
---
[Spec A](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZVxxsc0dtVxf0x) Offers some more mana regen which may be necessary if your gear is lacking and finding yourself struggling not to go OOM.
---
You can swap into Natures Swiftness or Leader of the Pack depending on personal preference.
---
[Spec B](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZVxxsc0dtVxf0x) This spec is the more comprehensive tank build with sufficient resto talents for raid and dungeon healing if you're well geared/your group is good.
---
Pick whichever you forsee yourself doing more of. If you're unsure then personally I prefer to go with Spec B and try and mitigate mana with consumables. If it's still a hard time then Spec A should make the difference.
---
If TSM is available I’ll have an alt account running it day 2.
---
"gameplay"
---
It's just a bunch of idle walking around.
---
Well, one of these items makes you look like the grim reaper personified ...
---
Rogue is a great class in vanilla. Very good in wpvp, but not great in BGs, and great raid dps
---
Is that  trinket Darkmoon Card: Twisting Nether?
---
I used that well into TBC as a priest, but in a non-standard fashion: I only equipped it once I died, while in guardian spirit form, for the slim chance I'd come back to life. This trick stopped working at some point.
---
Calling it now, there will never be a wow 2.
---
Wow is on the decline, MMOs have been dying for years, it's an old idea now. With blizz in such a weird spot right now they need to keep WoW floating for as long as they can while they think of the next big thing (which will not be a sub-based mmo).
---
Once they sink into that China mobile money they might not develop AAA games as we know them at all.
---
I remember seeing so many ret paladins decked out in T2 back in the day. Why was that? 
---
Saw a T2 pally on Nost with Sulfuras too, never understood why they ran around in healing gear.
---
I would like to see another MMORPG come out. Last thing to come out in the last 20 years was LOTRO which was a failure and Maple Story/Flyff which are garbage.
---
Keep responding ol bfa fanboy
---
I was referring to a video by Kargoz. It’s still pretty slow to level, regardless of if you place them above Paladin and Shaman, which I don’t.
---
I’m just competitive by nature. The context behind what I said is - I wanna get higher levels than anyone else the fastest. Even if it’s not reasonable and I’ll probably get distracted by exploring and listening to the Gregorian Chanting inside the small cathedral at the human starting zone. :)
---
I just wanna be da best ya feel
---
It feels like a slippery slope to me if they commit to doing that. There's a huge amount of people who's favorite expansion was WOTLK. 
---
Imagine how many people are going to eventually want WOTLK servers (or already want them). People could probably make arguments for every expansion which is obviously not sustainable.
---
I mean you're not wrong, I stand by it though fuck transmog
---
osrs took away the most important play interaction mechanic they had : trading. 
---
just use GE u dont have to talk to anyone . u can solo literally all content its shit
---
only good mode is ironman btw
---
In Onyxias lair, the path down to her boss room has the terrain inclining downard, with short stops where the elevation goes slightly upwards. You will find yourself losing line of sight on these often. Going forward to get a good angle is a mistake, as you will almost certainly take a fireball intended for the tank. Possibly killing gnome mages in stamina starved pre-bis gear.
---
just pick orc its hot and op
---
The thing is, though, Blizz wants players to play retail. That's where the cash shop is. Subs are a small bit of the money they make. It just makes them look good to have them.
---
What I believe they're gonna do is force a content drought in classic right before a new expansion or content patch drops in hopes that people who normally wouldn't play retail hop over just to get their fix and hopefully spend some money in the cash shop. Maybe even just a $60 level boost to get straight into raiding.
---
Making it the same sub is a good idea because it's just one more step closer to someone making a cash shop purchase.
---
I can’t decide between a mage/lock alt!
---
I can’t decide between a mage/lock alt :/
---
Both solid choices, can't go wrong
---
I played for a year in vanilla and never got my epic mount haha. No time for that
---
Ottawa here, close enough?
---
ZG tiger
---
We agree on that.  
---
It all comes down to a different set of standards. I've held pee in for hours just waiting on a collective agreement that we should all break.  
---
As you said before, I will be forming a group of people who hold the same standards that I do. Speed, skill, micro and macro efficiency, and a regard for the group.
---
same I was I think 14 when I made my blizzard account. Complete fake name.
---
Be more specific? Are we 100% positive that all calculations that anyone has done that includes weapon skill at all are 100% accurate? Maybe, maybe not. Are we probably very close? Yes. Would the slight difference really make a difference? Probably not
---
Mate you’ve gotta remember this isn’t retail, most people won’t care about a 5-10 even a 15% dps difference unless you’re going hardcore no life etc. Play what you think looks awesome and for you it seems like troll 👍
---
I see this a lot on here. I never had trouble in vanilla finding a group as a retribution paladin. Nobody cared. I didn't tell them I was ret, but I was eternally wielding a two-handed hammer and hitting things with it, so it was pretty clear.
---
it doesnt matter for horde much at all
---
pick whatever you think is best OUTSIDE of pve honestly
---
That one always happens when going into certain areas or when loading is slow/goes wrong. It's happened a few times as a weird glitch, if its just the dwarf on the gryphon its been like that for a while now.
---
I'm looking for evidence of the contrary. Evidence that we've been wrong. If no such evidence exists and we have a lot of confidence in the other direction, then that's good news.

I went with Dwarf Priest because that's what my mate said to play, only because his guild needed a priest. I never enjoyed healing all that much so this time I'm going to rock a Gnome warlock.

Oh word I only ever hear about the undead and orc racials being good as counter cc, what alliance racials should you watch out for as a horde player? Im thinking orc shaman or troll priest lol
---
Close enough! Have a bunch of the old competitive Toronto raiders and pvpers coming back, but nowhere near enough for a full guild.  It would be nice to get a group of competitive wowers to play with and even do some crazy lan events together.  Community is still going to be the most important aspect, and I'm willing to put in the work for those interested.
---
Heyoooooo
---
No it doesn’t, runescape is garbage, classic wow is awesome.
---
Awesome, LMK if you ever end up forming a guild or something, also have some friends who are down to play (some might be more casual but just want to be part of the community if thats okay)
---
What would WoW 2 even be? 
---
Basically another expansion? I don’t see how they could improve the game at this point other than what thy re doing now by going back a releasing the best versions of the game.
---
Fly off the handle much?
---
Update 4/13/19
---
We saw some confusion about a specific part of this post so we want to be clear that Customer Service will NOT be transferring items in WoW Classic and the system that we outlined will be in the players’ hands. If we were to go down the road of developing a policy on item trading, we believe it would end up allowing the exact same kind of abuse that we are trying to minimize with the 2-hour trade window system which we outlined in the original post.
---
Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter. Remember to play nice, play fair folks!
---
Lasher farmer was definitely around in vanilla. I remember trying to do it and getting my ass kicked because I was a dumbass.
---
On every pserver I have played you can reset the dungeon and log back in where you were with the instance reset. It is always a different technique and sometimes with multiple toons. This shit was always wide spread amongst certain people who bounce from pserver to pserver.
---
No news. To bad, was looking forward to a juicy blue post \^\^
---
I don’t see how people can roll the same character. I made a night elf rogue during vanilla that’s still my main today. Maybe it’s a little weird but I’m just too attached and there’s no way I could replace him with a copy. If I did roll another rogue I’d at least change the race or gender to it feels different, but I’ll probably end up rolling a mage anyway.
---
It does
---
You can get both Rhok and Lok just by talking to the NPC after you turn in to get Rhok
---
if you're pvp, trinket *every.**single.**time.*
---
can't use a spellstone with a staff.
---
100 DPS seems accurate enough
---
I think this is the truth.  I do think that long-term they'll eventually make a new game in the Warcraft universe, but it won't be an MMO.
---
O'gar
---
I have never seen any solid numbers on it.  I suppose its a lot harder to show pre target dummies.  So many other factors when comparing parses.
---
Ah, yeah that sounds like a pretty serious bug, so you would just jump on behind the door, mine it all, reset the instance and logout, then you just have to log back in and you stayed behind the door with new nodes?

Classic wow loading screen, the true first picture of a black hole.
---
Be vague much?
---
Messing up your rotation or being less optimal with your boss mechanics’ movements will be a bigger dps determinant than weapon skill I assure you of that.
---
&gt; it could make wands&amp;off hand more viable  
---
Sounds like you think the wand is in your main hand?  
---
Just to be clear, wand goes in the ranged slot and can't be enchanted and can't have oil applied.  
---
Offhand goes in the offhand, and a one handed weapon goes in the main hand, and you apply your mana oil to that or a staff.  
---
I've seen Mindtap Talisman listed as pre-raid BiS trinket in some people's opinions, so the idea of using mana regen consumes is not entirely far fetched. It might just require testing to reach the proper balance between DPS consumes and mana regen consumes.
---
It's been so long since I seen it. But I believe it was a human lock using voidwalker if I remember right the first song was some some euro folk type band something that sounds a little like this https://youtu.be/e7kJRGPgvRQ that's obviously not the song but it has that kinda tone to it. But it has been 10 years so I hope I'm right in remembering ;) if you have the right one you would literally make me the happiest person on Earth
---
I think it's the color not to sound racist but I really dislike the blueish tint they have and I dislike how they look in general. I do love their emotes though.

16 debuff slots and a non private server less min max mentality. shadow priests will definitely find a spot. Oil/dark runes/ demonic runes etc will help a lot. Also if unaware Shadow weave hybrid healer is a very nice way to play priest if going full healer doesn’t appeal. Unfortunately, most casuals might not be aware of it and convincing your raid leader could be hard. 
---
Basically the hybrid priest shadow weaver just initially spams rank 1 mind flay to get full stacks of the shadow dmg debuff for the Warlocks then heals while weaving in rank 1 mind flays to keep the debuff up. 👍
---
Isn’t it 16?
---
It's the image of the person that generated the first image of a Black Hole, but this has the laptop photoshopped to the WoW login screen. It took me a minute to notice!
---
Does this mean you can´t roll need anymore and then have a GM transfer the item to a group member? That would be great and seal the deal.
---
ORC is a bit overvalued IMO. You have 25% increased stun, which means 3/4 of the time you have no advantage. Making your fights feel too RNG heavy. Yeah a lot of classes have a stun, and also grenades count as stuns but, also consider that your PvP trinket can remove stun. Also consider that FAPs make you immune to stuns for 30 secs. 
---
WotF is 100% reliable, and you will often get caught in fears out of beserker stance. Having that extra fear protection will make a big difference in fights vs warlocks and priest and other warriors. 
---
Tauren warstomp is a nice extra stun; and you potentially can have increased range with melee weapon. The increased health is nice too.
---
Trolls can use berserking for some good burst. 
---
IMO choose what you enjoy. They are all great choices with the right consumes and support
---
It's 16
---
Thank god they didn’t call them memes back then
---
tough shit policy, good news
---
I beat half of the nerds knew this
---
If i were you I really wouldnt expect to go out and consistently 1v2 or 1v3.  Mages can do it often against groups of melee or if they can sheep a non melee. Rogues can with all their CDs up vs unprepared opponents.  Shadow priest is going to have a rough time against equally geared opponents in 1vX. Your fear is on a long cooldown, you have no CC, and many classes will take your entire manapool to kill alone. Vampiric embrace healing is designed to be minor aoe group healing not self sustain. While warlocks have much higher self sustain and multiple CC tools they can also toss up to 4 dots on multiple enemies. Spriests can do 1...
---
I will roll both a new class and role
---
Sorry, that's what I meant
---
I didn't know you could bind stuff for a while almost 8 months in vanilla.
---
Didn't figure out you could bind more than the main bar in TBC.......lmao
---
Never read through rest of the keybind screen when I didn't see it next to the other one

Goodbye two daughters of 1 year and 1 week and wife, hello classic
---
And he'd be at his Hearthstone Location after Cataclysm's launch
---
It says “customer service will NOT be transferring items”
---
That is exactly what it means. I think high level management is keeping their hands out of Classic except for 1 core mission statement to the Classic Team.
---
Keep Classic WoW operating with as minimal overhead as possible. They know they have to keep microtransactions out, so the alternative is make operating costs as low as humanly possible. Meaning minimal customer support. The only changes they are being forced to make is changes that will prevent people from feeling like they need to contact customer support.
---
Ohhh I like their response.  
---
  Sounds like old blizz, not this lovey dovey circle of peace shit they have going on lately.
---
Yeah it’ll be a buff for Warlocks. However, I doubt you’ll be able to put up corruption unless you’re the imp blood pact lock. A real buff will come from the highly likely inclusion of a shadow priest and their Shadow damage increase de buff.
---
Afaik smite crits are only 150% vs the 200% from talented frost mage or ruin locks. Seems underwhelming.
---
Wait, really?? That sounds amazing if true, in the right situations of course.
---
I’m worried for that one noob hunter who is like 9 years old and ninja loots the Warriors axe without realizing it.
---
From the stories I’ve read on here, it sounds like a lot of you were that 9 year old at one point. (I might have been that 19 year old lol)
---
Without a CS team to rectify the situation, that kid might get ostracized and harassed server-wide. I’m not trying to be doom-and-gloom, but this latest gen of kids care about their online personas more than real life. I’d hate to read a story about a kid who harms themselves over bullying in WoW.
---
TLDR: please remember it’s just a game and be nice to each other as much as you can.
---
Not true anymore in Retail, however a strange hitbox bug caused Female Undead to be the only players unable to make some jumps, but that was fixed during Legion.
---
Up to us players to pass jugdment onto the ninjas
---
This is the first one from EU Bloodscalp I've seen in this sub. Greetings! Fellow Hordie here :)
---
This is unavoidable to an extent. I 100% agree with you, but it will serve a purpose. I honestly think that if something like this were to happen, you'd be able to tell it's a child. What matters is how you act after you do it. If you know an important piece of loot for you can drop from a certain boss, and you don't know the people you are playing with, then the onus is on you as well. Clearly communicate that it is a BiS drop for you.
---
I can’t speak for Vanilla, as I didn’t play Priest back the . But I did play in WotLK, and Dev Plague would get resisted all the time. It was such a shit spell.
---
Okay that is great news again. They closed a loophole from vanilla where the  GM would transfer the item no questions asked.
---
I dunno it was plastered all over reddit this week. Most people would know I think
---
I always thought they should have raids for low levels. Level 40 would be an awesome level for a raid.
---
Did someone say Grand Marshallllllll
---
WE ARE THE LAW
---
Was an orc hunter in vanilla and going undead mage in classic. Mostly cause I want to be helpful to the guild, and there's about 10+ coming back for classic. We needed DPS. Mages are great DPS and they have a lot of ways to support a guild with conjuring, portals, gold farming, sheep, great AoE (HoJ farming). Seems like the best fit. I may make a hunter at some point to do the Rhok chain again.
---
VICTORY OR DEATH!!!!
---
GMs did not transfer items no questions asked.
---
If you wanted a loot transfer, you had to be eligible to receive the item.  Otherwise a GM would deny your request.  
---
In theory a rogue GM could have done that, but they would have been fired and the item would have been taken once discovered.  Basically only things eligible for loot trading now would have been allowable for a GM back then.
---
My heart will always be with the Alliance. 
---
Ironforge? Hell yes, that place is cozy. You’re literally inside of a mountain with a bunch of sexy lava keeping you warm. 
---
Stormwind? Don’t even get me started on the gates, or those beautiful lovely hardened (and masterfully carved) statues making you feel protected. 
---
Humans? Freakin yeah dude - I’m a human being in real life, so I can relate to that shit on a sexual level
---
Mrrrglglglglglglgl!!!
---
BfA is more like WoW 4 or something. So many reworks and updates since the beginning. Cata was WoW 2.
---
The dude is right it's like you're dangling some potential information infront of us and not actually explaining anything. Expect that sort of response.
---
It's actually really easy to level a priest in vanilla. Stack spirit and gg. Easy to find dungeon groups as a healer too.
---
19 days played to 60. Seems legit
---
I don't think this is a photo of you, I think you're taking credit for other peoples' hard work.
---
Nah. In the future, classic will be just WoW and retail will be some weird mash that doesn´t know what it wants to be.
---
I can't imagine spending tons of time in a dungeon and being told not to roll need on an actual upgrade. Will literally never do that, everyone's there for the same reason
---
So warlocks would be the best choice for 1 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 engagements? It would probably be a specific build like SL could sm/ruin pull that off too? As for mages that seems like a viable option too to take on groups of people or hunters. I don't want to play rogue since I have played it for so long I got kind of bored of it.
---
Yes, everyone is, but there is a small community aspect to it as well. I will never roll need on a piece of gear (even if it's an upgrade for me) if it is someone's BiS piece. I just do that in the hopes that when I come across my BiS gear, other people afford the same courtesy to me. Your logic isn't flawed, but i respectfully disagree with it. Please note that I'm only referring to BiS items for someone else that are just an upgrade for you.
---
Ahh damn dude, thanks for the info. That bums me out lol it feels bad not working the extra wand dmg available at the beginning of a tree into a build
---
Is it ever lower than that?
---
People forgive 1 minor ninja.   
---
2 makes you a thief.   
---
And something big(mount/legendary) will result in the server banning you from everything.
---
&gt;What the fuck Blizzard, this is bad.
---
That's probably why they changed it then eh?
---
Yes I didn´t specify that. You had to be present in the group when the item dropped and the ticket must come from the person that got the item.
---
I think your debunking attempt was drowned out by your severely overkill low effort memes. You just end up looking like someone who is jealous and you don't even offer a solid compelling counter argument. You're really edgy.
---
Ugh the trauma from when I was 6 and discovered the word c*nt after looting something someone wanted. My mum messaged the guild leader for me and got him booted lmaooo my mum
---
You won't get chased by a mob by ninja looting once unless you got pre bis or bis item that's not for your class. Mistakes happen, people rage and get over it. It's continuous behavior that's getting ostracized.
---
That's not much to go on, but I'll check my collection...
---
You say they were soloing scholomance at 60 on real vanilla?
---
i HAVE USED CAPSLOCK SINCE 2008 AND I UBDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM.
---
Same fam, same.
---
Kripparrian is in the background.
---
Under the inn in Hammerfall and other similar buildings. I have memories of my 35 gnome mage casting pyroblasts on unsuspecting hordies.
---
Well yes, but actually no.

The laptop was the giveaway.

---
im not sure its such a good buff for warlock to use early content, i mean you already have threat issues. In start when tanks are not geared. and if you play horde this is gonna be dangerous to use.
---
So... I'm going to be rolling on every upgrade. Because I'd want everyone to do the same. 
---
If I didn't have the possibility to get loot I wouldn't bother. The idea that I'd have to not roll is worse then losing
---
You shouldn't feel bad if you take somebody's BiS. They'll have another chance.
---
I forget when they changed this but I want to say late Wrath/early Cata. Mobs of appropriate level, for example, would grant the full 10 rep but at level cap I think it was \~1.5. Your chat box would alternate between saying you gained 1/2 rep with &lt;insertion faction here&gt;. Did make summoning Ragnaros a bit more time-consuming when you had to find people who had a) already completed the quest to get a douse or b) people revered (exalted?) that have a permanent douse.

NE rogue and gnome mage in retail vanilla, but now I'm a Hunter at heart!
---
Nope. Was Orc Hunter, will now be Human Warlock.
---
Tldr don't fuck up
---
Roll one anyway, fuck it.
---
Yes. If for example you're a human and want to ride a cat, then get ready to make the brutal trek to Teldrassil at &lt;L6
---
Like I said, your logic isn't flawed and I don't expect to change your mind. Someone like myself would just choose not to play with you. I wouldn't even get angry with you (in game, I'd be kind of salty in real life, lmao). Nothing personal, just different ideals. This blue post is about allowing the community to decide the norms, and you're just as much a part of the community as I am.
---
Weapon skill isn't as bad for rogues because they get some from talents as well as +hit, but it still makes a difference, especially for humans!
---
Maybe as an alt that gets slowly leveled, I was one of those paladins that wanted to be a warrior. I've been a warrior main since burning crusade I'd like to see them in classic.
---
As far as innervating a DPS goes, targeting a shadow priest is the most via let target. That being said moonkin and ele shaman would both do more with it.
---
So we won't have any customer service at all? What the fuck?
---
No. I mained a warrior in vanilla.  I'm rolling a mage for ~Classic~. Mainly because on reflection I think I would have preferred that and it will work well with what I know other people I know are rolling. I enjoyed tanking dungeons in Vanilla but I'd rather not bother tanking now.
---
Both undead though!
---
Dallas Smith (I don’t remember his character names)

Some 9-10 year old that got doxed on my server for doing something similar during Wrath, proceeded to get hate on all of his toons until End of MoP when he either quit or server transferred.
---
Oh lord a classic update this late in the night, I wasn't ready
---
I didn't think I had to say it but yes, this is not actually me. It was a meme format I saw on other subreddits and decided to make a wow post here.
---
Just prior to TBC a blue post gave the weapon skill stats. Yes they matter.
---
You appreciate what you earn. People don't appreciate much on retail when you can earn 4500g with 0 skill by  clicking on a garrison mission.
---
This is such a simple question, yet that seems to make me internally scream haha. I main a mage and play horde since 2007 I think. My first experience was as an orc warrior, playing orcs since Warcraft 2's release. A big part of me wants to go back to what I love, relive my past experiences and all of that. But...
---
Thing is, I am also really looking forward to a new experience. Perhaps playing alliance for the first time and finally getting to know all of it. Finally. Although... Would I be simply playing it that way to experience something new rather than actually playing what I really want and what would be most fun?
---
I am not really an alt guy and I plan on taking my time since the journey is important to me. So this is actually a tough choice.
---
Please let this happen...
---
World of Diablo
---
If your question is 'are rogues good' yeah. Second raid DPS and best 1v1 class.
---
I am. I'm going for a Rogue. My first 70 was a belf male rogue this time I'll be undead, thank god.
---
Didn't say they don't matter.
---
It's kind of annoying would rebind.
---
How am I dangling information when the post is literally asking for any information that a smarter man might provide? I'm quite lost on the topic, hence the post asking for any help.
---
I want to believe so, I'm almost certain tbc hadn't been released yet.
---
You seem upset, not offended. Don't worry though, you'll get over it!
---
So this pretty much confirmed no phasing are sharding here, right? I mean, they say that your reputation will matter. They're pretty much saying that everything you do will only involve players on your server
---
Theres some wonkiness to some upgrades and loot though. If im tanking BRD lava runs for Ironfoe to lose the roll to the paladin healing because he wants it for his 5 man prot tanking set then Id be pretty annoyed. Would you? If not, what about a warrior rolling on this? https://classicdb.ch/?item=5201 since its actually really strong and would no doubt be more of use for the warrior than a caster for its stats? (yes it really would increase the warrior's levleing efficiency much more than the caster). This inferior weapon also drops in deadmines https://classicdb.ch/?item=5194 for comparison. And it being a staff is irrelevant in case you wondering. What classes would say are allowed to roll on this? https://classicdb.ch/?item=1156 Are all classes allowed to roll on it since every class can either benefit off one or both of those stats? As a warrior, I personalty would not roll on the ring if there was a mana user in the group even tho the 2 agility would benefit. As the other redditor commented, probablyapun, I also would not roll on someones absolute bis if its only an upgrade for myself but not bis for me. Thats how it was on private servers and Im hoping thats how it will be in classic. The average private server player is pretty familiar with what pieces each class wants from which dungeon and what pieces they dont want to get. Its not too uncommon for someone to ask the group if its okay to roll on something (such as something for their offspec or pvp set) in order to not come off as a ninja.
---
k so just as we though and nothing new ; )
---
With 4 auto shots the mob is usually below 50% hp or dead. Pretty easy kill at that point.
---
Blizzard: "Look, I don't know how much clearer we have to be - GM loot trading is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN GET OVER IT."  
---
Except really nicely and with far more patience than anyone deserves.
---
they've said this so many times already..there haven't been in game GMs in wow since forever anyway
---
They've been saying that since Blizzcon. The only people who assume otherwise are people that assume they are lying.
---
I dreamed that I was fighting kobolds in the mines of Elwynn a couple weeks ago. Then I woke up and went to work. Quite disappointing.
---
Take off and re-equip all gear before a boss fight, pop demonic runes, then use berserking. 25% attack speed increase. 
---
The first rank14 on my realm was a troll warrior. My friend was a Tauren Hunter in the servers top guild
---
I can't wait to see a druid win an item over you for his tertiary spec.
---
All BoP loot distribution outside of raids with lockouts is final. That is all that this post says.
---
You can also swap the key. F12 is my capslock.
---
i spec'd into human irl and honestly im disappointed to see the racials have little to no impact end game. would pick cowman for classic
---
Sorry, I don’t have a good reason. I’m sure we just followed what the GM and officers wanted, whatever their reasons were.  I know on thadius we would always get to a point where a couple people missed the swap and we would just get whittled down.
---
&gt; Any idea how to make sure you are still writing in lowercase?
---
I mean, when you press enter and start typing, you could look at whether it comes out as *"HEY GUYS WE SHOULD..."* or *"hey guys we should..."* before pressing enter again to send what you're saying.
---
A couple other posts touched upon it, but to more straight-forward: I do believe they're trying to limit a potential ballooning GM ticket workload. They've cut their staff, automated, and streamlined, so it makes sense that they're heading us off at the pass and doing it like this. WoW probably accounts for most of their time-consuming ticketload even with the streamlining, so having a second WoW to maintain was going to be a strain for them. Having a low GM ticketload is a big priority from their side of things.
---
Generally seems to be what the community wants anyway, so the perspectives align.
---
Absolutely! I said the exact same thing like an hour ago, but you made it sound better. :)
---
I will have a warrior named Lodekim, but I will likely spend more time on other classes. Not because I don't want to be a warrior again, but because I won't be able to raid outside of maybe pick up groups, and I think I'd enjoy PvP on an under-geared mage or healer or something more than on an under-geared warrior.
---
Going from the vanilla formulas vs a raid boss (lvl 63) and assuming you are attacking from the back the difference is:
---
Base miss rate with zero weapon skill: 12%.  Base crit rate with zero weapon skill 4.4%. (non orc or human)
---
Base miss rate with 5 weapon skill: 6%.  Base crit rate with 5 weapon skill 4.6%. (orc/human with axe/sword or mace OR non orc/human with weapon expertise)
---
Base miss rate with 7 weapon skill: 5.8%.  Base crit rate with 7 weapon skill 4.68%.  (non orc or human wearing Edgemasters)
---
Base miss rate with 10 weapon skill: 5.5%.  Base crit rate with 10 weapon skill 4.8%. (orc/human with weapon expertise)
---
Base miss rate with 12 weapon skill: 5.3%.  Base crit rate with 12 weapon skill 4.88%. (orc/human wearing Edgemasters)
---
TLDR: Rogues can't use edgemasters but they get 5 sword fist and dagger weapon skill from weapon expertise.  The theoretical difference between a human and a non human rogue assuming they both have weapon expertise and sword/fist/daggers would be 0.5% miss rate and \~0.2% damage from crits, so &lt;1%.  
---
For warriors or mace rogues its a bit different.  Without edgemaster's (and not hit capped?) the theoretical difference would be \~6.2% (bit more with &gt;200% crit damage talents.  When both have edgemaster's the difference will be &lt;1%.  When the non human/orc upgrades to T3 level gloves they will get up to 1% hit, 1% crit and 35 str while losing 0.2% less miss and 0.02% crit.  
---
So worst case \~6.2% but more likely &lt;1% difference when attacking from behind on a raid boss assuming classic uses the same formulas as vanilla.
---
Sanctuary of Diablo?
---
Get a plainswalker pet and Ostrichize them!
---
I'll play WoW 2 if it keeps the aspects that I like from vanilla and smashes it with the stuff i like from BFA
---
op is a liar
---
Not gonna lie, I got nervous when they posted about this again before reading it. 
---
“Oh no, they’ve changed their mind!”  
---
*reads post*
---
“Oh fuck yeah Blizzard!”
---
Honestly I've kinda just wanted Warcraft 4 since like, 2011.
---
2-4% horde side. Servers top guilds never care about those things so neither should you. Play a race you enjoy.
---
Large scale sharding was never on the table outside of the starting areas.... They have always said that but people didnt listen. Sharding it to ease the starter areas, Period.
---
They even went as far as to say "There will only be one Kazzak per server" But chicken littles ignored it and made conspiracies anyway.
---
Yah like everyone else has said it has been confirmed that classic and retail will share the same subscription. I've already gone ahead and maxed out my amount of Bnet credit and got 1 token to activate the sub again.
---
I'm not sure if classic itself will be free for existing wow players - I think I read somewhere that it will be coming as a part of normal wow, but could be wrong.
---
Sweet CRT monitor
---
Back in vanilla, Elitist Jerks was the place to theory craft. They had figured all of this out back then.
---

DA BOO
---
VR support....yesssss.
---
Permanent weapon enchants and temporary weapon buffs stack.  You should be able to have your +30(?) shadow damage enchant with spl dmg mp5 oil.
---
My biggest love in classic is end game pvp, primarily Alterac Valley and WPvP. The issue I had in classic was that I played rogue and never had the desire to level cause I felt it was too hard for me (I was like 8 or something). Although I’m much older, I think I’m going to take the Hunter route for a smooth 60 leveling experience (done twice on pservers now and greatly enjoyed it). Would rather get my first 60 out of the way for farming + WPvP potentially and most likely remake my Rogue either second or third and take the slow route and really try to enjoy the OG Nostalgic experience.
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER!
---
I like this stance, but we should remember that loot trading as it stands now will give group members the option to ninja an item secretly. For example, one player could need on an item with no intention to use it and then trade it to his friend to give his friend an extra "roll."
---
There are 3 easy potential solutions that I'd propose, and any of these three would be enough to bring back the accountability that will be needed for the community to deal with ninjas:  
---
1. Send everyone who was in the group (eligible to be traded the item) a whisper message that player 1 traded item to player 2.
---
2. Send everyone who was in the group a voting button (yes/no) that player 1 would like to trade the item to player 2 and require a unanimous vote.
---
3. Just remove loot trading and keep the same stance.
---
Does this mean if I want the ivory raptor on my undead warlock, that I need to go 1-10 in Durotar?
---
If you're the type to show up to raid with every imaginable consumable, then you might want to worry about racial passives that increase dps. If you're the type that doesn't care that much about preparing every consumable, and seriously there are like 20 of them you pop at a time depending on the raid you're doing, then don't worry about and play what you want.
---
Yep this x1000 I grind often and save/sell profitable mats on AH. Also farm mobs almost only mobs that sell decent greys to vendors. I always am able to buy my full pre raid BIS BOE pieces/ epic mount usually right when I hit 60.
---
It does slow down leveling a bit but it feels amazing having a really good power spike immediately when you hit 60. Also many of the BOE pieces that are pre raid bis can be bought before 60 so you snag a few during the 50-60 treck
---
Mages can take on multiple melees due to frost nova and cone of cold being aoe CC.  Mages can also sheep 1 and 1v1 the other, then eat/drink to full and 1v1 the former sheep.  1vX vs hunters you are probably going to get wrecked. 1vX vs 1 equally geared/skilled player and 1 or more bad players and you are probably going to get wrecked (aside from mage vs melees).  
---
If you are talking about doing it on a lock once every 30 min or so when you have rocket helm off cooldown then sure.  If you are talking about noob crushing some undergeared/low skill opponents then sure SL or SM/ruin would do fine but then again most any well played offensive spec should be able to as well.
---
I've finally found my people on this sub. This seems to be such a heavily downvoted opinion.
---
"Ninja looting does have consequences in the community"
---
thats assuming paid name change wont be a thing in classic
---
like ive been assuming all the mmo services modern wow sells classic will sell
---
stuff like race changes and maybe even faction changes.
---
i assumed this not because i want it but because blizz likes money and will want to monetize classic in some form.
---
tbh im pretty sure there will be paid name changes
---
Was a ne rogue, didnt make it to 60. then was a ne hunter made to decently high level endgame at 60. This time I'll either be a druid or a paladin. Very excited about it.
---
going back to my roots of night elf druid
---
And Outland.
---
But point in hand, this is the Vanilla Kalimdor+EK map with 3.0 map changes
---
You were bitching abt che being racist, thats what I was referring to. And reactionary is not a term exclusive to vanguard communism, dipshit.
---
&gt;attack the cancerous retardation that is progressivism
---
Caught a live one here boys!!!! Go choke you fascist fuck
---
Yeah I never like Cataclysm. But this is a classic sub so I’m not sure how this applies.
---
Blizzard pulled one of those alternate timelines and gave people 2012 Macbooks in 2004.
---
I mained Priest from TBC -&gt; Legion (quit), but gonna roll a Druid in Classic because I like tanking dungeons instead of just healing. The "jack of all trades" aspect is just totally me.
---
He literally deconstructed the guys entire argument? Are you just pretending to be that dense?
---
I love this new meme template. Not only is she part of the team discovering the black hole but just as important she is now immortilized on internet with her pic as a meme. 
---
Good for her!
---
All in m saying is that he's no better than the person than he was trying to "debunk". Never said hamsterwheel was a saint. But the same criticisms he used against hamsterwheel could be used against himself due to his meme filled satirical video. Are you that dense?
---
What I do is level blacksmithing to about 80.  It’s not hard to do with copper and it gives you sharpening stones and access to some nice gear that you can craft that will really help you through the teens and early twenties.  
---
After that I just stockpile ore for leveling engineering later on.  I sell the excess ore on the AH.
---
I'm not positive but I don't think the original epic mounts will even be available if the patch is 1.12 off the bat. I really hope that's not the case though. I much prefer the unarmored original mounts.
---
I rolled hunter originally, this time I'm going to roll a war and try tanking and warrioring. Looking forward to being more useful in a role other than DPS. Undead warrior methinks. Or orc.
---
Being nice also includes letting hybrid classes role on all the gear they need. Just because a Pally or druid is tanking your run because all the dps warriors refused to doesn't mean that they don't need the healing gear as well. 
---
Rolling on both doesn't make them a ninja, it's the benefit they get for making groups form quicker by being able to do whatever role is needed.
---
Of note, there are numerous missing FPs (as of 1.12, which Classic will be based on).
---
One major notable example is (Alliance) Theramore &gt; Ratchet &gt; Telandris Point
---
My OG classes were priest and Druid. I will be playing Warrior and Mage
---
Why was a 6 year old playing wow?
---
Check out 5:25 and then 6:22 in the video. Reminds me exactly of this [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9TK4hQKP2II](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9TK4hQKP2II)
---
Sounds like my time with D3 launch, 'cept I wasn't dreaming.
---
Shit I thought I was basically the only one! Ursin was full of gnome warlocks instead
---
And shadow priests can only 1 vs 2 or are they strictly 1 vs 1? Hunters can 1 vs x too right? Not a big fan of that class though.
---
DW shaman were the bomb for pretty much one patch around 2.x ish(which most don't consider 'classic'), I don't think they even made it all the way to BC before the added an internal cooldown to WF to keep main and off hand from proccing at the same time. Once you could only get one every 3(?) seconds it only made sense to have in MH, so the OH wouldn't leach procs. After that, it just wasn't the same. DW Enhance went onto be okayish in BC, but never as flashy and fun as it was for that one pre-nerf patch.
---
zug zug
---
Yeah that's the issue with priests mana pool runs dry too fast.
---
Loot trading will only be possible in raids with a lockout. Not in five-man dungeons, and not in UBRS, since it doesn't have a lockout.
---
Taz'dingo!
---
It isnt a tertiary spec when you're spec'd hybrid. They are all your main spec.
---
Orange side in vanilla was always a disaster with that giant grub that spawned again and again until you killed the alien queen grub pooper.
---
Your original question begs his question, if you needed to research the topic it would be to find out if.....
---
&gt;  Yes they matter.
---
Try to help you some more. Stage6 had just became really big and YouTube i believe hadn't been purchased by Google yet so maybe before Oct 9 2006
---
WoW's ESRB is rated T for teens. If some 9 year old reaches the point where he's started harming himself because of online bullying, his parents are to blame for letting him play.
---
They are so good.  Not perfect: I would've like to see them even more haglike, but they are so much better than the 'cute girls with toofs' we ended up getting.
---
I forget, how many chest pieces can a druid wear in combat?
---
Garithos did nothing wrong.
---
Wait are you saying IF or is there evidence they will :O?
---
KRALNOR?
---
yeah you had to stun them when they got to enrage.  the very last four that were a chained pull... eep.
---
I think they get removed in 1.4, don't quote me on that though.
---
It only works in raids now btw. If someone wants to spend their DKP or risk getting outed by loot council for someone else, you do you man.
---

It's part of what made vanilla wow though. That's fucking stupid
---
Sure go ahead but your reputation will suffer if you take a +2 increase to your stats that would've been a +30 to another party members character/class.
---
I had Phase 1 longer due to community not wanting DM added in at launch. Also with honor system in Phase 2 it can't be more than 2 months. Phase 3 won't be out earlier than 5 months, so still see it being released at the 6 month mark. Phase 3 won't be more than 2 months because that's exactly the time gap as in Vanilla.
---
While pserver players proved the market there will be a significant casual base that returns and I think many will stay for a significant time. 
---
Plus I don't see them rushing out content because it would get cleared quickly by the hardcore base, but the casuals will be left it the dust. Also, it's been 15 years, there really isn't a rush. Once Naxx is out it's out and that's it.
---
Hope no name changes but even then the hassle for it doesn't seem worth...
---
Taurelf is where it's at.
---
You 100% take the extra wand damage while lvling btw. It is a massive dps boost as long as you have a wand and you do get them from a few quests and dungeons. You can choose it for your 60 spec as well for the extra dps when oom. Though for pvp the other option is probably better
---
In vanilla as a priest you wield a wand AND a staff or a mainhand/offhand. So you will always be equipping a wand and melee weapon. You just dont actually beat many people to death once you get a wand
---
&gt;Theres some wonkiness to some upgrades and loot though. If im tanking BRD lava runs for Ironfoe to lose the roll to the paladin healing because he wants it for his 5 man prot tanking set then Id be pretty annoyed. 
---
But the Pally is only healing because the group couldn't find a healer. If it wasn't for him you wouldn't have even has a chance at seeing it drop.
---
except thats not what happened...at all...
---
We'll be expecting to see a lot of new players I'm sure.  These things will happen quite a lot.  Especially when running for BiS gear in pugs, but that is the classic way.
---
I feel like most would be completely fine if at the beginning of the run an agreement was worked out.  It isn't so hard to just say "Mind if I roll need on Ironfoe if it drops?"
---
Most of the problems you are describing can be almost completely avoided with a little communication.  In classic it's the wild west brother.  If I'm running an UBRS run 1need 1greed 1free, and a druid has a need roll to use he can then use it on any item.  Even if it's for vendor trash.  Just talking among the groups will avoid him using it on a Dal'Rend item when another member would like it.
---
Wasn't the Racial 25% BASE attack power, which meant that it did not include gear / buffs of any kind ?  Because that would make Orcs just slightly stronger compared to the other races.
---
I could be wrong though, I never really played an Orc during Vanilla.
---
One of the worst things about him was you get him down to 20% and then your healer dies and you're like "what?!  ..oh yeah that one dragonkin group everyone always forgets to clear".
---
name changes never helped with that in the first place. Let's say I /ignore PlayerSalt and Playersalt changes his name to EvenmoreSalt the name on my ignore list would now be EvenmoreSalt and I could continue to spread the news :p
---
If I end up rolling horde then yes! Shaman all the way. Looks like most of my friends will be going alliance though so.. we'll see.
---
Seems a bit black and white.
---
someones not caught up...
---
I suspect someone has slipped the world of po rncraft loading screens into his addon folder and got confused by it
---
There were more weather effects added in 1.10, and they were removed in Cata, so we should have them to look forward to, unless they were somehow incompatible with the modern codebase and were removed because they didn't play well with phasing etc.

Things explode with windfury buffing 3 melee.

6 year olds are perfect fishing bots.
---
You're just writing in an oddly non specific way. It reads like you're thinking of something specific but just won't say it.
---
Anyway, we can be pretty confident about weapon skill. I don't know what the current knowledge is, but weapon skill was very well understood in vanilla and it was important so it was written down in a lot of places.
---
Your comment was about leveling efficiency. So no it isn't worth it even if you know how to clear it afterwards because we were solely focusing on the exp factor.
---
The proc does not, but the +AP does
---
Priest fear ward is even stronger in PvP than it is in PvE. 
---
A properly prepared PvP group in a premade BG is not fearable in the first engagement because the dwarf priests apply fear ward on another player every 30seconds until everyone has it.
---
No intimidating shout by warriors to bring the positioning into disarray, no psychic scream. This is incredible.
---
Escape artist being on a 1min cooldown which can make or break a fight in 1v1, group PvP etc.
---
A good warrior v mage is duel is a cat and mouse game of catchup. Often the warrior rides in while the mages counterspells the warrior to put him in combat, the warrior rides out again, rides back in when he drops combat, charges, mage blinks, warrior net-o-matics, now the mage either iceblocks or... uses escape artist. You can use it in many situations in which you would be forced to use iceblock with its 5min cooldown.
---
Stone form is not bad when a rogue is 1vX against you and a buddy when the rogue blinds one and tries to nuke the other. Blind gets removed by stone form, you are back in the fight.
---
Shadowmeld is *the* ability synergizing with a night elf hunter and his cat pet. 100% first hit with a warrior engaged and put in combat by the sneak cat. Just very good for hunters.
---
yea the GM interactions really were great sometimes but we can't have it all sadly this time around.
---
Thank you
---
Clever guilds will have tanks using tps gear earlier.
---
they remove it.
---
The only evidence i have is that activision is behind all this. However, this is still a big "if"
---
Oh right I remember this now. It'd be pretty good overall as is now then. My only thought there is that it could still impact PUG raids, since not all raids are 100% guildies. It'd be pretty common to take a few PUGs to fill the raid, and they could potentially roll on and secretly trade items. This could in turn discourage any PUG raids as well.
---
wut1?! It might have been... It was in guide format similar to Icyveins but old school? Gave stat weights priority, spell rotation, a weird respec build to soul link to 60 that worked. Cast drain soul rank 1 with Imp drain soul forever. Wands just do it. Respec SM/Ruin. With all the preraid bis from dungeons. The only thing he didn't say was don't spend tall your gold ranking stupid spells. damn. I think that was the dude. How did he know all that stuff back then?
---
??? What if he just whispered first? Its presumed a pally wont roll on ironfoe is the point. And does being the last person invited to a group give that person justification for needing on an extremely rare drop (6 out of 1000) against a warrior that would be much much more valueable with it. And the pally only came because he wanted the healing ring from the princess quest. The warrior already did the quest , has hoj and is on his 300th run attempt to try and get an ironfoe. (Yes some warriors will be doing that as its both bis for threat for tanking as well as bis for dps warriors). If a pally gets found out that he rolled and won an ironfoe against a warrior for his 5 man prot pally set.. Well consider yourself a ninja whether you personally think so or not because that is gauranteed to be spread across the server as that guy that did that. I formation travels pretty fast , it wasnt hard to know what was going on in private server guilds and what drama was happening, whether it be rankers, guild disbanding or someone ninjaing an ironfoe like that.
---
they can certainly afford it. 
---
So much for classic wow being like vanilla....
---
STRENGTH AND HONOR! ! !
---
By the time these quests were introduced I was already covered in epic gear. A free soul shard once every half hour didn't seem to me like it was even worth the bag slot. I took the staff for the looks.
---
Dont think its exclusive to gnomes, but they can walk under a fallen tree in un'goru crater which could save you from a gank
---
I am torn  between my 2h shammy or my lovely warlock. I think ill lock it a bit first since thats how I started.
---
yep.
---
No worries! As a horde rogue I get plenty of time to enjoy how cozy Ironforge is.
---
Sounds like a PS tbh.
---
I sold my account for lots of money, then years later I asked the guy who bought my account if I could buy it back (via Facebook). He told me that since he wasnt playing anymore I could have the account back for free. 😎
---
Adorable. Hahaha
---
This is an amazing edit.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
I made my druid specifically for tanking 5m dungeons and it still felt wrong not getting Blackhand's Breadth. When do cat durids typically replace that one anyway? BWL?
---
all of the comments in this thread can be their own subreddits.  
---
i fucking love this community.  take me home.
---
I would say this is group specific and make sure to work it out beforehand. If I am healing a group and a druid tank needs on a +healing piece without previously asking, I would be upset. I would expect several others would be also. If we are struggling to find a tank and a condition of the druid tank joining is to be allowed roll on healing gear and the healer agrees, then it's fine of course.
---
Hey! Similar boat! Wife, 2 daughters - although 2.5 and 9 months .....anyone I said my good byes the other day. Now I’m training until Classic launch
---
If the warrior cares that much they can say ironfoe is reserved when asking for more. If the Pally rolls and wins on a reserved item yes they are a ninja. If no ground rules were made before starting the dungeon they aren't a ninja. 
---
How do you know they didn't agree to come just because they thought they'd have a chance at rolling in ironfoe because no-one said there were any loot restrictions?
---
You really have to be top level retarded to make a comment like this.
---
When my hype gets too hypey, I squeeze a few “Dings!” out on the private server. Keeps me from prematurely bussin my Hordey juices into the void. I don’t fully bust though. Just edge to the point of satisfaction then squeeze it all in until legit Classic launch. Anyways, I could go for some fuckin nacho fries
---
I think you‘re not gonna make it to 60 😂
---
Hybrid druids wear 3 sets of gear at the same time?
---
With all due respect what other reason would you have? Weapon skill does 1 thing, makes enemies more dead.
---
Big no for me dog. Going to roll a new class for a fresher experience.
---
It takes both parties to contact the CS team if ninja looting happens (or happened). Probably not something a 9 year old would know how to do.
---
WC = Wailing Caverns
---
No but they always carry 2 sets in their bags. 
---
But again what does this have to do with anything?
---
Can a warrior hold a one hander, a two hander, and a shield at the same time?
---
Hi, /u/fows_cs
---
His guild just gave thunderfury to a Paladin.
---
I’m excited he’s coming back for classic
---
Make a dwarf shadow priest and you might have a good chance to get a raus spot due to fear ward and shadow weaving.
---
If the other person is that keen on winning, he/she would have reserved it when making the group (I assume that 
---
person is the group leader). So if both DPS roll on an upgrade it is fair game in my opinion,
---
My main was a MT for a raiding guild from before WSG til the end of Wrath.  I quit cause I hated Cata.  I’ll be back with a shadow priest as my main and a rogue for my alt.  I had a 60 mage for pvp but I want to play the classes that pissed me off the most now that I get a second go at it.
---
If I join a group that hasn't stated any loot restrictions I'd be annoyed if at the final boss I was told I wasn't allowed to roll on an upgrade. 
---
It goes both ways.
---
Paladin won’t roll on a reserved item because it will be master looter.
---
Also, main spec &gt; off spec so unless the paladin said “I’m gonna roll on Ironfoe if it drops” then he will be considered a ninja looter.
---
The main spec &gt; off spec is one of those unwritten rules that the community at large has agreed upon.
---
If you violate it you can be considered a ninja looter. And no, I don’t care about your definition, I am simply stating what will happen.
---
You roll for the spec you're playing unless otherwise stated. This has been the culture among all classic private servers is all I am saying. If you are a hybrid who plans to roll need on the spec you aren't currently playing without saying anything, many people would see this as bad mannered.
---
Dear god, was her soul also consumed by C'thun
---
I still remember that Beckon video where he went holy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyarUUYeJ-E

He remembers the *fuuuuturrrrrre*!
---
So catchy!
---
Why blink a charge when you should be blinking intercept? Yes, you run the risk of getting imp. hamstring on you, but pretty often you should be able to jump the charge anyway.
---
If they use their nets and walk up to you, that's an easy nova. If they intercept, you blink. If they use a fap to deny your slows? Use poly and just do whatever the hell you need to do.
---
So unless it's a 2v2 (and in that case, cc the healer maybe?) the warrior doesn't stand a ghost of a chance.
---
Warrior starts getting stupid with 2 dispellers, but that is more an issue with dispels being strong and helping negate a big problem warriors have.
---
I'm a filthy defector and play both (alliance Vanilla through Wotlk, Horde Cata through Legion). I got sick of the Alliance aesthetic and music and welcomed the Horde with open arms. Now I'm sick of the huts and drums and welcome the Alliance come Classic launch. 
---
(If modern WoW ever gets good again, I can enjoy both at the same time. Woo.)
---
And quests zone are questable

I was just illustrating on how you might put yourself or get bullied into a situation in which you have to use some anti-snare ability to get free. And this is escape artist.
---
You can replace my little illustration with conc shot, crippling poison, enemy mage's frost nova, really sticky glue or whatever you'd like.
---
Obviously you or he can use a FAP or LIP everytime you get caught or you use Iceblock. Or escape artist.
---
You have a mail back char, you mail him the stacks.  And repeat every 30 days when it times out of not retrieving them on him.  
---
That char can be a lv1.
---
Doing things for fun instead of playing at peak efficiency? Blasphemous.
---
Tbc = thralls balls casual
---
I’m guessing if a guild needed someone to tank whoever stepped up  could be funneled  toms of gear
---
I agree 100% don't do it it will be just not worth it queues that last for atleast a hour, crazy lag ,camped spawns and low fps.
---
that way i can have a pleasant launch and get ahead of 70% of people
---
This is gonna be a challenge to make a 10 minute youtube video out of :)
---
&gt; Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter.
---
What about Namechanges tho?
---
I agree everyone should wait so I can get ahead.
---
Hey. Don't blow up the plan you snitch.
---
You forgot w.

Alternatively, get a gaming keypad like the Tartarus V2 so you can bind all movement keys to a pad so your thumb isn't only left for using jump on a keyboard. Thumb can handle 4 directions since you can only use 2 adjacent directions at any one time in-game. Now you've got 4 fingers to address some 20+ keys
---
I've always mained the same nelf rogue and I feel compelled to keep doing that. I will be rolling a druid on the side since I'd rather raid with one, but the rogue still feels more important to me.
---
There is this [subreddit](reddit.com/r/classicwow) that has a [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) that might prove useful.
---
Nope! I played a mage world pvp for my entire vanilla experience. Now, I am going to pick up the gauntlet I left in all other games, and bc to modern, where I was s healer, and go back to my main goal, healing!
---
I've healed for over 15 years and I love it so much I spent the last year calculating who I wanted to play and what was the most potent healer at max skill. So, i'm going druid. I did the math, and man, im so excited. There is so much that people don't know about healing and I can't help but get excited. I am ready, prepaired, and I want to heal like never before.
---
Wooooo 10 months of math

Doesnt matter what 1 person thinks as much does the community as a whole and if that player is okay with being labeled as a ninja loot or an idiot or both by many players on the server. If i heard that a pally ninjad that for his offspec and i happen to join a 5 man group for something and see that hes also in the group im 100% leaving the group as im not interested in running with someone that would hit need for ridiculous stuff like that. When you go into a group with someone you dont go over what everyone plans on rolling and even if you did and someone planned on rolling something for their offspec they may not even tell you because they dont want anyone leaving. You dont go into a strat ud to lose baron cape to the holy pally that didnt say he was planning on rolling on it. If youre the holy pally its on you to let the group know youre planning on rolling on it. Because thats not expected. If you think thats its still on the fault of the dps or warrior and not on the pally then sorry to say, but that will not go by without people thinking youre a ninja for needing on that as a healer. Thats just how it is. That pally will bring down a bad reputation for his guild and himself. If that pally tried starting a zg pug he would find it harder to do so. Its not uncommon for players on the server to label entire guilds with bad characteristics based based off of few dickheaded moves like that. Theres common sense for someone to let others know when a group is formed that they plan on rolling on an ironfoe for their non raid viable offspec, its really just that simple. If you disagree with that then at what point do you draw the line? Is it justified for a warrior to roll on the healing chestpiece off of baron in strat ud because they like how it looks for roleplaying? Is that also the fault on the healer for not asking an all rogue/warrior dps/tank group if anyone plans on rolling on healing gear?
---
Yupp, one of the big things holding them back
---
I chose warrior because at a glance, it seemed to be the least complicated option out of all the class choices. I also played Barbarian religiously in Diablo 2, so that also influenced the decision.
---
No, my issues were not knowledge, but rather being an insufferable prick and over memeing.
---
I dreamed I woke up, turned pc on as usual and they finally gave us the release date.... I think tips out was also there but I cant remember exactly
---
I'm pretty sure, like most games, it will say something about how the rating is subject to change with online play.
---
That is part of the release experience for me. I don't don't want to miss that. Might sound strange but the feeling waiting fo your turn in the queue to get in or just trying to log in again and again is exciting!
---
Is it though?
---
&gt; They are all your main spec. 
---
Yeah, no.
---
So as a Druid you'd expect to get DFT over a warrior or rogue?  Or Tear off nef over a warlock?
---
Always faithful, Glory to the Alliance.
---
I feel the same way but I'm guessing there are a lot of people not familiar with that experience. Imagine you take vacation thinking you will play 12 hours a day and you end up in queue for 6 hours due to server crashes.
---
That’s literally the dumbest fucking thing I’ve heard today. Congrats on winning that prize with 10 minutes left in the day
---
So why are you on this sub?
---
Still going to be a pain in pug raids, so I don't know why y'all are celebrating. Pretty much everyone pugs here and there, even if you're in a guild (Ony / ZG / AQ20 on your own time). Makes me think most of you bnet forums / reddit guys don't raid. Guess the standard is going to be +1 or soft res.
---
I wouldn't put it in the same category as ninja looting but I would still consider it kind of shitty to roll on off-spec gear in regards to your group role without saying anything.
---
It is everyone's equal responsibility to notify the other members which items they want to roll on and make sure the group is on the same page.
---
owls have way better dmg though. they have a 7% dmg modifier while birds have 0%. they do have 5% armor on the plus side.
---
I was a warlock and I loved it. I was pretty sick but this time I want to be melee. I will start with a warrior, since my premade will be a priest we will be able to choose our dds for Dungeons and I like to think how sick PvP will get with a pocket healer dispelling me 24/7. GTFO FROSTMAGES!!!
---
it's funny how everyone is excited for classic but appearantly not ready to run an instance multiple times until you win your desired item.
---
&gt; The rep you get from quests doesnt change due to level  
---
Yes it does.
---
Yea for some people that might be horrible experience. I have been waiting this for over ten years so those 6 hours would be awesome for me! Seeing the actual number &amp; time when i could log in will be epic!
---
If you can heal or dps or tank perfectly fine without respeccing then they are all your main spec. 
---
I'm open to being convinced otherwise though so please go ahead.
---
It's not an offspec though. It may not be the role they are currently performing but if you're a hybrid spec that can do multiple roles they're all your main spec.
---
All of the memorable expansion launches were memorable because they were total disasters!
---
I remember MOP being completely unplayable as alliance because only one person could get credit for shooting a ship every 10 seconds and there were literally thousands of us lagging out on top of each other
---
In WOD day one everyone had to share a single phase of the garrison if you could even get to the point of having a garrison. Good times. 
---
I was weirdly disappointed to see legion and bfa launch in a playable state lols
---
I see you’ve discovered the same black hole as me.
---
That's a frightening enough thought on its own. I actually won't be getting it if they include micro transactions, despite eagerly waiting for it.
---
If you're a hybrid spec then items for any of your roles are your main spec...
---
OP seems to be asking if there is any evidence suggesting that pservers don't have weapon skill programmed correctly, making theorycrafting based on their builds incorrect in regards to Classic. This could affect the impact of human/orc racials and itemization for melee classes.
---
A legit concern as other aspects of pserver data are debatably incorrect as well.
---
I personally am curious, but also clueless on the subject.
---
Heh. Did you experience D3 release? It was THE WORST. That stupid error 37 or whatever it was.
---
What you seem to be trying to say is roll the the role you are currently performing. 
---
Spec and role are completely different though mostly related things.
---
I love how Blizzard knew and warned people about this error before release.
---
How do you not recognize the name of your god?
---
Oh retail if you focus on farming you can make 100g/min through many means (for example fishing).
---
Tokens in EU are 170k which 28 hours. However, this doesn’t factor in other sources of gold and playing the ah. Also some markets can make 300g/min possible - in EU leather recently went up to 25g each for a bit, combine that with bones etc and you could make 500g/min. That means it would only take 6 hours to get a month of game time.
---
Personally I just play the AH, I craft goods that cost a fraction of their sales price and pull in around 10k/day in about 15m of log in time. Comfortably covers my sub so I also have like £20 in my battlenet balance - id recommend buying WoW tokens now btw, the market has been slowly trending up for a while so sitting of lots of gold isn’t a good idea imo.
---
If the once in a blue moon GM interaction is really gonna be the hill you die on, then you really need to re-evaluate your priorities imo. It isn't that big of a deal.
---
48 to 52 its way faster to grind then quest, with how much traveling needs to be done in those levels.
---
The only properly active druid we had during early mc/ony raiding phase. Every single whatever caster leather piece going to one single person every raid.
---
I 100% disagree with that. That is not a privilege that all hybrids should feel entitled to. Seems greedy to me when typically you will be raiding as one designated role.
---
I'd be damned if a Resto druid came in to heal a dungeon with me and just up and rolled on a tanking ring/trinket without discussing beforehand.
---
You seriously think that 12mp5 will make shadow priest not go oom? Do you even play WoW?
---
Then don't join a pug raid with need/greed. Make sure the raid leader is reputable or in a reputable guild and have them master loot while everyone rolls. Of course people can inspect them to make sure they actually need it. 
---
Yes they could swap gear to make it look like they need it, but I feel like someone going through all of that trouble is not going to happen more than once in a blue moon. And there is always an option to join a guild and avoid pug raids altogether.
---
its a quintessential part of vanilla. and they said they want classic to feel like vanilla. so...
---
I calculated some things just to see what I'm up against. If I remember correctly, it took the average (or slightly above average) player 5-7 days played time to hit 60. Given that I'm not 13 anymore I can't play 10 hours a day. I work from 8-4. The most I could play per day is 4-5 hours. If I average 5 hours a day including weekends, it would take me 28-33 days to ding 60 if everything is paced correctly. For those with jobs, we're in for a grind people..
---
I’d assume they won’t allow trial accounts (partly due to the data mining that suggests so), mainly because I think it’s not necessary and doesn’t cater to anyone. If you want to play classic you don’t need to “taste” what it’s like to do so. You are likely either a previous classic player or played retail/past expansions so you know roughly what you’re signing up for.
---
&gt;they're all your main spec.
---
No, your main spec is your main spec.  If you are playing a role you don't usually play, that's great, thanks for being accommodating, but there's zero reason not to say "hey I'm happy to heal but I'm trying to get that +str item" or whatever.
---
That's sort of the implied rule.  No one is going to assume that you're going to need on anything that you can equip but if you give people a heads up before the run starts, everyone gets to make an informed decision; you're not "at the final boss being told you can't have loot" and no one will think you're a dick.  Zero effort and everyone is better off.
---
I think me and you have very different ideas of what quintessential means.
---
This isn't a joke. I clearly remember how long the last two levels were lol. 10 hours is considered quick from 58-60 imo.
---
The context of this sub-thread is loot. You can only have one 'loot main spec' per dungeon. At least, that is the norm in most groups.
---
real-sounding dilemma tbh
---
So you mean loot role? Because spec and role are different things. 
---
If you've never played a hybrid maybe you don't understand the difference but you can learn something new every day.
---
I know one guild had both bindings drop in a single MC.
---
Other than that, I once saw 5/8 T1 pieces go to a paladin in a single MC.
---
..And my AXE!
---
Have you never played a hybrid spec? My spec is hybrid. The gear I wear depends on the role I expect to play in the group but I keep up to 3 sets on me in case I need to switch roles. 
---
Are you perhaps trying to say you should only roll on gear for the role you are currently performing? Because that's completely different from what spec you are.
---
If thats quintessential, have you already dug up your pc from 2004, quit your job and signed up to a high school/uni, moved back in with your mom etc? Because these things affect your everyday gameplay unlike the GM interactions you might never have to have
---
Are you're sure that isn't just on private servers?
---
I sure hope I never get grouped with a bunch of players who collude with each other, ensuring they get the item they want regardless of how low they roll.
---
I'm not talking about resto druids. I'm talking about hybrid specs that allow you to effectively perform multiple roles with just a change of gear.
---
When people enter a dungeon, they usually announce "healer main spec" or something like that if they prefer to roll for that stuff.
---
If you've never played vanilla maybe you don't understand the difference but you can learn something new every day.
---
I assume based on that statement that name changes may not be in the game? Not quite sure, but if name changes were possible it would definitely destroy a lot of the social aspects of the game.
---
From my experience, we had a guy on our server that ninja looted chromatic carapace and he was forever known as the guy who stole it. Reputations like that are part of what make classic so cool. If you want to make a bad decision like stealing, go for it. However, you have to be willing to accept the infamy that comes with doing it.
---
none of your examples have anything to do with the game. are you high or just a troll? i can forgive the former.
---
If I was a guild leader I would have booted you instead.
---
Yes, I have.
---
&gt;Are you perhaps trying to say you should only roll on gear for the role you are currently performing?
---
Did you perhaps read my comment?  I said that typically, if you want to roll on gear for a role other than the one you're playing, it's polite to say so ahead of time.  If someone would rather find a group with fewer people to compete with for loot, this gives them the chance to do so.  Do you not realize why that is a good thing that is super easy to do?
---
Black holes really can be used for time travel!
---
You said a role you don't usually play. When I'm playing a hybrid spec I usually play all roles. 
---
Now if you had said the role you are currently playing that's a different argument.
---
Well said.
---
My first character back in 2004 was a rogue. Rerolled a priest which I raided with. 6 months before TBC I rolled a hunter. Did all raids except naxx. Few years ago I played a mage throughout entire end game content. This time around I am thinking to roll a shammy...
---
If i roll a mage, I will get tailoring first then drop it for either pvp (engineering) or cash (alchemy )
---
Well put.
---
Sounds like Soulkeeper, a staff with a lot of Spirit and some Int. Not a bad choice if you were affliction with improved drain soul, but obviously the Harvester wouldve been a better pick.
---
Tried that on private servers. Didn't really enjoy alliance side at all 😔
---
And add to that the servers being packed to capacity 24-hours a day for the first few days to a week is exhilarating at the launch of any online game.   
---
I can understand that some people, including myself, have a very limited time frame for stuff like gaming, but regardless if it goes well or goes badly launch day is an experience in itself.
---
I will be reserving Ironfoe and use ML for Emperor on the runs that I host and tank.
---
It's % chance on melee hit. Not just weapon hit. So it is supposed to.  The same goes for DMC:Maelstrom or heart of Wyrmthalak and the +weapon damage from Might of Cenarius (godly for kitties).
---
And this is a perfect example of someone who is going to have a bad time.
---
Priest is one of the few classes with no downtime. Super fun and super fast class to lvl. One of the strongest in 1v1 endgame as well.
---
Didnt spellstone go in the wand slot? Or is it offhand in vanilla?
---
We are prepared!
---
I played actual vanilla and never saw anyone do that.  Though they may have said something like I'm only here for x item. 
---
I've also been playing on a private server the last month or two trying to figure out when I'll play in classic and I have seen anyone do that yet.
---
From what I can gather private server players don't seem to understand the difference between role and spec and that some classes have hybrid specs that can perform multiple roles without respeccing just by changing gear. 
---
You'd think after 10 plus years people would know the difference but it's not my fault if they are a bit slow.
---
Glad you replied, I'd forgotten how embarrassing your post was.
---
It seems that people will likely end up thinking you're a twat irrespective of how you roll, so I guess there's not much sense pursuing this interaction any further.
---
There is no such evidence to my knowledge, but that of course does't mean that we are for 100% right :)
---
If blizzard goes down the path of more “vanilla” content after naxx I’d like to see some updates to classes but not before then. 
---
As for taunt to paladins/shamans id like to see changes that make them better at their niches and the ability to taunt just makes them more like warriors. In my mind paladins are the aoe tanks and warriors are the single target tanks but because warriors actually have gear tailored for tanking and scale so well with gear they become miles better at both. 
---
Off the top of my head, a way to make paladins better at aoe tanking while not encroaching on warriors turf would be to add talents or gear than returns mana when getting hit and also reduce damage taken by a flat amount. That would make almost no difference when it comes to tanking a big bad raid boss as they would hardly benefit at all from getting hit, but when tanking 20 adds they would be swimming in mana and would be taking less damage than a warrior would as their kit is made for mitigating slow big hits not lots of small ones. 
---
Idk shit about shamans tho lol
---
Still, a hybrid class' capability of performing above average in any given spec with different kinds of gear is not what we're discussing. We're discussing if people should roll on gear for multiple specs inside one dungeon run.
---
It's not classic but its still a something good.
---
Druids in BWL. we have 0-2 per raid, sometimes we disenchant gear. But fastest a class can get bis pre raid gear are warlocks in BWL patch. Just get all greens from AH and you are donezo
---
That was potent
---
Basically just trolls but no where near as awesome
---
Blizzard, you think you don't, but you do
---
They are bringing back Vanilla. That weather was part of Vanilla. It has been talked about alongside all the other stuff they know about. If it's not in the game on release, it's a bug and they should fix it.
---
The program Autohotkey has features that allow you to turn off key functions if a specific program is running.
---
I use caps lock for a number of things in path of exile, and the program disables the key's function while PoE is running. Very useful.
---
I played a Tauren Shaman in Vanilla. I never liked my Tauren through Vanilla and was always jealous of my friend playing an Orc Shaman. Tauren felt so slow and clunky compared to the more nimble Orc.
---
Fast forward to Classic, I have no idea. I'm really torn between these two races. I'm definitely going to play Enh Shaman, just like the old days, but I have no idea if I'm going to play Tauren or Orc. The nostalgia kid in me tells me that choosing another race will totally annihilate my experience. When I think about it I kind of liked my Tauren anyway. Orc on the other hand......yeah, I have no idea. ^(please help)
---
Mp5 is the most important stat for a shadow priest. If you have to down rank even once or any time at all wanding then all your +spell damage is wasted. This is because of the low spell coefficient on many of their spells.
---
Stack mp5 like a mad man and get spell damage where you can and you'll be fine.
---
That means a lot coming from a complete stranger who probably sat in his house all day and jerked off
---
Becasue you had to earn it, Getting your first mount even the level 40 one felt like reaching the top of the peak. You quest and profession whilst refusing the repair your gear even just to get that mount money and once you do you really appreciate it. 
---
Thats how it was back then anyway, Its not as bad now that we are not 14 and know good places to farm and to not waste our money on silly things so it wont be quite as bad.
---
Now that is actually funny
---
At least he has a phone.
---
Your reverse psychology wont work on me, see you in elwynn
---
It isn't. Every items with a chance on hit except weapon can proc in cat form.
---
I can help (´・ω・`)?
---
Oh god please no. "Hey just pay us £40 for the game, £10 a month sub, £2K on a new computer powerful enough to run it and just a lil 1 time fee of £300-400 for the VR headset. 
---
Who could refuse.
---
lol, the okay hand signal was not used by white supremacists. You ARE naive and fell for the 4chan troll op.
---
Hand of Justice and Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom  is almost as good.
---
Then you can get upgrades from bwl aq naxx  or silithus badges.
---
Meanwhile, you won't get anything as good as mark of tyranny in any raid. No items even come close.
---
This is true to a certain extent. Your post completely ignores the elephant in the room which is the fact that Hearthstone was so immensely successful profitable BECAUSE of WoW’s foundational work. You can’t just compare the net profit on both games and draw a conclusion. Not a meaningful one.
---
Or quit your job like me!
---
That was my understanding too. Works out to like 120ish AP for a warrior or 110 for a rogue. It’s a good boost, but no where near as big as weapon skill passives are
---
No lol.  Firstly if you were on the circuit you can't be sure it wasn't the respawn timer going off because you weren't covering all the nodes.
---
Isnt the whole point of taking vacation to be able to start as early and possible and push for as much to get ahead of people?
---
What's inside?
---
Wonderful
---
Depends if you mind 1+ hour queues and possible server crashes that reset the queu.
---
I'm glad *you* replied - the post was extremely low effort, took me literally 5 seconds to think of and 20 seconds to write down, and yet it seemed to have had an enormous return.
---
Let the salt flow, brother. 
---
Go with Christ.
---
Time for the #no\_changes group to trigger ;)
---
Jokes aside the biggest bane for these classes comes from itemization. Little choices for survivability (specially shaman), reliance on mana (which most survivability options don't have at all, making them prone to go oom) and well, hybrids' bane: too much stats to focus on.  Spell hit, +spell damage, int, mp5 have to get balanced with the typical (warrior) tank stats.  If we also add some not-so-well designed stuff (redoubt only when being critted, RF +threat only on holy damage, stoneclaw totem's threat distinct from shaman's, lack of taunt on both...).
---
It wouldn't change too much. Too much changes need to be made.
---
Fastest? I don't know if I can get that title, but in the first rotation of BWL / MC on my alliance rogue ( who joined the guild in late 2005) I got 4/8 Nightslayer, Perditions Blade and then 3/8 Bloodfang in two Nights. In the same guild the RL Hunter alt got 7/8 T1 and Leaf in a single MC run.
---
Priest is no challenge to level, in fact it is one of the easiest
---
This post will single-handedly be responsible for 0 players logging in at launch.
---
Tauren druid again. With hunter and lock alts. And probably a second druid. And maybe a third.
---
I figure I may have to roll a shaman at some stage if I actually take the leap and create my guild, but I played one to about 20 on a pserver and wasn't super-inspired. Found totems a bit irritating.
---
Orc
---
mana oil dont stack with weapon enchant or i am wrong?
---
Shaman could never cut it. Paladin would become situationally good enough thanks to access to plate gear.
---

---
You might be slightly gimped as a healer in phase 2 before BGs hit, because there are few ways to kill people by yourself. I'd imagine your best bet in that phase in particular is to find a good Warrior who has a similar play schedule as you.
---
All I'm saying is that you can definitely skip multiple end-game zones because there are plenty of quests to go around.
---
Why is this comment getting upvoted. Lol wtf hex of weakness is insane and you should feel bad for downplaying it.
---
That's a bit harsh to call it minimal overhead. Having a trained employee just sit around moving items because players messed was a bit of a big ask. I'm sure they're trying to keep the overhead low, but calling it minimal is a bit much - especially if they do end up taking out sharding as that means they need to monitor the servers alot more on their end which increases their overhead a bit.
---
They were added with the ZG patch. Why would they be added at launch this time around? Blizzard has proven to be pretty adamant about keeping it close to as no changes as possible.
---
Doing God’s work.
---
In BWL they woul be out of LoS where other classes weren't when tanking in certain corners around doorways.
---
I can't remember being a gnome ever being an advantage.
---
God damm those crits any rough idea of the build ?
---
Darkmoon Blue Dragon
---
haha that hunter hit the jackpot
---
what is this from?
---
My guess is that it'll be in the drop down menu where you select between the retail client and PTR client/between accounts.
---
That's how they get you! Next thing you know you will be forced to respec holy and heal your entire guild!
---
If I'm playing warrior and ironfoe drops and a rogue needs on it I'm gonna lose my shit and so should you. 
---
In vanilla not every class is made equal. Sometimes you gotta give the good items to the classes that will use them best especially if it's people in your guild.
---
But going beyond that even if they're not in your guild if you want to make friends on your server passing that ironfoe to your rival guilds maintank should put you on pretty good terms. Unlike retail the people you meet in dungeons will actually be from your server so there's incentive to actually pass.
---
Dont take vacation days cause its fucking stupid to take for the release of a game. You can play it later.
---
If the release is during my normal vacation, perfect, but no one should (and I hope they dont) take out extra days for a game
---
&gt; If you spec right you can get deterrence and scatter shot which will give you good CC options. 
---
I think the prefered PVP spec is intimidation + scatter shot.
---
Itemization really is the biggest issue not the taunt. If druids had access to pieces with +armour/defense/dodge on all slots they would be so close to warriors that every guild would use them. Shamans would need a complete change though and paladins would need a way to reach uncrushability which is hard with all the stats that they need.
---
Rogue. Not going to play that class as a main. Just because I discovered my love for healing.
---
Will be awesome to see the actual fights and not boss asses all the time.
---
Still think rogue is the best DD class in classic. 
---
Might twink my orc rogue though.
---
My twink was a druid, which is what I'm going to main. I love this class. Everyone saying they can't heal encouraged me to see, what resto Druids are capable of in the hands of a very experienced player.
---
I'm very exited about playing this class.
---
I will be returning to be og class the Paladin. I suffered with my fellow paladins as the least liked or given favoritism class by blizzard for generations! (expansions)
---
Even in BC they decided bloodelf ret was the only paladins they would shine favor down upon. :(
---
If blizz releases a TBC classic I won't hold out and wait for parity with my human paladin like I did back in the day. I will just switch to belf. \*sigh\*
---
No I can handle running BRD 50 times for ironfoe I don't want to run it 100 times because some jackass ninja'd me.
---
Impossible, my main on modern was an unholy DK. The closest thing would be an affliction lock, I do like locks, but I never ended up really getting to know them well/play them a lot. The next closest thing Ive found to be more fun is shadow priests. Im decent with em, but its another class I never got super in depth with. When all is said and done ill have one of each class.
---
I agree with all of your points, it has nothing to do with being toxic or calling someone out, but someone spreading such a great video of stupidity and not being well informed and not qualified for a content like that has earned it to be ashamed! 
---
I like your video, although i‘m not a great meme fan 😜
---
potentially a waste time if the servers are unstable, go offline, or have massive queues and you didnt get in on time.  but yeh optimally you want to play asap and get ahead
---
I'm still going to take my vacation on release day. I assume the sharding system blizz refuses to remove will alleviate the overpopulation issue and once you break away from the pack everything should be fine. Even back in the day the servers would disconnect lower level people first if a server was full.
---
I think the key to leveling during the bum rush will be A experience (Plenty of that from og vanilla and other servers) and B not sleeping which I currently work nights and have ample practice not sleeping for 48 hours due to insomnia/work obligations.
---
Indeed. "Evidence to suggest" being the more powerful words for this definition.  
---
I didn't much expect to get very far with this post, and I am starting to conclude this is as far as I will get. Abandoning the idea for now.
---
Girl does 6% of the work, gets 100% of the credit.
---
At least in the wow classic demo I did not experience any weather effects and this is something I would like to see people demand......I mean ask that blizz puts the weather effects back in for wow classic.
---
Paladins would definitely benefit a lot from a taunt, but I still think warriors would be far superior. The biggest reason being that Paladins have a limited resource pool, whilst warriors can go on forever as long as they are healed.
---
I don't mind if idiots think I'm a twat though. Now if someone with a reasonable opinion thought I was a twat I might care.
---
Hi, underthingy!
---
I am dropping by to offer you a robot hug! I hope the rest of your day is fantastic!

---
Oh man, I hope that fucking guy doesn't start appearing in my dreams.
---
We had a kinda casual guildmember that tagged along for a MC run ones. We had it on farm and mostly did it for the bindings (sidenote our guild never got a single TF ever. I still feel bad for our MT to this day, he must have spent more time in MC then any other player I know)
---
Anyhow. He played warlock and I remember him getting a piece of gear from every single boss, he had quite the night.
---
Backup plan is reading my book stockpile and all of my steam games I have not yet gotten around to playing.  Pretty much set whether launch works or not.  Bigger question is whether I can take time off at all which depends on release date and when it is announced ...
---
I knew it would make it into this sub somehow
---
Depends on what you mean by geared up? From fresh 60 - pre-bis takes about a week or two. 
---
If you're a new recruit who joined late it's not uncommon for you to get absolutely decked out in your first raid. There are lots of crap epics that get DE'd each week that they will just toss at you. Don't get me wrong these aren't amazing items but you do get a fair bit of purples just thrown at you in vanilla.
---
How long does it take to get the good gear? This one is tricky. Those bis off-tier pieces are usually BIS for multiple classes. That means if you want them you're competing against a large amount of people in the guild. With how loot works you could go 8 months without ever seeing an item drop off a specific boss.
---
No, kidding. That's incredible.
---
Should Blizzard give flying turtle mounts with rocket launchers to all players?
---
Please ~~clap~~ stop.
---
I don't how even wow could possibly manage nine more expansions, They are talking about having the game still going in the 2030s assuming they continue the pace of 2 years per expansions.
---
Nobody's reputation gonna suffer if they roll and win an upgrade, no matter how small. It's not someone's problem if another player is very undergeared. I'm talking about pugs here, not guild runs.
---
Both? That must've been an ecstatic melee.
---
Does this loot trading thing mean that you can just auction off the gear you win for gold in the raid your within?
---
Don't worry, like 98% of the people who will be responsible for crashing the servers aren't even on this subreddit. You can't mindgame anyone and people WILL NOT wait. See you in Elwynn/Teldrassil, mate.
---
Nice bait, mate!
---
Even if I knew for certain that I wouldn't be able to log in during the launch day, I'd still start my vacation then. For me, it's not necessarily all about getting ahead of the zerg, but rather the mass hysteria and hype of people smashing that login button, servers crashing and everyone trying to log in while blowing up the forums.. I really enjoy that chaos.
---
Hi, /u/Enviate
---
&gt;If blizzard goes down the path of more “vanilla” content after naxx I’d like to see some updates to classes but not before then. 
---
By then the only players left will be the ones who don't care about the shit class design
---
What's the most coveted BiS piece for multiple classes?
---
I always use capslock as a keybind without removing its function. It just requires some time to get used to it. Just remember to press capslock after you hit enter to activate the chat window.
---
That won't be possible.
---
Uh, if you say so.
---
Mad men. A great show I've watched through completely twice. Give it a shot, you might really enjoy it.
---
The resistance from motw doesn’t stack with the resistance auras/totem from memory
---
Yeah, well, that's a learning experience. Time to reroll on another server.
---
They do give less rep. If you plan on leveling in a different starting zone, don't roll a class that isn't available for the other race. For example, you're not going to find a Warlock trainer anywhere near Teldrassil.
---
I don’t disagree with your point, but dps rotations are super simple in vanilla. I’d love a warlock addon that tells me to press shadowbolt every 3 seconds haha
---
You can climb out of Dun Morogh just north of Gnomeregan and fall to your death on the other side of the mountains and respawn at Menethil Harbour. It’s really quick. Check out this video towards the end: https://youtu.be/Zuw9DcsCQMY
---
Oh and register at http://barrens.chat and join in the fun.
---
+5 Swordc skill for that Thunderfury bruh
---
Depends on the patch you're playing and your raid comp.
---
My guild had 10 casters in total (5 mage 3 lock 2 other) each nefarian kill it would take like 5 mins to do loot bc people would fight over the staff of shadowflame among other items. The last boss in the instance drops gear that is slightly higher itemlevel than the rest of the raid.

Also lines committed in GitHub != amount of meaningful contribution
---
this isn't 2000 anymore or private servers run by a single person. with today's tech additional servers can be spun up or taken down with zero hassle. i'm sure blizzard already learned in the past what launch day means in terms of how hard the servers get hit and overpopulation in starting zones which is why there'll be phasing at start.
---
Here I'm sitting and seriously considering playing a vanilla server for a while just to lower my through-the-roof-hype.
---
AV!!
---
I had a dream that I was leveling an orc hunter and got ganked by a mage and rogue. When I woke up I had such vivid feelings of annoyance that I wasn't able to get them, but also determination to not let it happen again. I've been torn over leveling a hunter or shaman for months. Guess this solved it, I'm going to roll a hunter and try to avoid the situation in the dream!
---
My thoughts exactly.  A bit too harsh for a non-douchey opinion.  D:
---
My friend joined our guilds MC run because we were short a couple people. No other warriors needed their might set. He walked in with greens and blues and walked out with nearly a full set of Tier 1
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1172 shows all set pieces on any race/class combo
---
I don't remember ever having a meaningful interaction with a GM...
---
Found the druid that is going to take /u/RazzleDazzleRoo 's BiS items.
---
"Multiple times" you realize it could easily take 300-500 runs to see one ironfoe for some people with bad rng right? Its a 1 out of 167 runs to see one drop. So statistically 2-3 drops in about 300-500 runs but thats just statistics. It could drop the first run sure but on your 500th run you might just get ninjad. Of course, thats why these items get masterlooted and reserved so often. Why risk such a massive time sink. People want to play classic, not waste time on their efforts. Effort for the amount of time put in to get a reward, not putting in large amounts of time only for pure annoyance of being ninjad from your hard work.
---
I wonder how many people’s “what class are you going to play” is influenced by the fact that we know how the characters will flesh out as progression continues. Like will we see less hunters and more warlocks because of aq40 and naxx?
---
I found it a real grind through lower levels...must of been doing something wrong haha
---
Invite the whole party to a discord server you can make for just that dungeon and explain him why that axe isnt for him.
---
I don't think true PuG raids will be much of a thing in vanilla. Over time after too many collusion stories, people will just stop joining them. There's always gonna be a few suckers willing to join but experienced players will only raid with people they know. Possibly guilds with good reputation will have their own channel\discord for semi-pugs with trusted players.  I certainly wouldn't join a 100% pug where no one knows anyone, there will be collusion.
---
I'm planning on doing this and it's gonna be a bitch..
---
I did that the whole day yesterday. No regrets.
---
Activision Blizzard is too busy firing people from their lively hoods and bumming their millions worth bonuses to give a shit about actually putting a release date on a product that is due out in a couple months or so.
---
You thought you were the only human warlock......... right........................
---
Their kit and itemization is not fully developed, to actually make them viable tanks you would need to change the game around a lot. And for what? Having an extra viable tank doesn't really change the game in any good way other than making bosses harder to balance and giving those few players their snowflake spec meaning.
---
I am not saying change your mind, but I do wish you would reconsider. The likely scenario is that in each dungeon you will have 1-2 bosses that drop a BiS item for you. What about the other 5 bosses? They drop BiS for someone else. Now if you form a group smartly, you will agree to all have a good chance of getting something. If you just roll need on the first boss and take a BiS of somebody else, you are likely to get your BiS pieces rolled on as well. It hurts everybody in my opinion, and I, as a tank, will not invite people who do what you describe. The point of running dungeons on 60 is farming PreRaid BiS, not hetting marginal upgrades that you will replace with PreRaid BiS.
---
For lower level dungeons, sure, Need on stuff you Need, I am fine with that.
---
Human racials are considered pretty damn good afaik.
---
I've always mained feral since vanilla...I tried a few times to main something different but in the end it's always feral. That being said I'm contemplating going lock or mage and constantly going back and forth on these for various reasons
---
I recently started back on a private server. Only 2 things im not looking forward to. Hostiles hitting you even out of range, resisting 2-3 spells in a row, daze-slow-knockdown to daze again.  But i was pretty happy about hopping a fence forcing them to run all the way around
---
Now you're just splitting hairs and being pedantic.
---
I dont mind queues, it's proof that you're playing on a server with a good population.
---
As far as I know, there is no WoW 2 project in development.
---
Can someone please explain why there is a race to the finish? 
---
Other than patting yourself on the back and it being a nice achievement what other benefits are there being the 1% in 50-60 leveling zones ?
---
Tbh OSRS slowly lost all the oldschool of it by constantly releasing new content. For classic I'd much rather we stay "nostalgic" and do vanilla then continuing with other expansions until people don't want to anymore.
---
as a Paladin main NO
---
i would be alright with some sort of item that had a similar effect though but that's a topic for after phase 6
---
We go where we want vermin
---
I'm so tempted to roll a human paladin again but I'm not. I've done it once so I'm doing something different this time!
---
I mained a human ret paladin in vanilla but I’m strongly considering maining a dwarf priest in classic. I’m still deciding. I might not ultimately decide until right before release.
---
Have an upvote
---
On paper, yes. However, the social environment of raids in Classic isn't really conducive to that kind of thing anyway. I'd expect master looter to be on in most cases, meaning that anyone requesting or rolling for gear is subject to scrutiny, and there's no personal loot that'd skip that process.
---
16 is good
---
Because it's fun to zoom zoom zoom.
---
No.
---
Hah, yeah I'm sure. Birds of a feather, as some say.
---
Found the NEET.
---
Yeah, I think you're right.
---
Already doing it lmao
---
Played a fresh private server recently and vanilla 
---
It's not bad
---
If you can't kill 3 people that are locking down an area then go level an alt or find your own factions rankers to come out.
---
If I hear of a badass 3 man crew wrecking shop, I get excited to face the challenge. 
---
It just really sounds like everyone nowadays can't handle that the skill gap has increased. Every game has try hards, roll PVE and your problem is solved
---
Your entire faction can't kill 6 people....
---
Jesus fuck you're bad
---
I goes a bit deeper that just giving shaman a taunt, as someone else in the comments said there is very little high tier +defence mail gear, itemizing your shaman tank would be very hard with the gear thats available to you. 
---
Also their ability kit doesn't provide them with any 'oh shit' abilities or active mitigation, you are pretty much just relying on your block and self healing. 
---
I think a better theoretical argument would be if paladins got taunt then shamans could get bloodlust. But as you said no changes :)
---
Honestly, if you want to contribute to your team the best you can I'd go holy until rank 13/14 and then respec to go ret paladin until the end of your days. I am not saying this as a dick because I know ret is fun but helping your squad the most you can not only helps you but your friends too.
---
I did the rank grind as a druid resto flag carrier. Finished ranking and helped my friends ranked while then having fun with feral in PvP. Running the flag is as boring as you can imagine but its the role that helped my premade the most.
---
[OP in his Youtube comment section right now.](https://imgur.com/OoWxfFw)
---
I've flip-flopped between 3 options now and every time gone "yep, that's definitely the right one".
---
My advice is don't plan until close to release.
---
I don't get it. A statue is helping you choose your class in a video game?
---
Yikes.
---
Its not the same anymore. No yellow wall, no shirts with holes in it, no how to min/max your OJ intake, no Papparian etc... 
---
Dude has become so casual im now more hardcore... At least he i happy peepoSad
---
There are several packs of x5 Hyenas scattered around Desolace. They all have very low health BUT give the same XP/Loot than normal mobs. I was basically running between various respawn spots, but I confess it must have been possible mostly because I was a Druid with Travel Form, most other classes would not be able to do that. I was personally killing Bonepaw Hyenas ( [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4688](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4688) ) just running back and forth their closest respawn zone.
---
For the most part I was dead set going for a female human rogue to start.
---
However over time I started to think about the utility of a warlock and its ability to solo (I'll be duo and solo sometimes trio during the 1-60 with my mum and gf) 
---
I was then set for a while that I'll get a 60 warlock first and then work on a rogue
---
Today I'm so confused on what I actually want since rogues are so much fun I need some assistance choosing.
---
What would be a better level 60 to funnel money over to the level 1 out of rogue and warlock.
---
If it were you with only these two choices what would it be?
---
If there is an even better class you'd choose that you believe has more solo ability or fun please suggest it 
---
Anything but a hunter ( I don't like that class and my mum has already taken that slot )
---
I eemember that Kungen’s earliest friends in vanilla said he geared up fast as hell, getting full t0 before anyone had ever seen more than a piece or two here or there. Though that might’ve been an exaggeration. But I mean it was vanilla &amp; 95% of people were new to mmos so I guess it wouldn’t be too unlikely.
---
Last weekend i play a lot lots of fun in hillsbrad and sfk, but i m afraid to burn out
---
PVE server then lmao.
---
If you quit because you're being camped then you probably shouldn't have picked a player vs player realm.....
---
Did you really play vanilla? Because honor system or not ganking occurs
---
Lold
---
It is if the PVE server is full but you only have 5% of the population to raid with.
---
Think about class first then maybe your race options will help.
---
I want to play a druid, but fuck gayass night elf males and I'm just not the type to run around in game pretending to be a woman. So Tauren it is!
---
For the Horde!
---
It was a good minute before they patched it in TBC.
---
Shamans were probably the worst class in TBC, but they were still fun

There was a detailed comment on UD vs Troll shadow priests made by a SPriest video maker from RetroWoW, Fleyz. I think he broke it down very well, so I'll just copy paste it here (again, third time on reddit this week I believe :p ) :
---
Quote :" ***I originally created the UD after I had finished everything on that, I decided to make a troll purely to mix it up. I now almost entirely play the troll and the UD is left offline.***
---
**Reasons:**
---
**1) WOTF vs Berserking** \- WOTF is only useful vs A) Classes which fear (Priests / Warriors / Warlocks) B) Those classes need to land a fear - I play an extremely cowardly play-style, very rarely getting feared. C) You can use Berserking vs EVERY CLASS. D) Berserking Mind blast is one of the hardest spells in the game to interrupt E) Berserking Mana Burn is the fastest stationary mana drain in vanilla F) Berserking Mind control is Savage.
---
**2) Hex of Weakness** is a 30 yd range curse which reduces healing by 20% for 2 mins. It also reduces the physical damage done by the target by a minor amount. My tactic with Hex is that I'm purely using it for the healing de-buff. Which means I can use Rank 1 Hex. Rank 1 Hex costs 35 mana and has NO COOL DOWN. It can only be dispelled by Mages and Druids. I've racked up some serious playtime with my priest and I can count on one hand the amount of time my curse has been dispelled. I use max rank Hex on melee who are training myself or someone on my team who is decent (for a bit more mitigation) Hex also affects POTS, Healthstones, Death coils and Whipper Root Tubers. On Retro-wow the food which everyone uses form the vendor restores 5% of you HP every second. This food counts as a "heal" so the Hex can further slow their regeneration.
---
**3) Shadowguard vs Touch of Weakness** \- Shadowguard is similar to touch of weakness except, it doesn't apply a curse debuff to the attacker reducing their melee damage (BAD) and cannot crit (Which isn't always bad as it will not proc enrage on warriors training you). However Shadowguard hurts melee and ranged attacks and can proc blackout and shadow weaving, has a low mana cost and gets an absurd % of spell damage and has a stack of 3. Meaning you need to re-apply it less (Touch of Weakness has 1 charge).
---
**4) Undead is still strong**, don't get me wrong. Undead can even be stronger than Troll in certain situations. You can't use Devouring plague in 100% of fights though and one simple cleanse from a paladin really does hard counter DP. Also Dwarves who have any idea know they can stoneform out of it. "
---
is it a plausible idea to get tailoring/engineering on my main and use an alt to farm mining?
---
Hello everyone, Rogue mechanics question from me:  
---
Bleeding is a "physical" type of damage, right? Is it affected by target's armor then?  
---
If yes, is it (garrote, rupture) affected by abilities like Expose Armor, Serrated Blades, Hemorrage?  
---
Or are there any at all damage modifying factors for bleeding?
---
Also does anyone know if were getting original night time? Loved how dark it used to get.
---
Out of interest what were those 3 options?
---
If you mean farm mining to level engineering I wouldn't bother. Engineering is the cheapest profession to skill up, unless if you have some sort of plans to farm arcane crystals or dark iron on your alt, then it's not worth leveling mining just for the mats.
---
Bleeds ignore armor.
---
won't I need a constant supply of mats to craft grenades and such on a daily basis though?
---
Get ahead and gank lowbies in STV?
---
No I'm not. If you want people to understand you, you need to use language that is understandable. 
---
I pretty much played hybrids throughout vanilla and TBC, when I started on a private server in the last couple of months I've mostly been a hybrid. 
---
This whole MS &gt; OS crap didn't exist in actual vanilla so when I came back first I had no idea what it meant. And when told it means main spec before off spec that doesn't even explain that it actually means only roll on items that match the role you are currently performing. 
---
I like to play hybrid classes as a hybrid spec that lets me perform multiple roles just by changing gear.  So all the roles I can perform are my main spec. 
---
Saying I can only roll on things for my main spec then calling me a ninja for doing so because you actually meant something else your problem for communicating poorly.
---
It's not bad.  You might have to buy some mats to get to the next type of cloth sometimes. 
---
But yeah,  not hard
---
I'm hoping to be full T1 on my Warrior main four weeks after launch. I don't see why it's not possible if I play every day.
---
Much appreciated. Thanks!
---
A huge chunk of prot for reck, holy for str and cast clearance, rest in ret. You don't need veng as much as people think you do.
---
Well for grenades people use iron grenade as they are cheap and people mostly just use greandes for the CC. Iron grenades requires iron and heavy stone, it's not really worth farming these instead of just making a bit of gold and then buying the mats off AH. It's really about efficiency why do a method that saves you 20g per hour, when you can farm 40-50 gold per hour and just buy it.
---
I mish the shitty cam quality and the blank wall :(
---
We don't really know how blizzard will do the mount system because it was changed in 1.12. It's fair to assume that they will use the 1.12 system, in which the riding skill is expensive and the mounts fairly cheap. If that's the case, then R11 mounts does NOT require epic riding, they only require the 60% riding, so you can save yourself 800g by getting r11, not really recommended though because ranking without an epic mount is horrendous.
---
I understand, thanks a lot!
---
there still is the possibility that it won't be easy to get mats from the auction house on a fresh server, so I guess we will have to see how it goes.
---
Worst case scenario I can always drop tailoring after I crafted the chest bis.
---
UBRS was only 10 and 15 man in vanilla. They will probably use the 1.12 version of dungeon caps, meaning UBRS is 10man. It was never possible to do UBRS with 5man, only LBRS(which you can also 10man if you want a fast clear).
---
No. But I'm sure when the business side of Blizzard decided to make classic, they did take into consideration the potential spillover of old WoW players from classic into retail, especially since the subscription will be shared.
---
&gt;Messing up your rotation
---
What rotation?
---
111111?
---
12121212?
---
Very reassuring to hear. It's good to see the classic team putting their foot down!
---
You can do the best gold per hour methods by yourself without contest, if you are first 300 herbalism imagine farming all 4 black lotus on the 1 hour or whatever respawn it will be.
---
That is if you can move that fast around the zones, I think a mage with epic mount can with silithus HS might be able to.
---
Thanks for your insight. I will certainly keep holy build on the table.
---
Thought it was out... Nearly had a heart attack...
---
Lets just jump right into it
---
Lol?
---
Late in vanilla the cheap armors in AH are better than pre-raid BiS during early phases.
---
People also take a not 100% min/maxed BiS carrying guy to an easy 20man to gear up.
---
I'm already better geared than anyone during MC release and it took me a week to get this far.
---
DM trinket, level 50 quest reward, abyssal BoE gear are all stronger than my tier 1 set (druid)
---
It's called humour, chief.
---
Hope I don't end up on your server or in your guild lol.
---
While possible, it relies on some pretty solid luck. Assuming you can run MC 2-3 times, within 4 weeks of launch (which I am not even sure you can).
---
There is no mobs, NPC's, quests, instances etc in the alpha so not much else to do
---
This.
---
&gt; sometimes we disenchant gear.
---
Tell me about it... Didn't get a spot yday on an MC run, stormrage armor dropped, got disenchanted because the 2 druids there already had it.
---
You can add me on friendlist and i'll shoot you a GM joke every now and then if its so important.
---
*hear hear
---
&gt;you think you do, but you don't. 
---
You're seriously going to tell people what they will enjoy? Here of all places?
---
Yeah we don't really know. It might depend on how tryhard of a server you are on, since tryhards all go enginering and that could make prices very expensive. 
---
You could also consider waiting out tailoring and just storing all the cloth, most certainly cloth will be cheap on AH, and there's not that much you benefit from tailoring while leveling except bags of course.
---
I rebound caps to be ctrl+alt so I use it as a modifer. You can easily do this kind of stuff using registry changes, I think it took me like 10 mins to figure out how to do it.
---
I think Star Citizen is your best bet atm.
---
&gt;his whole MS &gt; OS crap didn't exist in actual vanilla 
---
That's the wrongest thing I've seen today my friend.
---
But as for your point, I get it, but common courtesy is that you roll on your "main" spec, or your "main" role, if you will. That's how it always has been. 
---
If you join a group as a healer, but you want to roll on a tank or DPS item, people would usually ask in the party if it was okay that they rolled on it before the run started or when it dropped, as it was considered an "off" spec item, whether you know about main/off specs or not is irrelevant.
---
It is frowned upon to just grab items left and right because it fits within the hybrid playstyle. Warriors can all tank even in their DPS spec, but they would never roll against me (prot warrior) unless they asked first, that's a guarantee now and it was in actual retail vanilla too.
---
About 3-5% at most, you should be fine.
---
Though I would consider orc just because it's amazing in both pvp and pve.
---
I cant say to you pick rogue or pick warlock, maybe your mom knows you better to tell you what to do :p
---
Do a list with pros and cons, see what you want for end game.
---
Like he said in the video, there aren’t any real skills to try out and all the classes have rage.
---
So probably not much else to do.
---
If Classic had the same numbers as retail, retail would still make more money. Nobody thinks that players want microtransactions.
---
1. You have limited time to play and want to be geared for raiding
---
2. You don't want to get ganked by stupid high level players
---
3. You want to be high level and help your guildmates in dungeons/pvp
---
"just to recap, here's what the previous blue post said, and here's a link to my video on it" easy 5mins without a sweat "and how does this update change that? Let's dig into that but first dont forget to smash sub blah blah blah"
---
They dont exsist in vanilla. just like server transfers and faction changes. dont like your faction ? reroll. dont like your server? tough. stick it out or reroll anew on a different server.
---
Im not super up2date on the classic meta but doesn't usually go the bindings to a tank?
---
I haven't played it myself but yes i've heard lots of friends complain about their mount. If blizzard does progressiveness properly, then we won't even have class mounts pre phase 2, so maybe you will go for a regular mount.
---
Dear god I hope it was given to a Warrior tank.
---
&gt;this isn't 2000 anymore or private servers run by a single person. with today's tech additional servers can be spun up or taken down with zero hassle
---
This was true in 2000 as well. MMO publishers don't create servers not because it takes lot of effort at the technical side. It is an important and complex business decision that needs enough data and proper analysis. Too many servers can literally kill an MMO. Players think the game is dead because not enough player density, so they leave.
---
How many points in reckoning is enough? 3?
---
It is not both.
---
Well it's kinda wierd that animations like that was even accepted in the alpha. See how good the undead animation is in comparison to many of the others.
---
Tauren Druid &gt; Night Elf Priest &gt; Night Elf Hunter.
---
Very long story but right now I think I'm happy playing what I've always played, I want to go back and "finish" the game.
---
Ahhh being In Westfall and that rain starts blowing in. Can’t. Fucking. Wait.
---
Lucky you. I did over a year bt runs with my guild and never saw the gleves but saw them about 5 times with pugs / twink runs.
---
I feel really bad that I knew all basically all of these.
---
My warlock went 4/8 tier 1, staff of dominance, sash of whispered secrets and tier 2 legs first run MC northdale alliance side. Only warlock in raid.... lol.
---
Embrace the no life meme. With time off, cast rapid adjust to the new hours of 11pm to 11am, as your toon excels the levels competition free. Return to work/life as the zerg catches up. Spend a precious few weeks well ahead of the curve on limited time.
---
I haven't played ret in years but I remember something like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxhZVut0cbx
---
Can a human get exalted with Darnasus just by lvling in their zone and doing quests through lvl 60 that give you darnasus rep easily?
---
Same here and it's fun!
---
A wand and proper spec results in no downtime.
---
That’s good to know. Also another reason why the right-click ignore option would be about the best deviation from vanilla they could make lol
---
In Classic reputation and community are important values. If you are a lazy player who cant be arsed to walk somewhere, always forgets stuff, etc people wont group up with you eventually. Same goes for warlocks who refuse to port people. If you can save the group 20 minutes of waiting time by porting someone and you dont do it because you think there is a lesson to teach... nobody likes you. If it was my group I would maybe even kick you. You are the kind of healer who doesnt heal avoidable damage so people learn to not take it. Nobody likes these guys. The needs of the group should always be your first priority.
---
CAPS LOCK SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON ANYWAY SO YOU WON'T BE MISSING OUT
---
Yeah, Undead Warrior. Original was Tauren. I got stuck at around level 44-45 in Tanaris when I ran out of quests and didn't know that grinding is a thing. Oh, and Hunter stole my weapon.
---
Im playing retro wow insta 60, dueling People. Just to lower mine too. Im going crazy
---
Also the day/night cycle which I'm pretty sure was a thing
---
In both cases it somewhat depends on how well geared your tank is, which we'll assume is the case.
---
In dungeons you can sometimes dps between heals if you're not anticipating huge chunks of damage. Depending on what dungeon you're doing and the mobs your pulling, your tank shouldn't always need constant healing and if your wand is solid you'll deal good damage. If the run basically a faceroll then you can toss in a sw:p or a mindblast but generally you'll want to save your mana.
---
In raids you could theoretically toss out a shadow word: pain on trash mobs or wand in between heals but you'll be doing negligible damage, using up global cooldowns and mana. Pre-casting and cancelling heals is safer in case shit goes tits up, uses less mana (unless you just wand) meaning less drinking.
---
Whoosh
---
Truly onboarable
---
&gt; You were bitching abt che being racist, thats what I was referring to. And reactionary is not a term exclusive to vanguard communism, dipshit.
---
Go ahead and denounce communism as a whole, then, Ne'er-do-well. 
---
&gt; Go choke you fascist fuck
---
Ahhh, death wishes.
---
I'm civnat, so not quite a fascist.
---
I think its funny. Communists always get extremely aggressive for being called out about their vile ideology. Makes sense, considering communists definitely aren't human.
---
This is amazing. Great meming mixed with strong emotions
---
elwynn, eh? I'll see y'all in stv ;)
---
Expect lits of giggles and grins when original player are presented with the login and character creation screens.
---
Also expect supermarket shelves cleared of Hot Pockets and Mountain Dew.
---
In raid environment - not that much to be honest, unless you are that warlock who is allowed to use corruption in a good guild.
---
In shit tier guilds most (if not all) warlocks are specced SM/Ruin and fight over corruption slots, knock each other corruptions off after a few seconds it get applied, ultimately wasting DPS, debuff slots and mana.
---
Nice update!
---
Class fantasy is very important for immersion. You like the spy/Assassin thing, so do it!
---
Your MS is the one you're running as
---
That's it. That's the assumption. You can roll for OS but that's it
---
I'm pretty sure that I've seen a few posts on this! Most races are able to get other faction reputations while leveling to 60 however it is not an efficient route to level and will slow you down in some places considerably!
---
No they're not.
---
If it's the loading screen with the dwarf on the gryphon, that usually happens when you load into a zone or instance not located on the main land. I think it's just the default loading screen when there's no alternative.
---
I remember a guy carried on name changing on my server but everyone knew because he was on block lists or friends list that update so he continued to be Infamous
---
Was there diminishing returns in 1.12?
---
Thanks!
---
Well, it's kinda weird that animations like that were even accepted in the alpha. See how good the undead animation is in comparison to many of the others.
---
Sure.
---
BUT...
---
Will they not exist in classic? I hope so
---
I rerolled a mage in April 2006 after playing a shaman and mainly doing pvp.  Joined the top raiding guild on my server and on my first run in BWL got 3 pieces of T2 and was basically epic complete in 2 weeks haha.
---
Is a macbook pro okay for playing vanilla?
---
I have tried to play BFA with it, and I definitely can't play it smoothly whatsoever even turning down all the graphics...
---
Trust me, reputation goes around on servers and if you carry on doing this you'll definitely make a name for yourself
---
Warrior in dps spec without shield 🛡 can easy "tank" deadmines atleast :)
---
Is it worth getting skinning/leatherworking as a resto shaman over something like herb/alchemy?
---
I rolled a lock in vanilla. Needless to say. Never again! I do miss soulshards but just. Having to summon 37 lazy jerks every night and then giving them health stones all raid. *shudder* 
---
Still props to those rolling a lock! But I'm going pally hand having to cycle though my entire raid blessing every 5-15 minutes
---
Think I'm going to change, mage has been my main for years but I think I'm going to try a healer out. Probably priest
---
Great soundtrack too lol
---
If I have a spell damage trinket popped, and I cast a spell, will it benefit from the trinket if it runs out mid cast?
---
Now thats some effort. Awesome!
---
Didn't Titan turn into Overwatch essentially?
---
&gt; just to lower my through-the-roof-hype
---
It won't.
---
I kinda agree with you. I understand why they want to include this feature. However if Classic is successful and they are making good money from subscriptions then they have money to hire more GM staff.
---
Hey what's up guys this is WarcraftSmeg here with some breaking news about WORLD OF WARCRAFT CLASSIC! Don't forget to like and subscribe! You can also follow me on twitter and instagram.
---
This news is so great guys you're going to love it. There was a post on the official US World of Warcraft forums by Community Manager Kaivax. Now what's happened is this post was made 23 days ago but just now guys, Kaivax has updated it. It's about loot trading in classic - so you thought you knew about it because of the original post and you remember I did a video of that post click here to watch it and also like and subscribe.
---
...
---
I use it for push to talk since forever, just have to change the registry, mine is rebound to f13
---
I like the swampletic references :)
---
Nice challenge and video.
---
I mean Sp still have a spot on pservers, tho it is more optimal to have a healer priest with shadowweave, most guilds pref a shadowpriest.
---
Oh, I understand. There are some fights where you can keep the cat active on specific bosses and therefore do more damage than the buff from the wolf provides to the raid. But there are also fights where you can't keep the cat active enough and the wolf provides higher DPS. And honestly with 40 man raids, such micromanaging min/max bullshit is insignificant to the point of unnoticeablity. And since the raid is quite likely to have 2 or more hunters, it would make the most sense for one hunter to bring a wolf, and the rest, cats.
---
Black Rock Depths had a window iirc for gnomes and Dwarves
---
Played as a dwarf priest in vanilla/tbc, this time I will be playing either troll or undead priest. 
---
I want to play shadow priest as that’s what I did the whole of my time on wow, but I figured changing faction will make the game feel new to me. (Only had 1 horde character and only made it to level 37 or something) 
---
Now to decided troll or undead, it’s difficult!
---
Yes
---
All spell calculations are done as soon as the spell lands. Meaning that you can for instance place a debuff in a target after casting a spell, the spell casted will get the benefit from the debuff placed, as long as it hits the target before the casted spell does. 
---
With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that the spell damage calculation is done as the spell lands, meaning you won’t get the extra damage if your buff runs out.
---
Goodbye to wife, son (3) and daughter (3 months).

Hello Chandresh at the corner store for my random trips to get energy drinks at 1am
---
Gotcha!
---
Bumping this question as I plan to buy a laptop for when working away solely to play classic, I’d imagine if you use the vanilla graphics and I’m guessing blizz will set a lower view distance limit like vanilla that this will be easier to run on laptops? Hoping for decent answers or atleast they’ll maybe release minimum and recommended specs ?
---
Sucked in more human lives than any other black hole out there
---
Were alliance warlocks really that bad and gimped at pvp? Talking about all aspects wpvp bg’s and AV
---
I don't think that one ninja accident would lead to server-wide harass. I can talk for myself that I won't believe some random trade chat person blaming anyone, only myself and my friends (or with proper proofs). Also I won't treat person badly just because one occasion. Everyone makes mistakes.
---
I played on a private server as a priest last year with barely any WoW experience. By running every dungeon on the way to 60 you'll learn everything you have to know for raiding, it's pretty basic.   
---
The guild I joined had much better geared healers so I never knew if I was making a real difference (which was a shame) but as long as you're putting in actual effort you'll do well.
---
Basic tips for instance healing:  
---
Learn how fade works, don't use your fear (in most cases), avoid overhealing, if you take aggro run to your tank. Don't be afraid to let your dps die if they pull aggro, as long as the you and the tank live you can resurrect everyone else.
---
Paladins could maybe use something like spell damage increasing their block value to keep them different but useful.
---
If they ever change mechanics they are of course most likely to use the tbc ones which work quite well to make the tanks different but good in their own way.
---
You could server transfer for $$ some time in vanilla, not sure when it was added.
---
Or thousands of tourists that will eventually leave and leave the server empty 👀🤯😱
---
I had similar dream. It released out of nowhere and when I finally set everything up and logged in to make my first characters... I couldn’t remember a single name I wanted to save!!!! And when I finally remembered like 2/10 names I wanted..... THEY WERE BOTH TAKEN!! 
---
...It was a nightmare.....
---
You got that shiny trinket, someone whispered you, hey, Blight, I REALLLLLLY need that trinket any chance you would sell it for 1k? Even the fact that it's possible makes me slightly nervous, I don't even want to receive those whispers. And it's not that easy to track everyone. In theory you could write it down on paper that Blight got trinket and check his equipment next day, but I'm not sure that there will be many people who would do that.
---
There’s actually no normalized ‘bleed’ in vanilla. These abilities work individually, but in almost always the same way. 
---
Most scale with attack power, as is the case with both rogue bleeds, they also ignore armor. The ap scaling is not normalized, and I think rupture has a higher modifier than garrote, not sure though.
---
Damn man, there are people still going for their other binding.
---
Can confirm EU client (Great Britain) has always had yards.
---
i rolled on a 
---
[charged gear](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Charged_Gear)
---
that had int and stamina on it as a paladin and won it. But i was melee dps so 2 caster dps got angry and called me a ninja. Later on I try to get into other pugs for other dungeons but because just one of those people were in the group i get kicked.
---
According to https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7t5ck8/paid_character_transfer/ character transfers existed in vanilla.
---
You should rather level mining and tailoring to begin with, save your materials and learn engineering at 60. 
---
Or, level mining/engineering while leveling, drop mining when you’ve created all you want/need and level up tailoring.
---
I am unsettled of how much i relate. Two lvl 20s ish on private server now..
---
You're forgetting that vampiric embrace is a spell cast on the enemy in classic, so even if you DoT multiple targets you're realistically only getting 30% of healing from one target. So to receive max healing you'd have to focus that specific target with your shadow spells.
---
You act like this didn't happen anyway. Ask any Guild officer loot master  constantly pmed with bribes lol
---
No, not at all. But it was way worse before the warlock class revamp where they got death coil and much stronger talents. 
---
They will have this kit on launch in classic, so the issue is not that prevalent.
---
No one can really give you a straight answer, but the safest bet is to assume the same requirements as the current retail game
---
so there's a thing called tbc
---
That Mac is going to run hot
---
that's the only post-naxx content i'll like to see
---
Right off the bat I’m going to be getting skinning on my hunter and will most likely vendor the leather as the AH will be full of leather. Please could someone recommend a good second profession for early coin making?
---
I lol'd at work.
---
&gt; [Lol?](https://i.imgflip.com/1bhgqb.jpg)
---
I did this as well, 2 days in and got my mage to lvl 15. Although I'm sure I get way more bags than I should be, the rest of the pacing is perfect.
---
Stoneform! The answer is clear.
---
I haven’t been near WoW since early TBC but from these comments I’m finding out they removed weather and day/night?!
---
I remember really looking forward to the patch which added weather effects at the time and really loving them when they arrived. 
---
Feels like such a regressive step to me in terms of immersion - is/was this really the case?
---
&gt;  I'd estimate 95-99% of the raw value of a flask on any server with a healthy population comes from the herbs- i.e. if you can sell a flask for 100g, buying the mats on the AH is going to cost 95-99g.
---
So I went and tested this hypothesis on a high pop server that shall remain nameless /and is obvious/.
---
This is false. I tested the following recipes:
---
FAP, Fire Oil, Arcane elixir, Mighty Rage Potion, Greater Arcane Elixir, Elixir of the Mongoose, Greater Stoneshield Potion.
---
The lowest profit for crafting it from mats from AH was 10% (on Fire Oil and Arcane Elixir which are not in high demand). The average profit was around 20% if you just flip the AH mats and make the flask. The highest profit were those which involved fishing - Blackmouths and Stonescales, which, when fished were big profit, when flipped on the AH were back at 10-20%.
---
Yeah maybe, but what are you gonna steal gear from fury, that early so Warlocks can do damage ? what about healers, are you really going to push them that hard, that early ?   
---
Instead of just, dont let warlocks do so much threat until, your Tanks and Heals are geared enough for it
---
I'm having such a hard time deciding. I've always played horde but do I want to relive launch like the good old days or see it through the eyes of the alliance this time?
---
IMO don't. They said summer so the most you'll wait is about 100 days. I feel like playing unofficial servers would kill the hype for me. But that's just me. I waited over 10 years might as well wait another 100 days.
---
It's an all or nothing type of talent.  It's the focal point of the build and would be a waste to spend all those points to reach Reckoning just to take a low %age. Imo
---
Can I freshly lvled feral druid farm devilsaur leather?
---
Or will I need a friend?
---
and then theres a thing called wotlk, and then cata, then mop. You would rather want the stuff that made wow worse than new content?
---
+10% Rep gains is BiS racials for employed players.
---
like it was in vanilla untill partway threw WotLK.
---
i ran a lot of pugs runs in WotLK since i had alts and people would join my runs since i had a rep of being extremly fair and clear with my rules.
---
and on a similar note i had people i would not invite due to poor preformance and ninja pulling etc.
---
while it might seem wrong that the game dose better when people get ostracized out of parts of the game it really is true as it removes the few bad apples out of the playerbase and put pressure to be nice to people and do well since it might matter down the road.
---
this is why i think LoL, DotA, overwatch, current WoW, etc. etc. has such a huge toxicity issue random ques are bad for treatment of others. private game lobbies, LFG chats etc. means your rep matter so how you treat people matters and you can't hide in the mass of people for awful shit you do.
---
Haha i love you guys
---
been arguing for this since day 1 of the loot trading debacle. The only thing i got from it is people are to lazy to call out ninjas and in which, you kinda deserve to be ninjad.
---
There's no real way of hiding the fact that you're Ret. If you join a group, and they get 3 other DPS, then you're a healer. You don't want to be a healer as Ret.
---
Your one and only goal, is to do damage, do a lot, and do more then anyone else. If you're not doing damage, then you're not proving what Ret is capable of. If you build a reputation as a consistently competent DPS, word will spread, and people will want you.Support is secondary.
---
Well, you guys invented the yards so I guess that makes sense.

What item is he using at this timestamp shortly after his Hammer of Justice runs out? It slows the hunter and is displayed as a debuff with a Frostbolt icon. https://youtu.be/qodXtYwTZuo?t=1662
---
At low level and people tell they are new, i think most would not bash them to much for it. On high level though (BRS) you can't really tell that lie and get away with it. So to some extent im going to let kids get away with it, but you are doing it deliberately to be a brat, your rep will be dead the same day.
---
one of the greater aspects of being a community
---
the only thing we miss now is interactable GMS who pull missjiff for the fun of it. I miss those times when GMS came by in town just for the fun of it.
---
I'd assume it will be similar to running BFA, seeing as they're remaking classic with the modern engine.
---
Tailoring. You and everyone else will need bags.
---
(apostrophes\*)
---
cool job i will grind 15-25 levels in classic
---
getting properly ostracized in classic takes more than one action. sure you might lose the ability to play with at most 5-10 people and a server hosts what 5000-6000 people. you need to be consistently awful and quite determind to get so well known nobody wants to play with you. people will tell you every time you are being awful aswell so there is plenty of time to correct the ship.
---
the purge of bad apples is needed inorder to maintain a player base in todays WoW everybody is an awful selfish arsehole and you need to be the same due to anonymity of cross server, que based systems. a rep based system forces you to be nice and consider others inorder to make progress. yes it kicks people out of the game but do you want those people playing the game draging the experiance down for everybody else?
---
They came in 2006 with the bc pre patch. Essentially not vanilla. The only other way to server transfer before that was when blizzard offered it up to go from a high pop server to a low pop server. It was also pvp to pve or pvp but not pve to pvp.
---
I too am desperate for the Classiq'
---
Only on the internet can you go from being the first-ever human to have photographed a black hole and thus become world famous in a night, to becoming a meme template.
---
Hi, /u/Korgoth420
---
Depends on if you want PvP or PvE as your main focus.
---
Only on the internet can you go from being the first-ever human to have photographed a black hole to becoming a meme template.
---
Damn I forgot how much classic wow reused assets.
---
I mean, you can, but id assume what ever guild you are in (unless its a cesspool guild) would boot you out the very same minute. Unless its a pugg, but doing a 40 man pugg, you kinda ask for shit to go tits up with this system in place.  
---
But man oh man, imagine how much loot horny warriors would pay for ashkandi
---
What are the other two playing? Do you have a class fantasy that you enjoy? Or are there specific mechanics that you think sound fun?
---
I played druid during vanilla, always forced to heal in dungeons and raids and respec to feral to enjoy my time in the world and PvP. That absolutely sucked and I'm 100% not making that mistake again in Classic. Hybrids in vanilla are a big no go.
---
Looks like he has a frost oil equipped on his weapon https://classicdb.ch/?item=14634 I guess it's pretty good for paladin since they have no mobility and very little cc.
---
You will probably need a friend.
---
I'd actually rather be there on release day to experience it. I dont care about taking off to rush to 60. I want to be there for the frustration and the chance to be there when everyone is in the starting zones
---
My guess would be Frost Oil but not 100% certain
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3829/frost-oil
---
It isn't honored and rank 3 for 60 mount, it's exalted and some higher rank I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Not at all. Fear is not that important of a spell. Ally warlocks are actually stronger in BG's, but horde wins in world pvp mostly just because of better world pvp racials like orc.
---
Kazzak is more conveniently located for the Alliance (But Horde can mage portal to Stoneard)
---
Azuregos is more conveniently located for the Horde
---
Darkshire clearly favors Alliance
---
Ashenvale kind of favors Horde
---
Hinterlands is pretty neutral
---
Feralas is also pretty neutral.
---
He was a huge voice on the pserver I used to play, always bringing negativity in every video, until he got banned from the server for something unrelated
---
I agree with this. You can premeditate all you want but once that character creation screen is open, nothing in the real world matters and anything is possible.
---
Yeah, fun to see posts like these while on retail they made a personal loot forced everywhere.
---
Having a torch bearer support in raids would have been cool.
---
Yes you can do it without even turning rep if you just start in darnasus. I think you can get it at around lvl 45
---
Just out of spite, I hope a mage got it lol
---
I started wow in BC and played druid to this day, so this is my opportunity to experience the class in all its forms over the years.
---
What's the point of getting ahead?
---
If you stay with the pack you will always have teammates to do quests and dungeons.
---
a blocked person is still blocked after a namechange. all of this existed in WotLK and it wasn't an issue since a undead rogue that has the exact same gear asking to do the same content as before and he is blocked in your friends list for some reason seems like it is Y guy.
---
had a rogue name change 3 times on my server pretending not to be the guy but you can't hide your writing style and how you act towards people and the fact this guy used the same trade chat macro for his pug runs was a clear sign.
---
I upvoted multiple comments arguing either side, y'all are making good points and I'm still about as undecided as I was before clicking on the thread
---
Only gnomes can glitch into old IF through the IF bank :) Unless you have Noggenfogger, or pygmy oil, or world enlarger.
---
This is one of the last open questions when it comes to Classic.
---
Yep already have a 27 Orc Shaman
---
Ah sorry, shoulda looked into it more
---
Played mostly warrior in classic, had mage alt(s) too though. In retail I main mage but have warrior alts. Not planning on changing things up, those are the two classes I enjoy the most, question is which I will level first.
---
Unfortunately, prot warriors only make up 8 % of a raid (3/40), so if you intend to tank raids this is the single most contested raid spot...
---
You get 20% less rep for each level the quest is grey.  This floors at 20% rep.  You will get the same rep if the quest is green or red.
---
If you're just after money, grab another gathering profession. Skinning doesn't require a minimap overlay, so you can pick up either mining or herbalism without a problem.
---
Probably something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsMiqo0vt0bb).
---
the more typical situation was that you formed groups so that you would 100% ensure you are the only one rolling need on the BiS item as it is not an upgrade for the other people. or that you trust the person wouldn't take an upgrade for them so you could get a bis item.
---
that was why a tank might invite one dps after an other dps check out the gear would wisper you " kick Y or i am leaving" it was also why a comp like mage, rogue, hunter, warrior and priest was just generally wanted (party due to both good dps and just insane CC but the overlap of gear is minimal)
---
No profession is useless. What are you trying to do?
---
I’ll never forget in my first few Deadmines runs I hit the need button on everything, as in, “give it to the person who needs it.”
---
How was I supposed to know that’s what was going on?  No, I didn’t read the vendor manual.
---
Make a dice, throw it in the air and Kick it às it falls down, classes class facing the ground wins

Don't take vacation of release day, instead quit your job and barricade yourself in your room.
---
That's when the person asks in raid chat...
---
"REZ, pls" instead of running back.  :)
---
I re rolled a new everything from Alliance to Horde halfway during vanilla. Class and role I adapted just fine but weirdly enough it was faction I had the hardest time adapting to. 
---
It grew on me overtime but for example I was taking Alliance-style settlements for granted when seems to me the Horde in vanilla is essentially tents and huts put together on the ground
---
I feel you. As much as I would like to lower hype for the moment, I've also had a hard time investing myself truly on a private server. There's just something about them not being official, which removes a bit of the purpose for me. 
---
I mean, it's great to relive that feeling but for me it probably won't come close to official classic servers. That's part of why I'm so hyped for all this.
---
You got a raidspot in the best guild on the server with one of the most played classes wich you never played before, after mostly playing pvp ?
---
Stop blackmailing the gm, thats not ok :)
---
im creating an alt mage for my rogue just to make spawn camping and hunting people down easier
---
Even at a much more basic level, I won't roll a rogue because it's far too likely the class will be over populated
---
hunter tip: aimed shotting people through world geometry
---
I thought about waiting a day or two but decided against it. No matter how the launch goes, I definitely wouldn't be getting any work done that day so I may as well be off!
---
I will be playing a human, but early on I will be tramming up to IF to level in Loch Modan/Wetlands, because honestly, fuck Westfall. (Duskwood is kind of cool, but I've done it more often than the other zones so a change of pace will be good). What all should I look out for to do in Elwynn/SW so I don't have to come back? I know there's a quest at like level 8-10 in Goldshire that sends you to Loch Modan, and I figure I should do weapon training in SW, but is there anything else I can only do down there that I might have to go back for? Also, what level do you think is best to head up for the easiest transition? 10? 8? 12?
---
Looks like a normal dwarf female to me.
---
Burner accounts for dealing Savory Deviate Delights
---
Aah, feels like 2006 again
---
It will not.
---
How about in levelling dungeons. Do you think it would be okay for a druid healer to roll on dps gear that would help him level up faster?
---
Main was a nelf druid.
---
I want a different story, so this time around I'll try a different hybrid on horde.
---
Will level a druid alt at some point.
---
What materials are going to sell for more money as we move into different phases and content of the game? 
---
Nature resistant potions for example with AQ are used a lot? So the mats to make these sell for more in the future?
---
Dungeons are meh and 98% of quests are soloable. You get ahead so you can do what’s actually important in the game early.
---
I use capslock as my push to talk key for Discord.
---
July 16th
---
Try to think 1-2 steps ahead. Since the phases are clear try to think, what is needed for the next one.
---
E.g. p2 PvP Ranking - prices for Ore/Bars will 100 % increase before that since a lot of people will retrain and take Engineering
---
truly Blizz-like
---
Full pre BiS in a week
---
As a horde rogue. I spend some time in CutThroat Alley in stormwind city.
---
This is how I imagine all orcs from now on
---
Yeah guess I should have been more specific. I am asking in terms of usefulness mainly at max level. Are there any must have items for a resto (or even ele) shaman from leatherworking or would it be more beneficial to go herb/alch for the consumables and gold making ability?
---
I'm planning on doing some casual raiding and pvp if that helps.
---
Full T1 in four weeks? No. You’ll raid with your guild two weeks after launch minimal. You gonna get all 8 pieces in two MC raids? You could be the only warrior in your guild and it still won’t happen
---
I can't decide either. Nor professions. Only thing I know I want is to do all secondary trades on my main and I want 2 alts.
---
The funny part is that more the vast majority of situations we will still use the metric centimetres, metres and kilometres in day to day life.
---
Awe, you play with your mum?
---
You could also go mage for aoe farming, unless your grandma called dibs on that class lol
---
Do the higher level quests in Dun Morogh as well - like the Troggs in the quarry. This is an aspect that is overlooked in vanilla - doing two starter zones puts you at a really good place, especially if you want to completely skip one zone in the bracket, which you do. Do everything in Elwynn, then go to Dun Morogh, do all relevant there, then head to Loch Modan. You are putting yourself at a disadvantage there though, think it through.
---
Please don’t tell me you’re doing it as a mage
---
No! Played casually in tbc never hit cap
---
How does the savage strikes talent work?
---
If you have 10% base melee crit. Will your raptor strikke crit be 12% or 30% after 2 points in savage strikes?
---
In other words. Will it add 20% of your base crit or 20% additional crit?
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I started on Northdale yesterday just to scratch the itch. "Wow priests are awful I'm not sure I could level like this." *gets wand* "Holy shit let's gooooooooooo!!!"

Adding on to what /u/Sinflits said, get a macro that does the following:
---
* Target the closest enemy target
---
* Start auto shooting
---
* Send pet to attack
---
This is a godsend for leveling any class, but hunter two fold, since you need to manage the pet as well.
---
i've seen 1 druid get full t1 in 2 raids
---
That was fantastic

Oh that's sick!

Full Energy Burst build. Only good for stunlocking and bursting people down in world pvp, garbo for all else

Do you know the difference between spec and role?
---
I'm running as a hybrid spec...
---
8.0 weather effects seem a bit unlikely given its the 7.3.5 client
---
It's not me, but /u/SquillePlays btw.
---
Potato quality indeed
---
but then you aren't getting the true experience c'mon now
---
Nope, going for some caster class instead of Rogue this time, haven't decided which yet. Also switching faction this time around, young me picked foolishly back in the day.
---
I know lol
---
tnx bro
---
TBC counts as classic too?
---
Just buy a naga mouse with 12 buttons. Use shift Ctrl alt modifier boom 48 buttons available.
---
Yep imagine rereleasing future expansions with community decided changes. No group finder. Flying mounts. Etc that ruined much of the game and maybe making the outlands and northrend much less flying depending etc as a change as well. Keep stuff that makes the game engaging. And change stuff that ruins it. Would be very interesting.
---
I don't want changes, but I was bored so typed out some ideas.
---
Honestly, I think if they use the shitty itemization on some pieces, it could be doable with only one or two changes to talent points.
---
Like a converts spirit to defense talent.   That would quite easily the healing hybrids in line with the DPS hybrid.
---
Shamans would need a bit more live though.  
---
Like a second 31 pt talent in enhancement.   While having a shield equipped, educes all DMG by 10% and increases Stam and agi by 20%
---
And an improved, improved lighting shield.  Everytime lighting shield does damage, your shield is electrically charged, increasing block chance by 10% for 4 seconds.
---
yeah but for that you need to be able to proof that you bought it
---
dont buy gear while leveling its shit anyway. save it for hookers in goldshire
---
correct me if i'm misremembering, but mana oil didn't come out until like zg patch or later?  if that's so, the point is moot for another year or so.
---
LET ME BE CLEAR! \*EVERYTHING\* IS A HUNTER WEAPON
---
I’ll always upvote Don Draper.
---
What is the best profession to go with tailoring at the start of the game? I'm gonna be the bag guy.
---
Why would he need a friend? Devilsaur are what, 40-50ish elites? Any 60 should be able to dispatch them with ease, no?
---
I’ve tried every other class on PS and yup I’m sticking with Priest which was my first toon back in 2005 and my main to this day.
---
Damn, those nostalgia goggles blinded me to the fact that blizzard didn't have a proper boar leveling progression laid out.
---
Yes! Very good indeed! This team kinda sounds like “tough shit, you play bad, you don’t get loot” ideology
---
Since they won’t give me a release date I relapsed into pserver just playing casually learning the orc starting zones. I usually play undead but I’m going orc for launch so might as well learn all the quest.
---
Why, do you think it’s harder as a mage?
---
just want to mention that some of the best players in &lt;APES&gt; level as a 5 man group when new servers hit. the reason is that they know the game well enough to the point where they can constantly tag things left and right without stopping and aoeing it all down with a mage and warlock while questing.
---
rogue is a class for example that absolutely benefits from this. the highest lvl rogues on nethergarde and elysium at launch i know for a fact they played in a group of 2, but 5 is even better cuz theyre that shit of a leveling class. when they can keep going without having to eat they dish out dmg.
---
keep in mind that the xp reduction has diminishing returns. 2 players cuts it by 50% but the next player does not bring as much of a penalty per player (cant find tables but its out there cba)
---
u just need to have 5 players who are actually playing and not afk leeching
---
Dude its a thousand gold. Don't include discounts in your advertised price.
---
As a warrior tank it always worries me seeing tanks having trouble finding a spot. I plan to rush so I can get recruited easier but unfortunately just don’t have tons of experience as a raiding warrior. Have tanked everything up to raids fine.
---
&gt; missjiff
---
/r/boneappletea
---
why not copy? when tbc released we were 60. What´s the difference?
---
You are wrong.
---
Heyo, so I first joined in Mists of Pandaria, which was 5 years ago, so my memory might be a bit foggy. But there was definitely still rain and day/night cycles, just very watered down compared to the 1.12 servers I tried. Modern rain would make the sky cloudy and there would be a fair amount of rain, but never torrents and there was barely any fog. Likewise, while the day/night cycle still existed, zones were significantly brighter at night time than they were on the 1.12 server.
---
They attempted to correct the 'bright night' sometime in Warlords of Draenor, but it was on a per-zone basis. Meaning storm wind at night was bright as shit, but if you walked out the main gates it would suddenly shift to darkness and was jarring as shit.
---
I'm in the same boat, I played warrior as a kid back in the day, and wanted to redeem myself in classic. But I vividly remember how hard it was to get a raid spot, and that sucks...
---
I see a blood elf. Yikes.
---
This is really cool and entertaining. I really like that and hope it continious
---
I wonder why it is so easy to get mages and warlocks *10k shadow bolt* *4k ignite ticks*
---
I think they need to allow you to choose whether you want to transfer to the new content, but keep the original as is.
---
Personally id love new content in vanilla but there's always people that won't and the chance it'll ruin the game.
---
ever heard of a spell caster tank
---
didnt think so
---
This reads like the inversal of how it was in vanilla. Shadowpriests, warrior, mages, rogues got denied by the dozen in our recruiting website. Any healer got an instant invite. Well tanks were also not needed, true.
---
A rogue could kick a normal mount cast though too, right?
---
Eh... Nope. Horde all the way. Gonna be rolling UD Mage. For the Banshee Queen! 🤘
---
(Seriously.. no race was as ****:ed up in Cata as the Forsaken. Finally got the real deal back.. with buildings that aren’t looking like some cartoon by Disney or whatever. Not gonna miss that. And the Barrens Chat... obviously. If Blizz are gonna allow it ofc, lol.)
---
everything is important in the game starting level 1.
---
Unless you don't play to have fun or experience/enjoy the content since day 1.
---
Tanks being the hardest makes sense to me and agrees with my experience in the past
---
I know, that's the most surprising thing. But it's important to remember that not everyone will get to 60 etc etc.
---
You can always buy a mount anyway, and those two classes get free lvl 40 riding skill.
---
Druid getting his whole t2 in 2 raids. Not uncommon with how few competition there are on druid pieces.
---
I always wondered why the marsh areas didn’t flood sometimes leaving only the roads.
---
yee i see what you mean. For me a melee is a dps but technically a tank is also a melee i get you. 
---
But still, its usually a warrior tank item right? Like i've never seen a Rogue or offensive warrior with it but like i said i dont know whats currently meta on vanilla pservers.
---
Probably the bwl dps trinket.
---
in blues
---
Bonus finding for those wanting to go Warrior-Tank: The competition is even fiercer among the most "hardcore". If I filter out those saying they will reach 60 withing 1 month, there are only raid spots for 51 % of the players!
---
Going to have to be a “no” on this one. I didn’t watch the video. Seems like a waste of time.
---
Although the trolls look atrocious I understand what they were originally going for. The hunched over posture, the long arms, the grotesqueness. They are TROLLS after all. When most people think of a troll they don't imagine a hot blue chick with tusks.
---
When I levelled up as a druid tank through dungeons it was slower, but not that much, since my gear was amazing because of doing dungeons i could chain pull and we would clear the dungeon ultra fast, most of the time the whole group stayed with me to do a few more runs. 
---
During classic launch it probably will be faster than questing since zones will be overpopulated and dungeons are instances.
---
Wtb raid slot
---
I'd imagine how spirit based your character is makes a giant difference. Affliction lock stacking spirit should almost certainly spend the extra 10-90 gold.
---
ur right im just being juvenile 
---
but yea it goes to warr tank 99% of cases unless u have 1. dictator rogue GM  2. rogue has been around long enough so they get it after 1st tank
---
Have my upvote!
---
I AM THE LAW GIVEA
---
The release hype and chaos is the one thing I don't want to miss. Sitting on voip with friend trying to login when a new release of a Blizzard game/expansion is glorious.
---
No you're running a hybrid *class*
---
You're running a single spec. They are not the same thing. You do not get to roll for multiple specs as your main spec
---
Druid’s farming devilsaur is purely based on entangling roots and DoTs like moon fire and insect swarm. There is no diminishing returns on PvE roots so you do that and hope for no resists.
---
Do you?
---
A spec is Arms/Prot etc
---
That usually ties in to roll. You don't need a tank item as Arms so you don't get to roll for it
---
I was under the impression that it wasn't possible just through leveling alone. That doing that was just an incorrect calculation from private servers.
---
current spirit
---
Oh wow, these are amazing! Gonna watch the older two vids too lol
---
This is content. 34/10
---
Unlike M and Above, EC-T are simply guidelines, and not fast rules that sellers and shops have to adhere to. It's similar to any movie rating PG-13 and Below. It's SUGGESTED, not a hard and fast rule.
---
But maybe, if you make somebody cry and hurt themselves over a video game, maybe it's you to blame for being such a massive fucking dick?
---
40-50? They are 55-58
---
I was an absolute idiot who didn't know how to play a rogue. Somehow I ended up getting accepted into a raiding guild. After a week or two they threatened to kick me out if I didn't figure out what I was doing. A handful of guildies straightened me out and got me proper dungeon geared in like a week.
---
best summer ever
---
Raid comps will vary off the population of players available. It wont be static, but this is good research. Surprising on a couple levels, and assumes results of the survey are accurate.
---
Damn that is so realistic I almost cried too
---
I didn't tell anyone to not do anything though, I simply said that it's not fun because I was "forced" to farm dungeons once thanks to my best buddy and it was actually hell on earth. The most boring way to level I have ever experienced and I just wanted to be a nice guy and warn people before they make the same mistake, questing is both more fun and faster.  
---
But hey, if you want to do it then there's nothing stopping you my dude.
---
Uhm I have a masters degree in World of Wacraft, thank you very much.
---
Ehh, resto still did what it did pretty well. Elem was even passable in BC.
---
There's 3 high lvl ammo:
---
Dungeon ammo from LBRS, very rare and people use this for speedruns/progression
---
Thorium arrorws which are about 1g per 200, you usually use these for raiding, can use them for pvp too depends on your money.
---
And then the vendor arrows that you typically use for casual stuff or pvp.
---
The difference is about 5 dps?  per upgrade.
---
I always feel like making this post every day!

You sicken me. You are a fascist, "civic nationalism" doesn't exist. Just mask off and start goose stepping you brown shirt  bastard.
---
5 stars.  Would purchase again
---
Tanks have the easiest time (by far) of finding groups for non raid content, and the hardest time finding a spot in a raiding guild.
---
Wait What? This is exactly what I'm trying to do! Have a mega regen troll warrior with lifestealing and regen pots with hp5 gear...
---
You really think the only reason BFA is more taxing to run versus vanilla is because of the client it is on???
---
Download retail WoW and test that on lowest settings. Level 1-20 is free so don’t worry if you do or don’t have an account.
---
The irony of using an image from an article that expressly debunks the exact claim you're making to prove your point.  
---

---
Speed lvling is how I'm enjoying the content. And then speed professions. And then speed raids. And then I stomp scrubs in pvp with my purps. The wonderful cycle of wow.
---
oh, right, i can't have an opinion if i'm in this sub, my bad.
---
You spent time to complain about something you didn’t even watch.  I can’t understand this sort of logic
---
Expect the requirements to be closer to retail WoW than the old Vanilla client. The base of the engine is Cataclysm era. If that doesn't answer your question, without knowing any specific specs I'd wager it will run on lowest settings, but I wouldn't expect a smooth experience.
---
Yeah I've personally never liked the zone or had any connection to it (except that IF is there), the only reason why I didn't mention it.
---
Mining. Easier to level mining while leveling and if you plan on PvPing you’re gonna need to level Engi with that ore anyway.
---
I hope not. Character permanence is important.
---
Don't listen to him! He's only saying that so he gets to play first!
---
Is this basically saying there are not going to be enough shadow priests? Because if so I will definitely play it. I mained it during TBC having been a healer during classic and I absolutely loved it.
---
It depends on what is under the hood. My MacBook Pro runs retail WoW on high with ease.
---
Good mentality, man. Take those first 3-5 days off and tell your friends to do the same. It's not worth the stress, really. Really.
---
Thanks I couldn't remember exactly. Still a 60 feral druid should be about to drop a 55 elite, no? Switch to your healing set and entangling roots kite it if it hits you too hard to face tank.
---
No, but they drop a lot of herbs
---
Hey a day of trying to log into classic/deal with crashes is better than being at work imo
---
No you will find they have a wide variety of herbs on their loot table.
---
That's okay. I bet there are Rogues around who would want the Set as well.
---
At least we know that Blue posts happen on weekends too.
---
That's definitely good news.
---
As someone that was hoping to be Shadow for raiding (Heals if needed obviously) this gives me some hope.
---
Oh I plan to do just that in addition to possibly just founding the weekly MC pug for my server cause I want experience.
---
Cataclysm? Pretty sure it’s forked from Legion.
---
TIL YOU DIE
---
Yeah if it is the same type of effect. they both give armor, it is the same with frost armor. Fire Shield and thorns don't stack because they are both damage shield buffs. This is different from retribution aura which provides a buff but all auras stack with all buffs regardless. Devotion aura which provides armor, stacks with motw.
---
Sounds like you’ll have no issues then.  The ones that struggle are the ones not willing to put the work in (sounds like everything in life tho, doesn’t it?).
---
Warrior
---
But I do want to be a healer as ret. I just wanted to be a dps'er as well. Hybrid class baby.
---
All-out DPS focus would definitely be fun to try one day. I just never joined a dungeon group as a DPS slot. Always healer, but I never just healed - I DPS'ed and healed every time. Because dungeons were easy enough to do both, and multitasking like that was really fun. It's easier if there are two healers, there usually were. 
---
This was the hybrid class experience I signed up for, to hit my enemies while throwing heals on my friends. Raids were a bit different.
---
Point is, dungeon groups were easy to find as retribution. Just swing that hammer and heal when needed. If not healing between attacks makes me a false ret, well darn.
---
Yes very recently. Look for pvp phases
---
^ This guy gets it.
---
The T0 belt, bracer and gloves and T1 belt and bracers are available on the auction house as they're BOE. For some classes they're BiS for non-raiders.
---
We got a time traveler here.
---
I mean look at all these background equations used to jump to the exact day of classic launch.
---
I’ll be happy just getting the names I want tbh.
---
I think blizzard will leave us with no news until like 1-2 days before the release, to simulate the original launch - some people joining immediately on release, others few days, weeks, or even months later. That's also why they don't have any marketing - they will start it after a month.
---
About vacation, aka days off work - I think 3-5 days after release is a bad idea. Because, it will either be weekend 3-5 days after, or the first working days.
---
I rhpught you had to choose between the staff and the trinket? Am i remembering wrong? Its the sunken temple quest from felwood, right?
---
Oops
---
DIE INSECT!
---
What have you been calculating? If you care to explain!
---
Well, leatherworking items are BoE, so you can buy them from someone else if you need them. If youre only going to be casually raiding then buying consumables won't be that much of a big deal. So neither is huge for you. If you just want to make money, then herb/alch is probably the way to go. Skinning is a reliable but not huge income. (Side note: engineering has useful stuff if you're going to PvP a lot.) 
---
For me, I like feeling self-sufficient with professions so I'm going skin/LW on my shaman. But that's more of an RP thing and because I hate searching for and fighting over nodes for mining/herbalism. If you're on the casual end of playing, I'd suggest picturing what "feels" right and going with that. If you aren't hardcore or if you aren't going to spend a lot of time farming for mats or farming/raiding for rare formulas, then professions aren't going to be all that huge for you.
---
&gt;&lt;
---
Exactly the truth. I think the difference only starts to be appearant in WotLK.
---
First ever char was a Dwarf Paladin. I will probably roll gnome mage or nelf Druid
---
Oof man it’s boarder line, but you make a fair point.
---
bc
---
Still, Linen Cloth is so easy to mass farm at level 60 that there's no point in stuffing bank alts full of it for when it jumps up to a whopping 1g per stack for the war effort.
---
Before WoW entered my life I was majorly into EQ, played it for the first 5 expansions.  Some 10 years after I quit I caught wind of a private EQ server that was the original game I had played in 1999, and the nostalgia level that hit may have been more powerful than any I had ever experienced before.  Hearing the music gave me the chills, seeing the landscapes brought me back to the first time I played, and I swear I damn near cried when I saw the Kelethin bank.  Almost like a reflex I thought to myself, "I never thought I'd see this again..." In the same breathe before that moment I never knew how much I cared to be there again.
---
No game ever played a large role in my life than World of Warcraft did, and while I know it would be impossible to live that moment 1:1 ever again, but just being able to reclaim that feeling of exploring the World they created all over again is something special.
---
&gt;they were somehow incompatible with the modern codebase
---
true
---
&gt;were removed because they didn't play well with phasing
---
not really, they were removed because of graphical changes. And, judging by the options we had on demo, the new graphical options are still there. So, hopefully, if they don't manage to integrate it - they will either remove the new features, or give us a choice, but not give up the weather effects.
---
And taking vacation days so you can fly over to greece and be bored on a beach is any better?
---
People take vacations so they can relax and take some time for the things they enjoy. If that this is video games, whats the problem?
---
That
---
&gt;////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
---
sound upon entering STV
---
While it is running on the retail client, they have said there will be a "Classic View" in the graphics settings. I would expect this to be less demanding, but probably still more so than what we played in 2006.
---
I just want to see the Balance Druid stats :Ð
---
How about 21/0/30. You get all the best healing talents, even though you miss the tiny bit of extra healing crit, it's not that big a deal. Then you get pretty much everything good in ret. Also IIRC, don't heal crits proc vengeance? Pretty sure you can favor heal an friend and then judge with vengeance from it.
---
Actually surprised that this haven't been done before.
---
Well done!
---
Nah gotta join the fun!
---
cracks me up how much trash he talks about the night elf male running animation because in 2019 that's literally how blood elf males look when they run right now. Their arms have the same weird hanging posture.
---
Now, the real problem. What is my sister doing in front of a computer that's not her, playing WOW on a private server?
---
Seriously, did you have to photoshop my family?
---
Two days in a row. Elixir of Agility, Mighty Troll Potion, and Free Action Potion did not sell. Almost 20 stacks and not a single sale. :(
---
Sounds boaring.
---
What class are you playing? There is a really good early wand in Westfall that comes from a quest in the lighthouse in the southwestern corner of the zone. 
---
You can go to IF at level 8 and do a few of the quests in Dun Morogh that are on the way to Loch Modan. If you plan on skipping zones, be ready to grind mobs for a good chunk of your xp.
---
Don't just look at the stat - 1 shadow priest per raid, that's it. And that's only after 16 debuff slots and Shadow Weaving is in. The high percentage is probably just to not many people playing shadow priests.
---
I will look for a popular one.   
---
Want to increase the chances of it not dying after the flood of tourists.
---
When I quit BFA I played a classic server for a month.
---
It doesn’t lower hype, damn it...
---
I made a warlock to test some leveling specs for release, I’d play up to level 20.. I had to force quit by deleting my toon at level 40, didnt want to be burned out.
---
Surprised how easy it was to adapt to all the differences compared to live servers. Also surprised how bloody much I still remembered from ‘back in the days’.
---
I rolled horde, but when classic releases I’ll play alliance. It’s where I played in classic and from
---
TBC I’ve been horde. Feels right to end the cycle at home.
---
I don't believe the zones from the demo had weather effects originally, so you can't go off of that either way.
---
Staying a warrior, changing from gnome to human
---
BGs it's almost not a problem at all but in WPVP an ally warlock who doesn't have pvp trinket is at a big disadvantage compared to UD locks and priests with 2 effective trinkets. Plus you'll have a hard time against UD rogues (overplayed class combo) who'll be able to both trinket and racial out of your fear and seduction.
---
ez
---
if ur horde you hop onto the DRAK'GUR'ESH' server
---
if ur ally you simply choose Storm-ford-gard-crest
---
First off I really like the idea so thank you for that. However the numbers are unfortunately skewed by Tips' raid composition that is far from ideal and overall just another disinformative video like most of his content.
---
Obviously raid compositions will vary a lot from the casual guild bringing any player online to the hardcore guild class stacking to the extreme to speedrun content. To each their own, as long as they have fun. That raid composition specifically is *far from ideal* and much closer to the *"casual" mindset*. No hardcore structure is going to bring a shadow priest (heal priest with shadow weaving is a thing) or an enhance shaman and certainly not 8 mages.
---
In fact, most competitive guilds will run with 12-15 warriors and 5-7 rogues, especially in the early stages of Classic before casters start scaling. The norm for these groups that really want to push the DPS is more 1-2 warlocks, 3-4 mages and 2-3 hunters. As far as supports go, you usually only have 1 heal druid, 2-3 priests and 5-6 shamans. That would be the typical raid composition you see in the top guilds right now, with warlocks and mages growing in popularity during the AQ40 stage.
---
So overall I think your research is interesting for people that aim to play in a casual and relaxed environement or even PUG, but it does not accurately represent the ideal raid composition that you see run by competitive structures.
---
Shadow priest going to be rough til zg patch I think it was with the added debuff slots. Really can't do anything til then in a raid environment unless you have some auts healer/ shadow vuln upkeep build.
---
Regardless of what you do with that shiny trinket, everyone is going to know that you got it. Even if you don't equip it, you have received a piece of loot for that slot in that raid. You're not going to be getting another one. By selling it, you're only hurting yourself in the long run.
---
Umm...it was his mom’s character. 6 yr olds are great for leveling! Boars ain’t going to kill themselves!
---
Also no payment for lvl 40 mount, which actually makes the epic one even easier to get..
---
I don’t know about paladins, but I can’t wait for my warlock mount quest.
---
Yup. Beautiful!
---
Alliance Druids Interested in raiding responed this: https://i.imgur.com/7WjtpKo.png
---
I like how your tldr is twice as long as the top text lol.
---
I’m assuming he said it’s bad to level which is ridiculous.
---
No downtime, good damage, VERY hard to die, good for pvp.
---
How often do you need to "melee" as a hunter?
---
I know this looked like a shit post but I honestly wanted some thoughts. I never really thought about the itemization and that does seem like the biggest challenge for the classes which makes sense because as the game progressed Blizzard tuned their gear to fit healing roles which they are better suited for to begin with.
---
Ooh I am so glad they changed troll females, as someone who plays them I could have never taken them seriously. They look so goofy with that run lmao.
---
Thanks guys!
---
That ink and paper look pretty fresh to me...
---
The thing you have to remember about leatherworking is that not only that  LW is not terribly popular but also that the specializations are also rarer. Tribal LW is the most popular, so if you pick up elemental LW or Dragonscale, your unique patterns will be even rarer. Dragonscale LW has the added benefit of producing Mail Armor which not only creates a few extremely good pieces of Armor but also lets you create the Mail resist gear for AQ/Naxx.
---
According to the survey, yes!
---
37 people answered priest, primarily DPS and interested in raids.
---
At the same time there are 119 potential guilds to form from the respondents, so 119 potential raid spots. 
---
However, since there is competition for priest healer spots, im sure the reality will be quite different...
---
Casters in general do well in AV, warlocks included. 
---
Warlocks do well in AB as flag defenders, as you have a pet to help you protect the flag if you get CC'd. They do well in team fights, too. 
---
They are good midfield defenders in WSG and will have a spot in premades. 
---
In wpvp, warlocks are very challenging to kill while leveling assuming you are near the attackers level. Voidwalker sacrifice and a healthstone gives you a big health advantage while your dots are ticking. You can keep a soulstone up for extra fighting power. It's not uncommon for pvpers to see a warlock and decide to pick a fight with someone else. 
---
At 60 it just depends on gear and numbers. You're not going to 1v2 a warrior and priest, but a warlock could win any evenly matched fight.
---
It looks like 16 debuffs and 1.12 talents are looking the most probable at launch. 
---
Also the competition from Priest - Healers will create a different reality than the survey suggests of course.
---
What's the best profession to go with tailoring (I want to make bags).
---
The way I understand the release schedule, I expect we'll have the old Silithus, and the updated one will come with the AQ patch. But maybe I read it wrong.
---
Best for what? A gathering professional will allow you to make more money by selling on the auction house. Bags aren’t really helped by another profession.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6JM-LdRAeU
---
Assuming it drops on a Thursday my guild will be in MC four times in four weeks. So we'll do it.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
I'm no classic expert at all, so I need to rely on more experienced player's for this kind of knowledge. I could always replicate the research using your guild comp, but as you said it's more to tickle the curiosity than anything decisive. 
---
I'm having a though time choosing my class, so every bit of info helps!
---
I agree, everyone should sit out the first week.
---
&gt; You sicken me.
---
Says the guy who refuses to denounce mass murder. 
---
&gt; Just mask off and start goose stepping you brown shirt bastard.
---
Just because YOU want to enact political violence on your enemies doesn't mean others do. Get help.
---
At what point in the game did Disenchant require a certain enchanting level to disenchant higher level items? Can a level 1 enchanter still disenchant anything in 1.12?
---
Businesses that make more money never use it for things like that. It'll go straight to the ceos pockets.
---
For someone who claims they were making a joke you did a great job of missing mine smh.
---
People will die before wow is released ffs
---
Talents yes, Shadow Weaving will probably be in. As for debuff slots, I do not know. It is such an easy fix that I would expect 8-16 in their appropriate times. You are already adding bosses on a schedule, what's this in comparison?
---
Arathor server was great
---
Just did it too, the no struggle for bags does seem different from what I remember as well!
---
One of my coworkers took a whole 5 day vacation after the launch of one of the Halo games and the servers were down or choppy as hell for all 5 days. Hilarious and devastating. Listen to this guy.
---
Collusion happened in PuG raids without loot trading, this policy just opens it up to people other than the master looter and raid leader getting bribes.
---
Bear in mind though hunters can only have 1 type of tracking active on their mini map. So if you want to track beasts or humanoids then you won’t be able to track herbs/ore.  
---
I’ve leveled hunter a couple times on pservers and the NPC tracking is really useful. When a mob spawns behind you just out of the cameras view you will know about it without having to change camera angles 180 degrees and constantly tab target to see if there are enemies behind trees. It’s a huge convenience that other classes lack and it makes me want to level a hunter just thinking about it.
---
Very thorough and detailed. Thank you for posting this.
---
That's why I thought stacking spell damage and shadow damage would be best so I can DoT multiple people get some form of self-sustained healing and nuke another person down healing myself even more and then finish off the rest of my targets.
---
Yeah! And everyone should do Exploration routes for XP so I can have the mobs to myself :D
---
Enough that you need to keep your weapon skill up.
---
You'll wing clip pretty often in pvp and reasonably often soloing.  You'll also use raptor strike in pvp.
---
Tailoring will hamper your first aid progress, but you can work around it. Grind a level in each zone on humanoids that drop cloth, and you should be just fine.
---
Damn the hype is hard to contain! What am I supposed to do, really?
---
So, maybe I'll just try out if I want to be Tauren Shaman like I was in vanilla or Orc...like today. Just for a tiny, little while...
---
Keep in mind everything is still up in the air until we get confirmation on armor and resistances values, armor shred debuffs stacking, windfury swing reset, etc... 
---
Nobody can say for sure what the meta will become, I'm just giving you an idea of what the meta looks like on current private servers to compare with Tips' suggested comp but nothing is set in stone obviously.
---
Same here but to a Druid. 5/8 T1 in one night.
---
It's beautiful.
---
Upvoted just for the title
---
Well, as far as Revantusk Village and Thorium point go, for example, they're expected to be in the game. For one, it would be kind of stupid to not have it at launch, and two, the flight point doodads were in the demo world.
---
Silithus might be a different story though, since it's pretty much tied to AQ.
---
Thought about that too for a second, but The Division 2 is scratching the itch fairly well...but with guns!
---
Offhand
---
Lucky. One of my originals was hacked way back when, I think at the tail end of tbc somewhere around 2008. Long story short I got the account back in Legion I think, but my original rogue was long gone. I guess they somehow transferred it to another account?
---
I think 80 was when you started requiring more than 1 skill to DE.
---
Yeah I agree. I just wanted to give another perspective on this as well. Practicing dungeons can be a good thing in the long term.
---
That’s 4 days 16 hours in a week. Highly doubtful 40 of you will be 60 by then. And again, you’ll be with several other warriors. I mean, best of luck and all but it’s just not realistic.
---
Really cool idea! I had it written out when I was leveling a Hunter, but the image makes it a lot more readable! Will make something like this too!
---
If you play 16 hours a day for 4 weeks at least 1/40 of you will die probably
---
it just dropped u off among the raptors in a slightly different spot
---
and i mean the outside cave part that leads up to the instance, not a separate instance entrance
---
Looks really cool. Isn't AI rank 1 a level 2 spell?
---
Would that pc even run vanilla?
---
I mean, vanilla wow looks bad now, but it was head and shoulders above mmo graphics in 2004.
---
You might limp along at the lowest possible settings \*if\* you can even launch it.
---
Do you have a 64 bit os?  They weren't standard in 2014, let alone 2004 (if they even existed then?).  
---
Also:  What version of direct X did wow require in legion?  Will your hardware support that?  Unlikely.
---
To put it in perspective, I'm using a 2011 notebook \*just\* for running discord (not letting them get their grubby little facebook-lite hands on all my traffic data) and it struggles to run much more than a 64bit os, a web browser, and  discord.
---
contact support, what happened with me, was I had 2 accounts on my old account, wow 1 and wow 2...they were not linked together. Give them the name of your char and as much description as you can. I wish you luck, hes out there. Go find him!
---
Share it brother hunter
---
They telegraphed their entry by stopping to fight the guards at the entrance and generally played kinda like the Keystone Kops. Enjoyable video though!
---
Too soon!
---
Can you just 10 man any dungeon by that logic?
---
But even with this, wouldn't you want to gear more casters for the future in content that wont be hard anyways? Instead of bringing the melee of which most wont be getting gear due to how many of them are on the run.
---
That’s nice! Think I’m gonna make one for my priest.
---
In PvE, while leveling, occasionally, in dungeons, you really only use melee as a last hit if your group is trying to move fast (ie. you just want to close the distance before it dies, so you can start hitting the next pack earlier), if a mob is running away, towards you or you pull threat, sometimes purposely  if the tank dies.\\
---
In PvP, all the time. Every melee is trying to get you in melee and every caster is trying to deadzone you. You need to be able to decide constantly midfights whether you can just finish an opponent in melee, or you need to Scatter Shot, FD trap and range some more.
---
Don’t for AV ammo
---
I've tried for years. They shut it down every time. I guarantee they could get it back to me, but they just don't care. Like how tf does someone transfer my rogue off my account to another account, without that other account being registered to me? And then they don't help me in recovering it.
---
Yes.  In caster form entangling roots/moonfire root rotting it.
---
If you try to face tank it, you're going to get wrecked.
---
Nice idea.
---
10 I would say, theres a few quests for green items at that level including Hogger, then when youre heading up you can do the level 10 elite quest in Dun Morogh as well to help you gear up a a bit.
---
Does that PvP 10% discount stack on the reputation 10% discount?
---
I like this a lot I always end up trying to make a note of when I get what skills so I don't waste time going back to a capital
---
try now!
---
You could also increase the intensity of the weather effects with console commands.
---
Are troll hunters higher dps than night elf? They have bow specialization and berserking whereas night elf only has slightly higher agility.  
---
I’m seriously debating on horde or alliance but I need some reason to push me over the edge.
---
Well, I will most likely be at work in those days so it's not like I have a choice.
---
I'm not the kind of no-lifer that jeopardize work for Warcraft classic.
---
Not at launch at least. If the game screws me over after that, I can't tell.
---
Guess those thorium arrows are made by eng prof? Can I use it without being eng?
---
I've just now noticed that fireblast is a hand covered in fire and not just some weird shaped fire.
---
Priests having a hard time doesn't surprise me. Especially on Horde it appears that Shaman will be stealing Healer spots left and right.
---
On top of that, people learned how healing works over the decade. Back when I played in late Vanilla / early TBC it wasn't uncommon that people wanted to heal, but didn't know how to setup their interface properly. 
---
Nowadays players know about addons that make your life as a healer so much easier, so the entry barrier isn't as high. Even in Wrath I remember people in pugs asking "which group do I have to heal", because the idea of setting up a Raid Ui didn't even cross their mind (and why would it, no one tells you and the Blizz UI doesn't change on its own).
---
I dropped a ticket on their website, let's see if I can get my vanilla hunter back.. would be quite cool
---
That's fucking amazing dude
---
I always keep checking a website to see what spells I'll learn next but now I got this
---
In lighter news, I like where your heads at as well as your guild. I too will be playing/leveling at that pace. Any chance you’re Alliance and in need of a mage?
---
I think there will be only be one RP-PVP server at launch so I will choose that one.
---
Yup and it sucks. If you mess up now you can't ticket it. Bliz is saying they don't want to have any interaction on tickets anymore basically. They are getting lazy.
---
\~So awesome! Wish someone would make this for rogue.
---
You've spent minutes on your replies thus far. Enjoy kidda.
---
Engineers couldn't make arrows until wrath, I think you traded the crafted boolets for them in Ironforge.
---
Sounds like old blizz? You know they would fix loot mistakes via GM ticket in vanilla right? This is definitely not "old blizz" lol.
---
what is this horse spell mages have?
---
on a serious note, in reality mount wouldn't cost 100g more like 90g.
---
Officially for the first time since launch Blizz is taking the "fuck you" stance on loot mistakes. A little disappointed to say the least. But hey! #negativechangesaregoodnowwhathappenedtonochanges?
---
Is this legit? Do you have a guide for this? Or any reading material?
---
I dunno, on last huge pserver our guild was desperate for reliable tanks and we were often short of them - and that's with huge pop
---
Anyone who tanks 5mans well is probably gonna find it fairly easy to get a guild I should think
---
You can buy it immediately at level 1, but most people don't have any money until level 2.
---
The word "boar" sounds wrong to me after that video.
---
I recommend watching people on youtube like studen albatros
---
Make this for all the classes please.
---
Wanna do one for pallies for me lol? Itd be interesting to see one that also only highlights skills that are mecessary.
---
If that was the only person on your ignore list or your regularly cross reference it for name changes... And who ignores every troll, some people just remember them... This is like 3% of a solution to his problem lol.
---
'Bout time someone figured this out. 
---
Gooolllllyyyyy maaaannn...... 18058...
---
Very helpful and novel- saving this for sure!
---
I feel like if you want to main/offtank in raids you have to build your own guild. You have to look at this from two sides.
---
I personally would be very cautious to ever join a raiding guild again, that doesn't have at least their main tank in the leadership core. I raided with both types in Vanilla/TBC. In vanilla our GM, raid leader and main-tank was the same person, this guild never had any tank drama and progressed well. The TBC guild did *not* have their tanks in the officer core. There was tons of tank drama in that guild.
---
If you really want to tank raids then be a founder. Be one of the 10 initial players of a guild with long term goals and make sure that you communicate your intention to main-/off-tank.
---
If you join a guild that does not have their main or off-tanks then ask yourself why first. Check the specs and playstiles of their officers/leaders. It might very well be that these players didn't start a guild with the right mindset.
---
Wow, you got triggered. My statement stands, missing pay to play any kind of game is dumb as fuck. Dont do it.
---
I think so yes. Just like everyone will tell you, pick the class/fantasy that speaks to you!!!
---
Hope you dont speed burn out and be force back to the modern p2w loot crate bullshit that is every game coming out lately.
---
Why would you use anything but the highest level thorium ammo? The price difference does not really exist in practice. 
---
Price for 10 stacks
---
17.5dps Thorium = 20 thorium bars + 20 dense stone
---
16.5dps AV ammo = 6g -20% discount = 4g80s
---
13dps lvl 40 ammo = 1g -20% discount = 80s
---
In most cases, thorium ammo will be cheaper than AV ammo. And the difference between the level 40 ammo and thorium makes them not worth it. Basically, only ever use the level 40 ammo if you can't get the thorium ammo. Hunters really ought to have ammo on their bank alts, so every mailbox can resupply them if necessary.
---
Today I learned... wow
---
You need leather to make certain bags. Ex. Runecloth bags require rugged.  So skinning is nice for that and making extra coin in general.
---
Yep, there’s no 5% friendly discount in Vanilla though. The only reputation related discount is the flat 10% from honoured. TBC introduced the increments of 5% discounts.
---
450g total
---
Yeah, that seems to be it. He even talks about it earlier in the video but I didn't make the connection. Thanks!
---
Although if they do the phases properly, Rune of the Guard Captain and Maelstrom won't be available for awhile.
---
Calm down agenda man.
---
Tailoring uses the occasional item from various other professions, so there's not really a best choice.
---
If you have a set roster of players from the get go and these players want to stick to mage from MC to Naxx then of course you'll bring them and gear them for future content and that's not an issue, but early on they will perform poorly simply due to the limitations of their class. Most raid groups will be fine with that because, as you said, it's easy content anyway and it's not a big deal to have a slightly slower weekly clear.
---
The thing is, even with just blue dungeons gear, Warriors output way more DPS than casters so competitive guilds will still want to run with a lot of Warriors even if that means they'll have to share a lot of the upgrades and gear up slowly over several months. It's very common for warriors that don't rank up for PvP gear to step into AQ with a few blues still but that's not really an issue, they still output a ridiculous amount of damage.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that Warriors in the horde will mostly be orcs and will spike massively with Deathbringer, an axe that drops from Onyxia. Now Onyxia has a shorter reset time of 5 days and is easy enough to split your roster in two 20 man squads and still kill her before her first flight, so you'll gear your Warriors with Deathbringers fairly quickly. And lastly, thanks to windfury totem 2H DPS Warriors are very competitive on the Horde side so that's another source of weapon upgrades to gear up your warriors.
---
Gear in vanilla comes very slowly compared to retail for obvious reasons (3 drops per boss for 40 players, a lot of them poorly itemized and disenchanted right away) so you better be content with your blue gear and not too hungry for upgrades, it's a marathon.
---
The game was brand new in those days, and there were many stages of "the alpha" (and alpha/beta testing didn't work like it does today anyway; people actually tested the game back in those days). This alpha was the very first F&amp;F alpha, was seen by very few people, and it was barely playable anyway.
---
On pservers healers are way overpopulated, tanks are REALLY rare.
---
Also we take more dps warriors now than in vanilla so that is why there is easier access
---
What am I looking at here?
---
I understand where you are going with this. However, I think the major flaw is that in these polls you do not have information on faction. Therefore, Druids and priests are split between both horde and alliance which throws off the numbers a bit. 
---
The fact that you left shaman off this list tells me you are looking at it from an alliance perspective. So in this case the paladin numbers are correct but the priest and druid numbers should be cut in half, because half of the people in the survey will be rolling the opposite faction. 
---
Or do I have this wrong?
---
The internet is fucking ruthless. Jesus.
---
I'd never heard the term "Ninja Pull" before so I googled it but I'm seeing a bunch of conflicting opinions on what this means.
---
What do you mean when you say ninja pulling? I see people saying it means pulling before your group is ready to engage (leeroy style), pulling an entire room/dungeon out of spite to wipe your group before abandoning, aggroing extra adds unintentionally mid-combat, a DPS player pulling before the tank due to impatience, or doing a 'sneaky' pull with good CC management.
---
The last one obviously isn't what you're talking about (or probably anybody ever) but any of the other 4 sound plausible to me.
---
It's probably a regional/server thing but I've never heard the term before so I'm curious what it means.
---
Are there mining ores or herbs in high-level dungeons that can be mined during a run if one has mining or herbalism?
---
Yes, and I would do so again, all to annoy someone like you.
---
if you like to roll dots in bg. its Alliance for you as warlock. As Horde you focus more on curses and controll, since Alliance have 2 magic dispellers.
---
Shards though
---
&gt; Druids are thought of to "guaranteed a spot", but the survey shows that there are more people interested in raiding rolling druids than will ideally be brought to raids
---
One of the Druid raid spots could very well be an offtank feral druid. It doesn't help the ferals in that regard because the tank spots are limited but it helps the healers.
---
But yeah your data seems to be in line with the pserver vibe. Druids became more popular than they were on retail vanilla.
---
However I expect these numbers to be heavily skewed towards utility classes. I expect Tanks and Healers to be more common in Classic than in retail vanilla, but not as much as these surveys indicate.
---
I've been using, https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spells=7.11#0+1+2
---
Hunter is so good during BGs. No one want to fight you. You have a good matchup vs all the class :)
---
I cant wait to build all my toons on launch day. I want to do everything *right* this time. I'll get my professions at level 5, use every ability in my toolkit to my advantage, and be the person helping people through dungeons, rather than the noob i was, chainpulling with my pet in gnomeregan.
---
i really like this, can we get more classes ?
---
I've been saying this as far as "What's gonna happen after Phase 6?" is they will hopefully give content that fits the scope of Vanilla much like Jamflex has done with OSRS
---
I make my own schedule so I'll just work extra the week before up til day of, then start again when I feel like it
---
No, simply due to the experience of private servers end game. If you even slightly deviate from the meta, you will see a large amount of toxicity. Strangely, a lot of it on the Alliance compared to the Horde.
---
Well, first of all, I'm impressed you took that much effort to answer. And I agree, there is plenty of time to gear the casters. But for a guild that doesn't care about speedrunning mc, I think they wouldn't be changing their raid comp depending on when casters start being good enough, and instead just have them on the runs to get gear. 
---
Ofc having just one caster that needs the loot per run is enough, but I don't think most guilds will be doing it that way.
---
Do Rogues still have the capabilities to stunlock like shown in World of Roguecraft? I know the series was during mid vanilla and a lot of things got changed/reworked before 1.12.1. They still have a stunlock obviously, but is it still as extreme? And if it's not, what exactly has changed to prevent this?
---
because p-server 'professionals' love to spend misinformation. For example tips out with his 1k dps mages. Mages elevate each other once you are out of the fire immunity raids (MC/BWL) as the target only gets 1 ignite debuff and all mages contribute into this one debuff
---
Which is a double edged sword just FYI. It can result in a mage wide dps stop to let the old ignite debuff die/run out to avoid aggro problems if the mage who owns it is pushing too far up on the old threat meter
---
I honestly wonder what one would look like made in the live game... I imagine significantly less interesting
---
Not taking my PTO for this, but imagine being an adult with a job that doesn't have paid vacation. Lmao.
---
Haha yeah, the grind feels so rewarding in both games.
---
Nice white knight skills you have there
---
not to stomp on some shadow dreams. But people always forget that shadows eat imp shadowbolt stacks. So they don't produce a full 15% warlock dmg increase as they dip into the warlock inherit 20% increase...   
---
On a raid dps basis the additional debuff slot and the baseline lower dmg output is not worth the lost dps slot unless you have more than 8 warlocks in your raid (and even then only until they have a high enough crit rate to ensure that they keep imp shadowbolt permanent up)
---
I would love to see this for each class. Could you do Priest next PLEASE???
---
Yeah. I know all of that. I remember on live a frost mage crit the egg keeper in bwl with his first hit and that thing just flew across the room and smacked him through the wall.
---
Hi, /u/patdabberos
---
I appreciate your model of the data. A very interesting take.  I think your assumptions are generally sound.
---
And yet we rarely saw this on live or in pservers for healers at least.  I wonder if there’s something that isn’t accounted for (such as healer burn out and turn over), if this time it will be different, or if this is just an inappropriate sampling that doesn’t represent the population.
---
It won’t change what I plan to play, but it is very interesting to say the least.
---
You can’t solo theatre of blood without a thousand hours of practice. You need perfect movements. Only a 1-2 people have done it Solo. Game content is restricted by engine.
---
All the ones that you mentioned. Its a broad term for pulling when you are not supposed to
---
Hopefully we get some addons to help us blacklist people!! It’s 2019! Ain’t nobody got time to mess with ninjas!
---
Also wondering about paid realm transfers!
---
Exactly! I hope classic takes this direction
---
have fun farming 34-44 one handed melee weapons for such a raid comp
---
This is the non toxic version of the same video. Pepega
---
Yeah but the content eventually ends. Something new has to come In it’s place to keep the player involved
---
Yeah, there’s only enough content here for a 1 hour podcast.
---
Fits life as well. I created my first sandwich at Age 12.
---
As you stated this has weeknesses, the biggest of which seems to be that only tips and his crowd to stack a raid in such a way. It would be interesting to see what the numbers look like by grouping based on roll and valueing all dps as equally viable to fill that slot, same for healers.
---
My wow buddy made a video like this in 07
---
https://youtu.be/jssFYIMI6fM
---
Haha. I assure you Classic dps is much more in depth than it appears once you’re deeper consumes/threat etc. eg: threat bouncing with bop/invulnerability pot.
---
Ah okay - so they’d made changes rather than removing as some comments led me to believe. Which makes much more sense. Thanks!
---
The numbers you are pulling here are very much pserver specific IMO. Also you are talking specifically about server first kind of guilds, which are rare even amongst raiders.
---
First we need to define what the bulk of the good guilds will be. Guilds that will clear all content and have a schedule that is manageable by working people. Like 2 events per week, consumables *ready* kind of guilds. This is still pretty hardcore compared to most players but were not talking a server first / speed run kind of style here.
---
I expect good guilds to form more balanced compositions with long term goals and gearing in mind. For example bringing that many Warriors but so little Mages/Warlocks has a negative effect in the long term, since caster DPS will catch up in AQ/Naxx and even surpass Warriors at some point. And these are the raids were things actually matter. Pservers are so heavily populated that you can plug people in and out of guilds much more easily. This was not the case for most retail vanilla servers though.
---
I agree, I think most guilds will be very open to a large variety of DPS classes and favour the social aspects of raiding while class stacking will only happen in the most hardcore structures anyway so no reason to worry for 99% of the players. My point was just to correct this scuffed "ideal raid composition" from Tips's video.
---
Add him to your ignore list with a note, problem solved
---
Yes please! Pm me if you put it together!!;
---
Agreed. It just comes down to what your guild and your own min max levellers are. Personally, I live with my partner and work full time so hardcore raiding is a thing long past haha. Bring on the offspecs imo
---
And blink is a dwarf looking to the left
---
Encouraging people not to be dicks is white knighting?
---
That's a very incorrect assertion you're making. Stop spreading this nonsense.
---
https://www.nola.com/crime/2019/04/online-trolls-hijack-scientists-image-to-attack-katie-bouman-they-pick-the-wrong-astrophysicist.html
---
BC pre-patch aka 1.12 aka the version we're geting
---
It was announced two years ago, and I’m sure they’ve been developing it even a year before that
---
You don't have a clue what you're taking about. https://www.nola.com/crime/2019/04/online-trolls-hijack-scientists-image-to-attack-katie-bouman-they-pick-the-wrong-astrophysicist.html
---
No. Not this.
---
Pm me if you do! My girlfriend would love it.
---
You can argue the semantics of MS&gt;OS but you and everybody else understand the intention behind it. While MS&gt;OS may not have been a standard concept in Vanilla, rolling for your role absolutely was.
---
While you're making a case for your linguistic loophole everybody else will be deciding that you're a selfish player who is trying to exploit a system based around good faith and mutual respect.
---
It won't be a long-term or recurring issue because people will choose to avoid you in future. If I ever grouped with you and you were tanking yet rolled against the priest healer for some healing gear I'd immediately add you to my "don't do content with this asshole" list.
---
Which is absolutely not an issue since even with blue weapons melees will outperform casters throughout all BWL content. It's certainly a slower gearing process but vanilla WoW is not all about gear, it's a team effort and most people are content with a few blue pieces.
---
They will literally do that with the other system as well.
---
Yes. You will get 20% off. 
---
These discounts can also make your mount 20% cheaper.
---
Yes. A mount is 1000g. With a 10% rep discount it is 900g. With a pvp and rep discount it is 810g on private servers.
---
Afaik glancing blow chance is fixed %40 in classic. However with 315 skill you do like %99.3 glancing blow damage. Someone correct me if im wrong
---
You should put the total cost for each level somewhere.
---
i know 1 person doing it doesnt matter overall but still, if you want to play completely solo you can do 99% of content in osrs which is awful for an mmo. i like osrs but i play it like i play farmville, not wow.
---
my overall point is that letting the playerbase vote on changes is awful. it necessarily leads to the game becoming more casual / accessible and adding content that is completely out of the games original feel/ vision.
---
people hunger for content. theyre not going to say no if the devs are like "do u want this amazing new dungeon or not even tho it gives free epics and looks like shit?" Its content and people think short term, not about the overall effect on the game.
---
id be down for classic to go down 2 paths . 1 is completely no changes that cycles every 4-5 years , 2 is like classic but osrs style. everyone benefits.
---
Agreed, I also think most guilds will carry their casters throughout all raids for them to eventually pop off in the later stages rather than plug in new players.
---
My point was just to contrast a more casual raid composition with the typical *hardcore* composition that obviously only concerns a small minority of guilds.
---
Doesn anyone else see pyroblast having a dragon spitting it out?
---
I’ve looked at the math behind it, and weapon skill does very little for ranged weapons compared to melee. The difference is &lt; 1%. That difference could literally be made up by having a paladin on your team that casts might on your pet that the horde can’t get. 
---
I would suggest playing on a pserver both races to see which one you like animations, zones, etc for.
---
Nani?
---
Yes. Pservers run on 1.12 and you can have a disenchanting alt
---
Might try this with my TBC warrior. Thought he was long dead, I'll give it a shot!
---
You are aware that we are not getting the 2.0.1 rage normalization. 
---
The state of nos and other p-servers using the nos code for warriors had the 2.0 rage generation. In other words warriors in our classic servers will produce rage based on dmg dealt not normalized on hits/crit/glance regardless of the actual dmg of their hits and just based on attack speed.
---
The p-server BiS leather/mail lists leave them with high hit, but hitting like wet noodles and with that massively underperforming thanks to low rage. Aside from an execute phase they are no where near that high up in a dps performance before they are rolling massive attack power on them as well to get that rage coming in
---
Personally, I want to get ahead because one of my goals is to make A LOT of money. Getting higher lvl matts before everyone else is going to help me do that
---
The gear looks way better on horde but I prefer the alliance zones. Decisions..
---
Keep trying, they will give it back.
---
Blizzard support are excellent with account related stuff.
---
Yes, but it's not as good on Druids as it is on Warriors/Rogues because it can't trigger further on-hit effects. Basically for Druids it is about the same as just having additional crit chance or worse.
---
I think the polls have been An amazing social experiment. You’d be surprised how many times the player base has voted against increase xp rates, shortcuts, new enemies with op loot, etc. just now the new skill warding is not going to pass
---
SWTOR has a ranged tank, the Trooper
---
Absolutely as long as the terrain suits it
---
Depends on the patch they're emulating. In early Vanilla, rep decayed like XP on lowe level quests, but as far as i remember, this was considered a bug and fixed some time during Vanilla. I remember, because my then-main priest had done a lot of those rep quests with diminished gain (and consequently low rep levels), and I started an alt that then managed to hit Exalted with Darnassus well before my main had hit it with cloth turn-ins.
---
caving in to the carebears and their whining?
---
/shrug
---
It's not as extreme main factor being Diminishing Returns. I don't recall if heartbeat was around during roguecraft or not but that also plays a roll to some extent as well.
---
I would like a source on that, please. I don't see any reason why we would have an arbitrary 2.0.1 rage normalization in a 1.12/1.13 client.
---
Ranged and melee auto attacks run on different swing timers. Great hunters often stand in a position where they can melee one mob and shoot another mob, alternating attacks. During leveling, you can pull one mob yourself and have your pet pull another to take full advantage of this.
---
This is so awesome.  Going to do this with rogue now
---
Mom's a noob, she's using liek a 3 dozer build
---
Yes mainly DM if we're talking strictly dungeons. Both gathering skills can provide a decent amount of profit in certain wings.
---
Most definatly! I understand people who created these characters specifically to stomp low geared people are assholes, but i found the competetive twink scene so much fun, even more so than end game pvp. Ill be using my 60 to farm and boost other twinks for gold to pay for my twink career! Cant wait! See you on the battlefield my friend
---
Yea iirc they were over 100g ea on my server.
---
Did you even read the title?
---
blizz should sue george lucas for copying thunderfury tbh
---
If it’s the same as retail absolutely not, they said they will have some sort of ‘classic’ graphics option you may be able to run on low but I wouldn’t count on it.
---
You will only ever see me in elwynn when I beat up your alliance scum ass!
---
I didn't hit revered darkspear until almost level 50 despite being a troll myself due to lack of darkspear quests. Org reputation on the other hand I had an insane amount of.
---
This always gets my attention cuz it looks like my aunt...
---
Arathor-EU? I just remember it as being 90% alliance and most couldn't speak any English.
---
"Ninja" just means doing something unexpectedly ... as a ninja would. 
---
Ninja looting = looting an item unexpectedly
---
Ninja pulling = pulling a mob unexpectedly
---
There's an implication as well that the "ninja" is intentional. So with that in mind I personally only associate ninja looting with your scenario of "pulling an entire room/dungeon out of spite to wipe your group before abandoning". Though you could make an argument that any unexpected pull is a ninja pull.
---
How is Priest matchup againts rogues while leveling? and what about high level?
---
I'm used to play as pally which was difficult for gankers to kill unless they were twinks/higher lvl/a group  but I'm not sure how is gonna work with a cloth class.
---
wtf dude, you spoiled it
---
Eh, half the classes get free high speed movement, and the others get other free stuff.
---
This is gold.
---
Pick the nostalgia. The Tauren starting zone is great and it's fun being a bit hulking minotaur.
---
It picked Druid. I think it’s broken
---
Yup. I forget exactly how much they cost at the time. That was like 14 years ago approximately.
---
I do know they were in the triple digits like you said.
---
Me: i don't know which one i should roll.
---
Also me: *spins wheel until it lands on paladin* ok! I shall roll a paladin! Fate decided.
---
Hey good on you dude! You really rose to the occasion here. It'll be interesting to see if others respond more positively to this.
---
Tryhards to Alliance due to racials.
---
No way I dont take off for release date. I played on both legion and BFA launch and it was relativley smooth. 
---
Of course there will be some sort of hiccups/lag etc. But I have waited 15 years for this to happen and I'm not going to miss out on the first day
---
Hi, forgive my slight off-topicness on Warriors - you said that 
---
&gt; Warriors in the horde will mostly be orcs
---
Now I obviously see the benefit in +axe skill and Blood Fury, but wanting to be a tank, Trolls do perform better on threat generation - how much would I gimp myself if I went for a DPS Troll warr (if I cannot get a tanking spot)?
---
The mmorpg genre is ded, young audience(the main target) changed a lot over the years, they play fornight and apox,   and nothing seems to be changing this, the mmorpgs playerbase are mostly adults with jobs and responsabilities and is hard for them to keep playing, is as simple as that.
---
I’ve never played a mage in all my 12 years but seeing this makes me want to. I’ve always been attracted to them but some other force is keeping me from getting past lvl 3
---
There is no right or wrong way to play the game. Taking 6 months to get to level 40 or 2 weeks to hit 60. Both are 100% valid and require no explanation.
---
It's just a game man no need to act that way
---
Is rank 3 hard to get?
---
Neither do you clearly. The algorithm was developed by Japanese scientists over 2 years ago. The journalism on this incident is sad to say the least.
---
Its used by internet white supremacists now a days. Its in their sweets and posts lol. I know it started as a dumb trolly joke by the alt-right, but it is a thing now. Like any meme, it circulated and is now a symbol of the alt right.
---
Now someone tell me what spells to take so I can afford a mount
---
ur dick small as fuck boy
---
I was a NE Warrior that mostly tanked. This time I might roll horde still be a tank but be the main one this time. Had no confidence back then.
---
group portal to capitals
---
Thanks for your thoughts. 
---
The sample is r/classicwow, so it's probably a bit skewed towards the more tryhard or dedicated fan base. Otherwise there is plenty of variables left unaccounted for, but you do what you can with what you got!
---
My brother just told me the same thing. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
---
Yeah not getting Mark of Tyranny would be almost a crime here, since it is BiS forever when tanking. It will basically never be replaced.
---
Gnomish Battle Chicken has to be mentioned as well for dps. And you'll be upgrading your DPS trinkets in raids.
---
Will the AV ammo be available before AV is released in phase 3?
---
OMG, i have been searching this video for over 9 years. I watched it first time during vanilla and showed to friends also. Thank you, thank you 😀
---
You know we all will be spamming the login button though...
---
The level 20 conjure has a cow on it
---
Shame it's TBC and not Vanilla. But still a good watch. You never see anything like this anymore.
---
As ridiculous as it sounds [BfA is the fastest selling WoW expansion](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/battle-azerothtm-becomes-fastest-selling-world-warcraftr). They make all their money on expansion sales and microtransaction and as long as it’s profitable they’ll keep making expansions. To be completely frank with all the microtransactions available I wouldn’t be surprised if WoW is more profitable now than it was at its peak sub count.
---
Mana works in mysterious ways.
---
Back during TBC when my account was hacked they did a restore...twice.  everything I had I received double of.  That included gold and all BoE items.  I ended up with a second Orb of Deception which allowed me to sell the second for quite a healthy profit and purchase my epic flying.
---
I don't think you have to invite people to fight in Hillsbrad.  It will happen anyway. RIP anyone trying to quest at the farms.
---
If you simply look at rolls this is the results:
---
https://i.imgur.com/hXriSVv.png
---
As you can see, tanks are overrepresented, but healers are fucking spot on man, interesting. So I guess it falls on the tank wannabes to DPS while they wait for a tank spot and it all works out!
---
I have PTO waiting for release day. Hour long queues will not crush my hopes!
---
Must suck to be you. I can take any time I want off as long as I give a solid two weeks notice.
---
How people choose to spend their "vacation" time is really none of your concern. If someone wants to take vacation to knit blankets for 7 days strait and that's what means the most to them then why hate ? Were all stuck working are asses off the grind is brutal. No right or wrong way to "vacation" if said vacation is what makes you happy
---
LOL it picked mage three time in a row, not even kidding.
---
Still rolling Drood tho.

Dense stone was actually a bottleneck in live iirc, and often was 20g per stack iirc, though that might have been BC prices when sharpening stones still worked.
---
I think the issue is that if a guild is looking for a shadow priest, one of the holy priests will probably just do it because it’s fun lol.
---
you got it the wrong way. rage was normalized with 2.0. Nos ran with that rage generation.
---
We won't get it. We will run with the old classic rage generation whereby a fresh lvl 60 warrior with an X speed weapon won't produce the same amount of rage as full BiS naxx farm warrior with a weapon of the same attack speed per swing.
---
Since I intend to go Alliance I filtered every horde reply out first thing :)
---
So Priest numbers are people saying Alliance and Priest.
---
Actually I do, and you still clearly do not.
---
There was not one algorithm used. There were many. They didn't even use one overall process between the four different teams collecting data from 8 different telescopes around the world. They deliberately used different processes so that they could compare their findings together at the end and verify the authenticity of the data. In the end, all results were remarkably similar. 
---
Katie was one of the many many people who contributed to this finding. One of these algorithms, CHIRP, was developed by Katie 5-6 years ago. 
---
It was a collaboration. Don't downplay anyones contributions.
---
Not really, if you have done a small amount of World PvP while leveling and then take a few battlegrounds you will have it by level 40. Just remember that honour and ranks only calculate once a week so you can't "farm up" to rank 3 in a day
---
No, not at all
---
Amazing work with the facial expressions
---
I make 100k a year with 6 weeks of vacation time, which still does not change the fact that taking time of for a FUCKING GAME RELEASE, is beyond dumb.

If we are to go into personal attacks, yes, my life sucks for a variety of reasons, but I make the best of it.

PSA: let that be a lesson for everyone to now [enable 2FA if haven't yet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.bma).
---
My account got hacked as well. All my gear and items got sold, and all gold was transferred. After sending a digital scan of my ID card to Blizzard, my account was returned to me in the state it was prior to the hack (I presume they keep snapshots of their character database, which any good company would). The hack was either during Vanilla or TBC, and maybe before Blizzard released their security token on [June 26, 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20080701090750/http://eu.blizzard.com/en/press/080626-ba.html). The way accounts were hacked was because hackers targeted guild sites and server forums (some server communities ran their own server forum back then, independent from Blizzard). If those sites were breached, the hackers could take over the WoW accounts, because it was very common back then for people to use the same password everywhere (it's still quite common today, but not nearly as much as back then, because the awareness campaigns came later).
---
I was thinking Khagdar.
---
I would be surprised if 50% of the people that intend on tanking get to the point where they are geared enough to tank a raid.
---
Nice i only had to roll 5 times to get rogue.
---
Sorry to let you down.
---
But im playing constantly for 3 years now and it’s not killing even the slightest piece of hype.
---
It‘s even worse, since no private server can give you that feeling of being home like on Blizz Servers.
---
Always thought it was a fiery comet
---
Your the one who started with the personal attacks exalted wise sage. " taking time off for a video game is stupid" threw shade at the mass of people who are planning on doing so" 
---
I'm actually 12 so I still got a long way to go. Maybe one day I'll hit CEO 10k day 6 weeks paid vacation like you !!!
---
Thank you.  Put in all my info but didnt find anything.  Still very cool.
---
They have proven that there will be patches containing raid/dungeons releases, nothing quest like has been announced to be like p-servers
---
What's the 2nd one down at level 16?
---
@19 days played to get to 60. Love it!
---
i cant decide between druid or lock for my main ill play both but which do i main???? lol help
---
+1
---
You need rep to buy them, can't get rep without AV
---
Hopefully they keep it vanilla.
---
Holy fuck please make this for warrior PLEASEEE
---
Duplicitousness is a sin
---
Planning on rolling Horde. Wheel picked Paladin. Conundrum.
---
It will mostly happen in July that is for sure and may be along with FFXIV expac, but heard retail wow mega patch is also in July.
---
Well...my dream of playing a human mage riding a saber will be harder than I realized.
---
If I don’t go to Darn until after finishing Elewyn, will I be screwed on Night Elf rep?
---
The big thing for PvP Hunters is that their BG performance is already super high when hitting 60 with a subpar mishmash of items. They are very gear independand and have high impact right away.
---
Warlocks are more gear depenand in terms of their damage output because they are less mobile and have less range. They are still good, and there are many things a good Warlock can do in PvP.
---
This exactly, 60 PvP scales so much with gear that further into the phases you'll need to be doing high end raiding to compete, while in twink brackets there is a gear cap from the start, and it's far easier to get into in later parts of the game
---
Yeah me too. Fuck.
---
Some of these replies are flat out bad advice.
---
You won't be doing dps because your DPS/mana and DPS in general will be low as fuck.  What you will be doing instead, is battle control.
---
A well timed, hard to spot, offensive dispel is worth thousands of healing or damage.  Some pulls can be completed easier with a mind control, than with tanking and healing.
---
The way old dungeon density and AI works is that for most groups, things will be slightly more chaotic than you might expect.  If you are already at the point where people have figured out the basics, then the most high skill plays like mind-control and such become even more powerful.  This is how you can go from 5 manning 5 man content, to 2 manning 5 man content.
---
No wonder why I blocked that from my memory.  I thought UBRS was bad enough, but running LBRS that many times without any other loot upgrade possibility.
---
Take it with a grain of salt since private servers' simulation tools aren't 100% accurate, but toying with the spreadsheet I found a ~7% DPS difference in favor of orc, using a similar setup and factoring both Blood Fury vs Berserking cooldowns.
---
If you care about min/maxing I would try and make sure with your guild you are 100% going to have a spot as one of the main tanks, otherwise I would go the safer option with Orc since they have both the best DPS and PvP racials while also having some extra threat from axe spec.
---
considering the count for black holes is 0 afaik. So does basically anything.
---
I am! Played a druid when I was 13 might even name him Orcsmasher again haha
---
Do you really think there will be less than 3k people per region ?
---
There will be plenty of servers.
---
And even when there wasnt, that feature is more important and it would be in anyway.
---
Not sure if I see it. Is the reflection his left eye and the lower part of the picture his beard..?
---
She's been playing since vanilla has hundreds of max levels way better player than me
---
Not a huge fan of mage because warlock is similar but also has a pet and can self Rez
---
I've played Warrior half a dozen times on Pservers, I really need try something new and broaden my horizons! 
---
*Spins wheel*
---
 Warrior.
---
Spread the word. Still plenty of time.
---
To try builds with all  gear vendors and instant 60 what private server do I use ? Also which for blizzlike ?
---
&gt;missing pay to play any kind of game is dumb as fuck
---
What shithole are you from where you dont get paid vacation days?
---
Not a bad idea looking at it in an end game kind of way
---
Yea I know the feeling, I farmed the ubrs key there
---
Nothing is set in stone and a beta will definitely shed some light on a lot of these unknown factors. From the information we have available so far it's impossible to guess how the game will change, that's why I'm just speaking from private servers experience and not saying it's going to be the case for sure. Nobody can know for sure at this stage.
---
Wow, 14 years and I just noticed this...
---
You clearly didn't read the thread.
---
I can't unsee the hand now
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/start
---
Try it out.
---
Yea, if something goes wrong a bad healer wipes the group.
---
The difference between a good healer and a bad healer is still very evident in most cases as their mana efficiency will be significantly better.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
none of this matters, if you are a good player you will get a spot, if you are a bad player and you already have a raiding spot you will be replaced with better player.
---
Its not fuking rocket science :P
---
1/9 * 1/9 * 1/9 = 1/729 = 0.00137%, unless I'm dumb.
---
I'd say your fate has been decided, but since you're rolling druid over mage The Wheel allows it.
---
800g\*
---
The discount is on the total amount, not the already reduced amount from honored or pvp rank.
---
Share if you do homie
---
man, y'all got my hopes up.  lesson learned:  don't let your broke ass 20-year old self sell gold and get your account banned.  even over a decade later blizz won't give me back my original toons.
---
&gt; so every mailbox can resupply them if necessary.
---
damn, I never thought about that
---
Mum is hunter 
---
My partner is warlock 
---
So then a good automatic choice is rogue so we all have different skill sets but I'll be playing alone quite a lot so rogue or warlock for me is still relevent outside of playing with them
---
We all are simply playing whatever we fancy
---
My mum has always mained a hunter and is her fav class
---
My partner is new to wow so she's going to have a go at warlock ("because it sounds evil and cool")
---
And I'm going for whatever is most fun, soloable and can make a tonn of money
---
I know if we wanted a skill synergy we'd look something more like Warrior-Mage/Warlock-Priest  
---
But we don't want to play as anything other than what has already been chosen
---
🤷
---
Yeah I think we are on the same page. Intuitively it feels like an efficient 5 man group clearing dungeons should be more exp than a solo grinding non elites.
---
See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) for answers to any questions like this.
---
We don't know, but from what was suggested at BlizzCon last year (?) it will be a limited version of what's available on private servers. You likely won't be able to use the current ones for 1.12. From what I gathered new functions introduced post-1.12 will be limited, but functions removed since 1.12 will still be removed.
---
Nope. Played a Paladin during vanilla, will be playing Rogue/Warlock for Classic. Couple of different reasons, mainly that I've changed a lot as a person since then and I've gotten used to playing a certain type of playstyle, i.e not healing, and thinking back on it I feel like I was a lot more patient as a kid and I wouldn't enjoy the vanilla gameplay that Paladins have to offer anymore, I might have one as an alt for old times sake but don't think it's for me anymore.
---
Got any useful guides for good grind spots once you get to the blizzard kite hype train?
---
Cannot recommend watching that show enough,  those monologues are so good. This hit me right in the feels I love this show almost as much as I yearn for classic. I quit playing retail in WotLK so it's been a long time waiting for this moment =) can't wait!!!
---
This is really solid advice. I had never really thought about but I definitely picked my servers based on how 'Horde-like' they sounded.
---
Assuming you are PvP specced you have Blessed Recovery which is on average about a 10-15% physical damage mitigation talent. If you are Shadow as well you're getting another 15% in Shadow Form.
---
In terms of abilities against Rogues: Psychic scream is very powerful but weaker against UD Rogues. Blackout proccs are super powerful, especially as a Troll priest but dimished vs. Orc Rogues.
---
Generally speaking if you have a good amount of health and mana, your shield is not on CD and you are PvP specced then you can beat Rogues in a 1v1, especially as a Troll shadow/hybrid.
---
Personally, I didn't care for the elitist theme but you definitely over cringed with memes last time. That's way better now. Maybe it would be good if you left memes that lasted less then 3 seconds. The long ones were really breaking the video imo.
---
Played human warlock in vanilla, this time however I've decided to inflict severe pain on myself and play human Paladin.
---
Thank you! That puts me in a tough spot, I will not hardcore rush to level 60 in the beginning (no time in august/september), and thus probably not have a guild set in stone at all. I know that Orc is probably better for everything but tanking, but I like the femTroll model a lot more. Thanks, you have given me something to meditate upon ^^
---
People talk about how weak warlocks are early on (mc into bwl), is that just in pve or are they weak early in pvp too?  I know a big issue is their lack of hit and high threat, which isn't an issue in pvp.
---
I'm hoping to gear with a mix of the blue pvp set, bwl gear, and pvp rep gear as it's available.  There's zero chance I'll have the time to push for r13 and I'm going to be less available to raid by the time aq or naxx come out.  At the gear level I mentioned, how tanky is sm/ruin?  Does soul link do enough damage to be worth it?  I'm thinking mostly for wpvp, random bgs, and occasionally some non-tryhard premades. Thanks!
---
Frick yea this post just brought back the itch to go in for round three!
---
is this really a question? don't be a cheap fuck, ur a hunter, u can farm gold so easily....
---
its hunters like you who make all other hunters look bad
---
LOL
---
Blizz has been on a role lately with Classic. Hopefully we get the no sharding announcement next.
---
What resource did you use to make this?
---
Yeah we are a pretty different group and it's fun how at each house rules differ greatly.
---
Does this mean you generally want your worst geared mage to hold the ignite? Pretty interesting.
---
I very much suggest you farm them with a friend regardless of your class. Hunters are obviously best for farming them but duo farming them is your best bet for maximizing g/h, especially on a PvP server.
---
That sounds like engineers make them with an extra step.
---
Hol up
---
When every level meant something
---
FYI, Scorch is also not some weird shaped fire.
---
thanks for the info!
---
Not possible. Minimum 2 weeks to get 40 people to 60.   You can run MC once a week. You won’t get full t1 in two runs. You won’t down mag with only one tranq and an undergeared raid.
---
Sim! Grim Batol como nos velhos tempos
---
This guy is just collecting downvotes but whatever I'm with you man. Why are we expected to accommodate someone else's bad habit? You are very directly telling the rest of the group : "Hey I know we're all doing the same thing with the same goal, but my time is clearly more valuable than yours so why don't you just wait a minute while I do something unnecessary?"   
---
Smoke on the gryphon, smoke while you have someone on follow, hell just straight up lie and tell us you have a giant runny dump you have to squirt out. But don't tell us you HAVE TO GET A SMOKE.   
---
I need one of these smokers to tell me how it is materially or semantically different for the group for you to go smoke rather than just telling us "brb have to stand outside and aimlessly stare at the sky for 15 minutes"
---
While I'm on a rant fuck vapers too. Learn to use push to talk instead of Vadering directly into your mic you degenerate.
---
Paladin and Hunter 3 times each out of 10 spins, finally Warrior on the 11th - settled then.
---
The secret is apparently to roll exactly 23 times before you get your only true calling.
---
The fact were not getting RPVP servers tells me that Blizz is lowballing their expectations. If they were gonna make 100 servers total, (who knows, they may end up having to) then they could easily slot RPVP servers in.
---
The only reason I can fathom them being excluded is that they're planning in the range of 15-30 servers at the moment, and already have 3-5 servers per region, 2 PVPs, 2 PVEs, and an RP. 
---
Idk, Blizzard made the same mistake back in 2004, I could see them making it again. They have to be ultra careful this time, with an expected tourist wave, too. But maybe that's their problem, they think 95% of tourists will leave before level 10, when it's probably going to be closer to 70%.
---
This is nicely done! Excellent work!
---
Ya or be the offtank or fury tank that throws on their tank set when required.  Surprisingly spot on.
---
I would pay to see more
---
I already know I'm going holy pally/mage, but I clicked it and it told me mage =D
---
Sounds good to me. I think I do that. I mean Devilsaur is easy gold.
---
I'm making one for rogues next, if you wanted to hold off. Same exact style as this one.
---
I only played mage for like 8 years and you just blew my freaking mind.
---
Rolled Shaman as an Ally player, thx fam, it helps :)
---
paladins
---
Detect Magic : lets you see enemy buffs.
---
Been on the fence between warlock and druid, I rolled twice and both times it chose druid rofl wtf
---
Interested if you are going to make other wow content, still good video even without memes.
---
&gt;Pretty easy kill at that point.
---
\*MISS\* \*MISS\* \*5\* \*MISS\*
---
Theres a trick here. The minute you click the wheel, you know what you *actually* want to play, and hope it doesn't pick druid or shaman. Just go with that class you hoped you wanted.
---
Almost, you forgot to multiply by 100 at the end since we want percent so it’s 0.13%
---
I mean, I won't be 8/8 after 2 raids.  But after a few months of progress I expect to be at or approaching 5/8
---
Flamestrike took a while for me. Thought the darker shades were just fire streams, and not people burning alive.
---
I think you are kinda missing the point in the other guys post. You wouldn't bring 12 dps warriors because the gear share would be outrageous. Warriors going into aq/naxx with blues still just means that they are getting out dpsed drastically by the mages and warlocks fully slotted. You spent less time in Mc and bwl because of your warrior power house team, and now get screwed by weaker warriors as a whole in the harder raids. 
---
Since Mc and bwl are so easy, you don't bring 12 warriors, balance out your raid group more appropriately, theoretically get better loot coverage, and be more prepared with more quality dpsers for when it actually matters
---
...you learn something new every day, even after 14 years.
---
almost positive they announced 16 debuff slots from the start.
---
With planning and running the right dungeons for gear I was able to have a bis blue set for dps. Grinded rested exp from 59-60 just looking for my gear. I had an amazing set with only 10 hours played at level 60. Faster than most.
---
Thank you kanye, very cool
---
Not quite sure about that. When a new expansion releases a lot of hardcore people will have gold saved up to empty the market of things they need to progress the new raids. But on a brand new server no one will have gold saved up, so market prices will be really low, and there is not really a huge demand for high level crafting mats since there isn't large amounts of players around who want to buy them.
---
C'mon that ones way more obvious.  We all know that the searing pain icon is a hand with fire.
---
A convenient way to go about this is to skill up mining while leveling and storing your materials in your banks. You can also level up tailoring alongside it with a bit of pre-planning so you don't get behind on tailoring/first aid.
---
After you craft your BoP robe you can drop tailoring and get Engineering up. You will still have mining for long term income and to craft your Engineering stuff.
---
However Engineering doesn't require you to have mining. You can also just do Tailoring and Engineering and get money for consumables otherwise, for example by selling bags and later the Bloodvine set (ZG patch). Both tailoring and mining have long term gold value, but mining is more convenient.
---
Velkommen til WoW Classic Norge! Et fellesskap for alle som skal spille Classic! Vi er straks 300 stykker og vi vokser for hver dag.
---
Hensikten med discorden er å ha en felles hub for alle norske spillere. Her kan vi bli kjent med nye spillere, finne folk å spille med, få en oversikt over norske guilds og snakke om alt relatert til WoW Classic.
---
Tre enkle regler:
---
1. Snakk norsk
---
2. Hold det WoW Classic-relatert
---
3. God tone i chat
---
Her er linken til discord serveren: [https://discord.gg/Ud4EqA5](https://discord.gg/8fRvk5W)  
---
Del gjerne linken med venner og bekjente :)
---
Was it in the game? Yes, keep it. No, get rid of it. Retail is easy mode designed for player retention, classic was hard mode designed for a real challenge.  You want to play on the other faction? Join another server, you could spy on players locations in world PvP if they implemented that feature. That would in theory break world PvP if you had major guilds camping world bosses on the opposite faction to tell you when it's clear...
---
Lock is still a pretty decent PVP class out the gate but gets much better as content progresses. Link is really strong for base defense in battle grounds and 1v1s. Your job in organized PVP isn't really to dish out the damage. If premading you'll basically be tossing put curses or defending in AB / chasing or denying enemy flag carries in WSG.
---
I don't think so.
---
/u/Seguren 
---
Any chance you'd do this for other classes? awesome work dude
---
No one can answer that for you here as it's against terms, but if you Google some key words or check out the wowservers subreddit you may find your answer.
---
And they can still do that with a second account. I'd imagine guilds that dedicated would just have one guy do that.
---
If you do make it, please share with your fellow hunters! Thanks!
---
I think the idea is you farm relatively uncontested and save up the high end mats until the population catches up and demand grows for those mats.
---
Make a list of what streamers play on, then play on any of the others.
---
Very well made for a short. I liked many WoW machinimas in Vanilla, but there's so much more possible in 2019. In the old days the average creator didn't have access to tools for full character model manipulation, but relied on in-game /\[insert emote\]. I mean compare [Radim Zeifart (aka Hurricane)](http://www.zeifart.com/)'s work to Myndflame's Illegal Danish series.
---
I feel i wont live up to the same expectations with my main from vanilla. Given the little time I will have today. I won’t come close to the gear and skill of my rogue back then. So I decided warrior to releave that pressure.
---
TIL
---
The amount of gear on your melees will depend on the duration of each stage. If AQ and Naxx are 1.5 years away from release, that's really not an issue and your melees will be as geared as your casters.
---
Again, it's not about raids being easy or not and class stacking being required or not for most people. I'm talking about competitive guilds, running for world first and speedruns as this is how guilds compete on private servers. Raid composition doesn't matter in the slightest for casual guilds.
---
Whaaaaaaaat, these icons close up are honestly blowing my minds. Seeing things I never knew were in them.
---
^ please!!! Would love one for rogue
---
Ok...
---
Nice and clean
---
Oh you’re right I totally forgot about that expansion!
---
/s
---
Tbc made all the specs viable by giving everyone essentially the same tools with a different skin. Every tank gets a taunt and a big cd, every dps gets reliable aoe and a dps cd, every healer gets tools for raid healing, etc.
---
Sure it’s more balanced but the game feels much more like an rpg when everyone has their own niche that only they excel in. (And yes I’m aware that in sunwell shamans were the only healer that could keep a raid alive. There’s a difference between having a niche and just being overpowered lols)
---
if u guys are unsure just go on repack and test abilities on 60
---
I heavily suggest that you and your friend(s) take the time and make an effort to study the Devilsaur pathing and spawn points/rates very well. You can very much optimize your farming routes that way and be ahead of other players in terms of tagging them who don't do this, which is the majority. DS farming is quite competitive especially on a fresh server. Also think about a fallback plan when the zone is heavily crowded. It is better gold to just grind wolves (meat + leather) and bats (vendor + leather) in EPL than farming DS in a crowded Un'goro zone for example.
---
But in vanilla you played a class, not a spec, so there is some merit to balancing by *class* rather than by spec.  You're never more heterogenous than you are in vanilla.  Standard 31/20 specs put you at 60.7% invested into one spec.  As soon as tBC, that percentage jumps to 67.2%, and then 72% by Wotlk.  Cata-present you pick 100% one spec.
---
Oh God. Not I want to play mage.
---
Hi, /u/murdill36
---
There is a ton of them that you can skip, but some of the skippable ones are still useful in some circumstances (like fire or arcane spells, assuming you spec frost, or the ward spells). You pretty much got to use your own judgement. You could more or less level to 60 with just frostbolt, frost nova, conjure water/food, and maybe fire blast.
---
16 debuff slots is in at launch, so I guess I don't need to worry about that.
---
Its one thing to make it easily available for everyone instead of just a handful of dedicated enough players.
---
The government doesnt stop sending people to jail just because a few people dont get caught or break out.
---
They are weak in terms of PvE long term DPS because they are only using a very limited amount of spells. In PvP they are strong right away because they have a broad variety of spells and abilities that are non-gear dependand. That said, they do scale noticeably for PvP with better gear.
---
DM’d
---
dat lvl 12 banana bread
---
Not being able to make both ally and horde on pvp servers was a big deal in vanilla and with how adamant blizz is being on creating a faithful recreation of vanilla it’s safe to assume this will also be the case in classic. 
---
People that want both can always just buy a second account, like they could in vanilla.
---
I think 100 days is optimistic. They would have announced something if that was the case. One can hope tho!
---
I've asked about weather effects and night themes since 2011, they put so little focus on them and its sad. Atleast for BfA they said they had new tech and whatnot but tbh, I played the first few months and saw none of it. 
---
The silence on weather effects have me worried.
---
I’ll love you forever if you make one for hunters as well!
---
So at level 20, you'll have spent 4 GOLD and 2 silver on spells.... Level 20 alone is 2 gold 20 silver. 18 gold 92 silver by level 30. 53 gold at level 40, 114 gold at level 50, and 193.02 at 60.
---
It's not even so bad towards the end, because you have some decent ways to make money. But having 2g to drop at level 20 for skills, after already spending 2g on previous levels is insane. I might consider rolling Night elf for mailbox dancing, or I'll just hang out with Topper McNabb.
---
This was made for warlocks by @actualguy of the [classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF):

Assuming you're leveling as single target frost, your most important levels to go train are 4, 8, 10, 14, 20, 22, 26, 30, 32, 38, 40, 42, 44, 50, 52, and 56.
---
Pretty much always go train immediately when a new rank of Frostbolt, Conjure Food, or Conjure Water is available. Don't bother training less useful abilities like Detect Magic, Flamestrike, Scorch and Fireball until after you have your 60% mount. You can also get by with just training rank 1 for some skills, like Frost Nova.
---
Wrong sub.
---
Actually it was only announced a year and five months ago haha. 
---
I don’t see how you can possibly think OSRS’s success was the catalyst to Blizzard remaking Classic. It makes no sense, because OSRS was successful quite some time before blizzard even supposedly started working on Classic. In fact in 2013, when OSRS was launched, it was already almost on par with Runescape and considered a massive success. 2013 is the same year the “you think you do but you don’t” thing was said at BlizzCon.
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to raid hardcore. I sincerely doubt I'll need to worry about optimal raid dps on non-Naxx content in most cases. I've already raided hardcore in Vanilla way back when. I don't have the time for that anymore.
---
I just don’t see why I have to choose
---
Ah. So more like an investment? Sure, I could see that working out.
---
If this is true then it is a really good way to find out which class is for you.  If you don’t know what you want to go but then try and make it land on one class, that one class is probably for you
---
So whats the point of restricting it at that point?
---
The skills and their costs, every 2 levels. You have to actually go and buy new spells and new ranks of old spells every 2 levels, at a major city, or very few areas in the open world.
---
16 debuffs slots are in from the beginning this time.
---
That would be great! I was considering transforming this into a spreadsheet so you can filter by the abilities you care about while leveling
---
Like how the government doesn't send rich people to jail for laws they break, but if a poor person does the same thing, they are sent to jail. Just because something is a way, doesnt mean it ought to be.
---
We don’t actually know that they won’t do RPVP servers though, their response was just, “we don’t have plans to do them as of yet because we’re unsure how much demand there will be for them.” After they said that, there was a huge demand for it, so I would be shocked if they don’t have one
---
They said 90% of players quit before level 10 during vanilla and TBC.
---
tbc was harder than vanilla
---
Yes, you're wrong. The top drake image should be next to both images to the right.
---
Don't worry about the money young sperg. Become a useless member of society and grind these purps like a true neckbeard.
---
Well for one, making people buy 2 accounts is giving Blizzard more money.
---
And secondly, you shouldn't change a game just because .01% of people will loophole it with another account. It just makes it *less likely* for cross-faction collusion to take place. It will still happen, for sure. But it will be less easily accessible and widespread. Plus, it's nice being able to gank someone without a whisper of "kill yourself noob" from a level 1.
---
Yes, thinking ahead will increase your overall income, but also diversifying. If you just focus on one thing, you'll have less options to react to the server market. Cooking and Fishing are unpopular professions that have huge long term benefits, especially when combined. With crafting alone you can sometimes literally stand next to the AH, buy up materials, sell the gear/consumables/transmutes and make profit that way.
---
For example everyone and his mother will try to make profits with skinning early on because it is super easy to level up and DS leather is so expensive. But the skinners need to fight for their loot in the open, while leatherworkers can literally just log in, buy the leathers, craft the set and then log out for 50% profit *easily*.

Hi OP 
---
I’m not sure if you have heard of the podcast “countdown to classic”.
---
Episode #85 has an hour and a half chunk dedicated to ret Paladin PVP.
---
He’s interviewing a rank 14 ret Paladin that was incredibly knowledgeable. He goes into deep ret PvP and 0/26/25 ret PvP.
---
I can’t recommend it enough for someone that wants to play ret.
---
It added to the hype for me and some friends!
---
Why would they kick you from the dungeon for getting there?
---
I love this image so much!
---
Dustwallow Marsh had that mid-30's goblin spot to add more quests, but would it make sense to keep content like that locked for a year or release it asap? I mean, the raids are locked for similar reasons.
---
Decursing won't work. So a lot of carebear healers are going to complain now that they can't raid and watch Rick and Morty at the same time.
---
The compensation committee, made up of independent board members elected by shareholders, determine CEO's pay. So you've missed the mark a bit. It'll go straight to the shareholder's pockets first and foremost. And the largest shareholders are typically institutions like universities or pension funds. But you're still right that it won't go to more GMs.
---
Rogue is a great class with a huge number of viable builds and does well in any type of content.
---
Cross faction collusion shouldn't be discouraged. Its world of WARcraft after all, not hand holding simulator. If players want to be double agents let them, restricting access to this is simply an example of acti-blizzard overreach that is babying the players.
---
Well done. One of these would be amazing for each class
---
But there's the rub! Assuming a faithful timeline on content rollout, the cloth turnins only became a thing AFTER the original 100% speed mounts were replaced with the armored ones. Before then you had to hit exalted through quests alone.   
---
I would not be surprised if cloth turnins were around from the get-go and I wouldn't hold my breath for the original 100% speed mounts either.
---
Damn thanks a lot for the share!
---
That's what I just said.
---
:-D
---
I honestly can’t wait
---
Trying to get some less competition on launch, eh? Not a bad scheme!
---
It's a saying, maybe it's something I only hear where I live lol, but it means the same thing, "official word".
---
Can you source this please? I do not remember reading about it.
---
As a disc priest from WoTLK, it wasn't uncommon for me to out dps every dps in our group. Sometimes I would compete with mages for top dog slot. My character was heavily geared and the dungeons we're becoming mind numbingly boring, so I would compete with the dps players in the group for fun. When the content is challenging, do not dps as a healer. When the content, is lax because your gear supports it, have fun when you can. Just never compromise your group for a laugh.
---
wasn't Mudsprocket added in TBC or Wrath?
---
I believe Blind got nerfed too, which stopped the indefinite Sap&gt;Cheap Shot&gt;Kidney Shot&gt;Blind&gt;Stealth and repeat rotation.
---
Currently making one for Rogue. Should be done later today.
---
Bad idea. Attracts a certain faction as you say, faction imbalance likely.
---
People like that are going to tear the already fragile community apart before it even has a chance. WoW classic is not just a game for losers who think they are hardcore. The game was constantly mocked back in the day because it was considered a care bear mmo...
---
Cool
---
Think OP means that everyone left the party post-dungeon but you’re still inside and it teleports you outside.
---
I'm not sure how those numbers will hold up, long term. 
---
Healers tend to burn out more quickly than other roles because their gear progression doesn't make overworld progression easier (or faster, I should say).
---
Yes it’s world of Warcraft. You are at war with the opposite faction and you speak completely different languages.
---
A handful of people being able to do a bad thing is better then potentially thousands.
---
You probably dont want live in anarchy just because its equal and fair chances for everyone.
---
It was available in a limited form in late Vanilla. I recently tried to level there as a Horde character. It had about 7 quest and the majority were Elite quests that brought you into very tight camps.
---
I kinda doubt it will be that much of an issue this go around.
---
from my warrior pov most wls were super tanky early on - I guess they were SL. Dmg was fine in a 1v1 - in large scale fights you prolly want more Dmg and less tankyness
---
Shadow guard works exactly like lightening shield (aka it responds to any attack but there's a slight delay on how often it can fire) except it's shadow damage and will be affected by anything that affects or procs off shadow damage.
---
My friends are hell bent on playing on one of the streamers servers and don’t understand how awful it will be. I really don’t want to have to deal with that nonsense and I might just roll on another server without saying anything
---
"Hard"
---
And in a war, there are traitors on both sides and realistically some could speak the opposite language, this is even true in lore. Why do you feel the need to restrict game plays in a way to make it more handholdy? Why not just play retail if you want a handholding experience?
---
r/titlegore
---
It makes me so sad that thottbot is now Wowstar or whatever it is =(
---
I'm tempted to play druid as that was my OG character. I like resto end-game, but is that viable? Can't really remember the details but if like another druid has rejuv on the tank, am I not able to (lol)?
---
Or impose the standard evenly on both parties instead of just the poor. Or remove the standard if you will let rich people get away with it.
---
Now can we turn this into a web app where you can click the spells you want to buy and it will total up the cost? That would be amazing. Project time!
---
It’s amazing how in retail WoW we’re reduced to like 6 skills.
---
I don't even remember. Did Vanilla ever release 10+ bunches of quests after launch? Silithus and Plaguelands had stuff later on, but do players really run out of quests in their 30-40's?
---
Do you plan on getting skills every second level?
---
I agree. ***If*** a class needs to be buffed it should be buffed in the area that makes it unique. A paladin is part tank, part healer, and part dps. Talents may lean him more towards one of the roles but I feel the others should still take part. It's why I like abilities like Blessing of Sacrifice which puts the tanking into healing, or the healing into tanking, or what have you.
---
u/DiligentSyrup
---
You aren't even diligent enough to check which sub you're posting to. What a complete and utter failure.
---
A question for you all that came to mind while I was reading the comments... as a hardcore warrior from Vanilla(Tanked MC/BWL...up to 4 horsemen, first warr to max lvl on Steamwheedle) my experience was that whole guilds would often form around a core group or single Tank and die with their loss.  I got my start on Medivh and it was a long time ago, but I would suggest to anyone knawing on the idea of tanking to go at it full bore and watch a guild or party form up around you.  Vanilla was a time where such zero to hero stories became the best guilds around and i'm hoping it will again.  Does anyone else think the number of successful groups/raids is mostly proportionate to the number of solid tanks available?
---
Question: So for mages as an example, can you have the spells locked behind the seperate specs (in live) all at one time? Like can you cast both ice bolt and fireblast?
---
this is amazing ty for linking
---
This was really enjoyable to watch. I hope in Classic, consumable and buff meta will be more similar to Vanilla than private servers. 
---
We're already a good step in that direction though, if world buffs have cooldowns and black lotuses arent ramped up. Hopefully that nudges the community in a new, or rather old, direction.
---
Troll Berserking is pretty good - go Troll for higher DPS. Cooldowns are fun.
---
But then again, Stealth Hunter ;)
---
You can hurt someone's feelings but you cannot cause them to hurt themselves. Hurting oneself is a personal choice. Every individual is responsible for how they act upon themselves. You cannot blame someone else when you decide to harm yourself, it is still your own choice to do self harm.
---
From my experience playing on you-know-whats, it's a rare issue for a pug raid leader to ninja something. This is probably because they can safely reserve an item they want in return for putting the run together so they have no need to ruin their reputation. Now you'll have to watch out for other raiders hiding their gear and rolling for others or to sell.
---
For reference, MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20 are very easily puggable.
---
And not everyone who says they want to raid will be raiding any significant amount of time. And that also probably varies by class.

---
WoWwiki says the town was added in 2.3, but there might have been something there before that I forgot about
---
Is there really a significant turnover of tanks in raiding guilds?
---
Lol you’re never going to have any constructive conversations if you immediately turn to being condescending when faced with someone with a differing opinion.
---
Yep. I judged a book by its cover and shared my thoughts. Welcome to the internet.
---
I'm really confused by your comments. You say it's WARcraft, yet you should be able to speak with the enemies that speak different languages, and would kill you on sight. 
---
And it's not like wartime defectors, it's hopping on a level 1 to whisper somebody halfway across Azeroth about how to best kill dinosaurs...
---
Thats not handholding by inhibiting that. Handholding would be *allowing* that.
---
Training every skill up until 20 is really unnecessary. You can get just the essentials and spend ~2g total.
---
For instance, you shouldn't be training anything at 16/18 (except for maybe Remove Lesser Curse).
---
You can also defer training Dampen Magic, Slow Fall, and all the fire/arcane damage spells except for Fire Blast and rank 1 Arcane Explosion.
---
I don't get it.
---
Uhhh... what is there to say? Call us when you get there? For now it's a glorified pile of number salad. You should've probably worked on it for another week before posting to realise your idea more; at this stage you could've just as well explained it in text without the spreadsheet as it doesn't show much. Good luck though.
---
Yeah, its like the coin test. If you cant decide between 2 options, fliping a coin and then seeing whether or not you like the result is a good way to go.
---
Go with Skinning to start. It will help provide the Leathers you'll need for bags anyway.
---
Then maybe when you get to 60 you'll want to respec to Engineering or Herbalism or something a bit more useful than Skinning for the longterm. It's great 1-60 though.
---
Tailoring and Enchanting can be decent together, if you plan to be "The Server Enchanter" but I personally would rather have another more fun trade and just rely on someone else for enchants.
---
Yep. Which is why I think they are going to make the same mistake. It makes sense from a business standpoint, you dont want to oversell and then end up with a deflated IP. You want to keep hype high, but expectations low. 
---
I'm sure they're still *aware* that there could be a bigger boom, but they have to follow their projections.
---
Need a dmg expert for this one, but which dmg debuff benefits the most for rogues? Hemo or Improved kidney shot (9% extra dmg) ?
---
I know its a lol question but my m8 want me to spec into imp kidney shot when we going to level.
---
We don't really know right... But I do think it will be worse than better.   It might not be the end of the world to roll on one, friends are probably going to make it much better than alone on a nonstreamer one. Wish I had friends to play Classic with ^^
---
Playing on a private server, pick up skinning, pick up every item that drops, and you will have the gold for it easily. If you want though, you can pick out a couple abilities you probably won't use, for example, from 1-20, you probably don't need, arcane missiles, amplify/dampen magic seem mediocre, the wards don't seem necessary. But you have to realize that while in PVE these will rarely be used, they have a much wider use in PVP, and can sometimes be the difference between clearing and wiping in a dungeon.
---
dual monitor? :D
---
I will say for certain that your current mods on pservers wont work. For all intents and purposes, Classic is WoW 7.3.5, so addons designed for 1.12 wont function. But there will definitely be addons that take their place and preform as similar functionality as they can with the new "rules".
---
Haha, I love this!!
---
yet, I am interested in the demand for balance druids.
---
First, we start with 1.12 classes
---
Second, I'm expecting a bit lesser supply in this re-release.
---
Which is funny because dwarfs can't be mages.
---
My personal opinion on this is that the faction-exclusion on PvP servers helped add to faction identity and rivalry. The same goes for the faction-restricted shaman and paladin. I mean I want characters on each faction and I'm not terribly tickled by the idea of having to play on two different servers. I'd rather have my toons consolidated to one community. But I do think there's something to be said for faction restricting in order to foster that rivalry a little more, by making us pick sides.
---
If the players are ungeared, yes.
---
On a pserver I play, there is a mental dude who has a fully decked 60 horde he keeps on redridge. He scouts for players on his 60 ally and swaps over to kill on his warlock. If allies come to kill his horde, then he kills the stonewatch bosses on his ally character to prevent players from getting credit. There is no way to stop him because he has access to both factions 60. 
---
It’s an extreme example, but it’s the kind of abuse and griefing that single faction pvp server creation eliminates. 
---
Could he do it using 2 separate accounts? Sure, but the likeliness that such a player would spend $15 more a month to grief is extremely unlikely.
---
Sex robots aint gonna getcha to 60 pal.
---
I think focusing on what you each would find the most fun is the best way to go. You'll spend a lot of time with your characters, so it's always best to enjoy them (also, WoW is a game, so it's supposed to be fun). 
---
I don't know a ton about rogues, but both rogues and locks are easily soloable. Rogues have some sneaky ways to farm good money once you get to 60 (I don't remember which bosses offhand, but sneaking through mid-level dungeons to solo particular bosses for profit works well). Locks have lots of mechanics that make them hard to kill and they can farm mobs pretty efficiently by having the void walker AOE tank while you DoT a bunch of mobs and wait for them to die. So in terms of making money, it really just depends on how you want to do it. 
---
I've never been attracted to rogues so I can't sell warlock vs. rogue without bias, but they're pretty even in terms of accomplishing what you want to accomplish. So pick whichever seems most fun - which is a warlock in my opinion. 
---
Also tell your partner to keep in mind that they can reroll. The classes in vanilla each have a particular flavor and your partner might not dig the warlock playstyle.
---
How can healing classes make money at level cap?
---
I don’t think it’s entirely random, I probably spun with the same “force” three times, resulting in similar outcomes.
---
To this day I will never understand the logic of keeping the teleport TB/Darn and portal TB/Darn ahead 10 levels. It's not like they're high level zones, they're cities! It can't be because they're on separate continents from the main faction since Thunder Bluff is in Kalimdor.
---
And it's not like either TB or Darn are highly coveted zones to visit either. 
---
To my mind I can't think of a single good reason. It's just an arbitrary decision by Blizzard to stretch out the levelling process.
---
I slightly love you.
---
They did, we are getting 16 from the start.
---
Yeah, I don't claim to know *for sure* why, but I still think thats why. They know their is demand, they have to. 
---
Lets say though, that they expect 300K subs after 6 months of the game's existence, and they could wager at least a small chunk, say 10% of people would want RPVP. Maybe thats *still* not enough to instate an RPVP for each region. That would be spreading 30k players over 4 servers, and they can't just make one RPVP for one region and neglect the others.
---
But imagine if Classic WoW had 1.5 million subs by the 6 month point. It's up in the air, but it's possible. Then, that 10% demand is 150K, and thats surely enough of a large-sum demand to spread across multiple regional servers.
---
They confirmed 16.
---
60 &gt; 69
---
I resubbed to retail just to try and scratch the itch. It didnt help.
---
I had a 49 warlock twink and a 29 hunter twink and honestly fun factor it’s the hunter by a mile and a half. You will make rogues’ lives an absolute nightmare and it’ll be a very target rich environment. 
---
As far as PvP soul link warlocks are really tough to kill and if you get geared to the teeth you will feel like a raid boss.
---
Spinned it like 50 Times, Not once stopped it on warrior. I dont like this wheel.
---
It's pretty hard to pick which mage gets it, since it's based on which mage crits first. I suppose you could organise for the worst geared mage to use his combustion a few seconds before all the other mages though. I also wonder whether people have theorycrafted scorch over fireball if there's a big ignite rolling - because shorter cast time  = more chances to crit and prolong the ignite.
---
&gt;Priests having a hard time doesn't surprise me. Especially on Horde it appears that Shaman will be stealing Healer spots left and right.
---
Yep, you want Windfury totem in every melee group + tank group, and tranquil air in caster group. Add in that that you probably dont want more than 10-12 healers total, and some of these are druids, and you are not looking at a lot of priest spots. You dont have Fear Ward either to make yourself attractive to a raid.
---
Disenchanting level requirements were added in TBC.
---
But it still does what it's supposed to, even if its messy. Did you actually try it out? I already know the layout is non-existent, and was hoping for more technical critique and maybe someone to help out.
---
Even in TBC, Spriest hemorrhaged mana (you played basically the same as a try-hard Spriest in Vanilla did as the default style stacking and guzzling everyone mp consumable you could get), they were just giving everyone else gobs of mana back, so it upped their usefulness even further especially with Lock Master race as the only true ranged dps. 
---
The main thing that helped Spriest was their ridiculous front loading of spell-hit via talents, the debuff slot increase taking some of the pressure off on the 3 debuff slots an Spriest needs and the Frozen Shadoweave set's ridiculous amount of +shadow damage for very little effort. Which made them legit dps for like the first tier or so of raiding but fell off during t5 as their scaling was basically non-existent (they scaled only from +damage, no other stats) and they were relegated to pure support.
---
They have none of those advantages in classic and even locks are slow to build up in usefulness due to gear stats until nearly the end of raiding, and you NEED a lot of locks to make shadow-weaving worth bringing vs just bringing another lock in your slot.
---
It's a reference to the South Park episode "Make Love Not Warcraft", in the episode the boys can't level in higher zones because they'll get ganked so they stay in Elwynn and kill boars. Hence the reason why he restricted himself to boars.
---
No. The real cap on ignite damage is tank threat. You want the ignite as high as possible, and then just drop it before you pull off the tank and have some other mage get the next stack.
---
It's that shadowpriests, warrior, mages and rogues were in significant abundance.
---
This is the one change they should make to classic.
---
You can't pick classes, you can only spin the wheel! 
---
Of course you can only create one char a month as well,  you know to avoid wheel abuse!
---
Very viable, you guys will have a good time healing each other in world pvp. 
---
Competing for gear might be a bummer but it’s not that big of a deal.
---
That was the gist of it. That is how many of the Ironfoes were also farmed on at least 3 of the bigger servers as well.
---
I would much rather be at home not able to play than be at work thinking others are playing right then.
---
Minimize the costs to maximize the profits. No point using top arrows for farming when it will hardly increase kill speed. It's just cutting into your potential gold per arrow.
---
Restricting users to one faction per server isn’t handholding at all, it’s just the original WoW experience.
---
I don’t even understand people arguing for it. It’s just lame, people make characters of the other faction to message you if you kill them.   
---
It lowers the immersion and humanizes the other faction. I’d rather see Alliance players as enemies, impossible to communicate with, as it was in original World of Warcraft.
---
A lot of people want to cherry pick what content is protected by the “no changes”. This one is an absolute no for me, it brings nothing positive to the table.
---
Excellent, thank you!
---
🤣
---
I already booked vacation a few months ago for the first two weeks of August. Kind of hoping the July 16 thing is real for this reason. Gives me more time to play without worrying about queues lol
---
&gt;while also having some extra threat from axe spec.
---
But only if you actually use an axe. Since the majority of tank weapons in Vanilla will be swords, and sometimes a dagger, this racial is not really that huge. Only really has value if you can use  Crul'Shorukh or something.
---
Aye, I always pick up skinning. But, as far as abilities go, I absolutely loathe missing certain abilities. Arcane missiles for certain pvp situations, amplify magic for bosses like VC, and dampen for myself in the open world. Flamestrike for when the situation calls for it, and then, I still have bought pretty much 99% of these spells.
---
I've seen some people who can level to 40 without arcane explosion or other random less crucial abilities. I just cant live that way :/ I'd rather sell my poor level 5 water for 2 copper than be without me skills.
---
&gt;considered
---
I'm not calling you out in particular but this is something I'm seeing a lot of in relation to "classic summer 0w0 summer for ME is blahblahblah"  
---
Summer is not "when it's hot." It's a specific time of the calendar based on the position of the Sun in the sky. Summer for the nothern hemisphere begins on the Summer Solstice and ends on the Autumnal Equinox. For this year those days are Friday, June 21 and Monday, September 23, respectively. 
---
In any case this is a wild speculations thread based on when the release will be maximally inconvenient so my guess is June 26 since that's the day my next kid is due.
---
This is awesome. Thank you for this. Will put in my back pocket
---
You cant stop people from buying a second account.
---
So its either "not fair" and a very small problem or you ruin the experience for everyone and a big problem.
---
When you call for anarchy you have to explain why its actually better then the alternative.
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
At this point I feel like I'll have a better chance of getting some weeks off in september so I am no longer hoping on an early summer release...
---
This exactly.
---
My guess would be a bit of a hybrid. The actual geometry of the zone was completely different at launch, then revamped later when the new Silithus content came out. My guess is that the 1.12 geometry will be there, but they'll wait to enable the various AQ related quests and events similar to how its handled on private servers.
---
Considering undead and demons to be boars, feels like a cheat. But without those cheats, there's a gap where there are no boars with levels 25 to 47 and at level 32, the level 24 boars are worth nothing, and the level 48 boars are skulls.
---
Vanilla had tons of quest additions through its lifetime, that's why many of the people who keep complaining about having to grind in vanilla are working with a very out-of-date worldview.
---
yeah this is what i was expecting and curious about.  I am hoping Blizz will enable modders to get stuck in as they always did, because I expect to see a LOT of enthusiasm and cool things being created as we've seen with youtube content creators
---
i really prefer to keep it minimal - raid/unit frames, simpler+smaller action bars, neater bags.  beyond that i'm not too concerned but i would look forward to seeing what ppl come up with
---
Have to go trinket.  Must get and keep all the trinkets.  It's a rule.
---
[Wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Brackenwall_Village) says Brackenwall was introduced in 1.8, and then expanded in 2.3.
---
Why not? Plenty of people have jobs that take care of them and over reward vacation days. Classic wow seems like a perfect excuse to burn a week of hours.
---
Yeah duh.. And the thorium bullets are crafted by who? Oh right. Engineers.
---
Darnassus/TB don't have mage trainers in them and their respective races cannot be mages. The only reason that would make sense from a lore/logical perspective is that it would be more difficult to teleport there since mage presence is less prevalent. IDK lol
---
Oh, trust me, those kinds of players have at least six monitors. At eye level.
---
You might be able to do some aoe grinding with two pallies. You both spec into consecration, one puts on righteous fury and the other keeps him alive while you both keep consecration down. That and devotion+retribution aura could be dope.
---
Im probably in the minority but I have no interest in VR.
---
If you are solofarming, just use whatever. Just dont show up to my groups/raids with subpar ammo.
---
that line was in the post / parent, WoW 2 being under dev since 2012. Obviously its all speculation and guess work, no one has heard hide or hare of "WoW 2" besides this post lol
---
What is the least gear dependent class that is still considered desirable for raids?
---
IF your only interaction with the other faction is low level players PMing you about how you just killed them, that would dhumanize them instead. It increases immersion by creating a more realistic war situation where traitors exist and are working with the other faction to sabotage you. If you dont like that, retail wow has a much safer and handholdy experience for you.
---
No. LBRS and UBRS are player conventions. The instance is just "Blackrock Spire". UBRS is cordoned off by a door inside the instance and behind that door are mobs tuned for 10-player groups. LBRS is the part you zone into initially and is tuned to be challenging for 5-player groups. Although it's fun to steamroll it as a tenman, please note you cannot complete "dungeon" or "group" quests (will be marked as such in your quest log) while in a raid. So a ten-man clear of LBRS is just for funsies and possibly loot farming for new/undergeared guildies.
---
Thanks dude, that’s exactly what I was looking forbut I didn’t know any ret pally content makers. 
---
Cheers!
---
Anything’s possible friend
---
I see, sounds like we should be in for a good time.
---
Mudsprocket got added in TBC. The expansion revamped a lot of old zones like Dustwallow to have more quests and flight paths.
---
Indeed, realistically, you could be a double agent who helps aid the enemy. You use a diguise so horde dont kill you and give your buddies information on your faction. That is very very realistic for a war, far more realistic than saying "this is WARcraft, yet you cant do this one thing because its unfun."
---
Nobody wants to play shadowpriest. On nost I would go around recruiting level 50 spriests to join my guild before they hit 60 it was so bad.
---
You are your raids bitch. You exist solely to buff the warlocks damage this means any bis piece 100% is not going to you. You will be bottom of the totem pole on ALL loot.
---
If you're ok with this you get to enjoy an easy class that doesn't get shit for being low on damage meter and not having a million dps consumables.
---
Most guild  fury wars will have full tank sets when Rag/Nef is on farm. Any one can step in to spot tank. Vanilla raid tanking is pretty straight forward. I don’t see a huge demand for tanks in big raid guilds.
---
Wow. TIL.
---
No it wasnt. Dont confuse the 2.0 TBC prepatch with late Vanilla. Late Vanilla means 1.12.1.
---
People rich enough bought 40 accounts just to multibox before. You really think 15 dollars would deter someone dedicated enough. All it does is create a class system where the rich gets an advantage over everyone else and prevents realistic war from happening.
---
I really like this and wish I had something for warrior. I have all this data, but it is not graphical. It could probably  be improved by adding total gold cost for those spells at each level.
---
B-B-B-B-BUBBLES
---
while i honestly love that idea (akin to all lvl 1/3/5 raids on hogger..)  i had meant make it a new end game zone/raid, sideways progression similar to how people say dragons isles should be, or outland / hyjal / uldum, all those grey'd out zones on the map they didnt get time for. Also there are raids in zones whose lvls dont match, eg: Zul Gurub in STV, 30-40
---
Yeah retail is a shadow of the real wow
---
Haha, plenty of that.
---
Is my memory off? Was weather based on your region/timezone meaning that if there was a huge storm locally then it would be reflected ingame?
---
I still don’t know what blink is
---
I keep telling myself that I'm not going to go play in a private server while I wait. Currently typing this as I'm leveling a rogue in westfall.
---
I got Mudsprocket and Brackenwall mixed up at first, but as you can see ive already added the relevant information.
---
Flash heal at lvl 18 is pretty nice for Mages
---
Right, because it's a *game*. If you actually were playing a game with doublecrossing in it, I would welcome it. But WoW isn't that game. Carrying 50 items like weapons, bundles of cloth, food, and sets of armor in your backpacks isnt realistic. WoW isn't supposed to be an interpretation of real life and the way real wars are fought. It's a game with it's own rules that we play into.
---
Shit mate, if they make some fun-server version of Classic down the road, maybe it would be cool to do a long windy side-quest to learn how to speak Dwarven or Gutterspeak and have it actually *incorporated* into the game.
---
But as it stands, logging over to whisper somebody instantaneously from a nobody toon, because "thats what happens in war" is nonsensical, imo.
---
Alliance warlock is the easiest class to get a raid spot by far. I had a raidspot before hitting max level. I had guilds whispering me asking to join their guild without applying.
---
A good warlock on alliance is truly rare. Most alliance warlock players are noobs who heard the class was easy to level and you get a free mount and only need to press 1 button in raids. If you're a good alliance warlock you will stand out above the crowd as they'll be bottom of dps meter with the druids and you'll be competing with the mages and rogues.
---
Right. Got Mudsprocket and Brackenwall mixed up.
---
In the alpha dwarves could be mages but for whatever reason they removed it.
---
There were gonna be mages at launch but it would have given alliance more class/race combinations than the horde so Blizzard nixed  them.
---
I thought it was just time of day, but the continent could have had a "weather in any 3 places" kind of thing.
---
Yup, wolves will get you from 1 to 60 with no problems and no "cheating" by considering undead and demons. Got non-elite, non-rare wolves of levels 1-3, 5-12, 19-21, 23-24, 27-28, 35-44, and 46-54. Only nasty stretch is the gap from 29 to 34 and while the level 28 wolves turn green, the level 35 ones turn yellow.
---
Doesn’t make you a “no lifer” to use pto for classic wow. The fact that you post on this subreddit makes your way nerdier then most.
---
To be fair, that's basically what OP was asking for.
---
its not as good as the screenshot thou, the picture OP made is easier to read and has cost.
---
The majority of p-servers have inflated drop numbers and balancing changes, some drop changes are on the order of 100-1000%. There’s a whole segment on ‘countdown to classic’ that talks about how a lot of the p-server shenanigans won’t work or apply on an authentic classic environment.
---
Is it also realistic in war that the guy you killed comes back alive and whispers in your ear that you are a noob and he banged your mom ?
---
That’s part of the launch.
---
The addon api will be different from 1.12 and current wow. So no current addons will work at all. Other than that we have to wait for beta
---
"ARCANITE REAPER HOOOUU!"
---
But they will ostracize you and prevent you from joining any popular guild. Having a "disguised" character who speaks to the opponent is reasonable, PMs are basically just fast mail any way.
---
I'm kind of nostalgic towards thottbot, but not really in a good way. It's like those giant crate monitors that weigh 40 pounds, but are still 14 inches across. Yeah, it makes me feel like im in 2004, but I have so many horrid memories of Thottbot, that I'm not miffed that it's gone.
---
Still, it might be cool to use the thottbot theme on wowhead.
---
&gt; if this is just an inappropriate sampling that doesn’t represent the population.
---
This is precisely it. You usually get downvoted for pointing it out though because people are a bit fact resistent around here if it fits their narrative.
---
If Classic is successful it'll go to additional servers and staff to develop Classic TBC :p
---
Why this subreddit is "so aids" with downvoting everything? Because the same questions get asked over and over again ever other day and have been answered literally hundreds of times in the past year or so
---
I kept clicking until I got Warrior.
---
I think maybe I want to play Warrior.
---
thottbot was a way better database then anything that exists today.  Why?
---
But again, thats not how war works. If the whole premise of this being added is to make it more warlike, than it has to be warlike. If you get caught colluding in war, you're tortured or dead. Also, if it's a disguise, it has to have the ability for the disguise to fail. You're not disguised, you ARE playing the other race.
---
I'm glad that this can be a thing people can do on PVE servers, but PVP servers make the game as warlike as possible. Not actually warlike, because actual war sucks, but as warlike as possible for a game thats meant to be fun and not have glaring issues, like being able to body swap and have instant speech to anybody.
---
Yea I thought that was kind of odd. Like, the post said old Blizzard actually used to transfer items and now they won't
---
Just take up mining and engineering and don't worry about ammo. Most of your engineering skill ups will be obtained by making your own ammo. And the ammo you craft will generally be better than the ammo you purchase. Also if you're willing to spare 2 bag slots, a simple trick is to keep a stack of metal and a stack of powder in your bags and those 2 stacks of mats represent 20 stacks of ammo you can use (assuming you're using a gun). When you get to end game and assuming you wish to use a bow, then switch to a bow,  go to one of the servants that need to be killed for the quest ["the stones that bind us"](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2681), attack it and go AFK while you grind up your bow skill to max.
---
You're right if you're doing it specifically for mage. However the chances of it picking the same class 3 times in a row is just 1/9 * 1/9 because the first spin can land on any class and then it will just need another two spins at 1/9 each to get the 3x.
---
I don’t want to get corpse camped while leveling is why I’m picking rogue.  I also afk a lot so sitting in stealth offers protection
---
In south park I think the boys leveled in a party so the boar count would be even higher. So party of 4 \* 18058 boars  = 72 232 boars to hit level 60
---
Couldn't decide between hunter and druid. Got druid on first spin, I think am rolling a hunter.
---
I will never not see that icon as a giant blue-purple Orca using psionic powers. Somehow I doubt that's what Blizzard intended.
---
...but it's what I see.
---
Shockadin PvP! Yesss. 
---
Another class+Paladin would be better, but its def doable.
---
"guys i have a question" 
---
\[trade\]: look it up dumbass
---
This is great content, hope the the creator uploads more soon
---
Don’t locks shit on hunters?  Mages too if they get in your dead zone ?
---
&gt;Something new has to come In it’s place to keep the player involved
---
The moment classic is no longer classic is the moment we start agitating AGAIN for a vanilla server option. We just got done fighting for this after 11 years.   
---
What is this interminable march towards novelty? Does baseball need to be jazzed up? Do we need to put some spikes on a football to keep people more engaged? 
---
I mean here's a thought: just allow the game to run its natural course and then fade away. Once you personally have finished enough of classic to be satisfied, just go find something else to do. Not every single institution in our lives needs to be reborn and rebranded every couple years or so to capture the imagination of an aging target market demographic. Like, just let the good thing be good. The tireless pursuit of refinement, streamlining, content engagement, and player retention is exactly how you end up in a state like BfA. This is not a chicken little, hypothetical, slippery slope argument. We have 14 years of historical data of the game getting worse (my opinion) on a patch by patch basis.
---
I love this Dev team. There’s a huge difference in how they look at feedback vs the retail team.
---
I prefer the toxic version
---
Thats why we stay in the forest... killing boars. There's lots of computer generated boars in the World of Warcraft!
---
This is correct. Honored rep and rank 3 each give a 10% discount on all vendors, I’m not sure if getting another faction mount is possible at the start but I do know the cloth turn in quests aren’t in the game until I think AQ
---
Hmm, I'm totally fine with summoning people. Makes warlock feel all the more special to me. You do you.
---
It's just for Thorium Arrows, and engineers can make arrows in later expansions. Context is important in classic because stuff changed over time.
---
I'm excited to hit those low numbers again.
---
In TBC I was in a casual progression guild as the OT (sometimes MT). The officers were DPS and Heals. 
---
Everything was fine until some of them wanted to get more serious about raiding. Suddenly they stole gear that would normally go to me as the reliable tank because they’re going to *start* gearing an officer as a tank. This rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, self included.
---
That guild split in two within a month after the first ninja loot incident. I was invited to the hardcore version, but chose to gquit both.
---
Question about shadow priests
---
If a big part of shadow priests job is to buff lock dmg, but locks has threat problems. Doesn’t that kinda make it a waste to use a spot to buff them?
---
Isn’t it a little like having a car with a max speed of 70mph, but the speed limit is 60mph, then it doesn’t make much sense to boost your cars max speed to 80mph, since the limit is still only 60mph
---
Or am I wrong that locks doesn’t have that much threat problems?
---
Even with those rates, 85-90% of the value of consumables is in the mats. I suspect classic will not offer such good margins on crafting, keep in mind the current most popular pserver has a mature player base well into content and widespread awareness of the "best" gold farming methods, so players have a lot of gold relative to needs. This kind of spare liquidity isn't going to exist for a long time in classic.
---
No worries!
---
"Tank weapons" are not really a thing in the current meta.
---
The only real mandatory sword is TF because it's that much better threat wise (arguably Maladath/THC if you're gonna dw tank with TF) and the reason why troll's Berserking is favored for 100% dedicated tanks guaranteed to be funneled a TF, but other than that nothing stops you from tanking with any DPS axe and there are plenty (Serathil, Annihilator, Frostbite, DB, Crul, DE, Zulian, Waraxe, Sickle, Hachet...).
---
For any decent horde guild the name of the game is threat because your DPS will be threat capped without Salvation and pushing you, survival is really not that big of a deal in vanilla raids. Even then, there are plenty of better slots to focus on survival, for your weapon you should really prioritize threat and benefit from your racials instead of wielding a Quel'Serrar because it's labeled "tank weapon" while it's in fact barely better than a blue Frostbite. As an orc you'll probably swap between DB and Alcor's/Julie's early on until DE/Crul/Sickle.
---
Why not make one for the skills we want to train?
---
The point is to get to the end zones alone so you have free reign of whatever you want. In my case it's going to be stocking up on black lotus', farming thaurissan Firewalkers for the cindercloth cloak pattern and, farming scarlet spellbinders/archmages for the crusader enchant and buying all the limited vendor items.
---
All of that becomes infinitely more difficult and competitive if I'm not way ahead of the pack.
---
T2 is a spell power set, not a healing set. It also looks amaze-balls!
---
So you will kick a hunter with cheap ammo from your ubrs group because the boss would die 5 second earlier?
---
That is one badass screenshot!
---
TBH, I agree and if mom was a player I'd kick her from the guild also.  It's not even about being a dick to people...I genuinely think a 6 year old has no place playing an MMO by themselves and would not want to deal with the crazy parents or reports or w/e when something inevitably went wrong like this......and if it was a 6 year old playing on mom's account, I would still kick them because I don't need a 6 year old fucking up raids and my guild's rep using mom's account.
---
thats great but not everybody has been reading here for the past year or so, and information may change over time.
---
it's a forum for discussion, surely asking questions is the intention?  if people have seen the post before they can effortlessly ignore
---
&gt; People like that are going to tear the already fragile community 
---
apart
---
lol melodramatic much?
---
How good is tailoring for locks? I’d like to be selfsufficient for consumes by picking up herbalism but I’d also like to train engineering.
---
Then: 18, broke, failing community college and living with parents. Shitty, non-gamer boyfriend 😆 Mained a priest because I already knew I loved healing from previous mmo experience
---
Now: married (amazing, hardworking, casual-gamer husband), house, graduated college (at 30 lol), and I'm a mom as of 8 months ago. Looking forward to spending my precious, limited free-time leveling a priest again!
---
Out of curiosity, do you have any background in statistics? (Honest question, not being a hater. I appreciate the effort you put in either way.)
---
Agreed.
---
Hi, /u/Floppy_Trombone
---
It's been so long, I actually forgot that we had mana gems.  I'm a bit surprised how many icons and names I can remember.
---
I know. Americans have it rough. Good thing I was born in a first world country
---
Thats one cool screenshot.
---
Do you remember what gear you had at that pic
---
They’ll help with the grinding though.
---
Yes, on two separate accounts.
---
There is no reason to think that they'd deviate in that aspect for no reason.
---
No they won’t work. But there will be even better addons available that do work.
---
Yes, but you lock out a school of magic for Pally/Lock kicks.
---
Ok, so just using pally's as an example:  If I'm a 20/0/31 pally and I'm healing, my main spec is still ret so I can roll on dps gear then right?
---
But wait...20 pts is all you really need to main holy and you might be healing in dungeons and raids only and then ret in all open world/solo/pvp content......which one is my main spec at this point?   Say I play both in equal amounts in all areas of the game....at that point which one is my main spec? How do I get gear for the other one?
---
You do see how the waters get muddy and confusing for hybrid players...and people try to use that to take advantage of said hybrid players... "Oh you're a ret, don't roll on healing gear" "Oh your holy don't roll on any dps gear"....then you always get stuck with the shitty leftovers for ALL your specs.  You get called a loot whore or ninja if you DARE roll on a bis piece for EITHER spec....b/c the minute you roll on a piece that someone else wants (no matter what role you're actively playing in the group right then)...suddenly to OTHER players your "main spec" is the opposite of what it was before you rolled....
---
I never played a Rogue, but what is the point of speccing into imp kidney shot while leveling? It seems way more like a strictly PVP talent.
---
No u
---
Me not that kind of Orc !
---
Def big bad pauldrons, scarlet legs and helm, guild tabard and not sure what weapon
---
Hunters counter Warlocks. And Mage vs Hunter is pretty equal but Mage needs to blow every CD or it’s over.
---
Neltharion's Tear? Agreed. It's BiS for casters and also holy paladin's I think. Maybe rshams too.
---
Srs congrats on those married and future mom accomplishments! =D
---
I did this on Nostalrius with a bud, was really fun (for us at least). Did quests up to lvl 20 and then AOE grinded the rest. Managed to get to 60 a bit quicker than I did solo on my wlock.
---
Paladins are sick man. If you get off on being very annoying and neigh unkillable, you'd love Paladins. I used to play ret aswell and Ret is very good for 1v1 and world pvp. People make it out to be a memespec but it's quite bursty
---
Warlocks need a lot of gear to shine in BGs or melee and Hunters will farm you. Hunters don’t need any gear. They are strong in pvp right after they hit 60.
---
Thanks, I'll have to check it out!
---
2004: 13yr old me watching my older sister's boyfriend in college raid ONY for hours on his Nelf hunter while he lived at our house.
---
2019: 28yr married, house, career, and absolutely no time to raid but can't wait to watch streamers take down Ony some more lol!
---
On Alliance side it's no problem. On horde side full T2 does the trick and possibly a shaman. So there are ways around it.
---
Commenting in a 3day old post to suggest that if this is really important to you, consider trying out a gamepad if you can afford one on sale (is not uncommon to see $40-45). I've used a Logitech G13 for 7 years, it's perfect for me though Razer makes one that seems a bit more popular (tl;dr: don't get a G13 unless you have big-ish hands). You bind the thumbstick to move and free up your fingers to only worry about abities.
---
It's like fucking magic, especially for MMOs. Learning mine felt super impactful in going from "I'm not too shabby!" in PvP to "LOL here I come to hard carry again". A 12 button mouse might be overkill with it, and I just can't go back to WASD. Some of the buttons on a 4 or 5 button mouse are perfect for modifier keys, so you also eliminate the whole pinky-press shift/ctrl/alt PITA.
---
You still obviously need the other good advice in this thread, number one definitely being lots of practice. The key to practice is making lots of mistakes to learn from. My half-joke about learning to be a good tank is to just make every mistake once, so you know everything *not* to do. It's obviously more dynamic in PvP, but if your main concern is raids then PvP absolutely helps train situational awareness.
---
Ideas for improvement:
---
 * Remove (or at least move out of the way) the recipe location. Keep the tool simple and focused.
---
 * The "quantity to make" column should be the second column since this is the primary thing the users will be modifying. This makes the information easier to locate and modify. Consider giving the cells the user should modify a color as well (light green is often used for this).
---
 * Hide the raw data for quantity needed for a single potion (just moving it far to the right is adequate). Currently, the user is being shown similar data multiple times, making it harder to tell at a glance what is going on.
---
You could always start with mining to get ores collected and replace it with engineering.
---
Yes, they are as viable as any other healer in game and  yes, only one Rejuv per player. I think the stronger oRejuv always overlays de weaker one, but I'm not sure about this. Druid's main heal spell is Healing Touch rank 4 anyway, heals over time are situational.
---
Hmm is it? I thought it was too far down Assination tree to get for PVP?
---
Anyways just me and my m8 talking about helping eachother out when levelling (double rogue team)
---
It's pre-BiS but Truestrike Shoulders from UBRS are pretty coveted. Pre-BiS for warriors, rogues, hunters and feral druids. Expect to do many UBRS runs for these since it's a 20% drop.
---
 https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12927/truestrike-shoulders
---
I thought locks counter hunters because hunters have no defense against dots...
---
&gt;"Tank weapons" are not really a thing in the current meta.
---
So you dont use a weapon to tank with? Unless you get an Ironfoe, the majority of weapons you will be wearing as a tank will be swords. Which is why Orc racial really dont matter that much for threat.
---
But its great that you can list a bunch of Naxx axes. By which point your guild will already have Thunderfury.
---
I have thought of that too, the problem is I definitely want herbalism, and you can only track herbs or mines one at a time.
---
Yeah a big load of nonsense. No serious raid will ever bring a shadow priest. The ideal amount of fury warriors and rogue doesn’t exist because you try to stack as many of them as you can. Top guilds like to bring 15-20 fury and rogues.
---
Dots? Aimed shot + multi shot can 2 shot any warlock.
---
I would disagree with you on that part again I think. With YouTube abundant, the "best" gold farming methods are not secrets anymore, retail WoW tutorials on YouTube are largely popular as well. And a large portion of players is gonna see these guides and roll with just gathering and Engineering, leaving Alchemy behind, because, as you say, the value is mainly in the mats.
---
Oh this is sexy. Could you do one for Warlock?
---
That is extremely useful, thanks.
---
I have some statistics courses in my economics education, but nothing too impressive. I know these methods are oversimplified, but I just did the best I could with the data available.
---
No news at all
---
Does anyone remember this from back in the day? So many good one-liners. 
---
"They call me Andre Agassi I DOMINATE THE SERVER"
---
&gt; They are weak in terms of early raid PvE long term DPS because they are only using a very limited amount of spells. 
---
That's completely false. Warlocks aren't going to use more spells. It's Shadow Bolt from start to finish, with the odd SM/Ruin lock using Corruption for instant SB procs. The real reason is that warlocks scale extremely well with gear and that there are very little gear upgrades in until BWL/ZG.
---
Like the blink icon being a dwarf instead of just a purple whatever? Played on small screens and resolutions all these years
---
Holy fuck...
---
Some of the most fun I had in classic was based on drama following some massive ninja looting incidents. One of the top horde guilds on our server recruited people which would prove to have ninja looted their main horde rival.
---
Well, when there are rogues on my dungeon groups I don't see they stunning mobs that much, only when needed. If they want to deal damage to a mob they just spend their combo points on eviscerate instead of a kidney shot. The damage output from Evisc will probably be way higher then this 9% extra for a few seconds even if there are two or three people hiting the mob, that's why I thought it may be a PVP talent, idk really.
---
You misread the post. They are limited in raiding vs PvP in terms of spells they use, especially utility. I didn't talk about the difference of early raiding and late raiding which is mostly a scaling issue.
---
Thottbot reminds me of Craiglist. Design straight out of early 2000's. Doesn't look pretty, but gets the job done and loads fast.
---
Oh the early internet.
---
Everyone please spam likes on this video- he says if he gets 10k likes he will do the boar challenge.  it is nuts.  You have to do about 10 levels in RFK/RFD resetting it over and over again, and dodging undead/humanoid monsters so you don't get any bonus XP that way.
---
Dad? Who showed you how to use reddit?
---
Hoping they bring back old realm names, Illidan is my go to.
---
Share when Done plz
---
Dude, do you really not see how toxic the classic community already looks? The whole sub is one giant circle jerk.
---
Class quests probably won't be phase 1, they weren't in live
---
Hunter and , technically mage.
---
Hunters don't scale very well, but are decent in early raids and every raid needs hunters for tranq. Mages also technically get most of their damage from their base skills, but to maximize their dps they stack spell gear
---
Yes the rest of you stay at work... 
---

He

Wanted a rogue. Got rogue first time. Seems to be working well
---
Yea np, guess we will try, just thought there was no point in both of us levelling with the same spec and imp. kidney shot was on my way to my seal fate dagger spec :)
---
I think it was the simplicity of it. Looked ugly, but got you what you were searching for.
---
Level both, and you'll naturally gravitate towards playing one or the other more. That one becomes your main.
---
Rogues go combat while leveling
---
I’m done arguing with you, you just repeat the same stuff about hand holding, which I actually addressed previously.
---
I explained my position pretty clearly, and you haven’t made a logical point.
---
Also, despite obviously having a sub-normal IQ, you are condescending, which makes arguing with you exponentially more annoying.
---
yeah the pics is a nice idea. but the spreadsheet does have cost.
---
would be trivial to convert this to the same format as OP, all the same info is there
---
TILL YOUR EYES DIE FROM THE LIGHT (of the computer monitor)
---
Thanks!! I'll be min-maxing momming more than my priest... at least until the kid is old enough to start farming mats for me!😆
---
What is the point of this?
---
Yea dude. It's always 'trolls'. Good one.
---
Man tarren mill vs hillsbrad will be epic again.
---
No they are not. They drop herbs, greys, and greens
---
Warlocks are a way more scary PvP class than Hunters, by far. Geared warlocks are the thing people run away from the fastest in BGs. People avoid them like plague because of both DoTs and horrendous burst. Hunters are very strong at demolishing unaware clothies and rogues, especially early on, but they're not as good as Locks on same gear levels in terms of both DPS and Burst. When fighting in organized BGs (premades) they're more of a nuisance (frost traps, viper sting ...) than a real threat.
---
Also Hunters do physical damage, which is mitigated by armor, and there's a lot of Warriors roaming around in BGs, which is simply impractical. In 1v1 Hunters have more control, but would still loose to Warlocks most of the time. What's cool about hunters in both BGs and WPvP is humanoid tracking, which makes moving around safely much easier. 
---
It should also be noted that Soul Link locks are by far the most OP 1v1 PvP class in Vanilla. Even early with gear they're just too tanky to be killed 1v1, and their DoTs, even without advanced gear, do a shitload of damage. Hunters on the other hand have the most control in 1v1 PvP of all classes with ranged/melee slows/snares, traps CC/slows, a ranged stun in BM, immobilizing attacks in survival etc. But if you fall on an opponent that is too durable and if you don't get the crits you need with multi-shot/aimed shot, you'll get outlasted or bursted down eventually. 
---
Warlocks don't even need to rely on matchup and lucky crits most of the time, because they're so tanky and their DoTs tick so hard. If you put 3 DoTs on a rogue he's basically going to die no matter what you'll do next, especially with early gear.
---
As a Holy Reckoning Paladin in a 5-man, what blessing should I put on the tank: Light, Sanctuary or Kings?
---
Blade of the Titans
---
Jesus Hunter really is low
---
1. Yes, that is my plan as soon as I get everything into the database. As I don't know any better way, I'm doing this all manually.
---
2. The future plan is that you only see the boxes for "how much of each do i want to make" and the total resources needed. As of now everything just sits everywhere as I wrote it all in about an hour.
---
3. This is of course being fixed soon too.
---
I've never posted a picture to Reddit, sorry if I messed it up. Here are all the details:
---
\- I used [LegacyPlayers.com](https://LegacyPlayers.com) to analyse the raids. Thank you Shino for the help too with API.
---
\- I took the most recent 200 raids of MC, BWL, AQ40, NAXX (first 3 are from Northdale, Naxx is from Lightbringer)
---
\- I then weighted each guild (unique list of about 80 in the sample) equally. I.e. if a guild had 30 entries I just averaged class breakdown across those 30.
---
\- Total is an unweighted average of the 4 raids
---
Got some data backing it which I can share but to be honest I don't have much more than what you're seeing here. Can try mine more if requested.
---
My first char past 40 was a ne druid, my main ended up being a gnome warlock. 
---
Have fallen in love and identify with the horde now, tauren feral druid will be my new home for tank and dps. 
---
I'm gonna bite things.
---
Hard to tell from the angle but I think you're right
---
This is the guide I’ve always used:
---
https://legacy-wow.com/alchemy-1-300/
---
I don’t know how optimal it is in terms of cost. Individual server economies would play a part in deciding that. But it doesn’t seem particularly wasteful. 
---
If you’re levelling your alchemy while you level your character, only the Briarthorn will need specific grinding. Pretty much everything else will come easily.
---
What do the numbers mean? Can I get a key or table?

Yeah, look it's worth mentioning (I should have somewhere else) that this is not necessarily representative of Classic when it launches - this is specifically on private servers and only the most recent 200 of each.
---
blizz taking that animation out of the game in legion is what killed humans for me. such a mind blowingly stupid decision
---
As far as we knew there was no classic in development one year ago :o
---
The bars were like 50-60g on my server.
---
Plus dropdown for classes :)
---
Do you mean while leveling or after hitting 60? Because those two methods differ. Especially it differs when you have herbalism. While leveling you want to pre-plan your routes to adapt to herbalism a bit so you don't need to back-track. Keeping up alchemy while leveling this way is very easy, but you are going to craft stuff that benefits your class so they is not a super clear cut way that is applicaple to any class. Also depends on wether you have fishing or not.
---
-25% of the entire raid composition is warrior
---
-As content progresses, Hunters make up roughly 5% of the composition.
---
Looks like mages and warriors are in very high demand!
---
It'll definitely be unique - like nothing seen back in 2005. I can definitely see large groups of people following streamers and being annoying trying to get on the stream, tons of spam, weird events like the ones Asmongold does, guilds devoted to following or trolling big streamers, etc. 
---
And I can't see any legitimately big streamers running on a PvP server. They'd end up getting stream camped every time they get on Twitch unless their followers defend them...  which means there will be random brawls everywhere between grief guilds and stream followers (which honestly, could be pretty cool).
---
Well it's true, but in alliance as hunter you get every mail loot !
---
Even with that low of a number it isn't actually as easy as it looks to fill the spots with good hunters. Many of them are casual/non-raiders or farming alts.
---
No. But if you don't have your epic mount before pvp ranks hit, you might be doing something wrong.
---
No matter what I do I end up playing hunter. So yeah. Maybe will split time with warrior.
---
I kinda want to try other classes, but.. in Classic it will probably take too much time and I am not 14 any more...
---
It was Blade of the Titans.
---
Yeah, you're wrong. Give me Allakhazam instead.
---
What is the average /played time for 1-60 for a experienced player?
---
Any kind soul want to do this kind of thing for a shaman
---
Ah, nasty.
---
Half incorrect it seems.
---
&gt;In truth, singling out any one scientist in a massive, cross-disciplinary group effort like the Event Horizon Telescope’s project is bound to create misapprehensions. Many who shared an equally viral image of Bouman clutching her hands in joy at the sight of the black hole came away wrongly thinking she was the sole person responsible for the discovery, an idea the postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has tried to correct.
---
&gt;“No one algorithm or person made this image,” Bouman wrote on Facebook, “it required the amazing talent of a team of scientists from around the globe and years of hard work to develop the instrument, data processing, imaging methods and analysis techniques that were necessary to pull off this seemingly impossible feat.”
---
Troll shadow priests will be able to proc blackout more often than an undead shadow priest... that may be enough to be able to 1 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 players by catching them by surprise or melting them down fast enough? :D
---
Don't use professions while leveling is the best option.
---
Well his last video was getting downvoted into oblivion and if his actual goal is to debunk how hard naxx really was (not just shit all over that video for personal reasons), making a non-toxic version of this video that will get upvoted is a reasonable thing to do.
---
Nice one, could you do this for all classes?
---
Those sales were probably because of legion though. Legion sold less initially than WOD did as well. WOD and BFA both had hype fueled by their preceding expansions which generally considerd to be very high quality. However, both MOP and Legion had lower initial sales than other expansions while their more poorly received follow ups broke records. 
---
And either way, I wasn't really thinking of BFA or anything to do with the current state of the game when talking about my uncertaibty with the game getting nine more expansions, it's that WoW is going to more and more dated software wise as time goes on, and they are talking about having expansions for more years in the future than wow has existed for now. We have had 8 versions of wow and they are talking about more than doubling that over the course of nearly 20 years. WoW's engine has alreafy encountered issues with stuff like multi threading and storing large numbers for stats and health in the past, and the graphics are already very dated from a technical perspective. I can't see a ton of people still playing WoW in 20 year unless they totally remake the game from the ground up with newer tech, and at that point you may as well just make WoW 2.
---
Any spell you learn can be freely cast regardless of what spec it is tied to. Pyroblast, Frostbolt, fireball, arcane missiles and any other spell that you have learned, either from a Class Trainer, Talent Tree or even from books at level 60 can all be cast in any spec.
---
First one to ungoro means first one to skin devilsaur leather. First one to 60 means forming a guild or being invited to the first few guilds that will fill up. It's a snowball effect, getting ahead gets you ahead.
---
Give you a drink? I think you've had too many.
---
Right.  But your actions are not something to be proud of.  That’s something I’d actually be ashamed of.
---
Thottbot fucking sucked ass to use. The moment wowhead came out I never looked back.

If you aren't willing to listen to advice, it means you already know what you want to do.

---
Watched the 3 episodes, loved them! Perfect timing for me as I created just before watching a toon on a pserver, just reached lvl 5 and stopped so these quests were pretry feesh in my memory.
---
NB: did not help with my impatience, I need to play on a real server, or at the very least know when I will be able to play. More blue posts, fasssssst, plzzzzzzz!!!!
---
Honestly, if we still had to use Thottbot, I would download some quest-helper addon. I really hate to use them, but If i can't find out what to do with a quest from the few paragraphs, after a while I'd rather look it up than abandon it.
---
But if it took 3 minutes to find out, while on a pasty-white cluttered website, I'd probably end up getting an addon for it and spend more time in-game. But, I'm glad we have better websites now, because I hate using those addons, or the modern interface in WoW.
---
Yeah, I’m more debating between herb and tailoring.
---
shaman and paladin are viable tanks, in fact there are more viable tanks than you think.
---
There are synergies but most show up later in leveling (also depending on how you both spec) One good one early (22) works best with a ret and a prot/holy.  The ret's damage will be up because he's attacking from behind, the prot uses seal of justice and the ret judges command whenever a stun procs.  Increases damage for free, saves mana and saves your two good stuns for tight spots or pvp.  Mana conservation is important because you don't get seal of wisdom til 38.
---
The issue is if you ignore what your character has done in previous expansions, you run into the problem where people are asking "why am I picking up shit for this random NPC when I was killing gods two levels ago?"
---
I mean... nothing a twink can do that a max level cant in open world pvp.
---
When I saw those boots I immediately thought of Alabaster Plate Greaves. What a silly thing is our mind, to remember these friggin details while I can't do groceries without a list...
---
Tailor/ench
---
Definitely remaking my old mains, warrior + warlock.
---
That's a really sick screen! I still remember the day The Blade of The Titans dropped for me, also while in Tanaris. I had just gotten the warchief's pauldrons so I felt like a total machine. That sword lasted me for quite awhile and has a very unique model.
---
CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!

*Battle Shouts*
---
Both really surprising answers I was expecting healers to be on this list.
---
What would be better to make money as a mage, tailoring + herbalism or herbalism + skinning or some other combo?
---
I wonder if chests like majordomo and 4 horseman still work the same way in that they can be ninja'd, or if blizzard plans to change it since they are already changing the loot rules for raids anyways.
---
I know Tauren have a larger hit box than any other race in the game.

What about female Tauren? What size is their hitboxm

Kind of reminds me of what happened when EQ launched progression servers.
---
The classes that were in highest need in original EQ became a dime-a-dozen.
---
The classes that were in lowest demand became incredibly rare.
---
Both games suffer from the same tanking dichotomy though.  Grouping takes a higher percentage of tanks than raiding, so no one wants to be a tank because there's no where to go.
---
Hillsbraid farms as a alliance 29 think bracket is awesome. There are lots of friendly units that are mobs for the horde. The horde have a chain quest that require them to go to: the farm, the mine, and “dun” something where the elites are. I’ve killed 60s in the elite place by baiting them to chase me and Aggro a buncha elites.
---
Nothing is hard once you figure it out.
---
Bfa? They brought twinks back? I have a bank FULL of twino gear.
---
Amplify Magic, similar icon to Flash Heal.
---
Except your limited to a few zones. Thats fun too, kind of patrolling Blackrock Mountain, or Burning Steppes for higher levels.
---
If you mean just going to redridge at 60 to kill? IDK why anyone would really spend time doing that. It neither rewards you honor, nor is any fun in any way.
---
Ding ding. 
---
But I switched to paladin so just Ironfoe.
---
Yep. You can turn off xp and still go in bgs with others who hasn't.
---
Oh damn, Ashenvale is the worst. Running through there as a lower level makes you such an easier target. Dont think I've ever willingly PVPd there, yet.

I read something like "just make a macro to switch between show herbs/minerals with spacebar". So you can jumo around from time to time while walking and see both of them... I never tested it by myself and i also dont know how to do it. But the idea is great i think.

any1 ever do a test to see a smite priest + jotc stacking will do more dmg than mages/warlocks?
---
Ya post was edited a couple times so it looks like that now.   Heh
---
Now just remove the stuff you dont need while leveling, such as:
---
Frost Nova Ranks above 1
---
Dampen Magic
---
Detect Magic
---
Arcane Missiles 
---
Mage Armor Ranks above 1 (the spell resists are so little its not worth the cost)
---
Also you have talent abilities listed, but you wont be able to take both.
---
&gt;go back to fortnite
---
i wouldnt have hated if the guy could at least pronounce without a heavy finnish accent or whatever makes him say "enzent" as ancient
---
We will definitely have mods. A lot of great ones too, they will just need to be made still.
---
I thought you were joking. I don't understand how it would at least be beneficial to have skinning while leveling. It's literally free gold.
---
As a hunter I'd expect to be kicked.
---
Hunters have very poor itemization, and their pet damage is unaffected by gear.  Coupled to this 8.6% +hit (5.6% w/ talents) is all they need to have a guaranteed raid slot (for tranq shot).
---
Healers are quite gear dependent simply because they need to maintain a second set of gear if they ever want to be able to do anything outside of a dungeon/raid solo.  And also, there is also frankly more pressure on an under geared healer than an undergeared dps.  If a healer is running out of mana halfway through the fight, it's going to be obvious and on them to hit the consumables hard to supplement.  An undergeared dps is more easily compensated for.
---
Weren't priests the horde tank healers?
---
It depends, people react differently to stimulants based on biology and tolerance. I wouldn't recommend staying up that long though, you can still go pretty hardcore and get maybe 4 or 5 hours of sleep.
---
Better yet, don't hurt your health over a game.
---
Really? I've never actually tried enchanting. For the enchants themselves? Or for the disenchant gold?

Go with adderall bro, just dont get hooked on it :)

Since when do mages have Flash of Light?

I don’t recommend taking staying up for 2 consecutive days or taking drugs cause of the whole “drugs are bad, mkay” but in my experience from university (engineering) if you’re gonna pull that much time and need to be awake, do coffee and water the first day, lots of vegetables and fruit (this might just be a mental “im not destroying my body” thing) and then pop the adderall when you start fading at night.  Headphones with energetic repetitive electronic/house music and have fun. 
---
Not a doctor.
---
Then (nov 2005): 11 yrs old, ex runescape player who got told “play a rogue so you can kill everyone” but my older uncle who was a mage. 
---
Now: jet pilot, stoked to relive some classic WoW! Torn between going back as a rogue or Druid this time around (I mained Druid from TBC and on).
---
After you've been up for too long it won't be worth it.  I wouldnt suggest doing more than 18/6.  You get your mind back after some sleep and you get some rested xp.
---
Haha that would be amazing to try. I'd probably just get my ass beat by the elites though.
---
Bow specialization will be useless for 99% of hunters 99% of the time.
---
At 51 the BiS weapon is a crossbow, and stays a crossbow except for the brief period between a hunter completing their epic quest and getting ashje're thul.
---
Berserking still wins though, assuming the version of it that affects spells, melee, and ranged is what goes live.
---
Just dont die, people have died from to much wow already ;-;
---
Great that I only had to spin 2 times for Mage.

I keep forgetting at least 2 or 3 of those warriors are tanks and offtanks. At first I was wondering why there were almost 10 warriors and barely 4 warlocks.

If you were leveling an alt after phase 2 hits do you think rank 3 is easily attained before hitting 60?

It costs you time, the one resource we are in short supply of.

Yeah sorry I've been trying to figure out how I can scrape tank/healer info to then allocate to roles... but at present this is all I've got and it took a few days :(
---
Thank you for writing this that my stupid obsessive side is satisfied without actually having a need to explain it myself :-)
---
&gt;in my experience from university (engineering)
---
Elaborate, please. What happened? How many days did you go without sleeping?
---
Simple question:
---
WHEN?
---
hey what's the name of that font? i can't seem to remember it
---
Very viable. Most levelling gear comes from quests so you’re rarely contesting for gear. Even when you do, you’re mates so it’s easy enough to come up with something between yourselves to keep it fair. If one (or both) of you levels protection, you’re a ready made dungeon team (LFM 3DPS).
---
If you’re both gonna heal in raids then you’ll be competing for pre-raid BiS but you’ll find it so easy to find groups so gearing will be quick anyway (LFM 3DPS again) and everyone else in your groups will be after DPS gear anyway.
---
whats your experience on it?
---
I am a warrior at heart. I enjoy facetanking and the rage mechanic to my core. Sadly, I'll end up playing a pet class because I don't have any time to be social anymore. I am looking at about 6 hours per week of available time, all of it at the detriment of sleep. But I sometimes dream of it. Of what it could be. Of what it could have been...
---
Yeah. It actually is the time.
---
This is a brilliant fucking idea
---
Yes! Thank you.
---
I dont get hungry, stay highdrated, u forget about sleep.. amazing
---
It would be cool if there was a website with similar skills/level layout like this image.
---
You could then select which skills you want to learn asap and which can wait until you have some spare money.
---
At the bottom of each level it would sum up the total cost of the skills you have selected and maybe even factor in the rep duscount.
---
This way you could use this website to plan ahead your build. You'd know at which level you should go back to the trainer and how much gold you need to have.
---
Just throwing it out there in case there are any aspiring web developers out there
---
Good lordt

---
Please use our Monday LFG stickied thread, thank you.
---
Enough that I have a good reason for the first sentence of my post! In my opinion its not really worth it, because you’ll get eclipsed by the players that take a more moderate approach as soon as you crash, which you will. I slept for like 14 hours after the last time I did this and in your situation that will likely wipe out all the gains you make in the first 48 hours.
---
I thought druids were the “worst” healers of vanilla
---
sometimes doing only 18/6 isnt enough because of the tryhards that will be going hard aswell
---
Being awake for over 48 hours while hopped up on drugs and caffeine?..
---
Yeah, noone ever died from that... /s
---
Posting so I remember this
---
Idd, not many people would have put the extra effort in, but instead took the rage out on those who didn't like it. Kudos to OP.
---
Why even bother? Chances are that the following days you'll feel sick or just feel so uncomfortable that you might be unable to play, so whats the point?
---
If you are going for some world/realm first lvl 60 or some shit then just account-share like all the other tryhards...
---
Man I must be getting old cause i don't consider the 2000s to be _anything close_ to the "early internet" lol...
---
The combo staying up for 2+ days with energy drinks is quite harmfull for your heart. Those drinks will reduce the blood vessels' diameter, so your heart has to work harder. When you stay awake for 2+ days you already ask alot from your body. Its quite dangerous what youre planning. Dont do it.
---
I don't really have an ego with respect to WoW like I did back in the day. I'm fine with Warlocks getting loot priority as it makes the raid better. I just want to play and contribute. I can't commit to a raid schedule, so I don't expect any sort of loot priority and I can't afford to be a necessary class. I'd feel bad playing Holy/Disc and taking loot over other healers that can commit to a schedule.
---
&gt;I slept for like 14 hours after the last time I did this and in your situation that will likely wipe out all the gains you make in the first 48 hours.
---
Thats the problem, if needed im gonna have to go 3 days, or even 4  days without sleeping to not fall behind and lose all of my gains.
---
I was wondering when someone would make this joke, it was only a matter of time.
---
People have always said here you really only want 2-4 druids/hunters, shouldn't really be a surprise.
---
I'm going a Paladin though.
---
I'm gonna need both.

I have now moved most of the math out of sight and added color to the columns that the user needs to care about. If you got the time, can you take another look? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1384lv6M3hY4ensedLi8Sua6sDDdfeIZ2GBxVl6SBPOY/edit#gid=1380585187
---
Would you please post paladin next?
---
Believe they specifically stated that during the Blizzcon presentation.
---
im 21 what is the chance of me having a heart attack while doing it?
---
guess its for some specific build where you take hemo at 46? 
---
in reality hemo can be taken from level 30 not 46.
---
and where is cold blood, riposte, ghostly strike, blade fury, adrenaline rush, preparation, premeditation.
---
Unless you're trying to risk lifelong auditory hallucinations don't do this. You will hit 60 faster if you plan a sleep schedule, rather then crashing for 10 hours from exhaustion.
---
So on one hand, I started in patch 2.2 and played lock since then, on the other hand I'd like to try something different. On the other other hand, wheel picked lock...
---
How about you dont bother with 2+ days?
---
Plan for 18-24 hours and use coffee/energy drugs. If anything at the end you will feel tired(obviously, and reasonably because your body is telling you something), sleep 8h and then just continue. You can even put in 18-24h again and its not as bad as going 2days straight.
---
Take care of your body man.
---
Yep, I checked a few weeks ago and I have a few old emails from a few items I had transferred to me from guildies. Old ass 14 year old emails. In one of them they told me I could only xfer so many items per account, which is interesting. I didnt remember that part.
---
Oh shit, sanctioned bullying?
---
You’re getting into very dangerous territory there my friend. You’re far better off to do 18/6 and sleep during peak server hours. If you really want a boost in the first day, consider the adderall but just know you’ll crash not long after it wears off.
---
Any guild worth dedicating your life to their raid schedule will be bringing the player they interviewed and accepted. Not looking at a list of players and deciding who to bring based on class. You should have mentioned thisto avoid scaring new players into picking something they don't have their heart set on.
---
Just mix the energy drinks with aspirin (blood thinner) and problem solved! jk jk
---
Pvp &gt; horde&gt; warlock&gt; race&gt; min/ max

What would you consider best? Having a rng way out of stuns, or the extra “trinket” from wotf

6-7 days realistically on a fresh pvp server
---
Locks only start going crazy with threat post BWL from what I recall.
---
In a 40-man raid, each dps'er needs to avg 125 dps for the duration of the Ragnaros fight in order to carry his weight.
---
It's not a high bar.
---
I’m curious about this. What do you do differently than other warlocks that makes you stand out so much? Is it just because most people that want to play caster dps play mages because it feels more like the default? Why the differentiation regarding alliance? The player mindset being more casual?
---
I remember there was a huge difference between warlock dps in my raids back in the day but I can’t remember what the difference between the warlocks was. I do feel like a lot didn’t feel like they needed to try hard because of utility though
---
This ultimately means two things. Since they don't want to manually have to deal with much:
---
* There wont be able transferring of items via GM ticket
---
* Right Click Report is DEFINITELY going to be in the game, with the squelch and all.
---
I dont mind #1 personally. But #2 is going to infuriate the trolls and spammers.
---
You did an amazing job, OP. It is more than enough.
---
Sanc for AoE threat, Light gives you (the healer) the easiest time, most warriors bitch for Kings though, even though theyre better off with Light
---
speedrunners recommend to take a minimum 72 hour straight and then 3~4hr sleep sessions

Double ret, or one prot and one holy would be fine. prot/holy would likely be faster since they can aoe grind but pallies tend to be pretty slow overall. On the plus side, you would likely never die unless ganked, and few people want to bother ganking 2 paladins at the same level unless they outnumber.
---
Who said I was proud? I shared what I thought. I don’t care what you would or wouldn’t be ashamed of. All I’m saying is your video looks like it would be boring to watch and I’m happy I didn’t waste my time viewing it. Seems like it would be shit.
---
i dont have anyone to account share with

Can alliance mages learn portal to theramore in classic or was that added in TBC?
---
Of course it's not a hard and fast rule, but when the game is explicity stating that the content of their game is aimed towards a mature audience, you have to set your expectations accordingly. As a parent, would you let your kid go to a bar as a 14 year old when the legal drinking age is 18? Would you let your 9 year old hang out with teenagers at a party? You'd have reservations about it because you know your kid hasn't developped the mental resilience to deal with harassment and bullying. In an MMORPG, you are completely anonymous, and no one will care about how old you are when you roll on a staff as a hunter because the Need option was available. You're hurting the community by letting underaged kids play a game meant for a more mature playerbase.
---
It has now been updated with less visible clutter and some color!
---
...and my AXE!
---
Listen......1-125 year olds can die staying up 48 hrs on Adderall and or coffee and water. Now if you do want to risk death to be ahead at least get up every 2-3 hrs and move around.
---
Lack of sleep is never good regardless of how old you are. I'm no doctor so I can't tell what the chances for a heart attack would be but i'm pretty sure that you'll feel very dizzy and have headache the following days and obviously be very tired. :P
---
I wasn't criticising. However you've made me think: perhaps if you insert a smaller line inside the warrior's box, somewhat cutting off 3 of them as tanks. Then you just need to already know that the Druids, Paladins, Priests and Shamans are all healers.
---
i think i'd really confuse ppl, since ppl look at this to plan when they get what ability. name it "when to return to town" guide then.
---
what’s your current process? I know some stuff that might help depending on your process
---
If this included specs that would be a lot more helpful.
---
Those are optional because they are talented, if you have nothing positive to add, move along.
---
Let’s make one for each
---
I would have been happy to progress, but don’t start ninjalooting your core players in the middle of the raid. We all spoke on vent - this could have been discussed like adults upfront and I would have had no objections.
---
Being a mercenary tank thot was more fun to me anyways. Might do that again in Classic.
---
Ninja's on servers were usually kicked out a guild and ostracized by the server.  This was back when you needed two accounts to be a Horde and an Alliance on the same server.
---
Becoming a ninja increased when Blizz implemented server transfers.  All those accounts suddenly disappeared, a new name on a new server having the same armory stats appeared, and while it could never be proven -- ninja's became more bold and brazen.
---
In WOTLK, ninja's would put together pugs, give drops only to certain people within the raid (even though the rules were announced beforehand) -- and sadly, even their guilds didn't care if/when this occurred.  They just shrugged their shoulders.
---
Players became far more toxic, guilds became far more toxic, and less 'teamwork' and more "what's in this for me" attitudes.
---
You should practice leveling on a private server a few times before launch
---
have fun playing with ur health i guess good luck
---
There's no way for someone to know what type of ammo you're using. If you're worried about it keep one thorium arrow arrow or whatever in your bags that you can link in chat.
---
Classic should be classic and if you are paying for multiple accounts, I don't see a problem with this.
---
Speak for yourself.  I sit outside the mt entrance to wetlands for hours pickin off low levels
---
Warlocks please!
---
Warlock please!
---
welp, then don't even bother with lvl 60 first because you'll never be able to beat those that account share, no matter how many days you stay awake.
---
1k Needles and Hillsbrad are probably the big spot for Allys, lots of Horde around from 25-35, good for 19, 29 and 39 twinks. Stonetalon and Ashenvale are OK but less populated. Barrens is actually all right at 19 as well.
---
STV I found a tough time because youre really restricted to the north at level 29, the mobs are just everywhere in STV and will kind of wreck you near the mid-south areas. Its mostly great for 39s though
---
Them risking their health is enough for you to go "must be fine" then? Even considerung drugs?
---
Dude. Stop being stupid, go as far with that 18h as you can, and you will still be at the top.
---
This brings back a lot of memories. I remember looking at the Skeleton Warrior render in this manual. I thought it was such a mystery as a kid, how powerful would I need to be to defeat that thing?
---
And then I ran into Raven Hill and got rekt. :/
---
Basically its a free profession since you disenchant all the shit you make from tailoring.   Then at higher levels you add enchants to the gear you make and sell.
---
Daring post

Met my wife on a Scarlet Monestary run in 2005 and we are living happily ever after.  The end.

It's different depending on the class.
---
"Yo, hey Petey how about you let me in dem pearly gates?"
---
" lawl....Bruh you didn't even make it to 60 you scrub, rofl..."
---
First thing I noticed is that "Elixir of Water Breathing" is missing. It's a fairly low level Elixir and trust me, at level 16, there will be more than a few druids wanting them to make their aquatic form quest much easier.
---
I’m completely fine with this and hope they keep it in.  Most people seem to prefer no changes, and this is certainly low on the priority list of things I’d want looked at.
---
I'll put it in!

Middle schooler with too much free time.

No one do warlocks!!

Replace any, with a low health or fresh 60 warlock and you are spot on.  Once that lock is rocking 6k+ hp with -40% physical damage taken you arent aimed+multishot critting that to death any time soon.

Blade of the Titans was thicc before thicc existed
---
Fuck no
---
Never raided on horde, can someone explain this meme?
---
And still, frostmage rotation is just one skill.
---
I'm maining a warrior so I definitely plan on having a farming alt, but I'm having trouble deciding between mage and hunter. My SO is going mage as his main class, and I was wondering if two mages together could farm some crazy shit and/or instances? Or would a mage and hunter be more efficient since they have different toolkits?
---
Magic exists in azeroth, they are reincarnated and want vengeance.
---
I never noticed the sheep is chewing grass.
---
Planed to main a hunter, spun the wheel.....Hunter. All hail the wheel !
---
Huhuran and Visc must be really messed up in that nost syntax. I mean alliance going up against those with only 3 nature resistance auras sounds rough.
---
I mean we know that they have boss armor values set up by guesswork. If (and that's a big IF) tips out's source is truly one of the people who ran the original Nost they openly admitted that they had no idea about the boss armor. Not to mention that most P-servers allow -armor debuffs to stack which never did on classic (f-fire+reckless, expose+sunder - those pairs were always exclusive and while you could place f-fire and reckless on the same target you only got the anti escape/fear mechanic onto the npc with it not any additional armor pen)
---
Correct! Lots of things would make it more helpful :) It's a mission though as there's no API query for what I'm looking for, so this is all collected through pulling up each raid and scraping the class details
---
If I need to wait over 10 minutes for a game, I would really prefer to have a game with battlegroup players than wait.
---
If games can pop faster under 10 minutes with just my sever, than by all means.
---
My $0.02
---
Because you cant provide any legit counter arguments. I keep bringing it up until you can actually address it.
---
Isn't human really good due to the weapon mastery ? At least pve wise on alliance.
---
Its not fair and ruins gameplay by turning it into casual handholding retail or you enhance the gameplay by letting players play as double agents. If you want a babying handholding casual experience, retail is that way.
---
Very nice work OP. One thing that surprised me I would have expected to see a slightly more pronounced melee preference for horde.
---
Personally I would go hunter because I find them more fun through all stages of pvp.  Hunters hard counter some classes and have fair matchups vs all the others short of SL warlocks.
---
SL warlocks counter pretty much everything if you have the correct pet out for that engagement.  Stack the stam and int gear early on for pvp and you will have a lot more fun than trying to be a high spell damage immobile glass cannon.
---
That's a fine way to look at it and more power to you. I wish more people thought like this, unfortunately that's not the case tho.
---
It increases the gold you loot from beast mobs by 20%. That gets you your mount faster, which I say saves way more time.
---
restorative potion clears 1 magic and 1 curse every 5 sec. meanwhile a walrock can only pop one invuln potion to buy him/herself time until the hunter unloads the next combo after 10 seconds.
---
It isn't uncommon for a warlock to kill the hunter. But if they do - they usually watch the hunter die to dots - as a corpse
---
It gave me Paladin, Shaman and Druid, which are exactly the three classes I've been debating on rolling.
---
Thanks.
---
Hey, people can enjoy what they want. I just feel like killing grays is as fun as doing a slam dunk on a 2 ft basket.
---
Same tbh
---
Aslong as its not done inside instances, i dont see any problem with it at all. If you have a 60 friend willing to spend so many hours just killing mobs for you. Then go for it imo.
---
honestly thats the part I most dislike about Classic, one class being tier one for both tanking and dps is not right. Some could even say that warriors are the cream of the crop as far as damage goes which is crazy to me.
---
If it's anything along the actual time line of wow, phase 2 will be about 4 months down the road from launch. As far as getting rank 3 before hitting 60... It's possible if you grind PvP while leveling. BGs give a massive amount of honor in comparison to just killing players since there's diminishing returns (I believe after you kill 1 player 4 times they give no honor).
---
check where the 'famous' streamers go and pick a different server. No point in playing on a goon server that will be empty in 1-2 months
---
Nef’s shaman call summons a nice crop of corrupted totems, including Windfury. When Nef reaches 20%, all his adds are revived for an AoE phase. Giving 42 undead draconids windfury is an easy recipe for a wipe.
---
I’ve been researching what class to role.
---
Warriors do seem to make a lot of sense, seeing as how they can rank and top meters, I agree with you
---
And conflagrate is also actually a hand
---
Totems......shaman class call was one of the worst on nef. Healing totem can heal nef quite a bit at the worst possible times
---
1. instant posion is not "talented", and not optinal.  
---
2. he shows some of these abilities but from rank 2. like hemo (you said its talented optional ability).   
---
3. its positive, cos i care i wouldn't confuse and misguide ppl. it confused me already though i'm not new to vanilla wow. how new players gonna perceive it. calling it a skill field guide is a misguidence.
---
I think I remember time of day was on launch but the cycling was changed to a shorter cycle so people who played at night wouldn't be permanently playing at night on the client.
---
Druid ? I don't think so...though it is tempting. Powershifting and gnomeregan pummerlers for average dps is a pain though.  
---
Healing isn't my cup as well, and moonkins are memes. Bears, while usefull, are boring as hell :(
---
Lol eviscerate every 8 levels, I had no idea it was so formulaic.
---
Thanks! and same! I'm thinking about rolling Rogue and I literally ran this just to see if Alliance or Horde had more rogues - was surprised with the results...
---
Nailed it!   
---
Its just a game, you load up and you play.   
---
The best games in history use this model.
---
Mob tagging is fine. If people are willing to spend $ on multiple accounts then they should be able to spend their time how they choose.
---
We've already gone over this.
---
Best debunking if that morons video yet.
---
Oh nice! I like hard mode!
---
EQ had it even better. They dump you right outside your starting city with no explanation wtf is going on at all.
---
This is it right here.  Anyone who catches you fighting a mob can just jump on you at low hp and you are almost always screwed.  FAPs are nice but... a mage is just gonna poly you until it wears off, rogue gonna reset til its gone, hunter should just be out of range and not even worried about a fap or scatter and trap you...  FAP can be nice when you are on the offensive tho and especially when you have backup.
---
Hey better late than never on the college!
---
Damn so much.   
---
College. Career. Land. House. Livestock.  Wife. Kids.
---
I had two accounts starting in dec 2004 and I distinctly remember that actually not working for mobs jn the world, was one of the first things I tried.  I never did the dropping group in instances though so perhaps it works inside instances.  
---
Maybe I’m remembering wrong, but I just remember the only bonus I was able to get having two accounts very early in wow was helping out when I pulled too much and running myself through elite quests and instances for gear and quests.
---
Mob tagging on mobs that were grey to the higher level resulted in drastically less exp for the lower level on the demo when I tested it.
---
Orc &gt; Undead you can always get trinket, the passive stun resist is much better than racial trinket
---
Hell yea on finding love in the game!
---
Yea a majority of tryhards flock to mage because they start scaling way sooner and don't completely rely on bloodvine to do dps.
---
A large portion of the vanilla warlock community plays horde for the pvp racials. These are the tryhard min/max type. These same players likely undervalue blessing of salvation. Warlocks have the highest threat of any dps besides warrior.
---
So the pvp tryhards go horde and the pve tryhards go alliance.  For the casual playerbase will of the forsaken is way more appealing so you see the middle ground players, the ones who want to min/max some but not a ton go horde for the pvp convenience. This leaves us with casuals who don't care about pvp or min/maxing and are playing alliance mostly for RP reasons.
---
Because warlocks are so bad in early patches a lot of them do slack and get away with it because the class is so underplayed early game you can't replace them if you tried.
---
lol
---
The info presented: good.   
---
The smug butthole attitude: bad.
---
Give us some details! Were you the tank that successfully taunted Mograine off of your healer future wife?
---
I think I'm gonna roll a hunter just to use the lvl 1 arrows.
---
Then: 2005, high school freshman. Stayed up late at night to play, slogged through the next day, and took 2 hour naps every day after school. Loner with a few close friends.
---
Now: 28 years old, in a 6 year relationship/live with GF, desk job at an office working second shift. Super excited to get back in to classic.
---
...you definitely can
---
Yes :) They are usually on AH by someone who just afk crafts it.
---
With no other context given, tell me if I should play hunter or mage...
---
Pre phase 3 ofc
---
I'm now working on Warrior.
---
How many guilds did you include in that? Of which skill level? Of which servers? Did you look up old MC/BWL logs prior to AQ release or are these recent clears?
---
I don't really know how difficult they are on classic. Pservers they have varied a ton sometimes easy sometimes hard.
---
Legit argument : it was like that in vanilla. U can delete ur topic now.
---
Why prevent this?
---
Lol!!!!!!!! nice original post.
---
It works and yes it works in dungeons too (it was fixed in wrath I think when athene abused it to get world first 80), assuming blizzard doesn't change it.
---
There is definitely issues with multiboxing, honestly multiboxing in itself is a cancer but blizzard doesn't care when multiboxers pay extra money.
---
Personally, yes. That makes total sense and considering that most gear at that level is quickly replaced I wouldn't be strict in my groups at all.
---
Once you're dealing with pre-bis stuff it gets a little more touchy I would say.
---
I still think its good to communicate with your party to avoid anyone getting butt hurt.
---
Seriously! I had never been so confused as a human that couldn't see at night in Freeport.
---
I ran too far and zoned into East Commonlands. I went exploring and was promptly eaten by a lion. I ran around like an idiot trying to get my body so I could get my food and noob sword back. I screamed my head off until someone offered to help and we eventually found my body. That was the beginning of a 5 year online friendship.
---
strange that alli has less warlock at all times, even tho lock raid issue until t3 is threat, and salva&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tat
---
Correct
---
The point of the video is to be a smug butthole, he's putting on a persona....
---
I kind of sympathize with the bug :u
---
Don't get me wrong, classic is a great game and I'm gonna play it, but there's so many oversights and incomplete ideas.
---
Like, the epic 2h sword Destiny, I love that thing, but -no- class that can use it would do so since their abilities mostly lean directly off weapon damage. Goes for 1h weapons too.
---
Underdeveloped specs, debuff limits, etc. 
---
(Half baked post, but ive been awake too long to brain good, might come back to fill it out better)
---
Reckoning is just a meme spec for wpvp, it is so bad in bgs
---
And the Fire Ward icon has a gryphon on the shield.
---
The only mage trainer in kalimdor is in theramor 
---
:(
---
Fishing/Cooking.   
---
Or you could have two crafting professions and pay close attention to the market prices for crafting materials. Know when the cost is low enough that you'll earn more money from your crafted items than you spend on materials.
---
I mean it's a complete long shot that they might emulate patch features to such a strong degree, but I highly doubt it considering other decisions they're making.  
---
In fact I'm 99% confident these features will be based on 1.12
---
It's pretty fun especially when you go against high lvls with twink gear. 1vx is cool too.
---
Rep is hard to get in vanilla, don't waste easy rep. Get there asap
---
there's a cinematic? you skip that shit ofc
---
Yep. You really only need, at most, 3 hunters because they don't do that much DPS (past MC), so they're really only useful for tranq shot and kiting and maybe frost trap on some trash packs.
---
Same with Druid, they do less healing than the other healers, but still provide mark of the wild, thorns, and brez/innervate. You really don't want more than 4 healing druids.
---
if I should play hunter or mage...
---
Fucking brilliant
---
You should add a 'total' on the bottom so you know when you can afford going back only once, should you be short on gold.
---
One of my favorite dungeons. So weird and sprawling, with hallways, rooms, and little nooks that most groups bypass. I spent a lot of time solo exploring it on my rogue because as a Hordesman, it was hard to find groups willing to go there.
---
Depends on the spec. You can have single role specs and hybrid specs that allow you to perform multiple roles with just a gear change.
---
If it has boar in the name and looks like a boar, it's a fucking boar
---
Me also, it's on such a bad position
---
Then (20): second year Uni with no prospects after graduation, lonely, broke, living on campus, never traveled abroad. 
---
Now (33) (yes I played all this time!): switched to an IT career, amazing bf who unknown to me played the same class/spec as me since 2004- combat rogues FTW, house, friends, two cats, traveled in almost all of Europe and heading for Asia this year. 
---
As a side note, I met my dearest friend in wow 10 yrs ago, the person who all these years helped me change my life for the better.
---
&gt;Multiboxers could effectively level their other alts on different accounts using this strategy extremely fast.
---
Okay... and?
---
I was a priest back in vanilla, healers are very gear dependent but they also get gear easier. A healer that shows up consistently will never want for gear.
---
I don't think there's really anything you can 2man farm as any of these combinations. Hunter is better if tribute doesn't get nerfed, I think it will be nerfed but we don't know.
---
TBC.
---
Best of 7 and I got rogue 4 times.  Guess I know now.
---
You seem to be confusing retail, where your role is tied directly to your spec, with vanilla where you have more freedom and can actually create a hybrid spec.
---
Ah, if this is the case I think it's extra important to make that very clear when joining the group.
---
You may be hybrid spec, but coming into a group to heal it will be assumed that you're there for healing gear.
---
If you're a feral/resto hybrid and you join as a healer to a Mara Princess run I would expect you not to roll on Blackstone Ring. If it's something you plan on going after I would expect you to make that clear from the get go so we can have transparency going forward.
---
It would also be prudent as the group leader myself to ask if anyone else needs the item I'm going for as well, since I may opt to invite a different healer instead, but that doesn't always happen.
---
Herb+skinning can work great if you are farming diremaul north+east. But there's not really any other farm spots that utilizes both at same time, but having both does give more options.
---
Sunder and Expose armor do not stack on current private servers. The only private servers "quirk" is that some allow tanks to still cast Sunder Armor to generate threat despite Expose while back in retail vanilla that was not possible because a stronger similar effect was already applied. But only the stronger armor reduction effect of Expose armor is applied to the boss.
---
What are you using to scrape your data?
---
Mage.
---
Depends on class and experience. I think 6 days is pretty realistic, but you can go all the way down to 3-5 speedleveling.
---
Gotta do something, while you're waiting for that next weapon swing amirite
---
Use the tilde key (next to number 1)
---
Tailoring doesn't offer much as warlock other than perhaps farming satyrs and using demonic runes to make gear. I think herbalism would be better.
---
Personally I think extra attention should be paid to server faction balance. When I grinded through the ranks Alliance had instant queues but due to severe population imbalance while the horde were all forced to wait 40 minutes for a WSG pop. If half the horde rerolled alliance the queue times could've  been 5-10 mins for both sides.
---
One of the best parts of world PVP was getting some revenge against the people you fought in the BG. Sure cross-server BGs are better than a 40 minute wait but at the same time that's almost a last resort.
---
Professions, healing stratlive, 2manning diremaul east.
---
All solid gold makers.
---
I don't know about other private servers but on the one I am on the alliance just use a little more NR and spam elixirs of poison resistance to remove the poison debuff. Once it is frozen people just mass-sapper (35+ engineers) all the adds and thus kill it in one phase.
---
Where do you find this information? I'd be willing to make them similar to OP if I knew info
---
Is Ret Paladin ok to start as a main, or would Warrior be better for dps and maybe tanking?
---
Yeah unfortunately you can't have more than 1 hot on same target, so people don't usually have that many druids. But tbh I don't think anyone has ever really struggled to find a guild as a resto druid.
---
Herb / skinning..
---
drop skinning at 60 for tailoring.. make epic robe... drop tailoring for eng... keep herb for DM farming
---
It's just PVE.
---
Awesome!
---
Thanks dad!
---
I for some reason assumed it was some kind of mountain/volcano erupting. This certainly makes more sense, though.
---
Enchanting is one of the most expensive professions to level and you will have a really hard time making gold from it. 
---
While leveling you will not make any gold from enchanting, since no one will pay you for low level enchantments. And you need to enchant all the green items you find, and lose the gold from selling them to vendors.
---
And at max level, you really need some rare recipes to make money. And most guild will have an dedicated enchanter, who will enchant for free or just for the mats.
---
&gt;brief period between a hunter completing their epic quest and getting ashje're thul.
---
This period is NOT brief at ALL.
---
This is the same memory I have. We'll just have to see though!
---
Most guilds don't just kick/bench all their guys just because AQ launches. Our raid setup actually didn't change because most people have very high attendance and the class balance was very good to begin with (roughly what the picture shows).
---
hard to get gear though because of that.
---
They worked out your surname and made a new account with the same surname and posed as a family member and transferred it off. Have done the same thing myself back in the account trading days of early TBC
---
Likely simply because gnomes and humans are somewhat more bland visually than orcs and undead, making getting more locks slightly harder throughout.
---
Dwarfs are always gonna be better in pvp, on most races.   
---
But one thing you have as a NE is hiding at flags in AB, its very fun and in most cases wins you the fight, when they dont expect a healer to be there.  
---
Other than that NIght elf priest racials dont help you at all.   
---
And i dont think anyone will interupt your starshard. they will let you cast it, and waste time not healing or doing anything productive.
---
Rather see gear drop and take a stab at it than not get invited to the raid (hunter/druid) lol
---
How can a sex robot be nsfw when people are paid to make them?
---
Play both, start with hunter and slowly lvl mage over time with aoe farm. Play hunter while trying to prebis and pug on mage, and then when ZG comes out quit your hunter because hunters are then trash, and play a mage because they become ballers
---
Where do you find info?
---
Must be nice when bosses have incorrect armor values and sunder stacks with expose armor.... Too bad both of those things are wrong in actual 1.12
---
There's going to be a lot of disappointed fury warriors
---
The point is many news articles were claiming she was solely responsible.
---
Just search for "wow vanilla [instert class] spells", google it you lazy asses
---
How is the downtime/overall loving experience of mage?
---
Didn’t play them until much later xpacs. Always having food, and being solid DPS is very appealing.
---
There are usually just fewer warlocks on alliance side compared to horde side (because of pvp/undead racials mostly).
---

the Early 2000s were when most consumers started gaining access to not only internet, but decently fast internet. Sure, it was around beforehand but it was mostly usenet groups and the like. It wasn't until the late 90s/early 2000s that the internet as we know it started to really take form. So, yeah, early 2000s is definitely the early internet for most people.

&gt;Expose Armor. For one thing it prevented warriors from Sundering so you couldn't use it by default in most group settings, and it was terrible solo since it was a finisher and by the time you're ready to drop a finisher on mobs solo they're usually close to death.
---
​You have no need to sunder after expose armor is applied, sunder is worse threat per rage than other spells, and improved expose armor is gives more armor reduction.
---
Also it's amazing in pvp you can do some really cool stuff with sap, cheap shot(without auto), expose armor(without auto), and then restealth and open

I remember making my first at age 6. I finished it, and in my new found pride, opened the wrong side of the red and white black pepper tin, and poured several tablespoons worth of black pepper on my sandwich. I took it out side to shake off my bologna, and the dog cane over and snorted in the cloud of pepper and sneezed non stop for several minutes. My sandwich was still quiet spicy, but it was my sandwich, dammit.

---
Desperate Prayer is an amazing PvP ability, Fear Ward is also really good. Elunes Grace is garbage all the time and Star Shards is pretty useless for PvP. You could try to use it for kick baiting, but a good Rogue is going to see that youre casting Star Shards and not bother.
---
Arcane Shot as hunter had 1:1 scaling with spellpower in vanilla, it was insane. And really fun to see a hunter oneshotting with it.
---
Warlock's drain soul with the improved drain soul talent. I love playing Warlocks, and the mana regen from improved drain soul is too good to pass up while leveling. However in order to get that regen you have to drain soul on every mob you kill before it dies, creating a soul shard each time. This will completely fill your bags with soul shards unless you manually delete them or use a macro to delete them for you. This is a clumsy and annoying mechanic marring the otherwise elegant warlock play style.
---
They are tanks too.
---
But meanwhile in TBC you literally have 1 of each utility class then fill dps with hunter/warlock. It's not like it improved at all.
---
This is dope.  It would be nice if there was also some extra emphasis for the first time you learn a given spell somehow, maybe just a border around the icon?
---
Right now it's super useful for answering "What do I learn at X level?", but a little too cluttered to quickly answer  "When do I learn X?"
---
Hey, so all the details you're looking for are in my post (I didn't know how to write something as well as post a picture so it's all written in a comment above).
---
You're right in that it won't be perfectly representing MC at launch, and BWL at release, etc. but I'm not sure exactly which dates and raid IDs to use for the analysis - was easier to take last 200 for each raid on the servers listed.
---
Yeah I guess that does make sense. Damn it 😂
---
She was true one the rest of the group had to convince TO TAKE ME OFF /IGNORE in order to run the instance.

---
Good old Emerald Dream.
---
oh it's just VBA in Excel. To be honest it doesn't matter what's used in this case IMO as the limitation is waiting for the site to load the raid
---
Ahhh I see, that's sad but makes sense 🥺🥺
---
I'm happy with Classic for now, but I wouldn't mind if they had a new reveal along those lines in a year or so :)
---
Dwarf is still stronger overall because of fear ward and stoneform. Night elf is the most offensive priest though on the alliance side so it’s not an awful option like some people might say.
---
Figured it was something like that. That sucks.
---
Well done vid. We need more lore vids like this to balance out all the leveling guides, money guides, profession guides ECT. Sometimes we forget the game also has immersive interesting stories.
---
As a dwarf you can remove with stoneform very bane of your existence - the Viper Sting. And also Blinds and crippling poison.
---

---
If the point of this analysis if to compare the evolution of raid compositions between raid tiers, it would be more accurate to only consider logs for each raid before the release of the next one. 
---
If you're looking up logs after AQ/Naxx release the number of casters may be inflated and not accurate for a reliable analysis, that's all I'm saying.

As for huhuran and visc, 3 auras is enough, you have hunters go full NR so they don't need the aura. For viscidious you can literally just spam https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=3386
---
I use VBA to load up a raid, e.g.  [https://legacyplayers.com/RaidLoading/?rid=22449&amp;exp=0&amp;uploader=35273](https://legacyplayers.com/RaidLoading/?rid=22449&amp;exp=0&amp;uploader=35273) 
---
Then I scrape the details in bottom right about raid comp. My next step would probably be to try and pull down the classes listed in top right (healing done) to figure out which healer classes are actually healing... but then I need to make a decision on what minimum healing constitutes a healer. (And re-run all the scraping :) )
---
Oh and my detail about all the raid IDs is just by copy-paste the main raid page that has the last 20 raids listed out.
---
The problem with closing off servers to people is that a LOT of people play WoW to play together. So if an old player gets somebody new into the game, theyre going to want to play on the same server and that old player isnt going to want to give up his character to roll a new server.
---
I think Blizz just needs to keep on top of free server transfers, youre idea for making it 1 faction only is a good one though.
---
Because if someone already made it into a nice picture-chart, then why wouldn't I just use that? Fuck off.
---

It's crazy how easily false information spreads with just ONE video saying this bullshit. This has NEVER been the case on ANY private server.

---
Can I raid as dps 2h arms? Or should I be swapping to fury?
---
Yo, take it easy man.. stop trying to make people think for themselves.. this is a community of hand holding and circle jerking.
---
What on Earth?
---
1 resto druid is great, 2 resto druids works, 3 resto druids is a disaster. And not many raids use feral druids (on horde side, at least), the ones that do often only run 1 resto druid. Nobody uses moonkins.
---
So that's 1-3 druids per horde raid and 2-3 druids per alliance raid.
---
Happy for you
---
I only know that you had a limit of restore destroyed items
---
Play your warrior my friend.  I have 3 hours a week at a set time to play with my brethren and I'll be damned if I dont do it on a warrior
---
That's right, this is what I wanted to do in the first place, but I couldn't find any servers that had just released MC/BWL (given that classic's coming out soon). Would have been a lot of pages back to find the release dates.
---
If you can give me any specific dates when certain servers launched MC / BWL I'd be happy to mine it and see the difference?
---
I'm old enough to remember Athene losing his world first and getting banned in WOTLK for the instance XP exploit.
---
(Speaking of Athene, holy shit has he gone off the deep end.)
---
That is true.
---
But it is an investment, like all professions.
---
The question is whether or not the front end investment pays off in time.
---
And for the record, i think skinning is a good investment.
---
Oh, forgot about this limitation.
---
Anyway, ores shall be very cheap on the begining.
---
Can confirm. I've taken them to the face before hahaha!
---
Fury. Ive actually tried 2h Arms on a pserver and it was pretty awful DPS.
---
Arms used to be a norm for a raid spec in early Vanilla. Im not sure if it was partly the AP normalization, hit gear getting better, people just being mistaken, or a combination of all of them, but I saw far more Warriors raid as Arms than Fury in Vanilla. However, by late Vanilla it was becoming clear even to the worst raiders that Fury was far better for raid DPS and you never see it on pservers now because the difference is enormous.
---
The current most played servers starting with a K and an N both have timelines on their website where you can see the release of each raid. On LP you can filter out only these two servers and sort logs by date. I know it's a lot of work, I'm not expecting you to re-do your analysis, it's just a tip. :)
---
Can I use 2h fury or is 1h better. Thank you for your reply
---
Relax, boys.  People are bored and excited.  I, for one, enjoy these posts.
---
Hunter.
---
Yes!
---
Raging Berserker Helm, Big Bad Pauldrons, Gauntlets of Divinity, Overlord's Girdle, the boots are random greens (maybe Valorous?), and the cape looks like Parachute Cloak but could honestly be anything since it's not a unique model. Weapon is Blade of the Titans with Fiery enchant, and he's also a Paladin because he has Vengeance up. Probably mid SoC proc since that's the only thing to my knowledge that makes Paladins do the special attack animation.

I might be in the minority, but I think it's the right frame of mind for me this time around. The second this game starts feeling like work is the second I stop playing it.
---
1H almost always for raiding, unless you have a really good 2H and really bad 1Hs and you dont have much hit gear.
---
I know, it was suppose to be a joke
---
I actually prefer it when I'm in the underdog faction. (slight underdog though. I'm not talking 80/20 here). People will just have to be trusted to either do a little research or roll the dice and see what happens.
---
Hi in, I'm Dad!
---
But easier to get invited to raids

Just because sunder isn’t as efficient as revenge or shield slam doesn’t mean it’s not amazing threat.

Its so funny because the Paladin call is one of the easiest too.

lolwut? This is your main defense spell for half the enemies in the game. Also works against poison dots, any non physical damage.

These are great! Just watched all 3 and they're excellent.
---
I've been playing vanilla servers for over a year now and I'm still super hyped for Classic.
---
What do you call a non-rotation?
---
Why would you put hemo at some completely random level just to show it was "optional"?  What you would do is put it at the correct level but maybe put a border around of it different color.  You wouldn't just pick a random level there.  
---
Take your own advice.
---
No fear ward will always benefit more. 
---
But as a former NE Priest that pvp'ed up till rank 11 in vanilla, damn if Shadowmeld wasnt awesome for not being ganked 24/7 by rogues or defending a capture point.

---
It's less threat than heroic strike thus making it useless. Main tanks don't even use sunder, you have fury warriors do that.
---
In 1.12 that is.  People have this deal with sunder armor being OP because that's how it was in early parts of the expansion.
---
I don't think the majority of guilds are going to follow the consumable meta in Classic, maybe just the die hard guilds that come over from pservers.
---
Faction specific queues perhaps?
---
Warrior pop is also super high, so people aren't gonna be poaching you.
---
Ye i doubt they will copy paste all content release etc from pirate servers
---
Would love to see prices being added to this. Have clear separate section where users (or yourself) can change prices in gold, ie: [Mountain Silversage][5], then to calculate through the rest of your formula what the cost of what the potion would be to make. 
---
Then to add another column for prices of the potions and flasks, to then auto calculate the profit if you were to sell the potions on the AH, profit assuming you bought the herbs as well. 
---
If you cba to do that, throw me permissions and I’ll add myself.
---
That’s interesting, I might look into playing warlock for classic. I was thinking maybe mage, but I already played mage in classic as an alt and in TBC in alt raids, but I feel like they are going to be so overpopulated as a class.
---
I feel like they have some good damage potential on alliance thanks to the blessing of salvation.
---
It sounds like gnome warlock with tailoring is the way to go?
---
Ah I wonder if it's been hidden or deleted as I mentioned names of private servers...
---
Sent you a PM on where you can get the information for K all the way back, just commenting incase your notifications get spammed too much from this thread.
---
Any NE priest at the blacksmith instead of the lumber mill isn't a true NE priest.
---
&gt; honestly thats the part I most dislike about Classic
---
Thats the part I like the most about Classic. Classes are not supposed to be equal in every area. The should all have their strengths and weaknesses. If you only care about raiding (and dont want to heal) then Warrior is clearly a better pick than hunter. But if you want to farm gold or have an easy time leveling - you clearly want to pick a hunter over a warrior. Everyone thinking class X is clearly superior than class Y should start to realize that this evaluation is based on what one wants out of a class.
---
You realize that armor values are buffed on some pservers to make up for 1.12 talents? This is why people say they are "incorrect", not because they are too low...
---
**Dodge**
---
If you level herbalism you are basically guaranteed to have the herbs required for 300 alch so it should not a big deal.
---
stoneform wins.
---
Sure, I was planning to put it in later anyway. How do I give permissions for editing?
---
Buy a green level 6 dagger for rogue and you are one shotting mobs
---
I think I'd actually keep the project for myself, and I plan to add it in later. But you are of course free to use it and modifiy it for your own use :)
---
Soul shards is the only thing preventing me from rolling a lock. I spend way too much time managing my inventory as is, I'm a bit OCD about it.
---
these aracane spells are a meme, no one uses them ever pretty much. forget about them. 
---
NE pro is shadowmeld, which is very useful. as you can stealth before the engagement and avoid being charged by warriors, for instance, or any cc, or pretargeting you by other players knowing your position. 
---
also helps with flag defending on ab, and situationally in a various scenaros.
---
very good ability to have, though overall dwarf is better i'd say.
---
I wanted to raid as Arms as well but man most of the talent tree blows. MS will never be used. Deep wounds and Rend won't be used as well. So you really have nothing. If you find a guild who lets you raid as one GL. If you don't plan on raiding with one and just doing dungeons than they kick ass. Sweeping Strikes with Improved Cleave. So much AoE.
---
Strange way to spell "hideous". There are a few reasons why there are less Ally Warlocks, the main one being WotF. A second one, debatable, is that warlock is basically the edgy caster. So they go for edgy races as well.
---
Thank you to all the comments! Good info as always!
---
I can see that too, I was a prot warrior in vanilla so gear competition was a big issue until I finally got a spot with a good guild as a tank.
---
I definitely don’t have the time these days to main tank again too much outside work goes in to that with resist gear, mat farming and everything else. 
---
Everyone has to do a good bit of that but tanking for a raid guild is next level.
---
20 and 40 are 'spensive.
---
Bro I'll never look at fireblast the same
---
Yeah in TBC it is pretty much inverted: The melee DPS aren't good until late T6 so everyone just runs warlocks and hunters. If there's more than 1 rogue and more than 1 DPS warrior in the raid that's actually already melee-heavy for a TBC raid (add 1-2 feral druids for offtanking and usually 1-2 enhance shaman for additional totem/bloodlust).
---
In my personal experience in leveling dungeons at max level dungeons, most warrior tanks use Sunder as a bread and butter aggro tool and get a little upset when they can't use it. I'll let the warriors stick to the armor reduction and use my hard earned combo points on better stuff.
---

---
I wrote a Python script which generates these, unfortunately you need to manually assign the images to skills, so other classes will take a while. I will do a proper post once I am done with all of them.
---
There was a shaman on my server with the hand of ragnaros. Does that seriously mean that he effectively lost a rare legendary weapon when tbc was released?
---
Why do skills differ in cost with different classes?
---
This doesn't fix anything, pug raids will be a huge thing and it still incentivises people to need on everything their class can use only to sell to someone who actually needs it.
---
Yes, I would love that. On retail I had extreme luck of playing on one of the very few servers with nearly equal horde alliance ratio. Similarly with the private server I rolled on. One of my biggest fears regarding classic is that with my all world pvp expectations I'm going to end up on the realm with absolute 0 of opposite faction.
---
WoW Classic can be your hobby
---
That's for dungeons of course, I was speaking raiding.
---
Oh no, that is the worst manual labor in making these sheets then. I thought yours were off when I made the [hunter one](https://imgur.com/iduign8), but if each class is different, then it's a nightmare holy molly.
---
Please make one for mage
---
I’d wait and hop in fresh in classic to be honest.
---
While I had fun, it wasn’t worth it. I completed that level 30 or so quest for a blue warlock robe and it felt bad, because it wasn’t ‘for reals’ to me. I didn’t care about my toon like I usually do.
---
No love for the resto Druid
---
Unfortunately that's 100% of the challenging 5 man content in retail.
---
In vanilla servers tend towards 50 50, you can see that on almost every pvp pserver, where the max popilation imbalance is usually 45-55 split. This is because there are actually benefits on rolling the underplayed faction in terms of queues, ranking bracket caps, and competition over resources in the world. You can kill enemy faction players and zone them out to take control of a farming area/zone but you cant with the same faction. 
---
This all works relatively well and balances it out unless you hit a critical population imbalance of about 40-60 or 35-65 where it becomes very hard to do things out in the world as the lower population faction, and the incentive to roll on the larger population faction becomes much higher than those previously stated that work towards pushing the faction balance to an equilibrium
---
Hey all! I'm looking for a guild to raid with come Classic. Any inquiries, feel free to msg me here on reddit!
---
\[NA - PvP - Alliance - EST (I can raid Monday and Thursday night..) | Main Tank or Offtank Position as Warior\]  
---
I have tanked on Kronos 3 for the past year - MC/ONY/BWL/ZG/AQ20/AQ40
---
The other advantage of being a healer if play time is a limiting factor is you will never have a problem getting into 5 mans. So you can easily farm gear doing that until you feel like jumping into a raid. 
---
Tanks obviously also have as easy time of it but as you pointed out are much more gear dependent for raiding. Even as an undergeared healer you should have an easier time finding a spot than an undergeared dps or tank.
---
I remember having bought it for a steal on the AH back in the day, ready to brag to my 60 warrior RL friend. Rock up to him in Storm wind and he informs me I have purchased a Spank Paddle. The pain was real.

---
You sill looking for developers?

Also paging /u/Seguren so you see Hunter has been done already, and can skip hunter if you want :-)
---
This was an interesting and informative video. I checked out the other version to see how it differed, and I found the contempt (not the memes per se) rather grating. Good job detoxifying it.
---
Yes. You will have at least 3 holy priests in a raid.
---
LFG - Warrior for Main Tank or Offtank Position  
---

Have tanked on one of the pservers for the past year; MC/ONY/BWL/ZG/AQ20 &amp; AQ40; all under my belt
---
Looking for a mature guild who wants to do server firsts and conquer content. Interested? Feel free to PM. Thanks!
---
This game has sound? I play muted &amp; Netflix on my 2nd screen
---
Changing the weather really broke that zone. Cant wait to play there again :)
---
just found 4 friends from vanilla I didn't talk to for over 10 years, all hyped for classic.
---
this is game is epic
---
Yes tailoring is mandatory tho you can hold off on it until ZG comes out.
---
Warlock dps is a lot better than people give credit. If you check out the 1.12 talent tree the only damage buff warlocks got between vanilla and tbc is 20% bonus scaling on your shadowbolt. With world buffs +consumables you can get nearly 50% crit rating and close to 1k spell power. This is not too far off what you would expect from a Kara warlock so it's no surprise they're so powerful in classic
---
Well, looks like we know who will be using nude mods... :V
---
Sounds reasonable, hopefully I as a hunter can befriend enough warriors and mages to be allowed to raid!
---
I think the record is around 100 hours. So an experienced player who is not massively speedleveling can reasonably do it in 200 or less.
---
Is vanilla raiding really so hard that you have to screw over some of your players just to min-max?  I recall the mechanics of the fights being pretty damn easy.
---
Honestly i couldn't wait, i started on pserver the other day. I just decided not to play my main class. At first ot felt a little wrong, but totally worth it
---
You the real mvp &lt;3
---
Good times
---
Herbalism would get more money unless you're willing to do a lot of farming to sell bags. Selling bags isn't unreasonable, but the value does decrease as the server matures whereas herbs are consumes so they'll keep a pretty decent value throughout especially as new content releases.
---
There's a BOP chest piece for warlocks but I have heard that it can be replaced without too much trouble, unlike the priest BOP chest.
---
saved!
---
Back in the day, we always 5 manned UBRS. What am i missing? (I started playing about 4 months after release)
---
Requesting Priest!
---
I’m curious. Is this just every skill with each cost or the recommended skills to buy every level?
---
Why does it say AH for some items? I mean why not include the origin source of the recipes
---
K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple, Stupid. I would just put an asterisk and a small sentence below that says something like "Average of 2 prot wars, 1 shadow priest, 1 enhance shaman/ret pala with nightfall per raid" etc. You already did a nice job with the graphic as is.
---
With the 16 debuffs are Arms still not able to use Rend and Deep Wounds?
---
Thank you for the insight.  As a follow up, you say they do scale noticeably with "better gear," do you include bwl gear in that?  Obviously r13 and t3 would be more powerful, but I'm likely to have a lot more free time during the first 3 or 4 phases than I am toward the end.
---
I like the idea of a tanky shadow caster, so I'm trying to decide between lock and spriest for pvp (will pve as whatever), and I'm trying to pick based on what will be the strongest in the window I'm likely to play the most during.  Thanks again.
---
Almost everyone wants at least one resto druid. Multiple druids are definitely viable raid healers as long as they're not assigned to the same target (i.e. one on the tanks, one on raid heals, etc). 
---
You're right that HoTs don't stack on the same target, though to be clear *different* HoTs work just fine (i.e. renew and rejuvenation will both apply to the same target).
---
Can't say I'm a fan of using a transparent background with black text labels. As a person who uses a dark theme browser your image looks like this https://imgur.com/a/wXt5qCE

I'd be down for crossrealm BGs.  AV was always my favorite and it took forever to get into the one instance that had been going for hours.  You either had to get in during the afternoon before peak hours, or sit around waiting for people to leave and free up space.
---
Most of them are world drops, so its just easier to buy them than hope for a drop.
---
But ill add in the ones that can actually be farmed.
---
Bumpig for priest that would be great!
---
Nice work! I'm going to keep doing mine; I enjoy making them, but this is very cool.
---
I like your style, Sir.
---
Lol you don’t need to lock the faction, that would just piss everyone off. You have a 1-2min queue for the heavy faction with a free faction transfer. Private servers have shown this is an easily fixable problem.
---
My advice would be to just scrape all the info from the site in one go, store it, and then run your queries on top of it. It cannot be bigger than a few gigs, probably considerably less than that (since you are using 200 latest parses). This would allow you to restructure it in a meaningful way to allow for these over-complicated queries the people are asking for ^^
---
Oh wow that's terrible... Sorry about that.
---
Can I reupload the pic edited or does it require a full respost?

Im certin most hardcore players for this will already be married have kids or live on their own well in their 40's.

This shows everything. I figured people can decide on their own which abilities they want to skip.

You can't inspect a hunter to see what they have equipped in the paper doll ammo slot?
---
Shadowmeld is unique, no other priest, warrior or hunter is also a stealth class. Never underestimate stealth.
---
God damnit I hate being an orc, why do they have to be so good :(
---
Prolly cant check patch notes, but i cant bother yo do that, in any case whether it drops or not, trying to max out rep from quests will make leveling a pain in the ass.
---
So is ret in every instance.
---
Unfortunately, these surveys aren't sound data. They never reflect reality. It polls a subset of the playerbase that is most likely to represent statistical anomalies: people who browse /r/classicwow or the official Classic forums long before we even have a release date. We're much more likely to follow certain patterns that others wouldn't. The other 98% aren't basing their choice on research and discussion, and many won't even have played vanilla before and may pick the class they play in BFA or whatever.
---
I remember when N*st launched and there was a class poll whose results indicated things like warlock being the second most played class, and then when you looked at the data from an actual in-game census it turned out to be one of the least played. It's kinda like going to an indie film festival to ask people their favorite producer and then later polling random people at Walmart on the same question. There would be huge shifts in results.
---
What's wrong with warlock? I thought they put out good dps and we're liked due to the summon?
---
Warlock. And you pretty much get the best of both world!
---
Because Vanilla was not all about raiding. You spend at least 100 hours leveling, and then more doing 5 man dungeons, World PvP and BG PvP. So I don't see the problem with all classes not being perfectly balanced for raiding. At least every class is taken to raid at least - there are no classes which can't raid at all.
---
This is far better on a solid black background, thank you
---
It's a great post with solid info. I would just let this post stay as is and change the style of any future charts you make.
---
Other than wands, is there any weapon type they cant use?
---
Okay great, thanks!
---
I'm curious as to why you'd value agility over strength, as strength gives you 2AP per point (even in bear) and your bleeds are unable to crit.
---
I get the idea that agility will give you armor, dodge and crit, but considering you need 20 agility for just 1% dodge and crit, I wouldn't value that extremely highly.
---
Imo I'd argue agility and strength have the same value
---
Just have a pop up or something that tells you if there is a faction imbalance when server selecting. Just suggest a different server, don't force
---
2004: 7-8 years old playing runescape &amp; watching serveral of my friends big brothers play vanilla.
---
2019: living with two of my friends in a man cave apartment, waiting for classic!
---
I mean, the point of twinking in a level bracket is to have the best gear in the BG. People often choose level brackets that are good for their class/spec. The point of twinking is to give you an advantage over other players, in world you do that by just being higher level. It's not that different if you're five levels higher and you gank somebody, or you have crusader on your instance blue and you do it.
---
The hero we deserve.
---
I rolled Druid so you can have mine.
---
How did your guild distribute loot, wasn't there a DKP system in place?
---
2005: started playing at 13 years old in the summer between middle school and highschool.
---
2019. Dropped out of college in 2008 and played wotlk 24/7. Got a felony drug sales charge in 2015. Graduated with my associate's degree in 2017, at 4-year college now.
---
I was actually making an addon for this for pservers but I realized it would be useless for Classic.
---
Maybe I'll finish it. The plan was to do all classes.
---
Can warlocks solo as well as hunter or mage? Probably 90% of my play will be soloing
---
A bit dumb when the obvious answer was to just make Tauren Rogues
---
Wow looks great! What program did you make this in?
---
&gt; But #2 is going to infuriate the trolls and spammers.
---
Which is going to be great!
---
The problem is for me, what else to play until Classic. I'm still subbed to retail, however I'm literally forcing myself to login to do my weekly "homeworks". I'll probably unsub, my friendlist is empty as well as my guild. Almost no one I know wants to play retail right now. 
---
So I was actually thinking about trying some private server, for the first time in my life. I play other games too, but the hype is too big I can't play anything else than WoW.
---
Out of 10
---
-Warrior
---
-Hunter
---
-Druid
---
-Rogue
---
-Mage
---
-Shaman
---
Still very conflicted
---
There is an ignore list, you know.
---
Omg thank you for this! I've been echoing this on this subreddit forever, my guild got to 4 horsemen and then kinda died, so i killed all bosses but three. And i am so sick and tired of private server people who keeps saying "This and that is REQUIRED", nobody did that in vanilla. Nihilum used an ony buff on world first KT and that was like... the first time i had ever seen someone do that.
---
This video is 100% correct on how it was. The issue was time investment and keeping enough people active. You couldn't recruit from BWL level guilds, you needed people with AQ40 gear, and they were already doing naxx so getting new people was very hard when people burned out.
---
Consumables makes it clearable in one night and makes it go a lot faster. But they are not required for any one boss but Loatheb(tanks need some though on other bosses).
---
That is really fucking helpful
---
What about robe of the void and bloodvine set?
---
Tailoring gets me robe of the void, and when zg releases I can get the bloodvine set
---
Now we need someone experienced with leveling Rogues tell us which spells are skippable until after 40
---
That's genius if it actually works
---
I'd be interested to know the total gold each class takes to learn everything (including and excluding talents).
---
Also, you're lvling as fire, very interesting. You should consider not buying every rank of all those spells unless you are gonna do something for extra gold while leveling to make sure you get your mounts on time :)
---
How is it that I have been playing this game since it came out and I never knew this lore? Where is dungeon lore like this even found because I'm pretty sure none of the in game quests go into this much detail.
---
Certainly, but if I put someone on my list, no one else will know they are a ninja. If you can add someone to a list on your addon, and then everyone in your guild can see that, it will really stop ninjas from doing their tricks, or risk huge concequences.
---
If someone ninjas loot, and I just put them on ignore, they can just find another group.
---
Then: 10 year old RuneScape addict, failing the 5th grade. 
---
Now: 25 year old living in my parents office, unemployed, no girlfriend, not in school, ready to plunge my existence into Azeroth.
---
He did it for world first 70 farming mobs in Terrokar forest
---
Right, Robe of the Void is the one I was thinking of. I don't know as much about warlock progression, but I have heard people mention that it's not as hard to replace as Truefaith Vestments. Truefaith stays BiS long enough that it's almost always worthwhile for a priest to level tailoring long enough to craft it before moving on to something else. 
---
I forgot about Bloodvine. Selling those if you can get the patterns definitely makes money.
---
Paint.exe, cross out the ones you don't want, type in gold tally at the bottom. 15 minutes work for your whole playthrough
---
I would like solo que to have server prio and prem vs prem prio to have XR prio.
---
Totally agree on basicly all accounts. One possible counter argument is that the players polled here will be fighting for the same type of guilds, while more casual people join more casual guilds. But I admit thats a stretch. 
---
Either way an interesting interpretation of the survey imo.
---
If you don't find any satisfaction in min/maxing or, in that case specifically, if playing as an orc is a line you do not want to cross then maybe it's just not for you? Don't feel pressured into min/maxing your race choice if you think you will enjoy the game less because of that, it's not worth it.
---
Me personnally I like orcs so I'm lucky but if the min/max DPS race was troll I would just ignore it and stick to a more appealing race to me.
---
Maybe provide a fucking link?
---
And a system where anyone can add anyone else to a blacklist WILL be misused against innocents. Just keeping a Google Doc with your guild (or together with some big ones) is fine for most things.
---
Speaking up until end of AQ40, as you gear up, honestly mana isn't that much of an issue if you work on your +hit and stockpile mana potions/demonic runes. You won't be able to spam Mind Blast every fight, but you don't want that much threat anyway. If you do go near oom, remember your main job is to keep shadow weaving up so use rank 1 MF to make sure it doesn't drop. In regards to your post, in earlier progression you definitely use the oils for mp5 but later on you use the spell power ones. Similarly you would always Flask of Supreme Power, not Distilled Wisdom.
---
Bats can't learn claw, so they still inferior to Owls, not trying to deny your post, but I think Owls are just overrated, Cats still the better DPS while leveling.
---
Couldn't you just explore and figure out what to do instead?
---
I envy people that can watch stuff or listen to podcasts when playing. 
---
I sometimes forget to breathe while playing lol 
---
I’m very “one thing at a time while super focused on that one thing” type of person.
---
More of a comment that a question
---
 I remember from my vanilla days sometimes it taking a while to find a tank.
---
Spamming in major cities ... LFM Tank [INSTANCE]
---
But it seems from Reddit at least Warrior will be the most popular class. So has this, or will this change from playing in my vanilla days.
---
I am slightly tempted to try playing tank as I never have, but I also don't want to be one of the majority.
---
Is Faerie Fire useable when shapeshifted in classic? Was definitely one of my favorite movies for bear leveling in TBC/WotLK. Instant cast range spell to tag/pull mobs, then you still have a charge to hop into abother group for big pulls.
---
I laughed :D
---
Sure, why does anyone even need tools like talent calculators or item databases? 
---
Just make your own with MS paint and excel!
---
I think he means "old blizz" in the sense that they are encouraging players to deal with ninjas by spreading their bad reputation across the server, which is a very vanilla-esque way of thinking.
---
No changes it is what it is.
---
Eh he did a video not long ago where he returned after having raided naxx on private servers and said that his previous video was pretty much all true. You needed all the consumables and world buffs etc etc which isn't true at all.
---
With the soul shard bags which will be in from the beginning it's not that bad. You do need that macro to keep Imp. Drain Soul to keep it from overflowing, but as long as you have a free slot in the soul bag all shards are put there.
---
You just have one less bag, but it doesn't impact inventory OCD. It's just like a quiver/ammo pouch.
---
My guild back at vanilla wow, did all of MC, BWL, AQ40 with 0 coms, and only raid warning for bosses coming from the raid leader, rofl. was on Crushridge but I can't remember the guild name.
---
I played a Ret paladin in vanilla and if I wanted to raid, I had to go holy spec and heal. If you want to melee dps in raids, then I would suggest a warrior or rogue. (I didn't play a shaman in vanilla, so I can't help you there)
---
That being said, I loved my ret pally and will probably roll another one. I did just fine in dungeons, pvp and farming.
---
Farming soul shards before every raid is a pain in the ass. Being a summon bot is demeaning. Rotation consists of spamming 1 button then lifetapping then spamming that 1 button again.
---
At least you're unstoppable in PvP.
---
Enchanting is the social profession, since the enchants themselves require a “face to face” exchange.  I do it because I like to talk to people.  And I have fun creating a brand and having people come back to you with new gear they’re excited they just got.
---
Only really need 3-4 for curses and each is expected to have enough shards to summon half a raid, if not more is my guess.
---
I personally never really bothered with claw while leveling with an owl. I like screech mainly for the aoe threat generation as screech is probably the second strongest tps pet ability besides growl and it does it in an aoe. Most of the time I dont even need to growl and because it's aoe and nerfs physical dps, I can maintain two Target uptime for multishot while leveling
---
What’s the point of this?
---
Thank you for making this. Useful.
---
Thanks so much!
---
The dps is ok but not great, outside of that you are a utility bitch. Very few people actually want to spend 40 minutes before raid to farm soul shards and going through the hassle of summoning people / giving healthstones. Who knew.
---
&gt; Get off the zeplin in gromgol and run along the road to duskwood (or even deathwarp/take rez sickness to get there faster).
---
I think it might be faster/safer to just swim from Grom to westfall
---
Robe of void is not strong enough in pve if i recall correctly, and bloodvine is first when ZG comes out. Usually the meta is not to keep tailoring because its a bit of a useless profession, you only get it in start to craft items, then reroll something else, and when ZG comes out you have gold farmed up so you can keep tailoring until better gear arrives.

---
Here is a quick rundown of scenarios for 2H Arms/2H Fury based on Faction and Race.
---
Is Arms viable for PVE Raid DPS?
---
Alliance: 99% no. I'm fairly certain even if you had a fantastic Sword(Ashkandi, Bonereaver's Edge), human race, wearing Edgemaster's Handguards, Sword Spec, Hand of Justice, and wearing very good gear you will do very disappointing damage. IIRC your rage generation will be very low without Windfury procs and/or Flurry procs. In TBC the superior raiding DPS Warrior was a 33/28/0 Arms build because of your Blood Frenzy buff to the physical damage raid members but unfortunately Arms in Vanilla doesn't work Alliance side. Finally the Mortal Strike debuff is a complete waste of a debuff slot. I could be wrong because I've never seen anyone seriously try this but I highly doubt it.
---
Horde: Still no. You will benefit from WF but will be dependent on ALWAYS having WF. MS is a waste of a debuff slot still.
---
Is 2H'd Fury viable for PVE Raid DPS?
---
Alliance: It is viable but only if you're willing to utilize a swing timer to insert slam into your rotation, in other words it is more work than dual wielding. By choosing a 2H'd weapon path this allows more 1H'd weapons to be distributed throughout the raid which will allow faster progression and happier guildies. Go human if you wish to maximize your raid DPS but honestly I'd go Gnome(for PVP) and wear a Nightfall, this will make every caster love you and your chances of getting a consistent raid spot will be much higher. Nightfall is a crafted blacksmithing weapon, you need to be exalted in the Thorium Brotherhood to purchase these plans.
---
Horde: Everything above applies(except races) PLUS you get Windfury! Go Orc for the highest possible DPS, Blood Fury is fantastic, Axe Specialization is great, and Hardiness is good for PVP. Troll is the 2nd best DPS choice but I would rather go Undead over Troll for another fear break. Would still try to get my hands on a Nightfall ASAP but I'm a bigger picture kind of guy.
---
Hope you find this helpful and good luck.
---
You sure you mean UBRS not LBRS?
---
Because UBRS is rough as hell.
---
This guy has pugged as a hybrid before
---
Theres no need to tank multiple mobs while leveling a hunter (other than memes). Spamming multi-shot will make you go oom very quickly, and you'll also need to use mend pent in between because tanking 2 mobs at once every pull will make your pet be taking more damage, meaning that you'll have to drink, creating downtime.
---
I'm glad you commented this. I thought so too but I tried it and that whole river is covered in STV Crocs which oneshot you at 16 so it's better to stick to the road.
---
Hi, /u/wrusty
---
Druids heal dungeons all of the way to 60 as feral spec. They need healing gear to do it, though
---
As it should be. There's really no downside to bringing more Warriors in a 40-man group. Druids, on the other hand, actually get worse if you have more than 2.
---
This probably looks a lot more balanced for 20-mans. I would bet money that you still have your 1-2 Druids and Hunters in 20-man content, just a lot less Warriors, Rogues and Mages.
---
I wish.
---
River? I'm talking about the ocean. 
---
Just jump in the water outside of grom, swim away from the shore so you dont agro mobs, and then swim towards Westfall lighthouse.
---
I don't know if it's actually faster than your method, but it should be much safer.
---
Sorry man, but hybrid classes are not your healbot bitches. they like to dps as much as you do.
---
If a bis item drops for their dps spec, they're going to roll on it.
---
Sounds more like noob tip than pro tip.
---
Tame encrusted clawler or whatever it's called in durotar outside the cave and no you are not playing fucking tauren, use it until lvl12, get cat and then either stick to cat or wait until r2 screech from shimmering flats at 32.
---
You swim in the ocean, not the river.
---
You will probably be able to macro this if necessary.
---
ikr??// lop;l
---
This "owl for speedleveling" meme is the same as the exploration leveling meme, a way for people who are ahead on every fresh launch to trick competitive, autistic &amp; theoretical players into falling behind on fresh launch. The amount of traveling is not worth it, especially considering its all the way out in westfall which is avoided like the plague by anyone with a clue.
---
The first video was about 50% before it got brigaded.
---
Not if you’re the one Druid in the raid I guess
---
How much of a hardcore player are you? If you're not one of the "I'm going to cash in four weeks of vacation and buy 27 cases of Red Bull" people, then I don't see why you can't play an Alliance character with your friends, and a separate Horde character by yourself.
---
At the end of the day, it's a game. Do what makes you happy. I personally played mostly Alliance back in the day. I'll probably make an Alliance character to get reacquainted with the gameplay from back then, and then make a bunch of Horde characters to experience something different.
---
And you can rez with engineering but not really reliable. Iirc the best jumper cables had a near 50% chance of working correctly.
---
!remindme in 2 days
---
I did 3 spins and they all landed on Hunter..... Wut
---
Yeah. :(   Hybrid is heals alliance side. Horde shaman 30/0/21 is probably the only exception
---
That is 40-man raid loot and is controlled by guild looting rules.
---

---
Blizzard balancing has always worked in a FOTM fashion. It just so happens that 1.12 is Warrior and Mage land. Sadly for us, this means Warrior and Mages are Flavor of The Forever.
---
so what's your suggestion? let's hear it
---
Would love a Paladin one!
---
I couldn't get into ff14 for this very reason
---
Then: 6th grader autist with 3 friends
---
Now: 26 year old autist with 1 friend
---
Just check the official server forums. In Vanilla, they used to have a list for Alliance and a list for Horde ninjas. I am sure somebody will start one up again.
---
Recklessness+Faerie Fire+Sunder stacked in Classic. [Here is Curse vs Loatheb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3NLv4kR-T0) during 2006. Look at 1:05 on the video and what do you know, there's Faerie Fire, Sunder Armor *and* Curse of Recklessness, all on the same target at the same time.
---
Sunder and Expose Armor never stacked on private servers but I guess you'll just say whatever fits your narrative at this point.
---
Oh and before you start saying things like "vanilla videos didn't have 720p, video was uploaded in 2009, this is another private server!!!1", I'll just repeat what I said to someone that said exactly that:
---
The PoV from those videos is from Fura, a mage that was in &lt;Nightmares Asylum&gt; from NA Smolderthorn (and in fact was the PoV for a handful of their kills) and transferred to EU Vek’Nilash in the guild &lt;Curse&gt;. Both guilds got 15/15 naxxramas before TBC launched. There’s multiple POVs from Fura that are still up on WarcraftMovies that were uploaded in 2006. 2009 is only the year it was reposted on Youtube.
---
&lt;Curse&gt; was a 15/15 guild during Vanilla and there’s numerous POVs from the same mage that are up on Warcraftmovies dating from 2006. Just because it was reposted on YouTube in 2009 from WarcraftMovies doesn’t mean it wasn’t recorded in 2006. Video quality doesn’t mean anything either. There’s multiple 720p videos from back then. From &lt;Curse&gt;, &lt;Security&gt;, and other guilds. The only reason why the 2006 youtube videos aren’t in 720p is because 720p wasn’t an option on Youtube until 2008. It was a limitation of the website and nothing more.
---
Yea i will never understand this owl meme, owls are fucking shit compared  to cats, you dont see any speedrunner using a fucking owl, cats only start to fall in damage when wind serpents get lightning breath in zul'gurub and ravagers in tbc.
---
This is what everyone says but it's really not true. Once you get aimed shot you spam it off CD because it's good damage per Mana, but it does roughly the same damage as a multishot with 2 targets (if not a little less damage) and multishot is less Mana at every level so it's basically the same as having an aimed shot from level 18 onwards. As for the tankyness of your pet, people don't push what they're pet can do. Even all the way to the 50s my pet had no trouble tanking multiple mobs so long as there wasn't casters. I recently checked and with a level 54 pet versus level 55 creatures (with armor maxed and screech up) the mobs we're doing  38ish damage to my pet which has over 3k health. So taking 2 at a time for a decreased kill time per mob is fine
---
You should play what you think will be fun! Just know that if you plan to play as Ret at level 60, you may have difficulty finding raids that will take you along, and those that do may expect you to spend more time healing / BoP'ing / other support-y stuff than actually DPSing. Not to say that you can't/won't find a cool group that will let you, it'll just be struggle. Several Ret builds are also actually ok for PvP so you could maybe swing that way over doing PvE.
---
So if you aren't invested in class fantasy and what sounds most fun is doing melee DPS in end game raids/dungeons, you'll have a better/easier time as a warrior than as a Paladin.
---
I'm planning to play a Paladin as well, but luckily for me I actually really enjoy Holy and was planning to heal even if it wasn't the main viable spec at max.
---
Thanks for posting this. 
---
I never noticed how steep the price jump from 20-22 is!
---
&gt; "Multiple times" you realize it could easily take 300-500 runs to see one ironfoe for some people with bad rng right?
---
So what if the paladin who wants Ironfoe has already run BRD 90 times and you, as a warrior, have only run BRD 30 times. Does he get to roll on it?
---
Oh that's a good idea. Yeah that might be faster I haven't tried
---
What do you want your endgame to be? If it's raiding, figure out your role. Once you have that go from there.
---
&gt; Before anyone starts a roast session in the comments, if you think cats are better that's great. This is just if someone does like owls and wants one on horde while leveling
---
Warlock. I know I wont have a lot of time to play every week, 1-2 hrs total, due to wife/career. So add that to a FRESH server where I don't have money built up across characters, leads me to play Warlock as a good solo character that can save major moneys with a mount etc. 
---
Also I played Alliance back in the day so I'll go Human just cause I know that lvl pathing better than dwarf/gnome
---

100% agree, blizzard should listen to this. private servers learned the hard way that some things were added or removed for a reason. BGs are one of them, same with DHKs.
---
For many of us there is no choice.  I haven't decided if I'm going to start as a cow shaman or a cow druid, but 100% chance I'm gonna be a cow.
---
Moo.
---
Good God please don’t remove mob tagging, I hate how modern games are OBSESSED with removing any kind of system abuses.
---
I personally think that this line of thinking is one of the many philosophies that ruin game designs.
---
What if the jackass has run BRD more than you? How would you know?
---
Thank you, for a quick and very good answer!
---
I dont have the most time to play, more than many others but not like “i can live my life doing only this”.
---
I have though the same about making an alliance and a horde, but i guess im gonna just start an alliance with my old buddies and then slowly leveling a horde character just for the nostalgia. You have just made my situation a lot easier! Thank you
---
&gt;Once you get aimed shot you spam it off CD
---
If you are spamming aimed shot why do you have an Owl to tank 2+ mobs for you? Makes no sense, might aswell just single target burst, and you also just get Aimed shot at level 51, so not worth it.
---
Warlocks aren't expected to summon the entire raid on pservers.
---
However... Using shadowburn on cool down is where the shards end up going.
---
When there was an 8 debuff limit as well, your lucky to have your drain soul stick on trash, meaning what you came in with, was all you were going to have the entire run.
---
Miss, Miss, Dodge, Parry on that first boar. Man that made me crack up
---
I get the sneaking suspicion that the reason Alliance tend to have more Druids as compared to Horde may be due to race selection available.
---
Pendulum of doom intensifies
---
Me: spins over and over until gets warrior.
---
Also me:  sweet!
---
Light. As a paladin you will have dramatically higher mana efficiency if you use blessing of light and spam low rank flash of light (or holy light if you have low +healing, less than 200).
---
I'm saying that once you get aimed shot on a single target cat build, you spam it on CD for damage. But if you go multi target with owl, multishot is even better damage per Mana then aimed shot and you don't need to wait till 51
---
Alright can somebody tell me wtf [Blast Wave](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/0/08/Spell_holy_excorcism_02.png) or [Death Coil](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/e/ef/Spell_shadow_deathcoil.png) are?
---
close!
---
&gt; So the title is a slight jebait, because instead of getting an Owl you'll be getting a Bat 
---
It's just flat out wrong.  Alliance have owls immediately in their starting area as NE.  You aren't  getting one "faster than alliance can" at all.
---
the idea of a more story-based mmorpg intrigues me, but ditto. i ended up feeling so cramped in the starting zone, one of the first things i did in wow was make a bunch of different characters and just run around to see what was out there.
---
you definitely can't do that in xiv. distinctly remember starting by a cliff and not being able to jump off it (later found out i also couldn't swim), and if i tried to go back down the cliff there was either an invisible wall or a prompt to go talk to the quest npc, it was really annoying. let me go wherever i want and let me deal with the consequences!
---
People forget that Warriors are complete dogshit as a solo class. Until you have insane gear you wont have any good methods of farming gold or materials solo like every other class has. Warlocks can solo Mara, Hunters can do Tribute and tons of other stuff. Mages/Priests/Druids/Paladin can farm Lashers in DM:East and the list goes on.
---
As a Warrior, expect to always do your goldfarm in a group.
---
Warrior being the most popular class won't mean there is an abundance of tanks. Several of them will be dps, and some will be doing mostly PvP instead of PvE. DPS and to an extent healers will likely still outweigh tanks, making them very desirable.
---
i genuinely loved everything about kingdom come: deliverance - its beautiful, the story is very engaging, the characters are funny and have a really nice realistic feel to them.  It's challenging.  It's super immersive and well designed, and has tons of actual history in it...
---
... but it takes about 20 minutes just to get into the game and i simply don't feel motivated enough to wait through tons of loading

single target cat build doesnt use aimed shot, u shouldnt be wasting points on mm tree early on, theres too much important shit for leveling on bm tree to pass, aimed creates downtime and ur pet will be doing twice your dmg at that level
---
I’ve decided I’m going to roll on horde for a new experience myself. Played until Cata and all my friends were always alliance but slowly they all quit and left me alone. I’ve always wanted to try horde so I’m going for it this time. With that said I know I’ll eventually just make a NE again for the nostalgia of what it was like playing for the first time back in 2004. It wasn’t terribly difficult for me to decide since I want a new experience and to fulfill what I wanted to do from the beginning, plus I don’t have those friends that I used to play with playing anymore.
---
Agility has just overall more value because it not only gives you about the same damage increase plus mitigation but also crits trigger both Blood Frenzy and Primal Fury which are *huge* on ferals.
---
Dont get me wrong, Druids do benefit from Strength quite alot, it's just that Agility and Spirit are more valuable overall.
---
.
---
Holy shit 14 years later.. wtf is wrong with me
---
I was looking at the arcane intellect symbol and i just realized it kinda looks like an eye with an eyebrow and lightning coming out of the eye... always just looked like a weird rune to me
---
"starting by a cliff and not being able to jump off it"
---
That's so fucking sad. It's 2019 and Nintendo mastered cliff jumping way back during Link's Awakening if not sooner.
---
What role do you want to fill? Tank? Healer? Melee? Ranged dmg? Only a couple within each. Often it comes down to play style and feel. 10 mins prolly isnt enough to figure that out.
---
I got paladin 4 times in a row, but I am gonna be playing Horde... Guess it's time to make the switch. Undead Holy Paladin here I come. :P
---
~200g for all skills without riding skill and no reputation discounts if anyone was wondering
---
Lol when did they take out paying a trainer for abilities? 2007 player here :)
---
You are welcome!
---
But if you think that jump is something, prepare your posterior on Warrior 50 (4g20s) to 52 (5g40s). That is nuts. Poor warriors.
---
Warriors were always the most popular class. Most of them don't want to tank anything.
---
What do you mean? Bosses have MORE armor on private servers and Sunder does not stack with expose on these servers either.
---
Warriors will be better in Classic than they are on private servers because of this.
---
Plus not many obstacles, so you can afk it.
---
Faction is the easy part!
---
The hard part is a class and Race!
---
Your a nutcase... No. 
---
This isn't a War Simulator, and your idea of "Double Agents" I'm assuming comes from the millions of films you sit an watch. It's doubtful you have any factual evidence of how an ACTUAL war pans out or works etc other than what you read and or hear. 
---
Your argument is also made invalid by arguing that only the rich benefit from war. Do you think the poor ever benefit from war? That us boots on the ground see huge fortune from it... No. 
---
You've asked a question and don't like the answer, but we don't want faction collusion, it's bad news. 
---
/Thread.
---
The biggest caster DPS benefits come from DM, ZG and AQ/Naxx if I'am not mistaken. T1-2 to a less degree. Obviously you want to get to rank 10  to supplement what you get from PvE with high stats for PvP.
---
Skeleton head on fire/melting?
---
You're welcome! Just remember that it's a game, and not a job. If you force yourself to do things you don't like, then you're not even going to want to play anymore.
---
Totally forgot about thottbot
---
If you spec into it, yes.
---
Telling people the right way to play the game. Ascended brain.
---
Another common strat is to just leave a bunch of melee sitting outside the room until the boss is about to freeze. Takes a little more time to freeze it, but you will in turn have fewer players to heal. Its very doable with both methods.
---
&gt;You use aimed shot from 51 on
---
Thats not early on, that's when you're already 31 bm which is standard. The point is not that at 51 its better because I think at that point it's pretty much the same. I'm saying you get to have that type of dps ability at level 18 if you go owl
---
Like do you agree that once you get aimed shot, you use aimed shot as a bread and butter ability
---
RIGHT??? like if i see a cliff in a game of course i have to jump off of it, i thought that was a core tenant of gaming or something.
---
i tried to ''escape'' a few more times after that but couldn't so i eventually just gave up and followed the quest line without trying to go anywhere or do anything else. it wasn't fun. i know xiv is highly praised for its story and classes and professions and not exploration/zone design, so you can't have everything, but oof
---
I can confirm. I watched these videos religiously during my summer vacation back in 2006.
---
Telling people the right way based entirely on pserver tricks like /sit reck bombs: galaxy brain
---
ah right, haha
---
Go to WC at 16, tame a wind serpent.
---
&gt; Now one important detail of having an owl/bat is that neither come with screech rank 1 and the only mob that can teach screech rank 1 is the [greater fleshrippers](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?npc=154) in westfall at level 16.
---
Reading my dude, it's important. That owl doesn't come with screech and running owl without screech is dumb
---
Guilds use summon alts so you don't need them for that even
---
&gt; and no you are not playing fucking tauren
---
You're not my dad.
---
Haha exactly my thought
---
Wild! I bet it’d be really interesting to hear their original rationalizations for spell pricing and the spikes that happen. It seems so arbitrary looking at now.
---
I did it successfully one time on  my hunter engineer. Everyone in the party celebrated not having to walk back to the instance. I think it was VC.
---
You said that like your parents at together otherwise we're pretty much the same
---
you need to enjoy killing mobs with this class/race, cos thats what you gonna be doing A LOT. So you need to like it, conceptually this type of doing damage. what doesn't bore you and feels like you can keep going and going.
---
Race here is a factor cos of animations and how does it feel in this skin to play.
---
I really loathe how it's the modern standard for MMORPG's to delve deeply into some story. Even if they don't do the dreaded personal story lines which somehow turns you and every other person on the planet into the sole saviour of the world, at the very least it's just standard that whenever you talk to any NPC you get some dramatic close up, they show you some cutscene, or just generally take control of your character.
---
Way too many of those single player RPG components have rooted themselves into modern MMORPG's. MMORPG's have this reputation of being incredibly expensive to make nowadays, and for sure it's not cheap, but I really wonder just how overblown it has become just because of the insistence on adding features like lip syncing, fully voiced quest dialogues and excessive cutscenes that I literally do not want in the first place.
---
I really like the elegance of WoW in that it never takes control away from you. It actually lets you jump around like a lunatic while NPC's are having some serious discussion. Especially the whole zoom-in when talking to NPC's has become a pet peeve of mine. It's so obnoxious and just wastes time.
---
Haha yeah I remember. I bought it launch day anyway thinking “nah it can’t be all that bad”. Wowee, it was worse haha
---
It's also the strongest class thematically imo, with all the pet interactions, so that probably attracts people.
---
But on the website, you could make it so you mouse over the abilities to see their tooltip.
---
Yep eagerly waiting for pantheon rise of the fallen to bring that back till then wow classic i guess
---
if you can't decide between horde and alliance, you should just go alliance. that is the faction of fence-sitting centrists with no passion and no strong or interesting opinions on anything.
---
I had a night elf hunter, dwarf paladin, and gnome mage all at 60.  I think my druid was also 60 but I only ever played it in PVP.  I'll likely go mage again, but I'll probably have alts covering every class sooner or later.
---
#nochanges is going to last about 6 months on classic. lmao
---
Looking at the prices and skills stacked below each other for Hunter and Warrior, Hunters have roughly 111 skills to train, while Warriors only have 82. I think that the dev team just decided they want us to pay X amount for all skills and then they smoothed out the pricing progression. I might be wrong, I didn't do the math though.
---
Nigh elf priest hoooooo
---
11 Warriors and 2 hunters in a raid is broken man, come the fuck on.
---
Wait, are you under the impression that humans have bad racials?
---
Meanwhile somewhere in the Internet Max humansky “a demon with the Optic of a human” crossing his fingers and smiles diabolical.
---
&gt;Because Vanilla was not all about raiding.
---
All the best rewards come from raiding. Raiding is what endgame is largely about.
---
2004: 15y old excited about meeting a girl.
---
2019: Have a son, a bonus daughter. Working in IT.
---
It’s simple. You don’t side with the knife ears. We kill em
---
Definitely orc. Resisting one in four stuns is absolutely huge. It's not just rogue stuns but also things like grenades, Intercept, Tidal Charm and whatnot. WotF is nothing special for warlocks whereas stuns and melee are the bane of your existence.
---
Oh god, I forgot how annoying that was.
---
ahhh lots of assumptions I wasn’t raiding I was doing a dungeon and the guy wasn’t very nice, in fact he was disgusting and horrible. Thinking back I was more likely around 9 years old and it was my own account haha (yes I know that’s not much better). Man the replies are toxic af I thought the community was better than this my god haha oh well.
---
My small question is: is there any need to update or change any database for the items and their stages - like i had to do on privatservers?
---
Are you going to be doing all classes?
---
Thanks
---
Anyone know if sitting to force a crit will trigger the shaman Eye of the Storm talent? It does on private servers but I've heard that's a bug and only a legitimate crit worked back in the day.
---
Well for one thing, 10 minutes isn't enough to get a feel for any class.  You aren't even reaching the talent trees and only have a handful of level 1 abilities.  If you intend to use private servers to find your calling, then you should ride it out to at least lvl 20-30.
---
It's not useless. It's less threat per rage than sunder so while you're correct that hs can replace sunder as it does more threat, it's only recommend to do so when you don't have to worry about rage. And if your in that position you can still sunder during CDs anyways. A tank that doesn't sunder at all will do less threat than one that does period.
---
You can’t be serious, warlock has fear as main CC, deathcoil too and at certain times seduce, all of which is taken away by WoTF
---
&gt; in westfall
---
And Westfall is closer to the Horde than the Alliance?
---
Play or watch a playthrough of Warcraft 3. See what side jumps out to you.
---
"right race"? Slow down there Richard Spencer, this is a videogame.
---
Holy shit dude, what are you trying to say? If you go 31 bm you'll get aimed shot at level 51 because you need 10 points in MM tree to get it, and if you go for aimed shot before BM its just a waste of damage.
---
&gt;I'm saying you get to have that type of dps ability at level 18 if you go owl
---
Ok, you're just memeing at this point, you dont get aimed shot at level 18 and if you're going Owl (a inferior pet) why the fuck are you skipping BM and getting aimed shot? You're just going to run oom even more quickly because instead of only spamming multi-shot you'll be using aimed shot aswell.
---
I got Warlock 3 times in a row. Legit thought the wheel was a meme and only told people to roll warlocks
---
I never had any problems farming shards on trash
---
Quik maffs
---
Nothing is wrong just tedious to play, you have to do 5 times the work of a mage in dungeons, PvP you have to micromanage your demon and juggle cc with dots, lose bag space to soul shards, etc etc.
---
Even on TBC pservers where locks are undisputed kings of 1v1 and top tier raid DPS for the entire xpac they are the least played.
---
Off-topic-ish: I swear there was a meme on here within the last month-ish that was captioned "Virgin Min/Maxer vs. Chad Immersion." I have searched and searched though and can't find it for the life of me. I think one of the comments was something like "Lost it at Alliance Warlock."
---
I might of missed it and Google only lead me to speculations, so I figured I would ask you since you seem to have more of a finger on the news than I do. Have they released the date range of their span?
---
i dont not like world of warcraft because he is balck
---
Could probably get by with buying rank 1 of everything, then just training ranks of SS, evis, stealth, and instant poison
---
Yikes guess I'm going with mage then... I was thinking of going as hunter or warlock but it looks like those are a crapshoot for grouped content :(
---
The class spread is fine for the earlier content compared to how many people play those classes besides probably hunter (at 60 on a private server, warrior is the second most popular class). Most people won't see the later content. I think no changes will take until Naxx release to start dying off enough for blizzard to actually do something about it.
---
I liked being  outnumbered and hope my faction will be again, puny alliance need reinforcements.
---
Wrex.
---
At some point like 1.9 they just tried to make all the classes' total skill spending equal
---
Put in the work, get pre BIS, get consumes and you’ll get a spot. My roommate played hunter on a recent pserver for the first time ever playing WoW and he eventually got into a good guild. 
---
Plus hunters get geared quick and imo the best raid leaders are hunters because flair is OP for guiding through pulls and stuff like that.
---
Yeah obviously you would have to only trust people you know, why would you just accept a random person’s blacklist?
---
Lock is fine if you don't mind doing the work. The best thing going for lock though for a **casual** player is you can literally do 1 spec for raid and pvp and world farming and be able to do 90ish% of your max capabilities in each. I can't think of another class that can that.
---
I believe it’s a profile shot, so we’re seeing the left side of his face as he faces our left.
---
You can see the shiny eye, nose, and beard.
---
Mine was "compromised" and completely deactivated. They said it was used for illegal trades that violated TOS (gold farming). Would have loved to recover my original mage. Had the Zhevra Raf mount and I don't think it even ever hit 70 in TBC lol.
---
my 29ish pally with 2 rogues and another pally killed a 60 hunter, rogues are so stupid, and a lvl 29 can outheal a lvl 60 pet
---
Haha I had to see it for myself so i went digging. 
---
[here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ea1g/virgin_vs_chad/) 
---
This Chad Immersion dude must cast spells out of his spellbook and not his action bar. A true hero.
---
Well as an adult that's got a semi-time-consuming job I'll probably need to go the ez route. Maybe I could still do lock and just go at it casually, pop in a pug here and there
---
Wow, this thread was a life saver.  Haven't played since TBC, gave my account up for lost for over a decade, just got it back in 10 mins with live chat.  Thanks for the heads up everyone!
---
Congrats! 
---
But what’s the stolen computer story :P
---
Remember that game reviewer that deemed cuphead too hard because he couldn't read on-screen instructions?
---
Yeah. That's why. People can be insanely dumb, not excluding myself here. Was playing Divinty Original Sin 2 earlier and healed my Undead friend, thus killing him. 
---
Designing games so that even the shallowest of minds can play them is, in theory, a nice idea, but often more bothersome than anything.
---
Flamestrike, Long ass cast time, little payoff compared to Blizzard/Arcane Explosion
---
That's exactly what made me make this post. I decided to try it since I got it free from twitch prime but I just couldn't.
---
This is bullshit and even the law disagrees with you.
---
2006: first year of high school, long hair, no lifing wow for 13 hours a day because I thought the world sucked
---
Now: orthopedic and trauma surgery resident, beautiful girlfriend who plans to join me in WoW (it's her first time I'm so jealous!), the world definitely sucks
---
&gt;itely be addons that take their place and preform as similar functionality as they can with the new "rules".
---
Lies! I only have two! I resent the impli.... 
---
Oooo look what Rick is up to!
---
&gt; Unironically gets world buffs only to die before he enters the instance.
---
Lovely thanks so much.
---
Oh yeah, it's not a bad idea. But it's simple to get similar functionality yourself, very quickly
---
No, they have yet to announce the duration of each stage and I have the feeling we might not know in advance and they will keep the luxury to extend one phase or proceed to the next one based on players progression or popularity/attendance of each stage. At least that's how I would do it!
---
Server only. Cross-realm ruined the personality of PvP. You no longer recognized names or developed rivals. That was one of the best parts about PvP in Classic; having repeated face-offs with recognized names over many different games.
---
i have no idea why there are so many people underestimating lock dps. a properly itemised and specced warlock will be on par or outstrip a similarly geared mage, sans-ignite roll. stop spreading misinformation. this is from many many hours of endgame vanilla raiding.
---
let me know how it goes!
---
Nothing interesting. My house mate at the time had a weekend long party while I was away and someone there broke into my room and stole it. He said he was too drunk to know how it happened and I believe him. Still sucks though.
---
Got you fam, please share a screen shot of your char, would love to see what you was rockin
---
A lot of AP us nice, but if you are doing 110 damage instead of 100 to a mob with 500 health you don't really benefit. Where as having more critical is always beneficial.
---
Ironforge is way cooler than any other city. Darnassus is also dope in a way no Horde city can match. Problem solved.
---
cheers friend :D
---
Played a mage right through vanilla. Didn't have any alts at all until TBC. This time around I am leaning towards a warrior. Although until I click create on the character generation screen its still up in the air. :)
---
Fire Stone for Warlock, especially the fact that you could talent it.  Why was a caster class given a melee buff?
---
I mean a combat warlock would be cool but there was no other support for it.
---
A young and inexperienced me did make the mistake of trying it and trying to melee mobs with my fire Stone buffed dagger in Loch Modan.
---
* zug zugs classically *
---
Once I get everything reinstalled, will do!
---
This has been my experience. It's taken me around 5-6 days to level without being worried about speed leveling, but also not wandering around.
---
Thanks mate, really !
---
Mend Pet as a channeled spell. Making it a HoT was a massive improvement.
---
The real answer is all of them. The truth is that the original employees who made WoW are members of a cult to a real old god named Azeroth. There plan was to ruin your life and suck out your soul all along.
---
*stay woke*
---
Then your roommate owes you a computer, he was the one liable
---
Kings honor friend
---
i dont know what im looking at. is this a list of when the skills become unlocked or which skills to get at each level or...?
---
Okay but like... trolls have equally pointy ears.
---
They are fantastic DPS. Their issue is threat, and mages are more one-man wrecking balls with their AOE grinding/farming ability and teleport/portal utility.
---
I was personally more of a fan of ambushing people in the dwarf fort.
---
To elaborate on the link. Since this is an elixir, and not a potion it does not have the shared potion cooldown. Elixirs only have global cooldown which makes this Blizzlike.
---
That's not how this meme works brother. And for the thousandth time, it's another post telling people how they should play to enjoy the game.
---
Holy hell that's a flashback. Remember watching some BC PvP video years ago. Guy was playing a male orc Hunter and running a nude mode.
---
some people may like to immerse themselves by rushing to 60 and camping redridge for 18 hours a day ;)
---
Lol this is such silly logic.
---
Unless it's also good for fury warriors.
---
I have played wow for 14 years and vanilla wow since before nostalrius. I know every aspect of the game and really only enjoy raiding so I have to kill my Borden

"Ok, you're just memeing at this point, you dont get aimed shot at level 18"
---
That's not what he said at all. 
---
Tek is saying that the date to mana ratio of aimed shit at level 51 is about equal to multishot with his build. 
---
Having Screech means your owl doesn't take nearly as much DMG as a pet without it would so you don't have to use the pet heal as much as you think.
---
Looks like a perfectly serviceable shopping list generator. Good work.
---
Never thought of it like that but that is such a cool idea.. like an aternate reality timeline and future expacs based upon different versions of the game. (But please, no Pandas, no Goblins and no Worgens.. Spacegoat and BElf yes but in some other kinda way to introduce them)
---
But the female human cast animations are the best!
---
What if I hate leveling and enjoy time at 60 more. I rather get it over with.
---
No, you don't need to be NE, NE is one of the worst classes you can go for rogue. If you just want to gank low level players your race doesnt matter, if we are talking about ganking in the open world, yes, rogue is one of the best classes to do that, but if we are talking about strictly 1v1s, bgs, grp pvp, then no, rogues get countered hard by some classes and players that know  how to play against them.
---
If you don't know which role you would like to do, there is absolutely nothing meaningful to be said on this topic.
---
Where's Ice Barrier at lvl 40?
---
How is this different to trying to play with a buddy on a realm that’s pop capped?  The small minority of folks that want to roll with buddies should be way less important than balancing a server.  
---
Server balance is mission critical IMO
---
It’s exactly as expected and should be. A bit surprised that the average horde raid doesn’t have more Shaman though.
---
Honestly salv is super overrated compared to your tank having windfury, getting more rage, and generating way more threat because of it.
---
Ah, the core of the problem.
---
You say this, but I'm going alliance this time and although I like warlocks, I can't for the life of me chose between any gender-race combination on alliance - I dislike them all that much. 
---
On horde choice was always female orc, whose animations I find most appealing.
---
I was talking about going to Ogrimmar and ganking there without getting instakilled by the npc guards.
---
Least fun for casting, paladin buffs, idk who had the iead ot making paladin buffs 5 min cd and 15 min cd using candles, idk if someone REALLY enjoys buffing, but for me is tedious as fuck
---
Least fun for playing against, Viper String, my main is a priest so you can imagine my poor mana dropping to zero either im healing or shadow.
---
You can get inside org with any race, just make sure you pick one with good racials to survive 1v1s or even 1v2s when you are inside.
---
Which racial would you recommend me?
---
We really livin in 2019
---
I don't have the list in front of me but I think a some warrior abilities don't really need more than rank 1 for leveling quests/dungeons.
---
Made ones for:
---
Rogue: [https://i.imgur.com/6KsYi8Y.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6KsYi8Y.jpg)
---
Warrior: [https://i.imgur.com/peI6hS7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/peI6hS7.jpg)
---
I'll update this comment whenever I make new ones. Check back for the class you want.
---
You look at that muscly orc booty don't you
---
There's also the "problem" of 40man raids making tanks less desirable for raiding percentage-wise. So while a tank can EASILY find a group for 5man, he will have a much harder time finding raid spot.
---
And because a 5man tank can get a group anytime, plus reserve any items, he will get 5man BiS items pretty fast. Meaning there will be a shortage of 5man tanks. But probably an abundance of raid tanks.
---
Vanilla WoW: Delicate but potent.
---
&gt; Thats the part I like the most about Classic. Classes are not supposed to be equal in every area. They should all have their strengths and weaknesses. 
---
You mean as opposed to what... a warrior that excels in every single area (PvE tank / dps, PvP), at least end game? The only downside of a warrior is somewhat low initial leveling speed, but picks up in speed after level 40ish or so.
---
It depends, dwarf will give you a free win against rogues, gnome is better if you are fighting mages for example, human perception is good against rogues/druids only but the dwarf racial is better.
---
Yeah I loved the idea of being some random in this world wondering around making a name for myself and figuring out what is going on / lore
---
But doesn't perception allow you to attack first? And in a rogue vs rogue the one who attacks first usually wins right?
---
GW2 has a short short tutorial after which you're free to go exploring shit in many different zones or do storyline quests on the side.
---
Expose armor is also great for rogues in pvp vs high armor targets such as warriors and paladins. It certainly has it's uses not just pve.
---
Some people think there was some magic formula at some point in time during Vanilla. Far from it. Blizzard would have kept balancing had TBC not been in the works. 
---
I say give it a few months after the final content release (Naxx) and then introduce TBC-esque balance changes.
---
Zug zug
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt;But doesn't perception allow you to attack first
---
It's easy to spot perception and you can pre-vanish to get the opener first, it's not that useful.
---
&gt;And in a rogue vs rogue the one who attacks first usually wins right
---
It's not always like that, keep in mind you'll be facing Orc rogues that can resist your opening, in shit gear you wont be able to burst someone in 1 stun lock, most of the time you'll have to reset the fight with Blind, being a dwarf just deny that possibility making the other rogue's life harder.
---
But to become raid main tank one must sacrifice a lot of time and effort. Guilds help,  but not with everything if it's not an overly rich guild. Plus the personal responsibility.
---
Desperate prayer and stoneform.
---
Honestly I only played Rogue and Warrior in Vanilla and I used every skill on rogue except gouge. Having it break due to rupture, Garrote, or DMG over time poison was stupid. Should have broken on skill use so if you Garrote, Hemo, Hemo, Rupture, Gouge you've got a second to get away.
---
Which race would you prefer for rogue. Orc or Dwarf?
---
Nightelves stealth is decently better against level 60s.  But honestly the other races racials are way better (in my opinion) if you’re actually fighting.  You can remove bleeds/poisons as a dwarf so you can restealth.  You can break slows as a gnome to get away.  You can use perception if you know there’s another rogue nearby to get the guaranteed opener.  Honestly nightelves are cool, but they aren’t optimal.
---
Gnome, as a former horde you should know why
---
Makes sense, to roll Horde you have to be seriously committed to the faction to face looking that damn ugly for the entirety of your WoW experience.
---
runes,that boss where 3 people have to click, leeroy, waves of whelps (i wanna say drek and his mount dropped the twin swords), beast and then the three dragonkin. I must have done it about 60 times trying to get something off the last boss, I don't even remember what it was. I remember the hardest part of the instance was trying to get a tank.
---
NEETs represent
---
Pal/Priest/Shaman
---
Then Hunter feign + cables or warlock SS... I guess?
