I agree, there is nothing wrong with the default bars and I don't think it is necessary to use an addon to replace them.
---
---
---
His logic was we’d get invited to every group because of it :) and he was right
---
Yes, I'm the retarded one. Mr. My monitor was covered in sticky notes cuz I got ninja looted a billion times and never learned shit.
---
Lol alright dude
---
I'm pretty sure the &lt;1% figure exclusively comes from the population of level 60 characters, but I could be wrong.
---
Pretty much this. Before level 40, I was drinking after some pretty large pull chains and sometimes 2-3 mobs at a time (bear). After level 40, I never drank again until 60 unless during a group healing situation or after PVP.  
---
Agreed Lemondredge.  
---

---
If you have a gaming MMO mouse (with side thumb buttons) you can easily just bind most of your actions to your mouse without ever needing many addons to re-organize the hud or macros for that matter.
---
That being said, some addons DO make your life easier, but it's not like I'll be slitting my wrists and acting all emo like some people do...\*cough cough\* if they don't exists on launch.
---
If anyone wants, I can go grab the billing history for my account dating back to Vanilla and show how many credits they handed out due to servers pooping the bed.  Getting 1/2 day credits each month was fairly common, sometimes you even got a whole week if the problem lasted more than a day or two
---
At level 60 with good gear. Mr level 30 fury war with no +hit needs to suck it up and put on a shield 
---
I agree with you there, yeah. While leveling you're just gimp if you decide you won't tank dungeons. At 60 it's a whole different game.
---
I remember playing the Queue Dance with queues on Mal'ganis commonly in the multiple thousands and asking my mother (I was 14 at the time of launch) to log me into the queue about an hour before school let out so that I could play by the time I got home two hours later.
---
My biggest worry is they try to justify using sharding during the opening of  AQ.
---

---
Great story. Congratulations.
---
I hope you’re honoring your dad to this day as some of us, while still social outcasts, had no such pleasure with our fathers.
---
&gt; and they scale terribly into T3 (while warlocks scale better than nearly everyone else). Hunters are just above feral Druids in Naxx for dps, (which is about 1/2 the dps of mages and warriors) but hunters provide almost no raid utility.
---
Yeah I see DPS charts confirming it from private servers, but are we 100% sure its not some private server fuckery? I tried to google old vanilla DPS meters, but I did not have much luck :(
---
I  am and know I’ll pay it forward to my children one day. Sometimes I wonder if he even enjoyed wow or just wanted a way to connect with me, I’m not sure which of the two I prefer.
---
That's it. This meme is dead.
---
It was less of a zergfest directly to the enemy bosses then.  You still had to cap each tower and some of the graveyards and it was more methodical, and there would be diversionary attacks and the big furball in the field of strife while everything was going on.  It didn't take days to complete but neither was it over within 15 minutes anymore - you could expect to get in and have it last between 1 and 2 hours, and most people by then would get desperate enough to bring out the elemental gods to give their side an edge but that was about the only time you ever saw them by that point.  Most people played enough to get the honor discount on mounts or a specific weapon, and that was about it.
---
Get the Cobalt Crusher for that sweet on-hit effect chance, and play the ultimate game of Shaman Roulette in your early 30s.
---
Get the WF proc *and* the on-hit Frost, and you can one shot damn near anything.

Bears, Boars, Carrion Birds, Cats, Crabs, Crocolisks, Turtles, and Wind Serpents eat fish.

[Kargoz's duo leveling guide/preview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4)
---
Earth shock interrupts in vanilla and BC, wind shear was added in Wotlk
---
Exactly what I needed. Thank you so much!
---
That printed guide will be great for having a nostalgic wank session, but the version on his website has a faster route and class steps are being added all the way up to 60 for each class.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
I see a lot of conversations like this on the subreddit but fear we’ll be a minority.
---
As soon as classic’s been there for a few months i imagine the same stigmas will arise from playing weak speaks.
---
And i’m not sure how to feel about it. On one hand, ret palis and feral druids were my jam in vanilla; on the other, i know exactly how weak they were in pve (don’t even get me started on 31 balance druid).
---
It will be a case of tolerance versus patience. You can preach all you want; but when it’s the group’s sixth wipe in the middle of Maraudon and your druid/pala is doing slightly more dps than the tank; then you will be truly tested.
---
&gt; Yes, I'm the retarded one.
---
See, now you've got it!
---
:O Thank you! I had no idea this existed
---
Depends if they use normalised pets or not. Don't remember which patch it was but there's a 1s auto attack speed pet which beats everything else. 
---
If you can't have fun turning someone into a sheep and them blowing them up with a death ray, then I don't think you can ever have fun.  :P
---
But yeah, they synergize well and you get death ray at like Lv35 or something crazy.  No doubt a great choice.
---
It's a shame, too. People on private servers are still using the VanillaGuide add on which is total dogshit compared to what he has on his website now. Study up on it come classic, friend. :)
---
Anything works in 5 man since they are very simple. A ele shaman might make the run slower but u can clear 5 mans with anything
---
Shaman DPS of any kind will be fine in 5 mans. Depending on who you ask, it might even be preferable if you'd be the only shaman in the group, WF totem is just too good.
---
Yes mining and engineering is the way to go
---
&gt;Hunter / Anything
---
This is actually really shitty after the hunter gets their pet (or even conc-shot at 8) for anything not a druid maybe shaman.  The hunter is carrying from that point on and it's more beneficial to the hunter to just go solo.  Hunter's are going to want to use cheetah and don't get pack until you both have mounts anyways, so there's a lot of sitting around tapping your foot.
---
Also want to throw in Warrior / Druid is also aids for the same reason and possibly Warrior / Shaman as well.  Those speed boosts at level 20 and feline swiftness becomes annoying to play with when your partner is stuck at base running speed.
---
&gt;Paladin / Warlock
---
Same as hunter anything, I did this for about 20 levels on tights rope before my pally leveling partner quit.  The pally is 100% being carried here.   Great you can heal me so I can cut myself more liberally but that's not justifying the reduction in leveling speed incurred on me as a lock.
---
I look forward to the complaining. Sometimes it's just fun to bitch - especially if we're all in agreement. The little changes here and there will be the basis for much conversation and joking around. Memes and inside-jokes may propagate. But it's not gonna stop us from playing.
---
It'll be fun.
---
Such a ridiculous clip. Rup AKA Roope was a legend on a really old ~2012 private server I’ll get banned if I name
---
&gt;Are you trying to say that doing dungeons and battlegrounds burns more calories than selling enchants?
---
Compare the APM.
---
Paladin is horrible to level, you just need to grind it out.
---
Warlock PvP trinket actually doesn’t even work on stuns. Each class has their own version that removes 3 specific types of CC.
---
SL warlocks shit on shadowpriests, his drain mana along with felhunter dispelling ur dots on him will counter your mana burn
---
Mages is one of the most important classes in world pvp with IMP blizzard spam and more insane control
---
I've been playing on and off since the beginning and I'm still going to be that random lone fucker wondering around different zones exploring and getting killed.
---
It's always great. HP is down and you're running away from mobs but got hamstringed or frosted? Use "Escape Artist"! Tada!
---
Hell yea, man. Gonna finish up this semester and get my life all situated to settle down and play some WoW for the first time in over ten years.
---
A lot of people had the same fears with RuneScape and their classic server launch (Old School RuneScape). There was a fear of skilling elitists and hardcore pvpers just destroying everyone and claiming the hiscores, but the community actually had a nice balance of elitists/tryhards/casuals/noobs which ended up working out in the end.
---
I have no doubt that Classic will turn out the same way. 
---
It's not only reasonable, it's literally the only scenario in which a launch of million+ players can be handled day one and them have any sort of gameplay experience that isn't frustrating. Blizzard spends millions of dollars to make their games happen. They can't have a launch where it's practically unplayable and turns off 9/10 players for the first week.
---
Hey sorry for delay in response, my wife went into labor with our first child after typing this and i havent had a chance to respond. I still havent had a chance to read through this, but I want to give you props for writing an honest response, and not just a flippant remark dismissing our conversation.
---
I'm gonna stick with duct taping two muffin tins around my head. 
---
Yeah you're right. Looked into it and the private server (original Nost server) I based my answer on got that detail wrong.
---
You just ruined my mood for the rest of the evening, possibly tomorrow as well.
---
Yeah, you can find plenty of videos of Reckoning Ret Pallies or Ehnance Shamans one shotting people in BGs too,  except everyone knows you’re seeing the most selective, curated highlights of otherwise medeocro specs. 
---
I'm pretty sure a raiding Warlock has less APM than an Enchanter in Org.
---
My friends and I(Horde) farmed gold in Un'goro Crater. Anytime people fucked with us we would corral them into the graveyard that sat in a dead end of a narrow valley and then just hang out at the exit of the valley.
---
Why would it be unlikely, considering Classic is past 1.11?
---
I’ve played through low level zones so many times I don’t think I’ll need a qh addon &gt;.&lt; 
---
To be clear. If you do not want to be a T1 raider who is considered to be in the 1% of his server. Elemental shaman is completely raid-able on. The reason why you want the perfect comp isn't that you can't raid with out it. It's that hyper effective people want to put every raid on farm. That means they want every raid to be as fast as possible. This means for those people they want you to be as efficient as possible. Because efficiency is what they are aiming for. 
---
If you don't mind being in a guild that doesn't clear every raid every week. While putting every boss on auto farm. Then there is nothing wrong with being ELE. Keep in mind that will be the state of 99% of guilds. 
---
As far as if they can do 5 mans. The answer is easily.
---
As somebody playing private servers for years, I cannot wait to be overrun by noobs. It's a bit like having children. No you can never experience what it was like to walk into MC the first time, but you can vicariously live through them.
---
does your peepee get hard too? 
---
Mercader was pretty damn impressive too if you haven't watched/heard of him.
---
Why don't you just leave that guide for the "grinding levels" and do some questing or dungeons?
---
Yeah I can do the same for some races but not all. Haven't fully decided what I am going with yet. After level 20 or so I won't know much except general stuff when it comes to quests.
---
Maybe, just hear me out here I know this sounds crazy... the gaps are there for spells he gets at later level :O
---

---
I'm going to Pali tank and then swap to holy when it's finally raid time. I'm fine with forcing the meme but I'm also not going to expect other people to.
---
Interesting, in my first month on ps I have yet to meet someone that is not from NA, mostly US and some Canada so far. 
---
Please tell me you're going to be on the PVP server. 
---
What spec are you talking about? Or are you saying that PVE combat rogue is effective at pvp? 
---
I was running on the assumption that we wouldn't have a working addon at launch and it would take some time to get working.
---
I personally planned on using the wiki for quest lists I didn't miss reputation I wanted but I did plan on figuring out the quests on my own given that am playing a new faction.  Most of these quests will be a blind run.  :p
---
Im looking forward to Barrens chat and “hey guys weres Mankriks wife?” Being a legitimate problem! 
---
😂
---
&gt; Some of us don’t want to break TOS  
---
wat
---
That damn wife! I found her and made a mental note of where she is.
---
"Oh, she's right next to these objects. I'll definitely remember for next time."
---
A few years later: *Approach objects* "Where the hell is she?"
---
I'm lost.  
---
Honestly that could be the case. Thinking about it when I made the comment. I was referring to my experience pre Nost. Before Blizzard announced they were making a classic server. It could be the P.S. server community exploded with NA. players upon this announcement. The ping has always made U.S. players far more rare then EU ones. A good example being that warriors are unplayable after 100 ping because charge no longer works.

I feel like ~30 is better cutoff. I would assume when people get their level 40 talent they're more inclined to stay
---
I'd invite Moonkins into my group. I don't care about the status quo. it's a game and I play to have fun.
---
Hell yea, brother. Just play to have fun.
---
Boomkins dancing like no one is watching.
---
Lupos if it's not nerfed, otherwise a cat will be fine.
---
Cat/Wind Serpent are pretty equal imo, it comes down to preferences. WS has more potential dps if you can micro harder on fights where you'd want your pet outside of cleave range but cat will do more damage if your guild manages their debuffs right and if you macro your pet correctly.
---
Wolf is if you want to be lazy and not use a pet.
---
Just play the game and have fun.
---
It's only a game.
---
Maybe my standards are too high, but as a healer I always heal pets when possible and expect my fellow healers to follow suit.
---
Pets aren't as important as players of course, but a dead pet equals less DPS. I see it as my job to keep pets alive the same way it's my job to keep other players alive. Every bit helps.
---
No
---
No problem bro. Just remember from now on. You picked a Shaman you are a golden child. You deserve the world and your totems are the shit. Many T1 guilds actually want 8 shamans. This means your pickings in casual guilds are insanely good. Unless you are trying to be T1 like I said the world is your oyster lol.
---
Just to further explain what I mean. One of the big complaints about shamans is that they go oom too fast. Well after you get a little gear going in your guild all bosses pre aq40 die in like 30 seconds. The reason why people get mad at shamans for running oom. Isn't that they can't kill the boss, it's that they need to drink water after so they can't just keep plowing throw shit like all the other casters. Most guilds will want to stop and regroup  after a boss so this wont be a problem for 99% of players.
---
I'm going to be a Prot Pali on my journey to 60. I will never criticize anyone. 
---
New WoW is nothing like Classic WoW (Vanilla WoW). So a lot of modern *experienced* players may not have ever even seen Classic.
---
This is 100% correct. Getting crit due to sitting won't proc any talents tho.
---
Same.  In my personal experience on pservers I've found groups tend to get giddy and excited when a true classic virgin stumbles into the group.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Being viable and being optimal is two separate things
---
There are 3 reasons why i am extremely excited for vanilla rp. 
---
1. No sharding. Sharding killed open world RP events, vibrant rp-centric cities, and server identity crucial to an RP community
---
1. Characters that arent subject to superfriends-teir writing. Why in the fuck would thrall ever put garrosh, a racist orc with no understanding of politics on azeroth in charge after very carefully working to improve relations with the alliance? Why would tauren druids talk to the forsaken at all after burning Teldrassil? Why the fuck do alliance shamans get the doomhammer? Why is jaina a raid boss? The core characters in lore have not been written "in-character" for a long time. 
---
2. No railroading. Railroading is a tabletop term for when your game master writes a campaign that follows a very specific plot, your own character choices and exploration be damned. Post cata, questlines are so wrapped up in the plot that there was no way for you to RP your character with your own motivations. It was way more  interesting, rp wise, to have to build your rep with a faction rather than show up and have everyone kiss your feet as the chosen one. What if i wanted to RP an underdog, or anyone who isnt a mary sue?  When everyone is special, no one is.
---
You are right, retail does have more QoL for Rpers. But the entire discussion surrounding classic in general should remind us that QoL doesnt necessarily make a game better. 
---
Also, people on RP servers tend to be nicer and suffer less "purple blindness" because their goals arent about extracting the most loot in the shortest amount of time. Its also really important to note that rp-pvp is the least likey to have a streamer or their cancerous fanbase. Even if RP is an afterthought and dead on the serv, one without the zerg of fortnite twitch kiddies will be kino
---
The question is going to come up in that 5 man, why aren't you healing?  And then you the spriest/druid and can bitch over who should do it.
---
The same goes for warriors, I believe it's best for the community to "tank shame warriors" who join 5 mans to dps while the group continues to look for a tank.  
---
Warlocks only get like 3 new spells after 32, everything else is just a new rank.
---
[Here](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7717/ravager) is a link to the axe the other items are linked there as well.
---
Yeah I agree, but in raids I never have the pet windows open except for the group, making it hard to spot the hunter pet. Which usually dies anyway before the melee is topped up. 
---
Making a wolf superior as they will be usefull on all bosses.
---
I didnt play in MoP so I don't know what youre referring to, but youre basically describing integer overflow. So yes, that could be why. If the integer for health stops at 255, you could say "the health has to reach 0 X amount of times", and X would be stored as a second variable. Once BOTH are 0, then Garrosh is actually at 0 health (and dead).
---
Well here is my weekly shot in the dark. I'm a West Coast (US) player looking to raid late nights. Would like to play Alliance but would consider switching Horde if I found a guild to play with. The raid would need to start after 10 PM PST. I would also prefer playing on a PvP server.
---
Actually he was referring to nostalgia. He meant we remember it better than it was.
---
Unfortunately, it's the only good option for Alliance leveling in undocumented servers. Thank God Joana is making an Alliance guide.
---
Preface, I've always been under the impression that certain classes should not have the cloak visual enabled, Warlocks, Priests, Warriors, Death Knights.  Just the flavor of it seems off.  
---
This is one of those sets you turn the cloak back on for. 
---
I have over a decade on RP realms. People from RP realms trolled and created more drama than those that didn't RP. I think if you polled roleplayers, you'd find my experience is not unique.
---
Wow, calm your jimmies there friend. The thing is, 40 people would go through mobs like butter even in an area like Stonetalon. I've looked at the damage numbers, they don't one or two or even three hit a level 4 wearing a piece or two of mail, not to mention they probably wouldn't survive long enough to deal that many hits 40 people is so much damage the group would probably be fine with like 3 healers. Mages and warlocks would do better to say in the starting zones, but literally everyone else can leave for greener pastures and get awesome xp per minute, and a totally unique gaming experience to boot.
---
The low level pvp did happen on some private server launches btw. And those were just impromptu because there was plenty of mobs to kill with dynamic respawns. I would argue the game was designed to incentivize low level mass PvP.
---
The only thing that'd drive me back to the private servers is them offering a closer to legit "Classic" WoW.
---
Just plan on having a blast.
---
The biggest advice would probably be to research your class a bit in order to understand your leveling specs.
---
Changing your spec more than once or twice during the leveling process is extremely expensive.  Take your time when clicking those talent points to prevent accidents.
---
Skip Feral Aggression. Any combination of tier 2 talents is better. 
---
Same here, except it was a gigantic RP raid on Theramore. Hundreds of people from both factions were lined up in different battle formations with their guilds (though it inevitably devolved into a gigantic melee) Good times.
---
Yeah I am not sure if there will be an addon or not on launch. One will show up quick either way I am sure. I won't be looking them up either though. Want to force more interaction.
---
[removed]
---
You aren't the only one, bud.
---
Glad running.
---
Checkmate, atheists.
---
Whelp they did take down last weeks pinned update on the official classic forums. Maybe you are on to something? Or maybe we are all just going stir crazy.
---
Its more than just talents and abilities that need to be changed. Blizzard will have to add in dozens of new pieces of gear and tier sets.
---
It wouldn't matter how much better you made balance druid there is so little spell damage leather gear in game. As for balance druids rolling on cloth items ... your shadow priests, warlocks and mages will say "get f\*\*\*\*\*"
---
If so then you are right, I just see the total number of players vs the people who stay more than a month or so is going to be a huge difference.
---
The second Blizzard starts making small balance changes to classes and raids is where I lose faith in Classic. If anyone genuinely trusts Blizzard to not fucking ruin this game the second they realize they can start changing things, they're a fool. Go look at the current state of wow, that's where allowing Blizzard to do whatever they want will get the game.
---
Definitely. Applaud this sentiment and it is exactly what I am going for too. Maintanked up to, and including, AQ40 (just didn't really get into Naxx) and I am looking to do so again, and this time make sure there are boomkins and enhancement shamans and shadow priests in my groups and raids if they wish to come.
---
Looking to be in, or form, a guild with this mindset. If someone wants to play something suboptimal, because they love the playstyle, I want to do the best to include them in as much content as possible. When we had stuff on farm in vanilla we had non-raiding guildies in greens come to raids to get some gear. The joy they got from an unexpected piece of gear, or just experiencing the raid, was pretty special. 
---
I love hearing about people starting guilds that are just going to be focused on World Defence too - just defenders of all the gankees. Love it.
---
You'll find plenty of players who have varying playstyles from uber l33t to super casual...just try to find a group that shares your mindset and playstyle, whatever it may be. It might take some time, but finding people who enjoy the game in the same ways as you just makes the entire social experience so much more rewarding, imo.
---
no they dont
---
Classic did have class balance, it just revolved around more than just raiding.
---
As for honest-to-goodness, actual info from Vanilla, I’m beat. For all I know we could get to Classic this Summer and Hunters could be top DPS the entire time.
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** Grykogh! ^(hug)
---
nobody is gonna use a boar or an owl over BT, the fuk u talking about lol.  BT is insane for leveling, even any 1.2 cat will be better than a stupid boar or owl
---
&gt;so as far as raid mechanics and fights go i am clueless. 
---
Well, fortunately for you, fights prior to AQ/Naxx generally have very few mechanics. Sometimes they have literally none. There are multiple bosses in MC that are just straight up tank-and-spank.
---
I don't mean that as a criticism of Vanilla, to be clear, super advanced and complicated combat just isn't why Vanilla is fun. Just want to reassure you that if you can learn LFR mechanics on live then you will be more than capable of rapidly picking up the mechanics in Vanilla raids (again, Naxx is a different ballgame from the rest of Vanilla raids in terms of complexity).
---
Uldaman was terrible. Not only was it a long run through Badlands, but through the pre-instance areas and then again through the dungeon to get back
---
/shrug theres always Classic BC to wait for
---
And their mount, since that's a pretty non-trivial purchase for your first character on a fresh account.
---
BC had the advantage of 10 more talent points, deeper talent pools, and raids designed around 25 people. Even if you get the community on board with balance changes, I don't know what they could even do to that wouldn't overpower those specs in other areas of the game without drastic redesign. Pve raiding is one of many aspects of the game. 
---
I used my pet a lot when raiding, but there were fights where it was just going to die to AOE even with a lot of micro and I couldn't rez it in the middle of a fight so it stayed parked next to me, which made a wolf the best pet. Sometimes I'd have the pet charge in during the burn phase of a boss for that extra bit of DPS to get over the hump.  On fight likes rag I'd make sure my pet had maxed out fire resists and I'd use him to tank/slow down one of the sons of rag since we didn't have the AOE to kill them as a group typically.  
---
I'd typically rez my pet at least 10 times a run so he did get a lot of use.  I used my pet extensively when pulling the MC on mobs like giants.  I'd use my pet body pull the mob to the MT and I'd pull the other mob to the OT.  When I'd pull typically the raid leader would assign a healer to heal me and my pet which was nice.
---
It sounds like you just want to play on a fresh TBC server.
---
If you're a fan of classic how can you not rate Crapacylsm as the worst? It literally DESTROYED everything left over from Classic. The world revamp and flying in starting areas destroyed so much of the game. 
---
Cataclysm was the epitome of "design by committee". They tried to appeal WotLK kiddies and Classic/TBC mmorpg players and ended up pleasing no one. 
---
There was no vision other than "how can we maximise profits?" It was a heartless, soulless mess of compromises and flawed design. 
---
lets not forget maraudon, where half your group gets kinda lost in the cove on the search for the portal.
---
Granted, but now you become skinnable.
---
Yes , yes they do. A bit more health is not as important as the threat gain from weapon skill or berserking. Especially horde side.
---
I hope you enjoy levelling, it'll take forever 
---
Private server hero. 
---
Granted, but the Alliance has forbidden totems and will expel you. And Horde will kill you since you still are a human.
---
So Booty Bay will be your new home and capital.
---
They were underpowered in most things PvE except tanking 5 mans, but had a lot of utility for PVP. They could 1v1 most classes and escape from the rest. Good levelers, too.
---
I'm hoping the UI addons are available after a few weeks. Really hoping pfui is going to make it into classic.
---
But not interested in any quest addons or anything else like that. I'm looking forward to the questing and exploration and discovery. I don't want an addon telling me where to go and what to do, it's one of the main reasons I am excited for classic.
---
This and being able to go where and want and quest where I want is what I have been missing for years in MMOs. Single player games have been moving more towards non-linear open-world questing, and MMOs have been moving towards linear railroading of their quests. Pretty strange.
---
There will be vastly more people at Classic launch than the original WoW launch in Nov 2004. Thats why sharding will be done. 
---
It's probably going to attract a smaller audience but I think the quality of people will be staggeringly better. Will be my first time on an RP-PvP server, so maybe I'll bring the average down though. lololol
---
Vanilla Launch was you competing with 100 other people over 6 pygmy surf crawler spawns which have a 50% chance to drop their quest item of which you need to gather 8, and take 5 minutes to respawn.
---
It was not fun, it was frustrating.
---
Robert "Would you like the nature metaphor or the sex metaphor?" Jim "Oh god nature please." Robert "You see Jim when two animals are having sex..." Kills me Every time.
---
Well done.
---
Totally forgot this. You're absolutely right.
---
what about seeing a warrior dual wielding while leveling?
---
Expect a slower paced game that feels like a true RPG. I advise you to take a look at what is the leveling experience of each class and how they perform in endgame content (both PvP and PvE) to make sure you don't regret what you chose to roll as when you reach lvl 60, as it takes a while to get there.
---
Other than that, I would look at nothing else and have a blast experiencing everything for the first time. I and many people in this sub would love to be able to do that. You can reroll talents so don't worry about your build it anything until it matters at lvl 60, just try to have fun and discover things in your own pace.
---
Those pants sure look....breezy
---
If you've played any modern WoW let me just say that the majority of the time taking on two NPCs your level is inadvisable. 
---
Druids tank 5 mans/UBRS just fine. People are just overblowing how important war tanks are for raids. You need one warrior for MTing the big bad. Druids and pallies can OT.
---
I've played hunter - druid with a partner all through 1-60. It was quick, efficient and mostly painless even if my partner was completely new to mmo's. Pull with pet and shred all day, switch form heal pet and pull another pack. When it broke down and we took a few too many mobs at the same time we had all kind of tricks to deal with it. Either i was fast enough to top the pet and switch to bear if i got healing aggro or pre hot myself in preparation of taking all of the mobs. If the pet died we usually had the power to dps them down with me just tanking them but otherwise bear kiting through frost trap was enough.
---
Innervate when you reach 40 is the bomb, you will have almost 0 downtime even without it. She could drink while the pet tanked and i shreded away. When she hit 100% mana from drinking me and her pet had usually already taken another pack making it cheap mana wise for her to heal it up, so i could get the final ticks to 100% mana or just having to use a rejuvenation.
---
Since she did not kite our elite 2manning was a bit hampered. But it was always enough with me spending all mana but 1 shift on healing her pet then going to bearform and tanking while she kept on shooting. 
---
If the druid specs into feline swiftness earliest possible they get it 30%movement speed at level 21 making it suitable to with the early aspect of the cheeta which i want to remember arrives at level 20. 
---
Also druid stealthing and hunter pet pulling and feigh death gives you plenty opportunity to skip things
---
This is a good idea. Research your spec. That being said, have fun with some non standard specs. My hunter was based around knitting and cc and leveled a lot in BGs. Sure he could have done more damage, but making sure I was just dancing around and letting off viper strings to anyone with less than 20% Mana left was more fun to me. I was at 24 days played before hitting 60.
---
Bro can we talk about the mage who blinks before the cheap shot happens? Or doesn't start casting on the sheeped rogue? That's a fun highlight but these guys were just super bad. 
---
just hit him with thunderfury duhh
---
a couble of raid bosses? bear can tank every boss up to naxx that doesnt have a fear and even those bosses are possible if you are alliance and have enough dwarf priests. its a little harder on the healers, but its also better tps, so its a fair tradeoff.
---
also fights like rag are where he shines even more coz he can just solo tank it due to his charge.
---
Dat ass tho
---
That's sorda contradictory though, isn't it? Battles as large closer to 80 v 80 were pretty common in Blackrock in Classic. And for dragon spawns 120 v 120 isn't unheard of.
---
If those sorts of things are impossible for them they shouldn't even be hinting that there won't be Sharding later in the game, much less promising.
---
I played a prot war and never really cared about what spec the dps were.  I would much rather bring a good personality that a grouchy mage/rogue.  Just be careful to not break cc with chain lightning or that fire totem. 
---
I felt like I had a lot of trouble sustaining my mana.  The priest/mage would be 75% mana and I would be close to oom.  I would have to drink while they pulled the next pack, I felt like this kept me from keeping up on DPS.    I know Major Mana pots were an option but it always feels bad using them in situations where you’re not at risk of wiping.   
---
The biggest issue in the amount of time/mana spent on setting down the totems.  You also have to get good at running ahead of the group, drop totems THEN start drinking.  Send a friendly reminder to the tank to pull packs back to the pre-established totems so you don’t have to replace them after every pull.
---
Hopefully the DPS meters do a better job tracking totem damage because a lot of that damage would go unnoticed.
---
Unless the item is Mail/leather, you’re going to get a lot of shit rolling on spellpower gear against mages/warlocks.  You could also whisper the healer in the group and see what healing items they don’t need so you can build your healing set.
---
whenever i read a post like this, I fondly remember the bland playstyle of many classes, and even though the leveling experience is quite hard and engaging, raiding can be an absolute snoozefest. 1 button classes in combination with bosses that have less mechanics than retail trash packs..man I'm kinda afraid to go back there.  
---
I still hope they go with an updated graphic slider (which wouldn't hurt anyone, the same way we have colour blind option nowadays, yayy) and I might roll a druid to torment myself. But the old models are hideous to say the least.  
---
On the bright side, pvp is a lot of fun for pretty much every class. Using items, ingi stuff, consumables and the whole kit at your disposal makes it engaging as hell!
---
This is classic WoW. There's a strong chance he hasn't bought a spell in 15 levels
---
Why? 
---
Granted.  While the item is on cooldown you can not use a traditional respec.
---
Is that a thong? 
---
I’ve been trying to shield myself from all the min maxing stuff. I feel that I won’t have as much fun if I stress about BiS / quest routes / auto attack timers. I don’t care about being the best. Like most of us, we just want to live that classic experience as close as we can. 
---
My assumption is that they failed to live up to their intended launch day with all the connection problems they had, so reliving 2004/2005 isn't my goal. The people who got an earlier start were never supposed to get clear of the pack and stay that way like they did. That gradual trickle was meant to turn into a massive wave that swept over the first few zones. A level 10 alone in Westfall would've had his/her kills stolen by raids of level 2-5s constantly, perhaps rather than fighting it they would've joined the raid, allowing them take on even stronger enemies.
---
Yeah? Well good luck getting T3 while you wait for 8 warriors to get all the tier tokens instead.  
---
During the final days of the beta there were things like that going on. I remember being in a huge group of dozens of low level horde (1-15, with a few higher levels mixed in) all gathering at the Crossroads and then running to Ratchet to catch the boat to Strangelthorn, run through Duskwood and then once we got to Elwynn Forest there was some decent PvP until higher levels showed up and everyone started insta-dying.
---
I don't remember seeing any PvP in Vanilla Launch until mid 20s in Stonetalon Mountains.
---
getting your first mount was such a big deal!  I remember all of my friends went to meet our buddy when he bought his first mount at the vendor and we all cheered when he mounted up for the first time (we were all varying levels of 20-40 and had pooled our gold together to buy the first mount with the understanding we'd all pitch in to help each other get mounted - lol noobs are bad at gold management).

 **&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance**
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm firsts and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out, as long as you have a mindset that’s willing to learn. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay, and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay.  
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release. May this be on the (hopefully) upcoming Test Servers, or meetings of some sort in the guild. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)**
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to dayraid
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!
---

---
Sounds like a great reason to play on a non-RP server.
---
Is that legal?
---
If they shard it down from say 6k online to 2k online I'll have much fewer complaints personally. The demo looked more like they divided the number by about 100 though...
---
This makes sense. I am playing a warrior and have a ping ~120-140 and havent had issues with charge?
---
Hard to say, as we cannot see the ranks of the spells on the bar. He has Curse of Tongues which you get at level 26.  The only "new" spell I don't see is Siphon Life but that might be hiding in one of his macros.
---
&gt;knitting
---
at least you were staying warm! :)  Just kidding glad you had fun.
---
Cheaper respec costs and some form of LFG (not automatic cross-server dungeon finder, but just a server-only mechanism, something like what we use currently for m+).
---
Don't pick a class based on its strengths.
---
Pick a class based on whether or not you are willing to tolerate its weaknesses.
---
Then it is no longer the same game
---
Then this becomes a "do-over", it becomes Classic 2k19.
---
Then when they inevitably fuck it up (which with modern Blizzard is a guarantee) then we need a new Classic. Which according to Blizzard's release schedule we might see in 2031
---
Then one of your kind appears again, and he also wants some "minor balance tweaks" and then we never get the game we want.
---
The point of this game is to get away from modern Blizzard and their shit game design and balancing nonsense. Inviting the Vampire into your house to fuck shit up again is not a wise decision.
---
Do you not see how dealing with mostly Warrior tanks and not having Balance and Ret "optimal" is a very small price to pay, just to keep that shitshow of a company of our backs?
---
Warning:  The world is dangerous.  Stick to the road it's safer!
---
honestly give it a try, i was put off a little at first never really liking PVP but it becomes a lot of fun after a while, you usually have a guild and friends to back you up, and world pvp becomes a blast when you're a part of a 100+ strong raid force bearing down on the opposing faction's capital city. it's also fun for the sense of identity, belonging to your battlegroup, and to your guild alliance. 
---
we never did much "fantasy speech" or class/race roleplaying, or i didn't anyway. i just found it a fair bit more engrossing than playing on a regular PVE server. way more community. you even get to know players on the opposite faction. our (horde) guild alliance would speak with the alliance guild alliance and we would organize battles and raids of capitals. it was a blast.
---
Nochanges refers to no changes to the base game that were not made during vanilla. Regional release schedules, patch progression, and game knowledge are none of those 
---
Leveling a paladin takes a certain [mindset](http://i.imgur.com/7XQeZhp.jpg?1).
---
My guild never turned someone down because of their spec. We never did any sever firsts, but we had fun. If you want to play a class that's not typical, you can still find a guild that isn't about min/max.
---
😅
---
I remember getting into blade’s edge mountain by ghost running down the cliffs 
---
Good lord turn off error speech.  
---
&gt; Yea yea i get it, #nochanges , burn me at the fucking stake.
---
this guy gets it
---
Why do Humans have a monopoly on the afterlife? BLIZZARD SO RACIST!
---
I wish that undead character models came on orc, troll, tauren, gnome, elf and dwarf bases. 
---
The major hyped private servers lag horribly, crash often, have queue times of hours, then after you hit level 2 after hours, the server hard crashes and everything gets rolled back.
---
It's not an enjoyable experience. Blizzard servers for retail cannot handle 100+ people at any given zone when streamers host events. 
---
In any raid, you should have at least 3 paladins. So folks are getting all the buffs they need. Generally speaking salv is the 'best' for DPS, followed by kings across the board with some exceptions. I like to say that "Kings is basically a free piece of gear". since it's giving you +10% stats.
---
Sanc for tanks is also pretty great, if a nice paladin specs into it. 
---
I don't have any numbers to back it up, and I'd be interesting to see some theorycrafting -- but my guess is:
---
* Tanks: Kings/Sanc/Might
---
* Caster DPS: Salv/Kings/Wis
---
* Melee DPS: Salv/Kings/Might
---
* Healers: Kings/Wis/Salv
---
Some classes would mix it up. Like spriest really liking Wisdom. And DPS wars don't benefit much from untalented Might, since BS is better.

---
Vanilla WoW is much slower paced than modern MMO, and you are expected to explore and discover rather than have information force-fed to you, and the game will punish you for making mistakes.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
There is a lot more downtime and mobs take longer to kill. A level 1 Warlock can only cast 3 shadow bolt before running out of mana, and 3 shadow bolt is not enough to kill a level 1 mob. Most solo players will be shocked to discover that they can only take on one mob at a time. 2 mobs means run, and hesitating to run means death.
---
Quests tell you where to go instead of showing you where to go. There are no map markers, there are no giant circles showing you the general area where a quest mob can be found, and there are no tooltips telling you that this mob is related to one of your quests. You actually need to read the quest to find out where to go (ie go the dead tree north west of ratchet to summon Ishamuhale), instead of just mindlessly following quest markers. Sometimes the quest doesn't tell you specific information about where mobs can be found and you need to run around and use your eyes to find them.
---
Modern WoW gives you new spells/abilities automatically as you level, and when you get a new rank in a spell it automatically replaces the old rank. In Vanilla you had to visit a class trainer to **purchase** new spells every 2 levels. They are not cheap either. If you quest then you should have no problem affording them, but many players do not buy all of their abilities so that they can start saving money for their level 40 mount. You also have end up with multiple ranks of the same spell in your spell book, allowing you to choose which rank to use (for mana efficiency for example).
---
Graveyards are fewer and farther between than modern MMO. If you die you can expect to run for up to 5 minutes to get to your corpse. Some zones have particularly difficult terrain, and even though your corpse is close to the GY you will have to run around an entire mountain pass to get to it. Be careful when you spawn, mobs agro from far away and they will kill you again quickly. You cannot simply run through the middle of a field of mobs to leave the area. They - Will - Kill - You. Many players will be surprised that they need to stick to the roads when traveling.
---
I don't care much about quest routes, but I don't like having anybody to blame but myself, if I lose to somebody in a 1v1 I don't like having "Oh he had better gear" as an excuse.
---
Just curious what was your major and current job now?
---
You mean one of the events they specifically mentioned wouldn't be sharded? 
---
Perhaps the earlier ones, the last two I played for many hours at launch with maybe 15 minutes of rollback between them. The servers crash much more now though, it's not like they stayed steady but I assume that's just funding.
---
Yo ya'll fucked up.
---
I was thinking of rolling a prot warrior but I heard tanking in vanilla is much harder and I'm already afraid of tanking in retail lol.
---
So much hate for leveling Paladins, but I did it back in 2006 and enjoyed it. Swinging a giant mace, class mount, good times.
---
Every interation of wow I've had very minimal addons. Generally a Unit frame for target of target, a dps meter, something that displays cooldowns on the skills and thats all. 
---
Classic will probably be the same.
---
Sounds to me like the problem then lies with "daily quests" as an entire mechanic.  In an MMO, people should be interacting with each other, not NPC's and rep vendors (beyond the minimum necessary for basic game mechanics).
---
Yea, daily quests only work when there’s a short term goal — like badges for the 395 ring before BfD. The idea that people still log in to do daily quests with no purpose — on multiple characters — is really insane.
---
1. Cool overview. 
---
2. I understand it's tempting to pick up furor or OOC early, but I've found it's better to just go down the feral tree ASAP until LOTP. 
---
Not doing so delays 6% crit, Attack power with predatory strikes, savage fury, HOTW, and FF. I can't stress enough how important all of those are. Especially HOTW and FF. If you really wanted to get furor I would at least wait until after FF, being able to have a mana free and ranged pull without shifting is soooo nice to have.  
---
Even after you get LOTP, I would still go to OOC before furor. The primary reason is that you want to be shifting as little as possible because it is so expensive to do so (even once you get HOTW). Kill at least 2-3 targets, unshift to HOT yourself, and go back to cat to maximize the 5SR as much as possible. And if you do get a OOC proc, save it for the expensive heal rather than another claw. 
---
The one exception I could see is getting a point in nature's grasp early on, just because it might save your life a couple of times. But this is debatable. 
---
3. I would skip feral charge until after you get FF and max Savage Fury (and anything else really). Feral charge is an amazing ability, but once you get cat form you will rarely use it while leveling. 
---
4. Feral aggression is fine for points 6-10. I could see an argument for thick hide. But I don't think there is an great option either way. Both thick hide and FB are pretty weak until 40+. Personally I would go for thick hide for reasons. 
---
5. I would prioritize predatory strikes over blood frenzy. You will only be using combo points for FB which isn't really that much of your dps. Your auto attacks will be the vast majority of your damage. 
---
6. Don't train rake, rip, or TF. They are simply not worth the gold or energy costs, and are very rarely used even at 60. Cower should be an obvious no train ever ability. You can also skip cure poison (abolish costs the same base mana) Wrath after rank 2, Starfire, etc. You will spend 95% of your time clawing (or shred if you do group play), and then using HT and Regrowth in between.  
---
7. Your stat priority should be AGI &gt; INT &gt; SPIRIT &gt; STRENGTH &gt; STAM. Strength only really takes over for Agility when you are 60 with BOK and HOTW. 
---
YOU SHOULD ALMOST NEVER NEED TO DRINK/EAT. You can prioritize Strength over Intellect and Spirit if you don't find yourself having mana issues.  
---
8. Alternative: Max out Brutal Impact and Improved Shred. Open with Pounce, Shred your life away and repeat. Not my personal style because moving around in stealth is too slow and getting caught without feral instinct sucks. But ultimately play what you enjoy the most. 
---
Check out any private server that might close when blizzard open theirs so that you can check out the game a bit :) 
---
Well when they intentionally fuck up their biggest most profitable franchises year after year it's hard to think they're going to stick true to having an "authentic experience" especially when they have that option now and they're choosing sharding over authenticity. 
---
The fear mongering comes from a place of rational thought. The reason I dont believe blizzard will give us what we want is because they aren't the same company they were 15 years ago. They dont have the same values, they don't want the same things. The current team has no idea why people love Vanilla. They're going to give us vanilla on their terms, which admittedly less shitty than the garbage they've turned their current game into, but it won't be as good as n*st**r*us which was a free fanmade server. 
---
Ahhh.. the answer was right in front of me the whole time!
---
... well, after an alt/tab.

I'm not a father myself since i'm even younger than you are. But when i read stories like that about awesome fathers like yours i sometime think that seeing their kid happy is the best thing that could happen even if they don't like what they're doing. It's not what they're doing that counts, it's who they are doing it with. :) 
---
Druid is highly dependent on the other healers in your raid. How good you perform as a druid is not in your own hands.
---
Yeah I think Hunter/Druid would be a fantastic duo. That one is probably top on my list right now. From research I've done, a lot of people tend to like this combo - and for good reason. Thank you!
---
I may be a minority apparently, but I absolutely want long AVs. IMO that was the most fun thing ever in the game. To me, fighting in massive sustained combat with tons of opponents steadily back and forth across a mountainous zone was like - kinda what I'm gearing up for in the first place - so I enjoyed actually fighting it out instead of just playing for the reward.
---
I read an official statement somewhere once that said over 80% of people don't make it past level 20.  Let that sink in for a second.
---
To that end, if we're aiming for authentic Vanilla server pops of around 2-3k, servers would need to launch with like 11k max pops.  Which is *absurdly* not authentic.
---
Alternatively, they could keep the population caps around 3k.  And then in 2 months, when each server is down to ~500 people playing, they start merging them.  At which point, how is that any different from having played on a 2-month-long shard?
---
Used to play wow up until Lich King, can someone explain this new classic wow I keep seeing on my feeds? I’m totally out of the gaming loop but I loved classic wow, if it’s coming back I’ll be so excited! 
---
I prefer it to italics :)
---
Both the stun timer and energy ticker were pretty standard rogue addons in classic. I used them for PvP and PvE. Every classic rogue video I can remember used one or both of those addons, too.
---
Damn man turn off the whining speech too.  
---
Im honestly only thinking the next news well get is the annual April 1st Blizz announcement where theyre going to reveal all the Tokens, real money auction house, dungeon finder and sharding to Classic
---
If you grind a little extra while leveling then you won't have to grind out entire levels at a time later on.
---
While questing if you find yourself in an area where there are mobs that you can kill fairly easily and there is not a lot of competition for kills then stay there and grind for a bit before turning in all your quests.
---
A quest will give you the same XP no matter what level you are, but the XP a mob gives you depends on your level difference, so it is better to kill while the killing is good and then turn in quests after. If you turn in quests and level first and then go back to grind on mobs afterwards then those same mobs will give less XP and you will need to find a different grinding spot.
---
TL;DR Grind before turning in quests that will cause you to level, and if you stumble across a good grind spot that is uncontested then stop what you are doing and grind for a bit before continuing on.
---
The way I see it the more information that's clearly laid out to the player the more variables they can account for rather than having to make predictions based on feeling. This doesn't necessarily make it easier, it just makes it more clear what your options are. Good players can take advantage of this and handle more situations than if this information was withheld or obscured in someway. Mediocre/bad players are still going to die in situations like these. In fact they might do a little worse trying to account for everything their client is telling them. 
---
As far as addons that swap gear I suppose there is some mechanical skill in getting good at that but very little. It's not like this is Brood War or Street Fighter, you're just pressing b and right clicking an item in your bag. The decision making is still the same.
---
druids got a bad rep in vanilla because they were pretty complex to play. You will find a raid spot as a healer who will be innervating the priests, and bring combat rez utility. but leveling, world pvp, etc...it is all great :D
---
Till you meat switches or traveling through stv.
---
Yes I fully back this opinion. Make sure you Judy research the general playstyle and get the feel for each class then stay absolutely oblivious to all the rest.  
---
  
---
Going in blind is also an option... ^the ^best ^option
---
When would you pick up feral charge and would you go for OoC or furor first after leader of the pack?
---
This is false, the majority of pserver players I encounter are from North America. Some Europeans and Russians for sure but overwhelmingly American and Canadian
---
&gt;Ret is not a thing, sorry
---
Fite me
---
80% of players or created characters? Because if it's created characters that's roughly what my Vanilla account looked like, and I played constantly. Also, if the 80% was players but includes free trial accounts, that fits me aswell, I started and ended 5 or 6 free trials before I committed to paying for the game.
---
You might say a lot of people didnt like old AV, but NO ONE likes AV 1.12.
---
The only advocates I see for AV 1.12 say they like it because they only have to play it for a weekend and never have to go back to it. That ISNT liking the BG, thats liking instant gratification rewards and after all, isnt that exactly the kind of thing were trying to get away from with Classic?
---
Hindsight is 20/20, people wanted changes to AV because its quality was lackluster, but just because they changed it doesnt mean it was made better. Your own argument of them "nerfing the PvE elements" had the opposite effect. It made AV all about PvE and avoiding the other side due to the freedom of mobility that the void of NPCs that were removed then offered. It in fact became MUCH less of a PvP BG and almost entirely a PvE race.
---
I mis-remembered, but I was close!
---
[70% of ***players*** don't make it past level 10](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/blizzard-70-percent-of-new-wow-players-dont-get-past-level-10_1)
---
Raiding enjoyment.
---
good luck leveling a priest not worrying at all about your talents 
---
Tank-Healer. You can cruise through all quests and group really quick in dungeons. Warrior-Paladin/Priest probably.
---
The ability works the issue with having more then 100 ping isn't that the ability doesn't work in theory. It's that in practice because of the way information works. The person you charge will not be where you land. If your charge target is moving. I used to play a warrior on warsong and the amount of times hamstring would fail because my charge target was not where he was supposed to be is all of them.
---
Why do you even care lol. Such a weird hill to die on.
---
Engineering is expensive and most players are already hard pressed for spell money and affording a mount at level 40. Since you are going to be a Mage you will not really benefit from Engineering until you get to bronze/iron stage, and so Engineering will just be a gold sink until then.
---
I recommend starting with Mining and Skinning, and then later dropping Skinning to pick up Engineering. Vendoring leather will actually make you a decent amount of money that you can then turn around and spend on Engineering or anything else. You will still be collecting metal and gems for Engineering, so whenever you decide it is time to make the switch you will have a cache of material to skyrocket your Engineering skill.
---
Take a look at the stuff you get from Engineering and determine the first items that you actually want, then make a plan about when to switch off Skinning for Engineering.
---
What do you enjoy when raiding?

Personally, I think they should remake Ocarina of Time, but add Pokemon and Fortnite dances.  And there should be vehicles and a "Wanted" system like from GTA.
---
I’ve almost exclusively raided as a Mage, with the exception being the entirety of Cata when I played an Ele Shaman for reasons I still don’t understand.
---
I enjoy range DPS and I enjoy min-maxing and competing on meters to push myself forward.
---
That said, for Classic I’ll once again be putting the Mage aside. Leaning toward trying a Warlock for this run, but a warr or priest is possible if I see a need develop in my guild group.
---
"Hahaha, I'm a genius. Take that, game devel- WHAT THE FUCK"
---
I like to imagine the race/class combo ramming me from behind.  I’m thinking Troll Shaman...
---
Rock Hard with Earth abilities
---
Fire to heat things up
---
Water for a slick entry
---
Air for when I’m out of breath
---
Totems for extra fun
---
Don’t get me started on that slender bod.
---
Berzerkering to finish things up.
---
I think the Emperor's New Cape from Emepror Dagran Thaurissan is the only cape I think looks good on Orc female rogue.
---
I agree with Priest/Lock/Mage, the idea of mixing a cape with a robe seems strange.  But Warriors/Paladins/DKs?  Warriors with capes [can look badass!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/56/f9/1e56f9b00df1a69cc0386218b61f08df.jpg)
---
uhhh no, best tank weapons aren't even axe, troll zerking is pretty shit, 5% hp is irreplaceable
---
Have you ever fought against a rogue? I’d regularly be at four stacks. 
---
Ahh cool. I really like mages too. I got one into the late 30's in vanilla but my original main was a shaman. I also love dpsing in raids. 
---
I don't know if you know anything about EQ but I played a wizard multiple times and raided a lot, they were the same role a mage takes up in WoW. It was a lot of fun topping those dps meters. 
---
I remember trying to play a dwarf priest at launch and it being a mess. Lots of connection issues. At the time, I was in college and had other things to do, so I was only playing the game intermittently. I ended up coming back a few months later and leveling a NE priest to around 46 or so if I recall correctly. And I finally settled into the game big-time by the summer of 2006 and leveled a human Paladin to 60....only to learn that raiding as Ret both sucked and was pointless, so I speed leveled a Mage to 60 really freaking fast, haha.
---
if this is, uh, 'uncouth' pserver related -- go to /r/wowservers
---
For classic - we're not 100% sure what the UI will be based on. The current "best guess" is it'll be something like 7.3.5 and WeakAuras will be ported over from retail.
---
Haha!  I'm considering a Tauren shaman. If you can imagine...
---
Sadly never had a chance to play EQ, but I tend to always lean Mage/wizard in fantasy games by default.
---
Same. I did this at 13 and ended up questing in Loch cause I was done with the corpse running after that 
---
A good UI mod that will allow you to move any feature of the UI wherever you want it will help immensely with this.
---
Pfui is pretty cool, allowing you to have you and your target, buffs, debuffs, focus target and buttons all in a tight grouping allowing you to focus on the middle of the screen for the action, and just below for all of the important info.
---
Should be plenty of videos on youtube about setting it up, but this one from Perfect Stealth showcases what you can do pretty well.
---
There are probably mods to regulate timers on just about everything, but I don't use any of those so can't advise there.
---
Considering that the OP was more about a pally reckbombing someone that looked at him funny, I’d say you’re a bit off-topic (but not wrong). 
---
Walking at someone with full stacks that were pre-stacked is entirely different from getting some/full stacks midfight. Especially since reckbombing was usually the former rather than the latter. 
---
Ice Block means nothing if you're a poor player in a bad position.
---
Those two mages he faced just respawned. Neither of them used an armor spell either, so they were practically dead from the start. The first Mage used Blink after getting distracted (???), got fucked by Cheap Shot and then had to waste Ice Block on removing it. She got a Polymorph off, but rather than healing up with her buddy, opened up right away with a Frostbolt of all things. The other Mage broke Blind with an Ice Block despite the Rogue being Polymorphed, and then ran off to heal. Mage number 1 notices the Rogue Vanished, and decides that the best course of action is to *just Blink away again*.
---
If you're a Mage who uses Blink to gain distance, you might as well lie down and hold up a handwritten sign with your honor value and a bright pink heart. A 1vMany like that is still impressive, but it's always enabled by people who are practically throwing themselves on a fire.
---
I don't have a giant problem with Blizzard's logic really, if it really is financially healthy for the company then that's good news for me, but I'll only be happy about it if they axe first day sharding for the fresh servers that come out down the line. A sharded day one has no appeal to me.
---
I would mention that those number are from when they had trial accounts and no way of counting how many trial accounts were made by a single person, so it sounds more bleak than it is.
---
Why do everyone make it so complicated for? You should already have an idea of what you want to play, so pick the class that looks the most interesting to you and roll with it. You're not going to min-max either way since you can't even pick your own class so why does it matter so much? That's what I want to know considering there have been like a million posts about this subject since the classic WoW subreddit was created lol.
---
Or I could just level with something useful like a priest.
---
Clever man!
---
Too big for me. I’m not into a lot of pain you know?
---
Many people play to feed a competitive drive. They want to min-max gearing and execute each pull flawlessly to top meters. That’s what drives them to push on through content. If you don’t have that mindset, healing is probably the best bet for Classic. 
---
EQ was a lot of good times, but it's hard for me to see new players being attracted to the game. They have progression servers that start out with vanilla and work through the expansions. They usually release one every year or so. 
---
It's pretty rough compared to WoW though. It's basically like you're stuck in WoW combat regen with no food or water to regen with. 
---
Soloing a wizard in old eq is literally killing one mob, then having to sit for 2 - 5 minutes to regen mana to kill another. While having to kill a similar amount if not more mobs per level as WoW. It's pretty brutal, but forces you to play with others. God help you if you don't have any friends on a low pop or top heavy server. 
---
&gt; Paladins can no longer hearth stone while made invulnerable by Diving Shield
---
I wasn't asking for help.  I was trying to start a conversation about our thoughts and feelings about the up coming game most of us are waiting for.  You know, community and such.  
---
Before 60 it's pretty safe to assume every caster wants wisdom and every physical dps wants might. For druids/shamans it depends a bit on what they're fighting and what group they're in if they want might or wisdom, just ask if you're not sure. Kings is going to be worse than either of them in nearly every situation.  
---
For PvP and at 60 once people stacking good gear stats Kings becomes a lot more valuable, but in general is still going to be worse than wisdom/might so it's just something to chuck on people if they already have those covered.
---
Do you have Asperger's, by chance?
---
I mean I’m not even mad, you’re right, Paladin is shit to level. That’s why I’m not playing one. The endgame is mind numbingly boring, too. 
---
Yeah I actually posted this in the wrong one, mah bad
---
is this how people in the news die from gaming? i see these headlines now and then. this must be it.
---
About a year ago i did a private server for fun and was amazed at how much I remember from the zones. Where to get quests and where to go for them, especially the lower level zones. However once I hit about 35-40ish it started to slow down, zones because less quest dense and i had to split up, double back etc all over the place to find stuff. It was great however exploring again
---
I suspect there will be a lot of standard 31/8/12, 21/8/22, and a few 17/34/0 rogues early on. It will mostly depend on what weapons you have and what weapons are available to you. Obtaining weapons isnt anything like the modern game. Weapons are a lot more limited and competition is high. You could be using the same weapons for 2-4 months before seeing an upgrade at max level.
---
Combat swords will be extremely strong with dal'rends for early raiding. Anything daggers will be viable with Lobo and/or multiple dungeon blues being available early. If you're lucky and get Viskag from Ony, then combat swords or hemo becomes even more viable until you get Perds/CHT. 
---
**Dagger Progression:**
---
Dungeon Blue Daggers (Barman Shanker, Bonescraper, Frighttalon, etc) = WSG PvP Dagger, Lobo = Fang of the Faceless = AQ20 veiled secrets dagger = GGR, CHT, Perds, DFB
---
**Sword Progression:**
---
Dal'Rends, Warblades of the Hakkari, Viskag/Brutality Blade, Maladath/CTS
---
**Bonus Fist/Sword spec for BWL:**
---
Eskhanders and ZG fists aren't really desirable for rogues, but if you get them and they're upgrades, then combat fist is also good. Neither Eskhanders nor ZG fist are good for hemo because of their fast attack speed and low weapon damage. Later on, though, Claw of the Black Drake + OH sword can be strong if double sword drops are limited.
---
As you can see, once you get the dungeon blue stuff, obtaining weapon upgrades becomes much more difficult, as there are very few drops and will be in high demand. You can also see that pretty much pre-raiding through pretty much most of BWL will be dominated by some form of daggers, and after mid BWL swords will start to pull ahead due to the limited dagger drops past MC. 
---
Hemo will be strong for PvP regardless of weapon because 
---
Blizzard is releasing a older version of the game,  patch 1.12 to be exact. This is expected mid July.
---
They're hard to kill but the problem is most classes can literally just run away from them if they don't want to fight. Priest/lock can fear and run, mage can poly, hunter can ice trap, druid/shaman can travel form, rogue can just gouge run -&gt; stealth. So no, you can't really kill people 1v1 unless they're afk of stay and fight till they lose for some reason.
---
Have you ever tried to get through doorways as a Tauren?
---
No. You do get crit but it doesn't proc the talent in 1.12.
---
Yeah dude...that's a paladin.

One thing that helps keep hunters relevant is the fact that most guilds won't bring many. If there are only 2-3 hunters competing for gear in a guild that has 6 mages competing for gear, they're going to get geared faster and should be able to at least be competitive if they know how to play the class. 
---
I'll echo what other users have said. You should look at classes to have a basic idea of how they function during leveling and endgame (I can give you a rough list if you want). I definitely think you should go into WoW as blind as possible otherwise, do absolutely none of the optimized routes/min-maxing stuff and just be a happy noob.
---
Expect at least 200-300 hours of in-game time to get to the level cap if this is your first time levelling but you shouldn't worry about your leveling speed/time too much either. Take your time doing random quests, running dungeons and/or pvping when you feel like it. Classic WoW is a journey and should definitely be played as such. Welcome aboard and enjoy the ride!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like I remember that certain rare beasts had better stats. I remember camping a spot forever to get a rare cat that had an extra high attack speed.
---
Not the best reason to be a warrior considering how many will actually get some of that gear.
---
You have to be completely delusional to think that TBC was balanced. You beat Sunwell kicking all the mages and stacking locks. BM Hunters with a one button macro were tied for top dps. Stunherald might be the most broken item ever put into the game and rdruid warrior is probably the most broken 2's has ever been. My favorite is that Taurens could mace stun you behind a pillar due to tauren's melee hit box...
---
TBC was bad in everything but PVE. The problem  is they can never deliver pre nerf heroics (they tried to make heroics hard again in Cata and most of the population left) with progressive itemization and talents and netfs/buffs to classes. If you never cleared Sunwell you never will. You aren't getting that notch on your belt and no one cares if you are a BAD Elemental Shaman or Druid that thinks his class has no heals. GOOD Ele Shamans and druids had no problem offhealing in pvp while also destroying people in Vanilla. Same with Good rets and Enhance with utility totems and spells. 
---
If you think everyone is going to play a very BAD expansion and TBC was horrible in everything but raiding, just so you get to do some silly one-2 button DPS rotation on a heal hybrid that you are bad at? Think again. TBC Classic would be a massive failure and a logistical nightmare that wouldn't even work. How are you going to launch it in one zone again on virtualization servers in Hellfire Peninsula? How are you going to make the world matter when it was so small to begin with. You HAVE to limit TBC to 3000 players to even make farming gold viable for respecs and primals and rep. So take that 3000 and then people will eave when they find out arena sucks and these raids are all nerfed and boring. What else is left? Nothing.
---
I actually hope Blizzard does do TBC Classic just so they realize who ruined the game (Brack), who they never should have listened to and changed their game to be all that mattered (try hard raiders/elitist jerks like Ion). It's going to be a massive failure just like current WoW which is WoW TBC. It's the same thing. It has nothing but 3 v 3 arena and try hard raiding. It's probably superior because at least you can  use raiding gear in pvp. Raiding gear in TBC on most classes is useless outside raiding, giving it no value and making it a big waste of time outside the elitist jerk guilds who raid and sit outside a mailbox all day as if the other 90 percent of the players care.
---
I don't think vanilla Paladin is for everyone. I am low energy but vigilant which I feel fits the playstyle of the vanilla Paladin. Much of the class are passives like plate, auras, shield, parry, illumination, low threat heals etc. For me it's a sense of security and less stressful not having to worry about reapplying Inner Fire for the gazillionth time. Having abilities to do the above things is more engaging, but that kind of engagement is not what I'm after.
---
Bottom line is that I think personality and class are closely tied when it comes to sticking long term.
---
Die inside RFD you come from Ratchet, not the GY just down the lifts, fucking Ratchet.  That is 2/3rds the length of the Barrens you're walking back.
---
1. Playstyle.....dps gets boring after awhile so gotta be able to heal or tank.
---
2. Gear/Tier set appearance...if my character looks stupid I lose interest.
---
3. What are my friends playing.....I would never make the same character as a friend, then it’s no fun for either of us.
---
&gt;Reminder if you are going to be an enchanter
---
*don't*
---
My dude I'll be exclusively RPpvping an orc warrior with my friend who will also be RPpvping on an orc warrior :D vanilla WoW was the place for immersive World PVP and i doubt itll be hard to find like minds on this
---
They are the second best melee in PVE and the worst melee in group pvp and up there for 1 v 1 melee PVP classes. Ret Paladins are just a strong 1 v 1 and can be played by a Chow Chow. Enhance Shamans require a Poodle (smarter Dog) but I would rate them lower 1 v 1 but better in group pvp.  
---
Most people cry about rogues because everyone rolled a rogue and usually failed on them in vanilla. Their fragile egos don't allow them to admit they suck at the game when they lost to the class they rerolled from. They are usually Ret Paladins btw, which might be the strongest counter in the entire game since Rogues have no stun break on their pvp trinket and ret can literally one shot them. Rets are so badly played that players will usually reck bomb into a defensive and not into a stun and manage to drop a 1 v 1 that shouldn't be possible to lose.
---
Rogues are the most overrated class in 1.12. Locks are the most underrated in Classic (they sucked in 1.1), especially with 16 debuffs off the bad making them as good as mages throughout the entire expansion in raids. 
---
In before downvotes by ret paladins who know this is all true, even though all the best rogues outside a couple hipsters now play warriors in 1.12 WoW. The rets tried warrior to. They failed even worse at that.
---
It also looks like you're casting a holy spell. So you can bait out kicks as a priest or pally
---
It annoys me how most people don't remember things like windshear or deathknights being a part of classic. #rememberdraeneiwaifus
---
Just because they were standard doesn't mean it doesn't trivialize a certain layer of skill.  It's the same as hunters that use a macro to feign death and lay a trap.  Just about every hunter uses it, because it's hard to do it manually.
---
&gt;shamans it depends 
---
https://i.imgur.com/wBjEsAZ_d.jpg
---
Ele Shamans gear is all in raids. They have no casual blue pvp set. You simply don't play the class if you don't raid. 
---
&gt; human weapon skill racials
---
Except you use axes *sad trombone*
---
You could follow your heart and get the WW Sword or Mace, and then everyone's going to laugh at you until you finish the main SM quest and you get that slightly better but still equivalent axe.
---
Really? A dev said specifically that this will not work? Do you have a link to the blue post?
---
Perfect
---
&gt; If I had to pick one I’d say undead because cannibalize reduces downtime
---
And you're doing it wrong if you have enough downtime to cannibalize.  Either your stacking strength over spirit (it's not a meme) or one of these idiot warriors I love watching who facetank a mob with a 1-second swing timer instead of hamstring kiting.
---
Electronic Arts wishes to know your location.
---
Reckbombing was both. It’s just expending all the reck charges at once. I’m not exactly sure why you think it’s more the former than the latter based on the comic. 
---
Yes.all rogue guilds are a thing
---
I'm a tryhard that likes underpowered specs so I'm playing ret this time around. I figure even if I dont raid I'll find a way to farm my gear I want. Building both a tryhard set and a farming set!
---
lmao....
---
Perhaps it is cocaine?

[https://youtu.be/1cMvdOr9QEg?t=60](https://youtu.be/1cMvdOr9QEg?t=60)  
---
Welcome back.
---
I have leveled so many characters from 1-60+ I think I basically know where to go every Quest I pick up. On Horde side that is.
---
Alliance I might need to use Thottbot on 1 in every 20 Quests.
---
Damn, I spent my whole WoW-career just leveling characters from Vanilla-Cataclysm more or less. No regrets!
---
To assuage your concerns, Vanilla is about community. Trash people's names will be known, their guild names will be known, and eventually only people who want to play with trash people will group with them and their kind. We knew which guild tags to avoid in groups.
---
Groups are harder to find than in retail, so people tended to be a bit more forgiving (unlike retail where trash people rage for the smallest thing because they can get a new group in the LFG tool).
---
Second most popular class. 
---
They will be everywhere... but you'll never see them.
---
I learned about the vanity pets the hard way. 
---
I was getting spawn camped by a group of ally’s in stv. After a few miserable runs back to my body, I finally manage to res and stealth w/o being noticed. As I was sneaking away, as a sneaky boi does, I notice them slowly come towards my direction. I thought surely this is just a coincidence. I slowly start to realize they’re beelining towards me, and I look down at my Crimson Cobra standing out on the green grasses of stv. Before I could dismiss him I was surrounded and spotted while still in stealth, and was then promptly hacked and dotted to death. *double-hand facepalm*
---
&gt; The passive always-on regen from Troll probably doesn't have any competition in terms of downtime honestly.
---
Everyone in this tread talking about downtime on warriors either hasn't leveled a warrior or has leveled a warrior like an asshole.
---
1. You're hamstring kiting the entire time which means you take next to no damage unless you fuck up and path into another mob...or dealing with casters which is why you use *blank* protection potions.  What is hamstring kiting?  Apply hamstring and move in and out of range of the mob's hitbox based on your swing timer so they're not getting 2-3 free hits off on you.  This is also the same method enhancement shamans should be utilizing.
---
2. You're stacking spirit (of whale) until you get your ww axe which is when you begin to switch to agi (of monkey).  I know this has become kind of a meme (kek spirit on a warrior) but at like level 20 with 80 spirit it looks like you're being bandaged while moving to the next mob, zero downtime.  Your damage comes from crits (agi) or weapon damage based attacks, strength and attack power scale very poorly while leveling.
---
Play style and desirability are most important. If you’re not enjoying your class and nobody wants you in their raids, then your Classic experience will be far from fun. 
---
No you actually wear spirit (of the whale) gear.
---
It's orc for hardiness.  Which you don't have up there.
---
I feel like it’s completely legit if you wanna delve into the game as a complete “noob” (maybe you started post-Vanilla). 
---
But, like, there’s no reason to? I get that a lot of players don’t care enough and would just rather enjoy the game fresh. But holy shit do I look into every single detail going into a game to make sure I’m doing things “the right away.”
---
If you’ve managed to escape that mentality by now, props. 
---
It's not worth spending 10+ hours (can easily be more) and have to re-loyalty a pet if you are trying to level quickly, especially for a pet that is barely better if at all better for leveling. It's marginally higher damage and spell push back, where honestly tankiness is going to serve you better with reduced downtime.
---
If you're taking your time and want to get BT for BGs when they open, go ahead it's definitely the best pvp pet at that level. But for pve it's entirely unnecessary.
---
At Vanilla Launch I made a Rogue because I wanted to sneak around and gank in world PvP. I did lots of world PvP, lots of BG and lots of MC. I would have done a lot more 5-mans if it was not so hard to get in random groups as a Rogue.
---
I had quit playing WoW after a few months but returned with plans to start on a fresh server that was just opening. I made a Hunter because I wanted to follow Joana's Guide and be one of the first 60's. It was fun and a very different experience than the first time around. I enjoyed Hunter more than Rogue when it came to pretty much everything except World PvP. TBC came out and I continued playing Hunter. It was easier to get groups than as a Rogue but still difficult.
---
Then I quit WoW again for a long time and came back for Legion as a Mage. I *loved* mage so much. It was a blast leveling, it was nice having utility for groups (sheep, water, portals, etc), I had little trouble getting in groups (compared to Rogue and Hunter anyway). I did all of the raiding up to Gul'dan. I loved it right up until they nerfed the fire spec and I had to switch to frost to remain viable. I don't care for frost, and I hear that is what Mages need to do in Vanilla (all that fire resist in raids), so I decided against Mage for Classic.
---
Now I am old and do not have as much time to play as I did back in Vanilla, so my priorities in picking a class have changed as well. I am going to roll on a PvE server because I would like to be able to go to the bathroom without coming back dead, and I'm not interested in doing any ganking myself. After enjoying Hunter and Mage I have discovered that I do not care for melee in WoW very much, so my only other real choice of ranged dps is Warlock. Warlock seems like a perfect fit for me right now. It comes with a pet that can tank, so solo leveling is easier and does not require as much attention. It has high survivability with health stone, soul stone, and a bunch of stamina. There is still some group utility (pet offtank or pet cc, health stones, summoning). The only thing it is missing for me is high burst damage, which I do miss but you can't have everything.
---
My withful thinking is they realize how stupid only 4 stages are.
---
The &lt;Kirin Tor&gt; wouldn't let me in even though I made the case that I am essentially a shadow mage.
---
I am thinking of playing a troll elemental shaman in Classic. From what I saw you definitely need a lot of mana pots and there is an elixir that increases your mana pool, but the elixir is expensive.
---
I plan on focusing on spell crit and nature damage and seeing what happens. I am curious though. Is there a raid where bosses are immune to nature damage, and if so what do elemental shamans do? Switch to heals?
---
can you proof your statement with a valid chart or something?
---
Everybody’s journey is different. Don’t compare yourself to others too much. 
---
I played vanilla a few months after release (about when warsong gulch was shipped)   
---
for the first few months of playing addons weren't even a thing, no one knew what the hell we were doing and the only semi reliable resource was the comment section on thottbot.   
---
I can still remember how painful some of the grinds/learning experiences I had were.  
---
I wasn't a god at vanilla - though granted I could grind pre-raid BiS with my eyes closed and recite every gear piece and its drop percentage aswell as every possible consumable i'd need and what healing spells to down rank to just based on the 10 or 11 servers i've rerolled on, over and over and over.  
---
but the point is, when I first played vanilla, I was so lost, the only thing that got me to 60, was the great in  - game social aspect of my friends and guildmates, many of whom I still speak to today (though we're all in our late 20s / mid 30s now)  
---
I don't want classic wow to just be a pair of nostalgic glasses for us older gamers,  
---
I want the next generation of teenagers to love and enjoy the game as much as I did,   
---
I want the community to return to that social/help a brother out aspect that it no longer resembles today,  
---
no achievements, no item scaling, no garrisons or solo play unless you deliberately want to go off farming by yourself.
---
I think we forget sometimes that Vanilla was about the journey.  
---
not min/maxing/reaching level cap asap/ only play X spec etc.  
---
TL:DR   
---
I love the game so much I just refuse to be an entitled ass about my im-game knowledge.  
---
I'd much rather spend my time on wow being a better dude than I am in the real world , making new friendships and contributing the community, MY community, than be an entitled jackass that ridicules every shadowpriest or enhacement shaman for wanting to have fun.
---
I got like 20 days of free play time in Vanilla.
---
If you make it to the 40s there is an epic sword you can try to get. You get it by getting two different swords in ZF and combining them. It is really fun! I did ZF like 10 times to get mine. Maybe it is boring but it is just neat to get an epic two hander.
---
It is called 'Sul'thraze the Lasher'.
---
Current year world of Warcraft, everyone. Big yikes. 
---
Rock hard gachiBASS
---
Yeah i thought i was being smart ghost walkin as wisp in that alligator zone. Trying to rest in lake zone, khaz modan or some shit instead i returned to the harbor.
---
Tanks need Light my man. 
---
Yes, it was very common to see 2 rogues in a 5-man dungeon group despite no group actually *wanting* 2 rogues. There was just so many of them and they are all looking for a group all the time.
---
I played a rogue in Vanilla and 4/5 times responding to an LFM I would get responses of "no more room for mdps", "we already have a rogue", "our hunter does not want to compete on leather", "our druid healer does not want to compete on leather", "the druid tank does not want to compete on leather"
---
I don't see how they are more boring than other classes. E.g. shadow priest you just use the same spells over and over. Shield, Mind Blast, Shadow Word: Pain, Mind Flay, Mind Flay, wand. Over and over and over and over.
---
Mara was a nightmare for first timer. Elites group patrolling the entrance, confusing cave structure, 3 or more different dungeon entrance and the graveyard distance.
---
I have no kids or wife and none in my future. I've always prefered my own company and growing more into this as a get older. We are human and need some social validation. I find it fine to hit up a yoga class or whTever if I'm feeling lonely. This doesn't happen often but makes me feel like I  part of something for a brief period. Other then that latley I've been pretty satisfied with priv servers and really looking forward to classic.
---
Oh yea, I also own property and have a good job. I just dont like having friends. But i never miss a family event. I'm not sad about this, but just feels like who I am.
---
Gotta embrace this if I am happy and content with my life. Without wow I was just playing dota2 or doing other hobbies which cost to much money lol.
---
More like SW:P, wand-wand-wand, Mindblast because you’re gonna regen the cost anyway via Spirit Tap. Mindflay is pretty shit, especially early levels. 
---
&gt; I love RP.
---
RP in 2019 is wishful thinking, and a circlejerk on this sub. Do you love RP? No, you don't.  will you will on RP? Yes. Will you RP? No.  So your RP server will be nothing but people who pretend to like RP but never RP.
---
am i crazy or could you DE any level item with a level 1 enchanter alt?
---
12,000 people will be a drop in the ocean compared to what blizzard will bring to classics launch day. 
---
I’m thinking anywhere from 250-500k for launch day. There is a lot of hype around this
---
Weapon stats are pretty underwhelming in a lot of cases, especially on items where it's all about the big weapon damage numbers. The 1h sword off Kel'thuzad, so the highest item level tier in the game, has 40 attack power compared to the 28 of the RFD quest onehander you can get at like level 38. Not always the case but often
---
What kind of a time savings does the new guide provide over the old one? Does Joana have a significantly faster speed-run now?
---
Also it should be trivial to update the VanillaGuide addon with any changes, as the steps are just rows in a Lua Table.
---
    			[16] = { str = "15) Turn those 2 quests in and accept #ACCEPT\"Report to Sen'jin Village\"# " },
---
It's definitely the RP aspect. From what I've seen, people have this notion that it's all weird RP'ing going on &amp; no normal WoW stuff (hardcore guilds, trade chat fun, etc.). Which is obviously wrong and not everyone even roleplays.
---
We think RP-PvP realms are awesome because they're generally more mature, laid back, and historically more faction balanced. As a result our guild is going to roll EU RP-PvP (Alliance), and we already have 160+ members. Would like to see someone make a Horde guild, though, because there haven't been any so far.
---
In any case, if anyone is interested in maybe joining our guild then feel free to shoot me a PM.
---
They will be the most popular class at launch because people are under the impression 1.12 is 1.1 and people love to hate what they suck at and EVERYONE tried rogue in vanilla. The good rogues will all reroll warriors because they are better at everything except 1v1 before Tier 2. After that they are about the same there to with consumables, engineering and trinkets.
---
So yeah in Classic, especially in NA where people don't know about 1.12 as much (private) rogues will be stupidly overpopulated, never get gear and most will reroll to things like ret paladin after getting one shot by them in a stun they can't even trinket out of. Then they will complain they can't get a raid spot as ret.
---
I love the 1.12 rogue class btw. It's just not worth it though. Too many people rolling them and warriors are better and easier to gear (you tank as dps spec) and do better dps and are more flexible in a raid. Only hipsters still play rogue after Nost.
---
*tips* you must feel euphoric 
---
damn i forgot light even existed.... classic can't come soon enough.
---
On every private server the most popular classes are Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Hunter. They compose 80% of the server population and it will be the same in Classic. 
---
And then you fall through the map on Kalimdor to be forced into rez sickness in westfall. 
---
This guy was in my early raid guild in vanilla wow Bears Of Oboo. The original video 'Thats the World of Warcraft That You Play' features a lot of my characters. If you haven't seen them I would recommend the Azeroth Supervillains series he did. 
---
You only need to fear pserver players if you are on a PvP server. They will mop the floor for the first few weeks.
---
On PvE servers you probably won't notice them unless they are trying to monopolize resource nodes for crafting barons.
---
50% of your server will be composed of rogues who rolled their class to be cheap.
---
Man thats gonna take a while.
---
Thats called theorycrafting.
---
You think that emu is using entirelly wrong formulas?
---
Interesting i'll check it out.  That pally mace kept me going for sure.
---
I always spend a week or two in each BG bracket while leveling so I don't mind spending a few days farming good gear drops.
---
Wow you just things and then they become true? That must be awesome!
---
What? Lol no
---
Idk if it's a private server thing but you can use vanish to break cc with faerie on you, you just won't go into stealth.
---
You won't ever have a problem getting a group as long as you're fine healing. You won't be able to heal raids with that spec obviously, but 5 mans won't be a problem. 
---
Not worrying about your talents means not looking up minmax talent builds for leveling, not ignoring them until lvl 60. People played the game just fine when it released, not optimally, but they managed. The joy of discovery and planning your own path is worth the extra time spent when leveling by not going the "wand everything to death for maximum Mana efficiency" strategy, in my opinion.
---
I kind of want to roll a (human) warrior because it was the first class that I ever played. I never got him to 60 in vanilla, so I want to finish what I started, so to speak. I think I'd have more 'fun' on a Paladin or Mage, since leveling a warrior is miserable, but I can only imagine how rewarding it will feel once I actually hit 60 on a warrior. 
---
But grudges don´t mean "war going on".
---
Besides, as I said, RP is often separate from what happens in the game itself. When you have event in high level zone and you get attacked by a bear, you don´t RP getting attacked by the bear, because storywise, said bear wasn´t there (because, for example, in your story animals disappeared from that part of the forest and you need to find out why) and the same can be said about random Horde players passing by.
---
160 seems excessive. Multiple raid groups?
---
I have this thing almost memorized by now, yet leveling is still so incredibly fun. Also, I agree with others heavily. I always make it a point to grind at least 5 bars ever other level. This will always give you a level up on joana at almost every corner.
---
However, if I ever got too far ahead, I'd skip the 5 bars of grinding at some points.
---
Greedy players are abundant.
---
Seems like a very odd build. If you want to be dps/heals for dungeons a full shadow spec would be far better. With just shields/VE you can keep everyone in good shape for trash pulls and can then switch out to throw some heals for a boss if needed. Only problem is you will chomp through mana so i hope you got at least 3 stacks from a mage for every dungeon.  
---
Levelling disc is kinda bad because the dps talents in the other trees are far better, but like they say all you really need to level a priest is wand spec, spirit tap and a good wand. Divine spirit is a really nice buff with spirit tap so that's the only saving grace of levelling disc.
---
To heal raids, yes. 
---
How lol 
---
Don’t half ass it. 
---
Don’t try to avoid the respec and be a worse player for it.
---
Farm your gold to afford your respec and be the proper spec for the content you are currently engaging in.
---
I was top 3 r druid on nost and anathema. The conventional advise is wrong. You wont get close to catching other healers if you're using ht4 and nature's grace. Being a good druid healer all about timing blanket HoTs ans preempting high damage with swiftmends, regrowths, and NS max HT. 
---
Go look at the best druids on legacy players. On most fights the better druids will have a higher proportion of healing from RJ/RG than worse druids 
---
I'd expect 80%+ of active WoW players will download it just to have a laugh and muck around for a few hours without any real intent of playing it seriously so yes, the drop out rate will be very high.
---
In raids, there's 5 paladins, so everyone gets everything.
---
In 5 mans, everyone gets kings cause I'm lazy.
---
I was planning on picking up Spirit Tap and (if I can buy an early wand) the wand damage talent, but it’s basically I pick up every damage/mana/healing talent in the two trees.
---
This was the final spec I was planning once I hit max level. [spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxxhsAVZZVG0x0xo)
---
This isn't going to happen. It should, but it won't. Have you seen how toxic the Classic playerbase is? Just look at the private servers.
---
Everyone will be expected to know EVERYTHING or go fuck yourself.
---
Advice for new players: Play with your friends for a while and only them until you understand things better. The community *will* shit on you for small things. Sad truth.
---
Fury warrior is actually probably the best dps for most 5 mans in a good group as well. Cleave dps is very rare in vanilla, and the vast majority of 5 manning is fighting 2-4 mobs at once. When a warrior gets whirlwind as long as they have a decent weapon and know how to press buttons they will probably top dps in every group they do.
---
Oh I'm sorry I forgot warriors use WW axe from 1-60. Thanks for correcting me.
---
oh man that happened to me twice on nostalrius
---
got overwhelmed with mobs down by that lake and had to run all the way back from southshore
---
I’m not, but I’m very much a person who likes to run the less popular specs, like Tank Pally or Balance Druid.
---
Patch progression is exactly one of those things.
---
Regardless of what you do, what patch you release, whether  you do patch progression or not, youll be changing something for someone.
---
What?
---
Ah, well that’s something I will never understand.
---
I always ask myself “why would anyone choose to be weaker or a worse player?” When people talk of less optimal specs.
---
Get a second monitor so you can google the questions you have. There is actually a lot to learn about the game, even in terms of the basics, but that's a good thing. You can really throw yourself into it and you are rewarded, because it is as much a knowledge game as anything.
---
Prime advice would be to try and find a guild to join, even of random people, just so you have people to talk with.
---
But really, just play the game to learn. It starts off simple, and you just go from there. Read the quests, and really think about and plan out how you will accomplish them. Learn how to make decisions like when to use certain spells and when to run away so you don't die.
---
Your time now would be best spent reading about the different classes and trying to determine which you think you will try out at first. Picking a class is a big deal in classic because they are all so different. There are no "bad" classes though, so don't be worried about that, but know what roles each class plays. If you know you don't want to heal, then maybe priest isn't the class for you. Or if you do want to heal, maybe Hunter, Mage and Rogue aren't for you.
---
You should expect to have a good time though, best game of all time, easy. It's just super fun to do quests and level up. You get to go out in the world and explore, and really plan out your own thing.
---
It’s more of a “Well if everyone is Holy it’s boring” and I’m doing something different. If it’s really that much weaker I might rethink it I, but if it’s player perception I’d rather just try to find a guild that’d let me run as Disc.
---
Go for it! If you are a great player you will find yourself close to the Holy priests I am sure.
---
Plus that Power Infusion is no joke.
---
You can heal / Dps as shadow spec. I dont get why you want to make a bad spec when you can just go a proper leveling spec that u can also heal/dps with in dungeons aswell
---
i guess someone never tanked suppression room progression
---
Warriors are the most popular after that is rogues.
---
Can you think of an example of one?
---
I'm going to need more information to help you out.  You lost me at being comfortable having to heal raids but not wanting to be Holy, which is obviously the premier healing spec.
---
So you've got to level with me.  Are you trying to avoid respec costs?  Do you think a particular spell or mechanic in Holy is dumb and you don't want to use it?  Are you worried if you're Holy that your damage will suffer, or you won't be able to farm?  You want to drop huge Power Word: Shields on the tank to protect them because that sounds dope.  You've gotta tell me what you're thinking.
---
The really short answer is there are guilds that will take any spec, but you really need to curb your expectations and set the bar really low to progress in a guild that doesn't promote competitiveness.
---
ya.. lmao these people have no idea of pvp
---
It is not more beneficial to just go solo.  It is very valuable in a lot of cases to have extra DPS when you must spam Mend Pet to keep your pet alive.
---
[Current population breakdown on probably the most populous current server](https://imgur.com/B0djuGY)
---
I don't find that happens much in solo.
---
If you're really set on doing dmg/healing but don't want to go full shadow for some strange reason, I think a far better spec than yours would be a either divine spirit/spiritual guidance smite spec, or a power infusion/holy smite spec. Sinking 21 points into shadow for VE when you have such poor shadow damage is just a waste from a healing and damage perspective. Disc/Holy dmg and healing talents are just way better.
---
You don't get to choose which affixes drop.
---
I plan to level 3-4 warriors, but yes grinding dungeons.
---
Is this something that was later changed?
---
Nope.  Holding out for level 70 end-game.
---
You could.  It even gave skill ups at one time.
---
For PvP, yeah.  I don't find many stuns in the open world that don't break on damage.
---
You’ll respec to Holy quite quickly. 
---
Take your damn upvote and *dissappear*
---
This is the main thing. And take enough mats ...while everyone waits a looooong time.
---
Mostly the farming/leveling but also the shield thing. It’s more I understand I can’t be a semi dps outside of dungeons and will be fully healing, but I don’t really get why I can’t still do that in Disc. Is the healing differential so high that I shouldn’t try to run Disc outside PVP or am I just going to get a lot of weird looks (which I’m fine with)? Does shadow require Shadowform on the occasions I roll as it? I want to run shadow sometimes but I understand it’s rare in groups, so I figure I can run as Disc some times to at least come close.
---
Interesting data. By your numbers warrior/rogue/mage/hunter make up 62% of the class population. If we assume an even split of hunters on each faction there's actually more paladins than hunters, so you didn't even get the 4 most popular classes right...  
---
Got any more data? Always find them interesting.
---
No, there are skill and level hurdles.
---
Its a very common surname in China, sort of like Smith. It also has some other connotations that I'm not 100% sure I understand correctly, something to do with youth culture I think? 
---
I've played on several different pservers and never once had any experiences remotely close to what you describe ever.   I'm not saying it hasn't happened but I've certainly never even met anyone that had that experience.
---
I've only played on the blizzlike servers so maybe that makes a difference.   Overall the Classic pserver community is vastly friendlier and more welcoming to noobs than retail in my personal experience.
---
I agree with the Blizzard part.  The 58 to naxx coming in doesn't sound bad as long as the 58 is grouping up.   "I imagine many people wouldn’t find it fun to do hours and hours of leveling quests just for gear"   was that not most of WoW?    Could easily been long group quest line like the atunements.  People I feel would love that, as long as the quest story was interesting, and you still needed to visit Azeroth.  Leave outlands, and kara to almost be like a heroic zone.    They could easily add something like paragon or "outland" levels.   Increase certain passives or add slight affixes.  
---
false
---
I believe it’s actually the opposite. RPers will switch to classic for server sharding bullshit alone as well as deeper class identity and professions, reputations meaning a lot more
---
Yep in tbc they required your enchanting to be a certain level based on the item level.
---
I just snipped of the realm stats page for the server, there is probably more info out there but didn't wanna link directly to the realm site cause of sub rules. 
---
       
---
That page does include a graph of level distribution which is pretty neat, plus the same stats for their older server. 
---
Is *this* what LSD is like?
---
Yeah, some pserver experience:
---
Someone is playing nelf or human priest? Lemme hit them with a textwall of why are they should reroll a dwarf!
---
Solid list, you might add a note about loot contention between rogues and fury warriors, which combined make up for sth like 40% of a servers population. Gearing up a rogue is as bad as a warrior with the additional down side of not being able to tank
---
Sharding starting zones is hella lame. Taking the day off work only to be able to play for a few hours due to server instability is super mega hella lame.
---
It's not elegant, but it means I won't feel like I wasted one of my yearly vacation days.
---
This is just the hurricane trailers edited together with worse music over it. The original videos are much more hype.
---
I cant watch the video man :(
---
Hpal + Warrior
---
Druids tank 5mans better than any other class.
---
Granted. All raid loot has been moved to a permanently invulnerable banished mob in the Blasted Lands.
---
You should make a guild named Meme Spec and only meme specs are allowed. 
---
What profession pairs well with tailoring (besides enchanting)?
---
Do you have a link to that? I haven't seen it.
---
Granted but when you die as any race you come back as their undead form. Every additional death deteriotates you further until you inevitably crumble into dust.
---
depends on what content you're on. Being full prot can make rage generation, and subsequently threat generation, difficult. So if you're going for faster clears and have the gear/healers to make up for it, some guilds use a much less prot-focused MT.
---
Pretty much the best warrior racial there is
---
More like, it shows how much weight gear had in vanilla, and how bad people were in the good ol days
---
So from frostbolt spam andy to shadowbolt spam andy, noice
---
I had a look at your talent build and there's some interesting choices I can respect.  If you can do some DPS that's great but players are going to expect you to be a good supporter.  Taking things like Imp Inner Fire and not Imp Fortitude to be a team player is questionable.  Not grabbing the spirit buff is a mistake imo, I'd lose 2% mana for that out of Mental Strength.  The spirit will give you more than 2% mana over a fight, and it's team wide.  You can't shield tanks because they won't get rage when they're hit because of the absorbs, but you could save someone who messed up potentially.
---
You mentioned farming, it will be challenging without Holy Nova which is a staple for priests farming.  Taking 5/5 in Mental Agility, as you did, is usually for Holy Nova spammers.  You can Mind Blast and Flay things down slowly, that should work but don't expect to it quickly.
---
I know I'm all over the place with this reply.  I think dropping Shadow and going for Smite and Holy Fire/Nova is the better choice from a scaling perspective.  Shadow ends up being worse by comparison if you don't have +25% more damage from Shadow Form and Darkness.  You probably already know this and you just enjoy the flavor of a mixed Priest.  That being said you can make your build work but you have to curb your expectations.  Definitely find an open minded guild because you're going to get weird looks as you said.  Lol
---
I think your build is cool and I'd be totally down to group with you.
---
I think a part of the issue is that a huge chunk of hunter DPS (the pet) doesn't scale at all with gear. 
---
Kids or bored girlfriends are great for leveling fishing! 
---
Pepega take
---
Sorry, should have clarified. We have 160+ members on Discord currently. How many will join once the game launches, we're not sure. But maybe it will be around half that number or less.
---
And we do plan to have 2 raid groups running. Socials are welcome as well though.
---
YE YE YE YE YAY
---
Either cat or raptor. Furious Howl on a parked wolf takes a very long time to match the dps of even a brave cat that runs up and dies quickly. Many fights if you are good you can keep them alive longer and on some they won’t even die.
---
Lazy warriors will demand you get a wolf to sacrifice your numbers for theirs. Don’t listen. Get pallies to buff your pet with might and kings to increase your dps even more. Ask for that stam buff, MotW, etc.
---
Spec 20/31/0 and your cat will do 100+ dps before even taking into account it’s bite and claw dps. Remember, your pet benefits from trueshot aura too.
---
I feel like there’s always an A team and a B team with that sort of set up.
---
Warrior and any healer is good.
---
Druid and any melee DPS (and Hunter) is good.
---
Shaman and any melee DPS is good.
---
Priest and any DPS is good.
---
Basically any class works with any other class more or less. 
---
One will be very semi-hardcore and the 2nd will be more casual (just one day raiding), so the variety will hopefully help everyone get a chance at raiding at their preferred pace.
---
Also keep in mind tha furious howl has a short range compared to hunter range (15 yards, so more than a 20 yard difference) The melee are likely not getting buffed if the wolf is parked next to you and not up on the boss with them. Buffing only one person is rather useless. And then if the wolf is up on the boss... why is it not a cat to do real damage?
---
15.0 yards ≈ 13.7 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

Sounds like they might want to make a second guild when they get a taste and want to be more serious. 
---
My #1 factor is things that will be amusing when I'm sitting in Stormwind begging for a group for an hour.  It's really a hard tie between Druid for the yiffing potential or Warlock for the sexy succubus and the funny things the imps and voidwalkers say. 
---
Check out reckoning builds (especially if sitting crits work) or aoe/prot farming. Maybe those are more fun for you.
---
Other than that you can do stuff like strafe-jump-kiting a mob, either to get mobs out of packs or to get to the next mob without downtime.
---
I believe you can target him with buffs like fortitude so its a bit tankier
---
Q for those experienced PvPers in Classic, I know almost all of the people he fights are bad, but what other class could 1v4 like he did?
---
Stick dropper + biscuit dispenser.
---
I always get ganked harder in that area than anywhere else, even STV. It's the worst.
---
Did you try searching for WoW bots or gold sellers on Google?  I'm going to take a huge leal of faith here and say they exist.
---
best is not the same as highest tho
---
Typically I pick classes that are required for my degree. I have a few electives so typical I pick a music class since that’s what I enjoy the most :) 
---
Typically, the classes that benefit from a healer most don't have any self heal, so warrior, rogue benefit a lot. Also with those two, there's no dps mana to worry about, so you can just keep going as long as the healer doesn't run out of mana.
---
The problem with any kind of bots or paid service in classic: it takes so long to level just to 60, are you willing to lose all that and the rest of the progress as well to "roll the dice" that blizzard won't find out?
---
I don't think they'll be available at launch either, but it will probably be pretty quick.
---
It has nothing to do with having bad damage, it has to do with wasting your time being stubborn and refusing to tank potential groups. Yes, fury is great for speed clears and everything but if you want finding groups to go smoothly you should be offering to tank unless your group has one already. Also, fury has no CC or buffs, which makes them a less preferable option unless you outgear the content anyway.
---
$600 a month??  Pay rent or play WoW?!
---
I have no issue with people doing anything in the way you described, until it effects me. That will only happen in a dungeon. It also will only cause an issue when we fail at something. I have no problem carrying someone if it's possible, shit most of us were carried at some point. I'll even be down for multiple attempts if they're close, because if it's close it's possible. However if we're struggling big time, and it's obvious there's a weak link, it's only acceptable for that person to agree to be replaced. Only after they take issue with that, will I start to pick apart their shortfalls.
---
There was a video back in the day where a rogue made a video, and it starts off with him showing his gear. He's wearing the grey cloth twill gear, and the starting dagger. He then proceeds to murder the shit out of people. It was early on so it could have been a fundamental change that stopped the ability for that to happen, but it was still a great video.
---
I forgot about that guide since I was planning on going Alliance for Classic up until recently and forgot that it was going to be relevant now.
---
They were very popular and were in minimal demand for raids. So the competition was high, because the supply was high and the demand was low 
---
Something at PAX East maybe.
---
Witnessed

Mage just support cc class, you're a magic glass canon who can be one shotted by a warrior.

Only time when they was shine was duble trinket abuse, but blizz quickly fixed it.

God I'm hoping the July 16th meme pays off but it's little more than a conspiracy theory.
---
31/20 disc/holy is fine for raids.
---
That's a different era my friend, it used to be earthshock that did the spell interrupt. I think windshear was introduced in wrath or late bc.
---
No I got a twinge of classic hype even though I've been staving off the intense need through another method I shall not disclose.
---
"what to do in order to prepare?"
---
Nothing.
---
You know it's legit when your own voidwalker is an unknown minion
---
Notice the words, "early on". You can just keep your group up sometimes pressing 1 button without any troubles. Ofc if you have great +healing gear that works at least as well.
---
Tbh, it was usually too effective and you got the bomb most of the time. 
---
*Wooo* It's your **7th Cakeday** NostalgiaSchmaltz! ^(hug)
---
I'm stuck between choosing either warrior or rogue, the skillcap for rogue is higher and that's why I'm more inclined for rogue but one shotting ppl with warr is so satisfying too.
---
The most fun I've ever had in vanilla WoW was levelling to 60 with my friend as rogues. At level 40 we killed a level 60 mage who was ganking people in STV, still one of my fondest memories from the game. When we got into a raiding guild he went Swords and I went daggers so we weren't competing for weapons, and I would've had to compete with another rogue for armor anyways so why not have it be him.
---
Yes, many people are that reckless.
---
I was an undead tank so I had 2 fear avoidance mechanics in my back pocket. One for the stance dance predictable and WOTF for the "oh heck i messed up". I know what you mean though, most tanks don't have that luxury.
---
Inviting other Warriors is just shit in general. Those guys could be helping 4 other people run the dungeon if they wouldn't refuse to tank. Don't enable their laziness. 
---
Pfui is amazing. Really beautiful design and great customization. Tracks GPH stopwatch etc. Hands down my favorite UI 
---
Ashran was never fully 40v40 because horde races to their objective and alliance to theirs - I don't remember a single ashran when all 80 players fought each other in the same place. Plus WoD didn't have honor talents, so the abilities/effects I would say are the same. The game has so many more area of effect buffs, heals, do X when at X% health, do X when moving and X when standing still than it ever had in wow, those alone add a lot to the lag because they can't be calculated client side. 
---
It's so bad in BFA for several reasons, one of which is server scaling. It's cheaper to not handle the large events, it's that simple and the reason it's cheaper is because to handle the larger even has become significantly more complex. To rewrite lots of code and test and buy server capacity to handle events like 40 v 40 that happen so rarely is difficult to make a business case for. 
---
EvE online is a great example. Fleet battles in that game were pretty much the only group content for years, yet every single time it was a massive lag fest. 
---
GET STAKES AND GAS WE GOT ANOTHER ONE...;)

The speedrunners 'must do everything quick and perfectly' are really messing with my wife's enjoyment. I hope to avoid those players.

Where the fuck are you getting all this mail spirit gear.
---
A lot of people don't want to ruin the wonder and mystery of finding these things out ingame and in real time.
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/ogRQvdV) is a survey from this subreddit.
---
You are a bad healer than.  Simple
---
Very cool. Very legal
---
I will /spit on you too! &lt;3 And that's something that doesn't affect the gameplay what so ever, or the Classic feel, but it will make it better behind the scenes. Saying no to that is just being silly.
---
I interpreted the meme as your ghost spawning you on the other side of the zone instead of the spirit healer right next to you, i.e if you die at RFK or RFD as alliance it spawns you at ratchet even though theres a graveyard at the great lift
---
Was lightwell even in vanilla? 
---
I could take time to explain how it works to you. He's not banned, he's silenced from text. That's a precaution Blizzard take on accounts that have been banned or reported a lot in the past, during the time they investigate the issue.
---
So again, nice story.. Too bad it's not true =/
---
Dont forget that when it proc, it can also mean a free big regrowth. Less downtime.
---
May I ask what your rotation will look like? It seems to me like you have skipped most talents that increase damage which seems weird if you want to dps. 
---
If you like the disc tree and want to dps you ought to go all the way down.
---
If you want to be a real hybrid you can also make Specs that use all three trees with sonething like https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbxtZV0gpcz
---
Thats mostly useful if you like PvP though.
---
If you like pve healing and dps a smite build like https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxghszVaobxtMcb might be up your alley 
---
If you are horde your pet won't die in MC at all and in BWL u will be attacking with your pet only one 4 bosses (Razorgore the Untamed, Broodlord Lashlayer, Chromaggus and maybe Nefarian) because of OP shaman Chain Heal. On three other dragon fights (Firemaw Ebonroc Flamegor) your pet insta dies because of their very frequent 5k+ dmg AoE.
---
The heal is low and it is cancelled when attacked.
---
Yeah lol
---
Was joking lol
---
The cooldown is too long and it's canceled upon taking damage iirc.
---
thing like minor speed on boots, resistance on cloak still get asked alot
---
And lets not forget all the leveller that want the beastslayer enchant
---
Vanish*
---
balance and survival are viable pvp specs :o
---
Everyone is leeching off others in some way
---
Control in combat, utility in groups, daily quality of life. Needless to say, I'll be a Mage.
---
Oh, I didn't think hammer of wrath was at first.  Sometimes things really blur together.  :p
---
They’ve added, removed, then readded things so many times lol

---
Thanks!!
---
I have two weeks off between July 26th - 5th August. As such, I guarantee it'll be released 6th August.
---
I think I know what you mean. Focus on your own life, don't compare yourself to other people.
---
It's funny that people think these kind of rant will have an effect on player toxicity. 
---
There is literally a 0% chance this is true. You are playing with Europeans no matter what server and what hour you’re playing. 
---
Can dps, can farm, has pvp outplay potential, is wanted in groups, range.
---
Mage.
---
The portals are a nice bonus.
---
wind shear (originally called wind shock and shared cd w/ other shocks until it got renamed on 3.2.0) was a wotlk addition. Vanilla/tbc earth shock is an interrupt with damage and it has a threat boost.

/cast flair
---
/pst BoW pls.
---
Eh true I guess but you still dont need 5. Bring a few repair bots .
---
Hunters: BoW, Kings.  If your hunter asks for Salvation kick him from the group because he doesn't know how to play his class.
---
&gt; Your stat priority should be AGI &gt; INT &gt; SPIRIT &gt; STRENGTH &gt; STAM
---
This should be re-arranged if on a private server.
---
You won't last in pvp at all if you don't maintain some stamina and int
---
You are responsible for everything done on your account - even if it wasn't you doing it.  You'll still get banned, it has been Blizzards stance forever.
---
Yes, if Classic is even remotely like private servers, rogues will be the fourth or even fifth most popular class simply because warriors are objectively better as melee dps.
---
I used a quest helper sort of add only one time I leveled. It made questing boring.  Generally, the only addon I play with is a damage meter because I like to push my DPS to max for the e-preening.
---
Zerking is amazing. Especially with Thunderfury, but really any proc weapon. Theres plenty of good axes. Troll is better with thunderfury of course. 
---
mainly mechanics and playstyle then looks/animations
---
but nowadays i have to factor in time and investment because life changed and i dont know yet how to make playing wow work at all.
---
id love to play priest due to less possibilities regarding armor (just cloth to consider), i love healing, i leveled priest before and find it quite easy. but i dont think i can run dungeons to the extend i did in the past, raiding probably impossible for me. so what will be left? soloing some things, farm and pvp. i despise that i need to buff myself everytime i get rezzed and soloing and farming things aren't a priests speciality...
---
so i'm leaning towards hunter cause i realy loved the mechanic of the class, i like shooting, weaving in other actions between the autoshots, the deadzone, kiting and i wont have problems soling/farming things nor do i need to buff myself for half an hour after resurrecting, futhermore a have more chance to get away when someone corpse camps me.
---
my decision was priest but im leaning towards hunter instead - what it will be in the end i dont know. maybe, sitting infront of the char creation screen when classic releases i choose something completely different.
---
I love Tanaris, a proper battlefield :D 
---
Wtf are you on about? 
---
Well written
---
He's automatically banned from chat for being mass false reported for inappropriate chat?
---
No you are the one who is stupid, you are not supposed to have your keybinds in order lol, because that would mean you have to setup your abilities according to their keybinds instead of the importance of them and importance of placement for ease of tracking.   
---
If i have death coil that i want to bind to 0 but still want to track it properly im not gonna put death coil all the way in the end of the action bar, ill put it first and change the keybind, what an utterly moronic thing to complain about.
---
How does the fact that TBC sucks have anything to do with *Vanilla* servers dying? If anything that would mean the Vanilla servers should lose even *fewer* people than they would have otherwise.
---
To reiterate: **every time TBC has been released it killed the Vanilla servers it left behind, even with optional character copies.**
---
Depends if HoJ procs and maybe add other chance-on-hit stuff (maelstrom, heart of wyrmthalak and so on) for even more non-weapon damage hits.
---
If your friend is rolling a healer you will love playing a warrior.  Nothing like having unlimited health and rage while leveling.  I'd recommend a shadow priest/arms warrior combo.   You'll both do decent DPS, be pretty close to unbeatable in leveling PvP, and shadow priests make good healers.
---
Paladins are more about the class fantasy than actual active button mashing play. There was a running joke about paladin tanking for years, where all you did is drop Consecration and then go AFK.
---
99% sure its Broken Tooth
---
Who gives a shhit about naming a macro. he has one macro named 1111 are you gonna cry about it?
---
I disagree, RP'ers are annoying if they decide you are not RP enough for them
---
Noobs I understand. Noob is ok. We've all been there.
---
Entitlement and know it alls will kill me though. Coming to vanilla from retail or some other game and bringing bad juju
---
To be honest i dont get why im beeing judged for my hotkeys.. the meaning of this post is to show the cool moment when you entry a total mess battlefield as low lvl toon.
---
Hotkeys: I did not buy all the spells and i still miss a lot of spells. I like to reserve my hotkeys for those spells. Like example death coil and curses. I think every player should be comfortable with their hotleys. If somebody is clicking why not? 
---
This
---
Most bossfights have some kind of aoe damage element that cancels the heal effect. Its SUPER effective heal and would be great for example for melee IF it didnt break from damage. 
---
Problem with Rogues being able to stealth to objectives is that a lot of vanilla is grinding mobs, so that actually hurts your levelling experience. 
---
Unless they're removing it, there's a cap on amount of debuffs you can place on a boss so that hurts Warlocks a lot. As far as I know, Warlocks didn't get much raid action because of that and were mostly brought for utility/convenience
---
I'm torn between Warlock and Mage but I'm thinking Mage just for the portals. I don't get much play time and don't want to spend an entire session travelling between cities and other zones 
---
&gt; Warrior:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; WAAAAAAGHHHH
---
Im sold
---
the debuff limit was 8 before a certain patch, but blizzard said it will be based on 1.12 (1.13 people are calling it) and the debuff limit was 16 for that era of Vanilla. 16 is plenty and you'll be able to see quite a few warlocks in 1 raid.
---
remember to tell your warrior tanks to right click salv =P
---
And then HOPE some wpvp comes along as soon as you have the stacks ? Or do you HS and go find someone ? :P
---
Im sorry but why dont you take into account ALL THE OTHER pets? In vanilla pets are not divided into 3 groups like retail. You dont even mention cats wich are the highest DPS and highest ATK speed, you dont take auto-attacks into consideration AT ALL when thats MOST of the pets damage.  
---
Also you couldnt tame a wind serpent in vanilla so kinda of a weird example to use.
---
If we're talking old school pvp vids, its gotta be Akrios with the Eviscerate series. [Eviscerate 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3mBK6Wf_wQ) is my favorite
---
Why use a windserpent as an example when you couldnt tame one in vanilla lol. Second of all the highest DPS pet was the cat, you dont even mentions cats or worst, you dont even mention auto.attack dmg wich is most of pets dmg.
---
He's muted from chat for having a report spike after having a history of being banned / muted (by Blizzard, not automatic).
---
It's a precaution they use against previously reported and banned players. He also exploited the report system by creating a situation that won't happen by just playing the game.
---
I'm pretty sure you won't get 10 000 people to report you at the same time because you ganked someone in STV. And if you already have received some temp bans and have a steady flow of reports, you've earned it anyway.
---
That's how their system works and it's a great system.
---
Warrior and Resto Shaman is the best. Period.
---
16 isn't that many in a 40 man raid 
---
Mostly how annoying will people be overall. Used to be playstyle+utility for me but after so much time being *encouraged to heal* (as a mostly bear tbc-wotlk feral, along ele/enh shaman) for guild convenience in most cases having it done again once more (would be the fifth time if we count pservers, none being vanilla...) is a no-go. 
---
I don't bother being the most desired one, but having to sacrifice my playstyle for a raid spot is just awful and I've done it too many times. But this is actually the core reason I'm struggling so hard to find what to roll. Wanna keep my hybrid-utility tank playstyle but any actual hybrid gets to heal by default (and anything else is ditched by default, or maybe as a 1-per-guild basis) . And the actual tank has a severe lack of utility which I do miss (which is an issue for PvP for me, as an avid PvPer). 
---
&gt; As for balance druids rolling on cloth items
---
As someone playing on a pvt server for first time - the general consensus seems to be that if its BIS/an upgrade for your class then you need it, regardless of armor type.
---
Hence healing Paladins rolling on cloth and leather, etc
---
**&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore**
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.

" But with today's technology it shouldn't be too difficult to get so many people into the game at once. "  
---
You have no idea what the problem is, the problem is having overpopulated zones and the spawn rates not matching that, just imagine 500 players  in the starter zone, how long will it take you to get ANY quest done? When WoW launch it didnt have as many players playing it that Classic will.  
---
" What will thousands of players do when there's so few spawns? Will people form raids to attempt the untouched higher level content? Will they attack the opposite faction for the hell of it? "  
---
So little spawns is the exact reason why sharding is needed at the beginning. Lets say you are orc, if you go out of valley of trials at lvl 1 u will get 1 shotted, nothing a raid can do, just a waste of time. Attack the opposite faction from your starter zone, wut????  
---
" It makes me smile just thinking about hundreds of level 1-4 players getting together and having an insanely huge pvp battle! "  
---
That would never happen.
---
No it did not, it was a truly painful experience and was painfully obvious the game isnt designed for 12k.
---
&gt; and fact that theyre not even good at 60 until they get geared seems like a huge hurdle that might put a poor taste in my mouth
---
this is a myth. warriors are top DPS with quest weapons in mc and never leave 1st spot.
---
theyre also as of right now holding the 3rd fastest solo leveling time, leveling a warrior isnt slow its hard
---
Where would you place ZG and AQ20 in that tier list?
---
You can most certainly try to micro it back and forth, but it will be hard. Most of the time you’ll lose dps while wasting time rezzing your pet.
---
I remember trying on MC-raid but gave it up mid-raid, had to feed my pet a lot because it became angry due to dying over and over again.
---
Always need add ons to get rid of that shit at the bottom and allow a minimal ui
---
How do you view your debuff durations.
---
I meant "warrior" in the broader sense, as in someone armored who fights.  Point being armor + cloak is definitely an aesthetic that has a precedent.
---
Don't be a weenie. It's not hard to get away from spawn campers.
---
in fairness though, youre always going to need repair bots for suppression room progression
---
LOL
---
Resto shaman + fury warrior 
---
Anything else that you want to do independently. Tailoring doesn't need a gathering prof, so it's a nice endgame profession when many people delete their gathering talent. Ie. Tailoring and engineering. Tailoring and alchemy. 
---
You gain the ability with tailoring to have two complete end game crafting professions...
---
I agree, there's nothing wrong with a warrior that doesn't enjoy tanking and don't want to play it. Forcing people to do stuff they don't want will just end badly.
---
Meaning, because of the addition of buffs, or strictly 5-man tanking mechanics?
---
Go what Preach's priest guide, it has a great bit about Lightwell. It sums up how the lightwell is viewed by DPS'ers generally. As someone who specced into lightwell back in the day, I can confirm, it is a turd and not worth the loss of the spirit buff. Logically it just does not work. If there is a fight that does not have AoE damage then in theory it is great, but if there is no AoE why is a non-tank taking damage in the first place. If there is AoE damage then any charge could be lost after the first tick. The only possible using application is to allow warlocks to have a free heal after life tap. But screw that, a mid rank renew can do that and does not waste the 31pt talent.
---
I did not roll a rogue in vanilla. I feel like your opinion is pretty skewed from overpopulated pserver.
---
Never know what will happen when it goes live. And hipsters dont play wow. They spend all thier time trying on clothes in thrift stores.
---
There will be alot of rogues yes. I was interested in playing one at first but after playing one to 60 on an unofficial server and experiencing the struggle with gearing in dungeons, competing for gear against all other rogues, all fury warriors and hunters + the occasional dps druid/paladin, it just wasn't worth it so I've decided for another class on classic.
---
According to stats from unofficial servers, rogues are usually in the top 3 most played class, often the second most behind only warrior. Where the top three (warrior, rogue, mage) make up almost half of all characters on a given realm. That should give you an idea of how many it will be.
---
uhhh I don't think uve leveled a hunter before, BM hunter with BT is the best, if u don't have BT then even a 1.2 cat is better than a pig or owl.  cat is objectively the best pet hands down for leveling and even in pve late game
---
Isn't fury the fastest way to level if you only think about pve questing? I know it sucks pvp and for tanking dungeons, or are fury warrs supposed to level only with 2h?
---
But do you know where Mankrik's wife is ? (joke)
---
Damn you guys are set in your principles, personally I wouldn't mind if anyone didn't like tanking so they wanted to dps. Sure it takes a while longer to find another tank but I wouldn't say it's laziness, just preference.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion. Seeing sycophants like you in person really gives perspective for how strong bootlicking really is among some Blizz fanboys. It's absolutely incredible.
---
Divine spirit is 100x better
---
Shm gives windfury totem so good for any melee dps
---
Beastslayer was huge when I was a WoW newbie on a roleplay server. Everyone knew it was useless, but wanted the fancy red glow.
---
I’ve hardly ever seen anyone sacrifice their dps for a sec, to click the thing. 
---
Me and a friend did the same but then with 2 hunters, one was leatherworker and the other engineer, so our proffesions worked well together. You can do all the q's with just the 2 hunters (even the 5 man group q's) and the moment we went in STV was a blast. No1 likes 2 pets on him with range shots and kiting for day's. A true hell for the horde :D
---
Running dungeons with new players is half the fun. 
---
April 1st is coming up soon...
---
People will see the +68 on Robes of the Exalted and not think twice about what potential a mail or plate item will have.
---
I have limited play time and my schedule rotates days off so my choice came down to what class could I play that would almost guarantee my invite into pugs. Dwarf Holy Priest. 
---
With 1 billion -1 variations of the name Legolas.
---
Life is depressing and I need a temporary nostalgic escape. Any rumors on a more specific release date?
---
You can just do it after last boss is dead. No one needs to wait 
---
Tanking mechanics. Warriors are notoriously shit for tanking packs of mobs, feral druids actually excel at this. 5-man dungeons tend to have a lot of packs.
---
Enchanting is the absolute biggest noob trap in the game.
---
There is an extremely limited market for enchants. Any enchanter is lucky if they *ever* make back the gold they lose leveling it.
---
Keep in mind that even when you're "selling mats" the marginal benefit of those sales are *extremely low* considering you forgo the vendor price of the items you DE.
---
There is a very, very simple way to get **rich** in Vanilla WoW: Herbalism.
---
It’s ok for your warlocks on patchwerk. 
---
It's a bad thing for me because I think nobody should literally play with themselves in an MMORPG... Not to mention the unfair ingame advantage it gives, especially in PvP.
---
You might be in the minority but many people abuse the hell out of it...because they can.
---
&gt; this is what's great about vanilla, leveling actually makes you learn the game.
---
Speaking as someone who played right from release, this was absolutely not the case. It's not like vanilla had difficult levelling; people could and did hit 60 having a very poor idea of how their class worked. I lost count of the number of atrocious players I found at level cap back in the three years of vanilla I played. 
---
The only thing I wrote as an opinion is that I think their report-system  works (well, except for when you exploit it by having a large number of followers report you as a test or something).
---
The rest is just facts and how their report system works. Just because their report system is quite good and that I'd rather wait until release before I judge how Classic turns makes me a sycophants and blizz fanboi?
---
No, that's common sense.
---
Don't fuck with my balance.
---
So you can be snarky it's fine but from 30 on when you get your first point in axe spec you are using axes.  You know, the remaining 4/5ths of your leveling experience. 
---
The really competitive and good players, don't give a fuck what your specc is and what you play, because they are going to carry you through a Dungeon or Raid regardless. It's even fun for them to help other people out, because they are over-geared. They might even run MeMe-Speccs themselves just to see how far they can push that specc.
---
The people who are harassing you, because of your specc are mediocre players at best. They can't carry you without issues through a dungeon, I would never call them good players.
---
**Don't alienate a whole group, because you don't like what they are doing, period.**
---
Hottake: The people who actually are getting harassed are the people who want to be competitive in WoW classic, by this sub.
---
Look ”moron”, I am pointing out that saying that the guy who created the best tbc private server ever and donated years of his life to the community, has never done anything but lie, is straight up resiculous. I get that people are disappointed that he didn’t give MOAR. 
---
But if the community is so mentally damaged that it can’t give credit where it is due,  it had what happened f***ing comming.
---
Having said that, not keeping your promises is wrong, especially such big ones. Goes without saying, get over yourself ”moron”.
---
You get to choose to buy them off the ah cheaper than the vendor price of your own quest rewards.
---
I could be placed at safe spots on various boss fights such as Chromaggus or Firemaw. It's use it quite slim though.
---
Not true at all. 
---
How cool they look, what else is there but looking pimping while afking in stormwind or IF
---
I played on a P-Server the Druid + Shadow Priest combo. A guy I met there and I we leveled the whole way our twinks together. It was a delicious combo.
---
I also think Druid and Rogue could be really good.
---
Or maybe a Warrior with a Shamen, think about all those sweet Windfury proccs.
---
&gt; They might not be the fastest to level per se, but you might find that an easier class to level (mage for instance) 
---
Just a small correction, Druids are actually one of the fastest levelers in the game.  Due to their early increased movement speed talents and their complete lack of downtime, they can rival Warlocks for 2nd fastest levelers and there have even been cases on private servers where a Druid has been the first to 60, beating out Hunters.
---
I’m at work, what does the link say?
---
Pulling 2 at once just because you know you will ding. Thats leveling like a pro.
---
That’s great variety in food ( meat and fish) is best, I like to farm clam meat and then any beasts for Lea ether and meat and my cat eats anything. The problem with all these classes you mentioned is that they can’t be taught bite, claw and charge/prowl. Cats are superior for DPS, raptors too but they don’t eat fish the suckers 
---
When noob groups enter MC and I happen to be in it, I so hope we will wipe to all the stuff we used to wipe on 15 years ago... So satisfying to see those fire dudes get out of hand and all the newbies run around in panic. Sometimes wiping is fun :D
---
(ok, not after several weeks, then order should be restored hehe)
---
Im going to play without and even read the quests this time. Its less extra time than most think and it does enhance the questing experience.
---
who cares? you wont be topping dps meters either way so you're just fighting to be on top of the other hunters dps
---
focus more on being a good utility player and using all the tools in your arsenal while raiding rather than min maxing and going hardcore tunnel dpsing and still coming out lower than mages/warriors/locks and mages.
---
Hey guys i brought the torches and pitchforks. 
---
Worst talent in the game. I would love to hear someone that found a use for it.

I think you mean devolved

and it was glorious

Oh sorry, your right I don’t think I quite read what you put properly.

Sure yeh battle shout could be better for smaller packs.

Honestly, while I love the idea of RP-PvP, I'm unlikely to play on a PvP-enabled server. It absolutely is thrilling/nerve-wracking to do so, but you don't want to be in that mode at all times as a roleplayer. At least, judging by waning population (More so than regular RP servers), most roleplayers don't. Some do, of course. Anyway.
---
Over the years, in retail, RPers on RP-PvP servers (when they still existed) were effectively pushed into the few safe starter zones, as world PvP guilds would often swarm RP events. Or they got annoyed by what was seen as interruptions to sometimes quite emotional RP events.
---
(I understand that you're playing a big bad overcompensating orc warrior, Mr. "I'm here for the better community" guy and 27 friends, but you're actively driving away many of the people you profess to create this better community by doing what you do.)
---
The argument goes that if you roll on a PvP server, you signed up for it. And that's true. So I won't. Loads of the people that actually did over the years, and then came to RP servers, also won't. Because the idea of RP-PvP, from the perspective of someone who's a roleplayer first and everything else second, is attractive. But the reality of it isn't.

Are you computer literate? Smart enough to torrent game of thrones? If so, I would suggest you hop on a vanilla private server to learn the game a bit before classic launches. You are going to be a huge noob, no matter what so learning now is going to set you up for the future.
---
they changed the calculation of eviscerate damage. wouldnt be possible anymore :)
---
Sl lock, spriest, mage, druid
---
I don't mind clueless people.
---
I very much mind clueless people who don't bloody communicate.
---
The questions and problems you have, have nothing to do with what the game is really about. I would suggest you get off Reddit and actually play the game.
---
I remember rogues were quite strong in Vanillla but I F them up with my warrior even when they got the jump on me out of stealth.

I have like an super old News Archive for the German Release. So lets go through this beauty.
---
11.02.2005 Release Day:  The Servers are overflowing with players. It's laggy, every Server is at maximum capacity. The Account Creation Side had to be shut down for now. Blizzard plans to increase the player numbers on all the servers. If that doesn't work, Blizzard has to add more PvP Servers, they are also working on the account creation side.
---
12.02.2005 - The News is called: Chaos and Records on release day: Amazon is reporting record sales numbers of 30k Pre-Orders, Okaysoft sold 3,5 Tons of CDs, they are sold out, PCFun, managed to send all the CD-Keys out, but they had to disconnect their phone lines (too many requests)
---
Around 200 People are waiting in line in front of Stores to get copies of the game. In Berlin there were even Fist Fights.
---
In the Forum the thread called: Account Creation Side is down, was clicked 255.000 times.
---
So for everyone who thinks P-Server release is crazy and the actual release was smooth. LMAO
---
Bonus-Round:
---
22.02.2005; people asked about Server Transfer for their Characters. Blizzard's official response was Soon. So Characters transfer was demanded very early on.
---
15.03.2005: around 1k Accounts were perm. banned, because of Gold-Selling
---
Where did you get your feral dps numbers from? Feral does not scale so well into naxx, that's true, but if you are doing 1/2 of warrior/mage dps you either do something wrong or the fight is heavily aoe based.
---
Ret paladin mate following the same footsteps, although if i am asked to play heal i might try to.
---
What are you asking?
---
Well, you will notice them: They're the players 10 levels ahead of the rest ;-)
---
I'm thinking about classic release and first character experience. In both cases you won't use ah to your advantage very often.
---
Warrior because I like people literally begging me to join their group.
---
I played healer thinking this but you'd be surprised how common healers are.
---
I think sta is an intrinsic stat, since every item you go for should be sta + &lt;insert other stat&gt;, so you don't really need to prio it.
---
Unless you always go for of the boar/wolf items etc.
---
Ele shamans do VERY high damage in dungeons and can drink between fights.
---
Hey man, in exactly the same boat as you brother. From noob to noob; what are you planning to pick? (Faction, race, class).
---
I’ve seen a bit of the Barrens and absolutely love the safari-like wasteland - so Horde it is for me! I haven’t decided on race/class, though
---
DKs can get away with it since they’re a form of Knight, right? Knights generally have a regal/lordly influence somewhere along the line. And a fair few were once Paladins, especially all those that were raised/seduced during the sacking of Lordaeron.
---
surprised to see hunter with a low %
---
Hey! Do you guys think that frontshredding will be a thing ? I think probably not
---
Ele shamans have the highest burst in game. They will not make the run slower. Ele Shamans are VERY strong in dungeons. The biggest problem is that they will pull a lot of aggro with their huge crits.
---
SP and Warlocks probably have one of the highest dps if they could use dots on the bosses but 16 debuff slots fuck you there
---
i hear this so often. who cares what others play. you dont even know how many players will play rogue. just play whatever the f you want.
---
Ahh Hurricane. Shame he couldn't work for Blizz's team. Dude makes bad ass videos.
---
Dont listnen to that guy. Ele shamans have the highest burst in-game and will not make a run slower. You will drink between pulls and do REALLY high damage.
---
Do you play now? Or waiting for the vanilla?
---
I came from a table-top background (pre-internet days) - RP in MMORPGs is a totally different kettle 'O fish.  I love table top roleplaying games but find most MMO RP to be awkwardly detached and a little bit weird.   I have enjoyed playing RP-PvP servers in the past, but if someone walks up to me and tries to explain their backstory my character treats them like loonies.
---
Varying defintions, June/July/August is one
---
best Video ever made inc
---
&lt;3
---
5mins of 'awesome', followed by 4 hours of wondering why you bothered taking time off to not be able to play
---
If that were to work that'd be just awesome. It would TOTALLY add to the feeling of being successful as a group. Working together to improve DPS would just be a super fun thing to do. Not sure how much that would work out due to the debuff-slot-limit but it's a great idea nonetheless!
---
arms is the fastest way to level. fury works, but only with a 2H. dual wielding is only good with a shitload of hit gear and that doesnt exist in the leveling phase. dual wielding, you would just miss about every 2nd attack, its probably as efficient as prot leveling.
---
None of the friendly DK NPCs wear cloaks.  Tabards yes, cloaks no.
---
You'll find more mature players on RP (compared to normal).
---
&gt;In both cases you won't use ah to your advantage very often.
---
You might not.
---
If you look at the lists of guilds who have cleared everything on a private server there are usually around 15-20. Now split these between the 3 regions, and the fact there will probably be 30+ servers per region. These guys will be in the minority come Classic and chances are they stick to a couple of servers.
---
There are also guilds on private servers who aren't easily clearing everything, so don't expect everything to instantly die. 
---
i played shaman in tbc and then i think hearthshook just did dmg and reduced melee dmg or something
---
Hes just awesome.
---
This is a public forum for discussion.
---
A large part of classic is the social aspect, if you go around stealing loot you won't last long.
---
Back in vanilla we had people switch servers due to being blacklisted by major guilds.
---
Loot trading maybe, sharding for a few weeks? Nah. This game could last a decade, no-one by the time they hit 30 will give a shit let alone long term
---
Pain
---
Something today? I need my fix, man.
---
It was in 1.12 though, the patch the game is based on. With no changes either it's in at launch, or introduced later on.

---
wtf. stop taking those drugs man
---
Right, so if you are a warrior you can be a MT, an excellent DD, or you can be OT as well as DD, you just need a shield. So why exactly you should pick a druid or pala in the first place? Just to screw yourself on the long run? 
---
I've even created a whole guild for players who like that style. :D
---
(I mean no rushing, enjoying and learning the game by playing. Addons are not forbidden. :)
---
Personally I'm baffled by the use of any "quest helpers" and I certainly not use them. When you don't know where things are, finding them is part of the game and the fun. When you've played enough, you already know where things are and don't need a helper.
---
Wait wait wait WAIT WAIT... You mean I dont have to ask every single question I have in life as a separate Reddit post?!?!?!?
---
Keep in mind many retail changes occured simply due to having tonnes of expansions and level increases.
---
Transmog for example made 15 years of content relevant again but would do nothing in Classic. Talent trees became impossible to balance with so many new points and classes. Arena and flying fucked up PvP massively despite seeming like a good idea at the time.
---
We have the benefit of no new levels and hindsight. The big issue with new content is power creep
---
Well it's not so there we go
---
When you’re at 3 hp and the mob is at 4% hp and you suddenly remember you haven’t missed in a while.
---
 Thanks for your thoughts.
---
The talent distribution is not yet 100% final.
---
I will take your comments into account in any case. 
---
So I've got to ask; are you simply too arrogant to acknowledge you are wrong, or are you really this dumb?
---
I didn't say videos of a spec is proof that the spec is good. I said it is proof that some people have managed to gear said spec. This is not a complicated matter, no idea why it is so hard to understand.
---
As for balance actually being good at wPvP, it is pretty much generally accepted to be one of their strengths, except for the people with no personal experience that just saw too many "balance sucks" threads and jumped on that instead of making an informed opinion. Oh, and all those "balance sucks" threads are about *PvE*.
---
I also wish this.
---
No, fts
---
&gt; I didn't say videos of a spec is proof that the spec is good.
---
The first legitimate thing you've said so far! 
---
I personally like the [STV PvP Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SRiyXCZuws) featuring a level 30-39 taking on multiple opponents and people +10 levels above him
---
I wish I was in your shoes - coming into Vanilla WoW with little to no knowledge of the game is one of the coolest experiences in gaming I (and I bet a lot of others) have had.   
---
You can ALWAYS read all the guides to how you play the game optimally, find the best class, specc, items, etc etc - but you only get one shot at experiencing the world for the first time.   
---
Enjoy your time leveling, do the things you find fun and interesting, and ignore the people telling you you're doing them wrong.   
---
Arguably the best part of Vanilla WoW is getting to know the world and your character - so take your time, you're playing to have fun, not to be the best raider on your server.   
---
If you realise at lvl 60 that you would like to dive into the world of try-harding, you can always do that - but the only real benefit of starting to read all the various guides while you level, is that the leveling phase becomes shorter.   
---
still no. 25% crit on poh is indeed crappy if you think about all the +heal ur trading for it.
---
32-43 on the headslot (cassandras grace/green lens), 11 on the shoulders (burial shawl), 46-51 on the chest (robes of the exalted/truefaith), 22 on the belt (whipvine cord), 20 on the legs (padre's trousers) and 8 on the boots (full moon).
---
thats a total of 139-155 +heal depending on professions, 25% crit is nowhere near as good.
---
&gt; If you're a fan of classic how can you not rate Crapacylsm as the worst? 
---
Why should I not be able to like several versions of WoW? I also like GW2, despite being different than vanilla.
---
Yes, the world was revamped, but honestly I had leveled so goddamn awful many through the vanilla maps that it was pretty nice. Now, yes I do prefer the vanilla zones, but at the time of cata I was very tired of them. And I don't care about flying in older zones. The reason I don't like flying is because of wPvP, but that problem was all the way back from TBC, so not something to blame cata for.
---
&gt; There was no vision other than "how can we maximise profits?"
---
This seems awfully unfair and rude to the devs that tried to make a great product. We all know that isn't true - yes, Blizzard is a company and as such exists to make profit, but the devs are passionate about the game. I understand that from someone that only enjoys the vanilla version it sucks to see it die and be replaced by another design philosophy, but don't try to say anything but what *you* prefer is soulless shit. In all honesty, if Blizzard had just kept the Vanilla philosophy we might not have a WoW anymore (and therefor not get Classic either). While they alienated vanilla fans over the years they did manage to keep mainstream. Vanilla was mainstream because it catered to casuals, but as MMORPG changed WoW had to change too. Did they change too much in my opinion? Yes, but I won't blame them, all the haters would have trainwrecked way faster if they were responsible for the game.
---
And I realize I might sound a bit aggressive, not trying to attack you personally.
---
Soon, not soon™.
---
This is my favourite spot to get rank 2 quickly for the PvP trinket.
---
The questing NPC are also Alliance Friendly and help you LOL
---
It has niche uses for certain bosses with regular downtime. My guild used it for Four Horsemen f.e., you stand in the safe spot in the middle for like a half the fight and always run there with damaged HP. You could also use it for Chromaggus etc. But it's not really a spell that breaks the game, the advantage is still minimal.
---
I think in general, maybe except alchemy, crafting professions should be viewed as a gold sink, except for the top 1% who get a hold of the ultra rare recipes. 
---
Yes, you dont go too deep holy, but Inspiration and improve healing are must haves in the holy tree when you raid, unless you are the single designated shadow priest.  Even as a dedicated shadow priest you will still do the worst damage in the raid, even when you flask and others wont. Also you will most likely be in the bottom of the loot bin, unless your guild runs DKP or something similar.
---
Except for a few bosses, ZG and AQ20 are between easy and very easy
---
It's a raid-healing HoT that's canceled by raid damage, has to be sought out and clicked by other players, charges are easily wasted, ten minute cooldown. And you have to drop Divine Spirit for it. It is truly awful
---
Actually this worked in earlier versions but it was patched. 
---
Effective? Yes, Optimal? No
---
Against randomly geared, (often also pve spec) players its still better than half the specs in the game.
---
That's what I'm saying, I want to see what everyone does when the quests aren't an option. We'll see it anyways in a smaller scale when sharding ends, too many around to quest normally, so players'll need to get creative.
---
You have around 170 health at level one and 200 at level two, mobs don't start dealing 100 damage (making crits 200) until about level 27.
---
Grouping up to kill higher level mobs is common on private servers, it's just unnecessary because there's fast spawns. The groups do fine though and it's a lot of fun. 40 level 5s all physical damage dealers and healers could easily take on level 14 raptors, even getting attacked by 3-4 mobs at once would probably be easy.
---
haha it wouldnt be classic without that awkwardly geared/specced paladin trying to be something they arent
---
*ret pally walks in with 1hander and shield and spams consecrate*
---
Oh, don't worry about "go go go" in Classic from Vanilla vets or private server vets. I am both a Vanilla vet and private server vet, and while I do not know everything, I know that "go go go" is antithetic to Classic, and being fast usually means you are slow...just because a wipe adds like 10 minutes to the run.
---
Hardcore players, that know all the ins and outs, will play with other hardcore players, and yes, they will be FAST. Still, not even they will be "go go go", because each and everyone of them KNOWS how fast a run can go.
---
The VAST majority of Classic guilds will be progression guilds, and as such, they will be much slower compared to hardcore guilds. Those guilds will take their time, and they will progress when their players will have the gear advantage, as opposite to hardcore guilds, where players have the knowledge advantage.
---
Vanilla vets will always come off as very opinionated...because they know all the shit. Snarky? Not so much. Some, yes, but most no.
---
Im trying to avoiding being that guy :D
---
Closest i can up to is shockadin with prot talents, skiping retribution entirely
---
\*\*Epoch of Thought \[H\]\*\* | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
\*\*About\*\*: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
\*\*What we expect\*\*: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
\*\*Why We Will Survive and Thrive\*\*:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.  
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.  
---
\*\*Raid Schedule\*\*: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
\*\*Looking for\*\*: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; \*\*specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.\*\* Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
\*\*Apply\*\*: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Discord: 
---
Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326).  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on \[B\]discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916\[/B\] 
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;[http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)\&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;[https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT)\&gt; 
---
\*\*Join us!\*\*
---
Just Level as prot pally. You will still be able to heal dungeons and tank them. With this build you'll also have a good time leveling and can even AoE farm at times (especially later with wrath against undead packs).
---
Pick up consecrate at level 20 (11 points in holy)
---
And then spend 21 (Blessing of Sanctuary) or 25/26 (BoS + Reckoning) or 31 (BoS + Reckoning + Holy Shield) in prot. 
---
Then switch back to holy for better healing or retribution if you feel so
---
Thanks. Which seal does prot paladin uses? SoR?
---
I was 25 when I played Vanilla now I'm 38 and will probably play the shit out of classic and hopefully it can keep me busy for a while.
---
I'm not married (not even close) and even further away from having kids. Don't worry, be happy!
---
Itching*
---
FTFY
---
Logged in just to give this a thumbs up
---
Great work!
---
For me personally I would much rather have sharding for a a limited time than have transfers unless absolutely necessary.
---
Transfers let ninjas have new victims, makes people fight over names and just generally break up anything resembling cohesion.
---
Sharding (again only for awhile) lets the tourists go back to BFA after a month and keeps endgame players with healthier populations.
---
People imagine they'll get Tailoring or Enchanting so they can get the imagined benefits,
---
but in reality if you go Herb or better yet Alch Herb, you can easily *buy* all the Tailoring made items and all the Enchants you need and have 100s of gold surplus,
---
rather than sinking 100s of gold into the professions themselves.
---
To mix a cape and a robe would work if the cape was waterproof or if you didn't want to get your fancypants robes splashed with mud whenever a horse rode past. /me wraps travelling cloak around me rp-style.

&gt; I know this will be downvoted to Oblivion
---
Becomes sub’s most upvoted post of all time. 
---
Yeah i agree 100% the only toxic ppl i met was through a hard core pvp guild, pservers are also free so ppl dont care enough
---
class fantasy. and I can main only 2 classes ince launch: warlock or hunter
---
Well, since Classic was announced, the forums were FULL of people saying the following :
---
"Players today are much better than those back in 2005-2006, we have a lot of information, everyone will know everything, there is YouTube, Wowhead, etc. Vanilla was easy, raid bosses have 1-2 mechanics, people will clear MC in greens. Everyone will quit in 2 months, because all raids will be cleared. Vanilla is a joke". Etc. Etc. Etc.
---
So, if what they say is right...clearly EVERYONE knows everything about Vanilla. Right?
---
Ofc they are completely wrong, but even today, after like 18 months since Classic was announced, they are STILL saying these stupid things.
---
The "Everyone will be expected to know EVERYTHING or go fuck yourself"  holds as much water as "Everyone will know everything and players are much better today".
---
Both are equally stupid.
---
I think you'd like plain old Protection. Sword and board, magic damage from seals, judgments and Holy Shield. Has no problem fighting multiple mobs and can tank or heal dungeons.
---
Huh? The Draenei were in WC3. They were aliens back then, no?
---
Say what?
---
When it comes to picking a class, everthing with the exception of warrior is fairly easy to level imo. Class/race combination doesnt really matter pick what you think is cool. Just be aware that if your class is able to heal most players will expect you to do so in group content.
---
Do you not itch for wow classic news? First thing I thought when I saw 'Inching' was -&gt; 'Itching'.
---
So would the goal be to have the 6 ret pallies in melee groups with sanctity aura and then a bunch of smite priests plus your tanks, healers, and a handful of C.C. classes? That would be fierce. 
---
Exactly
---
I do but I certainly don't itch closer.
---
Fair enough, it wasn't grammatically correct.
---
Being able to chainpull is what makes dungeons fast, if you have to drink for 20 seconds between every pulls its gonna be a looong ride.
---
But yes shaman burst is fucking amazing.
---
A fully geared warrior could just pump out 4 one-shot and walk away
---
otherwise druid, sham, spriest and lock
---
Bad troll
---
Avoid servers with famous streamers on them. Thats in my book the biggest thing im going to do first. Also i guess there will be a site or something to check the balance. When the hype dies, who knows what will happen but i guess merges are most likely to happen eventually.
---
I don't specifically recall any bosses that are immune to nature, but the biggest problem with shaman is just that there is no way to reduce magic resistance on bosses. Curse of elementals and curse of shadows takes care of every other element and even gives a 10% damage increase, but not for nature. So you are looking at not getting 10% damage and a fuck ton of resists. I have seen the difference between not having that debuff and having it is for when we only had 2 warlocks to curse, it is absolutely massive.
---
I don't think I need to choose. There's probably only going to be 1 Oceanic PVE server.
---
Right. But it still stands that if you’re not playing on the same server you can’t play together at all?
---
how do some of ya'll even dress yourselves and get out the door every day if these kinds of things puzzle you
---
 "If I don’t communicate with them, will we risk ending up on different servers and be unable to play together?"
---
maybe you should communicate with them then? if its that big a deal?
---
"How do I go about choosing server?"
---
pick one based in your region?
---
"So that will make it even more difficult and you’ll risk ending up and dedicating yourself to a low-pop server."
---
so pay for a server transfer.....
---
much ado about nothing up in here
---
First up: Clear up with your friends what server/faction to play on early on. That is, clear up the server type right now and the name shortly after launch. The sooner, the less any of you will have to abandon to play with each other. Otherwise, you will not be able to play together. 
---
Sharding is a sort of instancing. Instead of having one world where everyone is, there's several versions of, say, Elwynn Forest running in parallel similar to how dungeons work, but more fluid. The reason it's such a big deal on this subreddit is precisely because people don't like the idea of being right next to a person, but not being able to see them, because they're in another instance. 
---
As for population... nobody knows how it will develop exactly. You can't know in advance which server will remain full and which won't, so it's a roll of the dice. 
---
prolly bc he wants to dps
---
You could do this in Vanilla if I remember correctly. Drown yourself in wetlands right next to the GY then run across the coast to Southshore and spirit res. The first time I did this I was disgusted that I wasn't nominated for a nobel prize.
---
If you’re not on the same server you don’t play together. That’s how classic was and how it should forever remain until servers merge. 
---
He actually works for blizzard now afaik.
---
Same guy:

---
Classic UI, no quest addons. Maybe titan panel. That's it, make it as vanilla as possible!
---
Hunter it is then.
---
Most professions are. Alchemists require Scholomance to craft flasks, Blacksmiths require BRD to create several high grade recipes, Tailoring requires you to find a Moonwell every few days. Heck even Engineering is a pain in the ass despite not requiring a specialised crafting bench, just because if you want all usable items you have to relearn the profession from scratch.
---
is there any reward for farming ravenholdt rep?
---
Reckoning isn't gonna work in actual classic, Ret-Soc is gonna be the main way forward 
---
In this raid setup smite priests would have insane dps by the way. Could be a cool concept for a guild.
---
How many people would be willing to do that vs them saying fuck this game. Doesn't make any sense from a financial standpoint.

Even if it wasn't the exp penalties are huge a lvl 1 mob gives like 90 xp for a solo kill, a lvl 14 like 300, elite mobs in a 5 man your level are roughly 100. So there isn't any way that you would be making even decent xp per hour for the group. (Raid-sized groups dramatically decrease experience gained and fighting red names hurts it even more.) https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP
---
I don't get it.
---
I don’t know how the hell this isn’t listed, but shadow priest with the wand talent fully maxed from the disc tree, and then a warlock. Since warlocks can sacrifice their hp for mana they can constantly dps with no downtime. With the shadow priest your highest dps rotation for efficiency is shadow word pain, and wanding. With the mana saved with this method you can be a constantly killing dps machine of a duo. What is even better is you also have the same movement speed till level 40 when the lock gets a free mount, but if you’re smart you’ll pool your money to get the priest a mount and it will be even.
---
Well, compared to modern MMORPG it is slow paced. It is also old, so no fancy graphics or anything to carry the experience. Because of this it does not lend itself well to people that just want to rush through it.
---
What you can inspect on the positive side is a game with a great story. The quests are actually often worth reading and if you accept the slow pace of leveling, then the leveling experience becomes a fun part of the game instead of a chore to do before endgame. I'd recommend trying to do all quests in Duskwood and read them, they are really great and shows early on what Vanilla quests can offer. In PvE don't expect hard mechanics, instead it's a matter of being 40 people together in a fight. PvE is quite stat based. PvP is not balanced in the sense of "everyone can fight the same", but in the sense that each spec is unique. One spec might not be strong 1v1, but have amazing group utility.
---
Now, how to prepare? The most important thing is to research classes. It takes a long time to get to 60 and a long time to get gear. Rerolling a new class can turn most people off from the game. Now, do beware that on forums people yell all kinds of only partly true things about classes, so try to find some reliable sources. I'd really encourage you to look at gameplay of all the classes that interest you. A little list of things that most people find important in their class (in no order):
---
- Theme (for example the devilish spells of a warlock)
---
- Role (Tank, healer or dps. Also, do you want more roles in one class?)
---
- Viability (do you want to be the best dps, regardless of whether class playstyle is fun for you?)
---
- desirability (is your class sought after? Makes it easier to find groups)
---
- Playstyle (do you love melee? magic? kiting with a bow?)
---
- Content (some classes can simply do things others can't. Solo farming stuff? Raids? Battlegrounds? World PvP? some classes simply lend themselves better to some content)
---
Paladin can easily aoe grind lvl 50-52 mobs
---
Priest can Holy Nova farm lasher in DM
---
Druid can stealth run with rogue 
---
Shaman (other healer too but shaman are best for that) can duo farm DM with war
---
Go prot and either go 11 into holy for consecration followed by full prot, or full prot from the start to holy shield.
---
Seriously recommend going holy 11 first, gives you that fantasy of a tanky sword and board paladin along with the magical fireworks of consecration
---
This works but is far from optimal. For a interesting meme you can run a booking, 6 Ret pallys, smite priests and then prot pallys for tanks. The extra holy damage lets them keep agro 
---
Neat! Thanks for digging that up!
---
Need gold for arrows sorry
---
Classic balance was terrible for the fact that AT the time we had zero idea how anything would play out at 60, so we picked a class on good faith that we would be able to stay competitive at end game, but as it turns out that wasn't the case at all.
---
"Upholders of the Holy Light and defenders of the Alliance, the Paladins can be found from the northern forests of the Tirisfal Glades, fighting back the advance of the Forsaken, to the southern reaches of the Blasted Lands, ceaselessly upholding their vigil against demonic forces from beyond the Dark Portal. Wielding their mighty hammers and the strength of the Light, these holy warriors command forces in battle, all the while throwing themselves to where the fighting is the thickest."
---
So say you are a bright eyed paladin who just bought the game when it came out, you spent 8 months leveling and have zero idea about addons, if you look at that description you might be under the impression that you might be doing something other than spamming flash of light, but oh how wrong you would be. You go to join a raiding guild and they basically laugh at you for being ret and tell you go holy and wear a dress. Sort of like getting an art degree.
---
&gt;I think I'd have more 'fun' on a Paladin or Mage, since leveling a warrior is miserable
---
Honestly I wouldn't say it's miserable. I find leveling a warrior fun. I never liked the modern WoW AoE everything to death style - it doesn't feel like the enemies are actually a foe, just walking xp.
---
With a warrior when fighting it feels like a foe, I feel immersed into the game. I really think people just need to let go of all the hate on warrior leveling and they might enjoy it. Sure, some will want an easier time, but being harder isn't necessarily a bad thing - hence games like Dark Souls are still a thing.
---
I love mothering noobs through the more difficult content. People new to the game won't have too much difficulty getting along with other vets from my experience, either. 
---
Even if you had 150 more healing and you get like cant remember lets say 75% effiency to your casts. Aka about +112 per heal.
---
Rank 4 poh does 970ish without any +healing, ill make that 1k for clearness sake. Cant remember how much healing you will have with full T1, lets say 400 for easy counting. Meaning your poh does about 1300 per cast compared to 1412.
---
Additional +27% crit (lets say you got +5% from talents and 10% from int and random buffs). Not counting that tier usually has more int and stamina.
---
On your gear 0.85*1412 + 0.15*1412*1.5 = 1517.9 on average cast.
---
T1 0.63*1300 + 0.37*1300*1.5 = 1540.5.
---
Crappy it is not.
---
Has to be said though that people will keep changing their minds up until classic launch. I remember voting NE Druid on that poll, and have since changed, first to Paladin and then to Mage.
---
No, full holy is not needed, and most hardcore guilds actually use 31/20/00 priests to boost their speedkills. 
---
They can heal just fine, can use PI on mages for more damage, or use it defensively if it's a heal intense fight.
---
You can change some points here and there and be a smiter priest, with some damage potential and still being able to heal when needed.
---
31/00/20 shadow weave priest is also used sometimes, it's basically a full raid utility priest.
---
You can change it to  13/17/21 so you get some holy talents, mana regen, and silence, and be a shadow weave healer priest in pve, have a silence in pvp, and have spirit tap and holy nova for farming.
---
No. You don't need to be holy. It's not needed and also not optimal even if you were trying to min-max.
---
Class fantasy is a big one, and then just the feeling of the class gameplay. I enjoy constant micromanaging something. Spamming frostbolt isn't fun to me, but trying to weave abilities in between auto shots on a hunter keeps me engaged.
---
Only thing you'll miss out on is the pre-raid BoP items, but that's really not worth it. I'm still going to pick Tailoring on my main, but mainly because I enjoy crafting my own items, not because I have any delusions about it being an advantage.
---
Rivendare I believe wears a cape hence the drop. Personally I feel a cloak fits.
---
you get 1ap from agi, 2ap from strength, so strength is your most important stat besides stamina.
---
also brutal impact &gt;&gt;&gt; thick hide or feral aggression.
---
You sound excactly like that lvl 60 with 100% mount camping my lvl 20 warrior
---
People changing their minds is unlikely to be a big deal. You change your mind from Druid to Paladin, someone else changes his mind from Paladin to Druid. The thing that'll really upset it is the inherit selection bias. The people that vote on these polls is a small subset, of usually more informed and/or dedicated players than your average player, which will bias their choices compared to the far more plentiful masses.
---
Very true!
---
Acknowledged. I just think it'd be a lot more fun to play than sharded. Crappy xp per hour is mitigated by the knowledge that it's the same for everyone. Perhaps your raid group getting constant kills in the barrens is the best xp anyone's getting in the game? However it happens, the people that pull away from the pack are the ones that will have it easy from then on, so the drive to push through is still there. And for the people who are fed up with trying to snag kills and accept that they aren't going to lead the pack anyway... Epic, enormous world pvp battles!
---
This but you're playing on a warrior and you have 20% hp and you miss, miss, parry, parry, miss, die.

---
Not to be rude, but did you really need a thread about this? 
---
&gt; you’ll risk ending up and dedicating yourself to a low-pop server.
---
Well yes, what do you expect us to say? Learn to see into the future.
---
&gt; If I don’t communicate with them, will we risk ending up on different servers
---
Yes, that is how communication works. If you don't communicate you won't know about other people.
---
&gt;Also, I’ve heard sharding being thrown around a lot. Exactly what is it?
---
Now this is an understandable question! It's basically to prevent overpopulation in a specific location. Imagine 1000 people all logging into the same zone at the same time. Instead of all 1000 being together sharding will put them in small instances. So you might see 100 people, but none of the other 900. This means you could run right past a friend and not see him because he is in another shard. The important thing here is, all the shards can only contain people from your realm (server). If sharding puts you together with people from other realms you suddenly have cross-realms.
---
The big deal about it is you can't have a proper community if you only see half the community at a time and it's random whom you get to see each time.
---
We can definitely expect a 10:05 minute long video from TipsOut today on his interpretation of this post. 
---
You are literally shaking rn.
---
Imo, a warrior without a cloak looks like a warrior fighting for a king. A warrior with a cloak looks like a king. I'll be keeping my cloak for now.
---
finally not a horrible spec in this thread, but i wouldn't skip improved shred since its so nice for pvp. (take 1 point from instinct and 1 fr blood frenzy)
---
HEY WHAT'S UP GUYS IT'S TIPS
---
SO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT BLUE POST A FEW DAYS BACK-
---
Nah I shouldn't bash the guy lmao
---
What's the point of classic servers if they're going to change everything?
---
Me and all my friends will play on a RP-PvP server! =) 
---
I wish I was a complete noob. Best thing about playing Vanilla is finding out how everything works. You will fuck up and you will have a ton of fun for it.
---
And we're relying on some random dude's dream and the July 16th meme great that's how starved for info Blizz has got us lmao
---
rank 1 smite for no mana cost and only a 1.5 cast time, max out crit % on gear etc, with enough mp5 to be infinity sustain 0.o
---
and he should prolly be prepared to be kicked for the healer
---
So you disagree that people who lie repeatedly should be shunned then? 
---
Have never met anyone who RPs in an MMO with that attitude, unless you are not RPing at all and take offence when people ask you to do so.
---
I played on some RP servers in Vanilla and TBC just because the community was so much more friendly.
---
but it is crap, most of the crits will just end up being overheal and u dont benefit at all from the armor vs vael. your healing will be more spikey and less reliable with more overheal.
---
&gt; keep hearing from people that they actually aint that good.
---
No idea who says that, but they probably just want less rogues because they are so strong.
---
In PvE they are among the strongest DPS for pretty much *every single tier*.
---
In PvP they are arguably the strongest for wPvP and 1v1. Basically the only PvP they *don't* shine in is structured battlegrounds, but they don't suck here. They are just not the alpha dogs. In random BG's where you don't play like a team they go right up to among the best again.
---
Yeah all the evil/bad DKs wear one.
---
Do you people not have other stuff to do? It will be released, jesus.
---
We've seen it happen in retail over and over again...why ignore this. 
---
Well, we should get a release date and some preorder package, like 3 months priced for 2 plus some pet on classic servers
---
Granted but you once your respect you cannot respect later in a build you already used and the LFG only make group of 5 same class toons 
---
&gt;  BT is very over hyped
---
I wouldn't say so. He is extremely strong in PvP. No one is trying to say he is amazing in PvE, he is a PvP pet and he does that very well.
---
Chainpull fast? You need to vastly overgear lvl 60 dungeons to be able to chainpull stuff or what server have you been playing on?
---
No, we really don't.
---
Arthas and the other DKs from W3 did though.
---
I look more at the long term, short term I am sort of indifferent about the sharding but long term I would much rather have a health population @60 that didn't require server mergers
---
Idk, because you were no longer in danger of dying?
---
I would say most people didn’t abuse the mechanic because of the wisp speed increase; more because as a low level you would die a half dozen+ times running through wetlands.
---
As much as I'd like to see testing and feedback from a beta I wouldn't want a bata to take away that new fresh start feeling of logging in for the first time in a packed (depending on whats happening with all this sharding crap) starting zone.
---
I'm in danger.
---
The point about mages is not true. There are several very specific optimal aoe spots that are ideally laid out with certain types of mobs. When you're leveling and there is even ONE other mage there competing it messes up your flow big time. Same with mobs respawning too fast, since usually you swap back and forth killing moba on one side then the other a and your kill kite zone is where the previous pack of mobs was standing. 
---
Everything else in your post is spot on though!
---
I heard a rumor that there are more cuts coming at activision/blizzard and it may affect the classic dev team. 
---
all your examples are hirrible, since they are the go to specs for pvp.
---
You're just wrong, and clearly don't know what you are talking about.
---
&gt; I also have many friends that say they will try Classic. If I don’t communicate with them, will we risk ending up on different servers and be unable to play together?
---
What's the problem with, you know, trying to ask them where they will play? Lol
---
It's because of Lightning Reflexes, a survival talent that increase your agility by a 15%. The thing is, TSA is static. So at a certain amount of agility the % increase from LR will grant more total AP than TSA does for the whole group.
---
The problem with most guides is they just look at this AP increase. SV also get 3% crit from killer instinct and some crit from LR, but they loose 5% overall damage from Ranged Weapon Spec in MM. Most guides just assume this to equal out.
---
And then the real deal for why SV isn't as strong as it might look at high agility; who gets the AP? Hunters scale poorly and you only get enough agility to consider it at very high-end gear. The problem is here, even if SV grants a combined higher AP than TSA, will your actual DPS increase be higher than what TSA would grant an actual good dps like a warrior? Often, no - it won't. TSA isn't strong because of the amount of AP it can grant, it is strong because it can grant it to other dps than yourself.
---
Put 11 points into holy so you get concecration. Done. Now you can tank, heal and dps in dungeons and do quests and pvo no matter what you do with the rest of the talent points.
---
Do you mean,
---
Until you meet Stitches in Darkshire on the road to Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Or,
---
Until your corpse twitches whilst traveling through Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Not arsed about the skill or whatever used in this video. It still gives me a pants party when that song kicks in and he firsts charges in.
---
There's literally another dude replying to my comments calling me an idiot for thinking that BT isn't crazy best for everything, so there definitely are people that say that.
---
I am thinking about something similar.
---
I am currently testing the below build on a 'undocumented' server. So far so good.
---
No problems either healing or tanking 5 mans. Haven't tested raid healing but what I gave up in the holy tree is very minimal imo. Should be fine for a non min/max guild. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuRgoZVGzIczx
---
it says ... "classic is on its way" 
---
i dont think there is any other hidden msg
---
Sorry i'm really hype
---
I would say avoid 2 classes that share gear. Priest/warrior is great, you will never have an issue leveling and doing 5 man's, you only need to pick up 3 DPS and you literally just find them any where you go. A good warrior tank is just lovely. A good priest to go with them is even nicer, you will cruise to 60.
---
Any healer with a hunter will be good for leveling, you will have zero down time as the hunter just keeps on killing while you drink every 5 minutes. 
---
Rogue/druid sounds great any way, druid can probably go feral the whole way and have an offset for healing. For PvP you will be supreme. 
---
\+848 holy damage... that would be insane for smite priests. But I doubt more than one copy of it can stack. "A more powerful spell is already in effect."
---
Why would crits be overheal and +healing would be "better". Its just matter of when you cast a heal. 
---
My main will usually be a support/healer type character and then I like to have a main alt that can do some fun stuff. 
---
I’m leaning toward Shaman for my main and then Hunter or Priest for the fun alt. 
---
For the Hunter, I would like to get into soloing dungeons and see how far I could get. For the Priest, I would just hang around spots with large drops and MC people :)
---
&gt; It’s more of a “Well if everyone is Holy it’s boring” and I’m doing something different. 
---
I get it to some extent, but this isn't exactly mind-blowing creativity here. "Everyone is pushing button one because it's clearly the best... I'm a gonna press button *two* everybody look at me being different!".
---
And you are doing it in a cooperative game where you being good or bad matters to the enjoyment of other players.
---
Couldn't you go get a nice set or watercolours or write short stories or something for a creative outlet, that enables some actual creativity, and play the team MMORPG as a good team player?
---
I did consider adding to my comment that obviously there are always people thinking such things, but I'm talking about people who at least knows something about the game and thus have a relevant opinion.
---
You should his vids are bad
---
Yah when they walk in a step too far and the Raid gets wiped by lava giants. 
---
You can farm devilsaur leather and skin some bosses in raids but. You won't make any gold from the raids as it will be used for gear and the raid leader will probably take it off you / assign it to someone.
---
Skin high level mobs with valuable hides (Devilsaurs, certain Molten Core beasts etc) and sell those on AH. 
---
Big if true

---
You seem to have reasonable arguments as to why you end up with either hunter or warrior, but from then on you based your thoughts on wrong information.
---
First of all, you don't need epic raiding drops to do well with a warrior. Actually, in BiS you will already be quite strong. So the only time you will feel weak is *right* after hitting 60, and then its only in dungeons, not even raids yet. On the other hand, as a Hunter you will only feel strong in the very first raid or two, after that scaling hits hard and Hunter is useless dps the rest of vanilla, only used for occasional kiting and Tranq Shot. Also, hunters are not strong in dungeons either, so they go through the same as warriors. I'd say both warrior and hunter are equally fun in terms of rotation.
---
Now, as for leveling. Yes, they are opposites. Warriors is undoubtedly way harder to level, but does that make it awful? I'd say no. Honestly, you just need to "obey the rules", like don't pull too many. I actually find warriors fun to level, and they even become amazing at PvP while leveling whenever they get a strong 2H weapon (like whirlwind axe). Sure it's not for everyone, but don't let the general mindset that they are harder to level decide that you will hate it.
---
No preorder crap.
---
But release date, please, need to book my holidays..
---
Yes - I tried ghost-walking through the Timbermaw tunnel and it ported me back to where I started.
---
Always was a fan of 40man raid.
---
Look at that Titan Panel though! I prefer mine on the top :p
---
DPS, when properly prepared for a raid, have too many heal options of their own, ones that dont require them to move or stop dps. Hearthstone, potion, whipper root, etc
---
A good rogue can 1v1 any class, even spriests, sl locks and hunters. 
---
40 man people&gt; 40 man multi boxer not really p2w
---
Have you ever played 1.12? Spriests and SL locks own rogues most of times. Nevertheless you can beat them, but it requires gear and engi.
---
Skimmed through and I don't see it. Most people just argue they they aren't *as* OP as they are made out to be. That's true, because some people still see them as they were in early patches where they literally were invincible (no diminishing return on stuns). That doesn't mean they say rogues suck, just that they are hyped up a bit too much.
---
And then quite a few says they are very CD dependent. True, that's how the class is. You can't design a class to have strong CC and burst and *not* limit it by CD. And even if you consider having CDs a weakness they can counter that weakness themselves with stealth (although this makes them useless in premade BG's, hence they aren't strong there).
---
That's the thing though, though can't really.  You can talk small group, you can heal small group.  You can do about 70% of the dps of a mage in even level gear.  That's your limit.  To so what you want will be to have three gear sets (one def, one int, one dps) and the weapons to go with it.  You will take roughly 160 hours to level.  That's if you know what you're doing.  Most of your damage will be proc and auto attack.  Not reactive proc, just the occasional SoC pop.  You will hit judgement once every few seconds unless you are weaving.  You will not tank raid bosses and you will not have loot priority.  You will not be wearing plate unless you are in tier.  In raids you will be blessing the group.  At 2 seconds per that's 80 seconds per 300 you spend on blessings and 220 fighting.  These are the things you need to know before rolling one.

It’s going to be using the retail client and launcher. My guess is that it will start DLing in the background a week or so before launch. 
---
You have plenty of time but you should DL the current game so you have it ready to go whenever they start pushing it into the launcher. 
---
Dont worry, they will allow you to download it at least one week before launch. 
---
The Beta will give us more information about this. Sooooooon my friend...
---
i would be interested. but it would be nice to know more about you guys. whats your goals for classic? are you building a raidgroup? will you even raid? if so which classes are needed? how many members are you planning to have? 
---
PS ich komme aus dem schönen Wien in Österreich. LG
---
I love it, so many good memories.
---
Do you mean just have a current launcher and be logged into it or this + have bfa downloaded?
---
LF a | semi-hardcore/ hardcore | horde guild | that raids during eastern time zones. I Will be playing DPS warrior and plan to hit 60 less than two weeks after release. Looking to raid around three days a week during the week. I will also be leveling an alt as time allows for alt/ gearing runs once content is on farm. I will be farming consumables for raids and I hope this is the expectation, not the exception.
---
Might tell your friend if he enjoys playing - and having an account, spectacularly poor idea.  
---
wouldnt sham just get bursted down quick?
---
That would be my guess. I’m not sure about having BfA but it should be on the current launcher. 
---
I'm split about it. I've tried several big launches, and honestly I like how you fight to tag mobs and can hardly get any xp. It's an experience for me, one that only exists at launch.
---
On the other hand, I do understand some won't like it. Also the problem of queue is relevant - doesn't matter how launch is if you can't even log in for 3 days straight. Being "locked out" of the game would ruin launch for anyone, regardless of their preferences. And simply adding a shitton of realms will obviously totally destroy populations once the initial rush fades.
---
And then we have to think about the success of the launch. For many people who aren't hardcore into vanilla, a bad launch experience might turn them off from the game. Honestly we don't want just the hardcore pserver players to be our community, and we also want long support for Classic, so it's not just in Blizzards interest to make it a massive success.
---
Overall, I really think sharding could work *if* they did it so each shard will be quite big. Essentially it should only split into 2 or something like that and only if there are massive queue (50 in queue is not a catastrophe).
---
Warlock+Druid has good synergy. Druid can throw a HoT or two on the Warlock and also has Innervate, and can go feral to do additional dps. There is little downtime in combat. You also have a VW that can tank a lot of stuff. MotW is a nice buff, too.
---
Nahh don’t worry. Been playing p.servers for like 2-4 years (vanilla), and most of the time (specially in pugs or guild-runs with some pugs), they always go over basic strats on discord before pulling, so I would’t be too worried! 
---
By all technical means the servers don't have a "language" they're organized by time zones inside your region (NA, EU, Asia, Oceania). In NA alone there are English, French, Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries. The EU would have more and I doubt you will have problems finding a community with those you can communicate with.
---
It will have its own launcher.
---
how would you rate their leveling speed and BG/Premade viability? 
---
Today's the day.
---
I'm sure blizz will figure a solution to dying servers after the tourists leave. I'm just gonna pick a pvp server with a cool name  
---
sharding = multiple instances of a zone on the same server
---
The way the BNet launcher works is the selected game changes the background. Perhaps within World of Warcraft's options there will be a choice to make it have a classic background but it's likely not a prio for the dev team to work on a redo of the BNet launcher layout.
---
Thanks for restoring my sanity good Sir and / or Madame 
---
Leveling first time in vanilla is an amazing epic RPG-ish journey. And honestly, I still enjoy it after having done it 5-10 times already.
---
All the servers 
---
This clip is from AV. This is instanced pvp. There is no crz, phasing, or dynamic mob scaling going on.
---
Retail is a different game. 
---
In retail changes occurred often due to having tonnes of expansions and level increases.
---
Transmog for example made 15 years of content relevant again but would do nothing in Classic, it was a good choice. Talent trees became impossible to balance with so many new points and classes, that was probably a good thing. Arena and flying fucked up PvP massively despite seeming like a good idea at the time.
---
We have the benefit of no new levels and hindsight. The big issue with new content is power creep.
---
Even sharding is due to the endgame taking so long to reach, and not enough low levels around. Similarly heirlooms and mob nerfs are due to not enough players at lower levels.
---
We don't have those problems in Classic, so why are we assuming they will pointlessly make the same mistakes?
---
I'm pretty sure there will be at least english, german and french servers for classic.
---
I Think spanish server came some time later, but i guees there will be some for classic.
---
But there hasn't been an official statement by blizz.
---
Jeez, one instantly think classic WoW will have WoD models simply because the CM used a gif.. how can you get this paranoid?
---
BUT he's obviously trying to hint something, I'm ready!
---
First character I ever leveled in vanilla was on a pserver(nost). I picked a human male warrior and a stupid name and with no questing addons or anything I set out on an adventure that took me 13 days played to hit 60.
---
Best time I ever had playing a video game that's for sure.
---
He's just a guy who is super stoked about Classic WoW and a platform he's able to shout to about it. 
---
Ohhhhhh HYPE TRAIN. Right thanks that makes sense.
---
I see your point. But for this build efficiency is not the goal. Steady AOE leveling  / filing healer tank role in dungeons until 60 and then mostly pvp in BG as shockadin. 
---
It wouldn't even need to be a redo, could just be an extension. Like what you suggested with the backgrounds changing. Classic's background can just have an extra button that redirects you to a classic launcher

Welcome to the World of Warcraft Beta Test! - Katricia on 03/18/04
---
Have a mug of ale in one of our many taverns; adventure the wide world; meet friends or form a guild: the choice is yours.
---
To those joining us for the first time, we are currently in the middle of our All Alliance push. This means that you may play any of the Alliance races (i.e. Human, Dwarf, Gnome and Night Elf) and can choose one of the following six classes: Mage, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Warlock &amp; Warrior (as each race allows). More races and classes will become available in the next few weeks.
---
Please be sure to check the Readme documentation supplied with the download. To further help you get settled in, I've included a few links below to help you establishing yourself in the new World of Warcraft community:

Elementals are awesome in 5mans. Most pulls are right in the sweet spot for chain lightning and nova totem to do maximal damage. Meanwhile everybody loves having totems around. Even if you're running with a resto shaman healing, that's just double the totems! I was often able to outdps even mages who out geared me thanks to cleave damage. 
---
However like others have said, mana is an issue. You'll need to spend a ton on drinks, slam them between every pull, you might even want to swap some dps gear for mp5 based on your options.
---
You will run into some skeptics from groups at first, but I've never seen a group not come around to the power of elemental in 5 mans.
---
I'm well aware of why it might be better, what i want to know is if it ACTUALLYbecomes better or if it is just a myth. Given most groups always brings 2-3 hunter 1-2 could be survival and the TSA could on one of the other hunters. If you count in the 100 AP x12 melee/tanks then MM will always win, but you dont need 3x TSA.
---
&gt;Yes, these additions caused me to stop playing because being the "best" didn't mean as much anymore
---
What do you mean? 
---
That was a helpful read, thank you. 
---
He probably dont understand that simple formulas such as how much AP you get from str, how much your spells scale with SP, etc were known for years now.
---
No, this is modern day wow for everyone. So when they announced that they're putting classic on this client using their cloud servers and that they might need to utilize sharding. My hopes for classic being just like vanilla died. No I'm just hoping I can somewhat enjoy the product they're going to make even if it's not as good as the one they put out 15 years ago.
---
Are you just trying to prove that casuals can still level to 60 or something 🤔
---
Someone watched the video of the rogue killing the two clueless mages that was posted earlier. 
---
He had deathwish and mortal strike, it was a bug and obviously overpowered
---
This post is very very cool, Just my own two cents on the classes I played:
---
**Warrior,** until lvl 60 on the official servers, Orc, Fury spec. I actually do not have much to say as I was quite the noob but:
---
* Leveling is not easy, as you have no heal to be able to chain mob. If you pull too much mobs or if one of them flee and comes back with 1-2-3 friends, you have to run for your life. 
---
* If you are Horde, you will be the only one wearing mail until lvl 40 and plate after that, pretty cool.
---
* In PvP, Mages (specially Frost) and Druid can kite you all day long. You have one in-combat charge and the PvP trinket to counter CC and that's it !
---
* As stated in the post by OP, only Defense Warrior are capable of tanking in the raids. 
---
**Shaman**, until lvl 60 on a private server, Orc, Restoration spec. The server guideline was to be as close as possible to 1.12, so the feedback is relevant. I played a lot of PvE and we cleaned every raid until I stopped at before the 4 horseman at Nax.
---
* I leveled with the enhancement spec, it was easier than my previous experience as a warrior because: Totems, heals, cure disease/poison, spirit wolf form. Also your totems are very useful in dungeon
---
* I joined a guild and we start doing PvE with big ambition, so I had to respec Restauration. The totems + chain heal are very powerful as mentioned by OP. Restauration is the only spell relevant in PvE for Shaman as Mage/demo are better as spellcaster, and Warrior/rogue are better at melee dps.
---
I never played a lot of PvP
---
Big advice, if you plan on playing high end raid, you need to have a character with Alchemist/Herbo as his jobs, because you need some elixir buff when you reach a certain level, it is simply mandatory.
---
Hope it helps!
---
&gt;We had so many battle ground feuds and even the world PvP nights.
---
Lol, the forum posts between the Thug Pug and literally all of the Horde lol, those ones stand out in my memory. 
---
&gt;I know it's cool to bitch about Pat running around with healer and buffs and what not
---
Haters gonna hate honestly, we have the gift of hindsight here and are able to point out every.thing he did wrong but back in the day, when we didn't have 14 years of try harding, Pat was a force to be reckoned with and, honestly, I think that as long as WoW is being played he'll be one of those players that's remembered, I mean, we're still talking about him 14 years later aren't we? 
---
Leveling speed is among the slower in my experience (I've levelled all classes several times through either vanilla or TBC, only tried paladin post xp change in TBC, just as a reference to how well I know leveling). I'd certainly say better than warrior simply because of a way easier time getting away from danger (less corpse runs) and stealth allowing you to skip a lot of stuff. The problem is you don't have mana. As a mana class you can kind of use both mana and health as resources and then both eat and drink to regain it. For example a mage can use less mana by using wand and taking some hits, or if low on hp burn more mana to save health. A rogue can't, they essentially only got one resource in terms of this.
---
As for premades, they really aren't strong. The biggest problem is they are reliant on CD's, and quite long at that. So once you blow them in the first fight you are useless for a long time. Also other classes like warrior becomes way stronger in a coordinated group with pocket healers, so the competition is way harder than in a wPvP situation. In random BG's you can just fool around and have fun jumping on people, but that doesn't say anything about viability, just that you can certainly have some fun in random BG as a rogue.
---
This. During the Blizzconn demo the Classic client downloaded and became a selectable option in the same list as the current Retail and PTR servers. The game also downloaded ahead of the start of the demo.
---
I'm leveling a holy --&gt; prot pally now. Tanking dungeons has been so much fun and very effective. Went straight for cons then moved to prot
---
I haven't played retail in about 5 years, but when I was working overseas I would get temp-banned all the time for connecting over a connection with a foreign IP. This was in 2010, so I'm sure they still have the capability to track that sort of thing.
---
I was also temp-banned for connecting with a VPN service with connection points in several locations - Blizzard interpreted the multiple connections with different source IPs as multiple people connecting to the same account,
---
I'm sure someone connecting from China to a NA server would raise some eyebrows.
---
Speaking of Jesus... Jesus Moria! I want Moria on LOTRO legendary servers. It's supposed to come earlier than WOW classic.
---
But what I really want, is Mirkwood...
---
or maybe beacuse wisps can't enter deeprun tram, I guess.
---
You’re assuming I’m playing horde, a warrior, and that I have friends? As well as that I won’t be RPing? I RPd back in vanilla. I was in a female only guild names Heavenly. 
---
We dont have much goals but to enjoy classic and Raid, maybe pvp. Time will tell how hard the Guild (We dont have a name yet) will go. We will accept every class at the moment due to our small amount of members. Just trying to build a small community of like minded people before the launch. To help each other out etc. Maybe even combine with  another guild with the same intentions.. As i said, time will tell.
---
&gt;No preorder crap
---
why not?

I could use the discount...

To solo DMN tribute runs on a hunter you would need blacksmithing (keys) or engineering (blast charges) to open that one locked door before the last hallway.

**&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction**:
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  We expect to progress through raid tiers in quick order.  
---
**What we Expect of Members**:
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.    
---
For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time.  We also expect raid members to be well read in our raid strategies and able to follow the raid leaders instructions. 
---
**Guild Culture:**
---
We want this guild to feel like home, as it did for the members who were part of the original KT guild!  We are committed to building a guild environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our server.  
---
**Raid Times:** 
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.  Sundays will drop off when content is on farm.

**Recruitment**:  
---
We are currently recruiting for all roles/classes, but especially hunters, rogues and warriors who go pew pew!   If you are interested in joining feel free to join our discord channel (invite above) or message Papacy#2992 or Drobu#2181 on discord with any questions.

Human Paladin? Wait a minute... 🤔
---
5 letters in “Human”... 7 letters in “Paladin”... the 5th of July! The 5th of July 2019 is a Friday... Hmm...
---
4 letters in “Train”... 4 days after Friday is... Tuesday! WoW originally launched on a Tuesday! *Today* is Tuesday! That must mean Classic WoW is going to be released TODAY!
---
Can you farm any wing of DM as a Warrior? Because I will be rolling with BS and Engi on one toon lolz.
---
No. Just know from watching others' guides.
---
Tbh they are one of the fastest but not THE fastest 
---
that means it's already going? Hmm, when is the last stop?
---
anyway, I thought it was a "scratching" animation, because the waiting is itchy and he cannot wait for a classic scratcher :Ð
---
I didn’t realize he was still going.. I didn’t go out of my way to RP but I enjoyed the guilds I was in that did. 
---
You know what it is? This guy is probably an ERPer. He just doesn’t want us bothering or talking away from his sweet sweet dirty talk and /me experience. Gross man. 
---
As warrior you can tank DME jump runs with a healer or a group of 3. Its good to have mining and enchanting in the group to DE the loot and mine the thorium in the exit tunnel.
---
Watch your launcher!
---
I always choose my race based on aesthetics, so if I manage to hit an optimal combination, it's purely accidental. 
---
Haven't set my choice in stone yet, but one thing is sure: Either Night Elf or Troll. And that, I think, precludes most of the optimal combos. 
---
Awesome if it works 
---
but blizzard probably wont let it =|

What about Lineage 2 classic?
---
For me it's way easier to build a route on my own everytime, responding to dynamically changing situation based on individual approach for each character. 
---
You don't need to precisely follow every step if doing that and you feel more involved to the game, and when your efforts starting to pay out it feels real good.
---
Not to mention it works better too. Because you know what? If you've decided to level-up your profession or do a dungeon or two, any thing that isn't listed to put it briefly, you are "exceeded" the allowed exp cap. The mobs that would be green will turn grey, you aren't doing high-lvl quests that you already can because you blindly follow the route, and even if you decide to skip and find the appropriate level you would miss some pre-quests because again, it isn't YOUR WAY.
---
That is the first "rule of thumb" btw, if the quests starting to turn red, don't bother doing them even if your class/spec can, it's better to switch to the other same level zones and catch up there, before it's too late and the "early" mobs/quests already grey. You usually can divide each zone with early/mid/late and, as a special WoW flavor, "Elite" parts. STV is a perfect example. You would miss the hunter's camp EXP if you aren't there in time, yet the chain is so long that it's relevant for 15 levels. 
---

^The only "helper" thingy you'll ever need. You can find some "hidden" quests that you haven't done (for Wetlands it's gonna be a drowned dwarf, you'll bring sad news to his wife, and 15 min speedrun to Southshore most likely), see the required/supposed levels for each quests and rewards if you like to aim for something specific.
---
I am planning to play a Human Warlock on a PVP server.
---
I have always played horde and I want to experience the grind as Alliance, and I just can't imagine playing gnome.
---
What about Vedic and his mage? He was destroying 2 or 3 Level 60 players in wpvp with his mage. I watched a video yesterday and was just bummed out of how much I suck at wpvp with my mage.
---
[First video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA)
---
[Second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk)
---
There's more where that came from too.
---
Well, the point of my post was to show how it is more complicated than a general "x amount of agility means SV is better". It also depends on your group.
---
Now, I actually once did a full calculations that almost certainly showed it is never going to be better unless you already have full coverage of TSA from other hunters. My math involved some assumptions, though. I looked at the dps increase you get from *all* sources, meaning both AP and crit from LR, crit from KI and things like losing RWS from MM. I calculated all together to a dps. In regards to TSA I looked at how much AP it could grant in total if the whole group is buffed by TSA and uses AP. Now, here comes the important assumption: when calculating how much dps this AP translates to I calculated it in terms of how much dps *the hunter* would get. In reality that is *not* correct, since a warrior will gain more dps from the same amount of AP due to scaling differences. You needed like, BiS gear to make LR better, and even then it's only just - taking into account that my assumption makes TSA look a little bit worse than it is I concluded you will never optimally use SV if you can get full benefit from TSA.
---
So no, not a finite answer, but I'd say just stick to MM. I actually plan to do a full on out calculation, taking everything into consideration and I'll probably post it on this sub. Look out for it!

This is not a good build. You said in the original post that you have zero interest in PvP, but then you picked up Blackout, Unbreakable Will, and Improved Inner Fire. These are three PvP talents that do nothing for you in raiding and very little for you in dungeons. If you plan to raid, you need to look at each talent you pick and ask yourself 1) What it does for your raid team and 2) What other talents that you could pick instead would do more to help your raid team. The two biggest reasons to bring a discipline priest are 1) Divine Spirit and 2) Power Infusion, both of which are missing here. \[Any priest can have Improved Power Word: Fortitude, so I don't mention that specifically for Disc priests.\]
---
You really need Divine Spirit and Improved Power Word: Fortitude. They are too powerful to pass up. For raiding, you won't get a debuff slot for Shadow Word: Pain unless you have Darkness and Shadowform. You especially won't get a debuff slot for Vampiric Embrace if you don't go through to Improved Vampiric Embrace, Darkness, and Shadowform.
---
Shadow priest is already an incredibly mana hungry spec. With zero points in holy, you won't have enough mana to heal (even if you are ONLY healing and not spending any mana on dps), but you picked the spec that costs the most mana to do damage, leaving you with even bigger mana problems when you try to be a hybrid. Furthermore, when you are dpsing with Shadow, you are wasting mana on all of those spells you cast that get resisted because you didn't take Shadow Focus. Then when you run out of mana two minutes into a twenty minute fight, you are even more worthless because you didn't take Wand Specialization. How are you going to heal effectively without any points in Divine Fury? If you want to do damage, why put 30 points in discipline without any points in Force of Will?
---
&gt;I pick up every damage/mana/healing talent in the two trees.
---
You didn't, though.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
You can do all of the content regardless of combination anyways, I think racials are best viewed as bonuses rather than essentials.
---
Fear Ward is not a needed mechanic. Ppl still down bosses without it. Fear Ward just makes certain fights more easier/less of a neck pain.
---
Stoneform is also amazing, but the 10% armor is pretty meh and there's a potion that can remove poisons. So Stoneform isn't needed either, it just makes things easier. 
---
I don't think it's difficult at all, it says what game and server they're on for me.
---
check kargoz video he breaks down duo's combo in depth and rates them. mainly for leveling, but usually if classes synergies its all the way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4
---
I can tell you the most annoying, uncomfortable thing for leveling is different speed of the characters (before mounts). So either pick both classes that travel fast, or both which are slow. 
---
Hmmm. Seems like I would be going for either Priest or Druids. While it does feel good for me to top charts, I just want to be useful and enjoy the dynamics of raids. Only reason why I want to be a shaman is it has the ability for me to drop countless totems which are fun. 
---
Would racials factor in which Priest works well?
---
Thank you for the extensive response!
---
Not really a class to race meta breaker. BUT i will however be playing a boomkin (which certainly isn't Meta according to the private server geniuses) for both PvE and PvP, always mained balance druid, so much fun for me, and that's all that matters to me!
---
Place a light well next to a warlock in a raid and they will use it consistently to replenish mana. Adds a huge damage boost to them under the right circumstances.
---
Ya, hes in T6. 
---
ClassicTBC confirmed /s
---
He made a 16 min video about the previous blue post. 
---
Only reasing I'm going enchanting is because the smoking heart of the mountain.
---
There is an item that drops from the dust stormers in Westfall - I believe it's something that can blind your opponent in PvP.
---
I'm 90% sure I'm going to main an Ally Lock as well. Couldn't decide gnome or human so I asked myself "what's going to bother me more? The looks of a gnome or knowing that I can only be 95% as powerful as I could potentially be."
---
I would suggest rolling gnome. We have Noggenfogger and Deviant Fish for this.
---
Hey guys it's Tips *proceeds to right click report a player for tea bagging* 
---
Tauren for Dad mode
---
Undead for edgy asshole mode 
---
That's a strange way to say rogue t3 set.
---
Starshards is awesome though
---
This is a side track, and I honestly approve of your decision to play balance in pve. At the same time, I will argue against bringing balance druids in my guild. This is nothing personal - you may be that one exception that would be worth bringing. Sadly, there will be many disappointed balance druids out there come classic.
---
Just remember that most of us had their first raid on group loot, and like half of the group were clicking need on everything
---
haha how I remember that. Before people learned what "master loot" is
---
As your leveling make a list of everyone who ganks you. Once you hit max and have full t3 it's your turn to gank them.
---
The hunter has become the hunted.
---
^ This is some good advice.
---
I played a Gnome Warlock in Vanilla and will be back this summer to it. 
---
How was my experience in Vanilla? Well, my guild was nooby too so barely anyone wanted health stones nor summons (GM made everyone show up themselves), so I am worried about the potential Soul Shard farming. Outside that, in PvP vs Undead I was upset back then but I always just prematurely casted a second Fear when dealing with an Undead, and it was not as bad as you would think as Fear was likely to break before full duration anyway due to the damage in 1v1 situations. One underrated advantage of playing Alliance Warlock is that you are more likely to be the god outside IF winning duels.
---
I played a Night Elf Priest recently. I was OK with no Fear Ward. I was OK with no human spirit buff. The thing I completely forgot was no Desperate Prayer either. That is a pretty big deal in PvP. The cool combo of Shadowmeld + MC was very rarely useful either, but cool I guess. At least I had that booty. I also got daily whispers about how bad NE was as Priest. My tip to you: Screenshot every time you get a whisper about this and make a salt compilation.
---
Doing all that work for an armor set and having it smashed onto that little model is to much for me. 
---
Just google the tier 1 and tier 2 gnome warlock sets... Just, ugh...
---
Your post is how I lvled my first lvl 60. A rogue with 26 days /played when I dinged. I helped out friends, went on adventures, world PvPed a lot. It was great.
---
The 1-60 content is only a grind if you want it to be, it's also one of the best gaming experiences you can have if you let it.
---
I assume a server list will be provided before launch, so I’d advise reaching out to friends then to settle on a server. 
---
It’s a crapshoot though. Once you pick the server, your life is in Blizzard’s hand for how they manage dying servers, etc.
---
Hah true. I watched the video again too and there are definitely some moments of play we'd consider bad now, but at the time it was awesome. I'm also getting a bit defensive because I'm at max nostalgia and played with Pat a lot so I gotta defend him haha.
---
I will be powerleveling like a madman this time. It’s the first time, and I used to be an extreme case of ”smell the roses” mentality. Now I m the opposite. This is how it goes
---
This is actually super helpful. Good job man
---
used to play it a lot like 2 years ago
---
This is the common answer, but there are not many combos you can’t make work. 
---
Rats at level one: the bane of the Nerevarine
---
I think a lot of modern WoW players will enter the game, thinking they know everything and brag about how "pro" they are.....then get very angry that everything isn't given to them on a plate and they actually have to work for rewards.
---
From personal experience on pservers (I'm a noob too) I noticed that when some people ask for advice or help on the general chat, people are sometimes mean to them. Not helpful at all. And not to mention telling people to figure it out themselves or to google what to do.
---
While I do know people can google everything, I like to socialize with people and ask for help or advice or whatever. If I need to find something for a quest it'd be nice if there are helpful people. Don't want to search for a youtube video on how to do it. Takes away the social part of the game. Which is what retail did.
---
There’s no reason not to level as shadow. Leveling as anything other than shadow is strictly worse. Once you get near level cap, you can swap to whatever you want.
---
&gt;GM made everyone show up themselves
---
Seriously why is summoning the whole raid even a thing?  It should be like 5-10 summons at most for people who had to get some last minute consumables or were running late.
---
99% sure that the most people advocating for early AV are private server players.
---
More of a pvp guy, but plan on doing all raids in vanilla and BC if it progresses that far.
---
Strongly considering Human over dwarf just because perception is so good in TBC arenas, and they are also the best pve melee in vanilla. 
---
Basically old WoW is returning in all its glory. 
---
5 Auto attacks, 5 Seal of Righteousness procs. All those 10 hits having a chance to trigger Maelstrom Trinket, Shadoiw Oil, Chili and Weapon procs.
---
You are right, paladins are just retarded for thinking 6k instant burst damage is good.
---
From what I hear, locks don't often wear their full teir sets. (Exception to t3)
---
Your probably going to be wearing a lot of pre raid bis gear that looks ugly anyways. (Bloodvine Set) 
---
I also heard that t1 for locks is worse than most pre raid bis gear. Not sure on which patch/patches that applies.
---
Ive heard about this in countdown to classic, dont remember the episode, but in theory different ranks of SoC stacks, so it could make pve paladins viable. Of course, first we have to test it first if it works.
---
Did anyone try it in the demo? 
---
Yep, it depends what your aim is really. Druids have so many variations on their talent specs depending on wether you want to PvP, play pve DPS, focus on tanking or whatever, with slightly different builds depending on which one.
---
He has claimed his route is much better now.  No time information was provided though.
---
Lvl 60 in 5 days played &gt; having fun
---
Also, if you find it fun.  Do the dungeons and their quest lines.  That alone will take almost all of the grind out of Joanas guide.
---
It'll be interesting to see the reception the four groups of players have to classic:
---
Group 1: played vanilla
---
Group 2: didn't play vanilla but played private servers
---
Group 3: didn't play vanilla but played retail 
---
Group 4: never played wow at all before
---
Oooooor you can just heal?
---
Ready for downvotes!
---
Yes there are specific aoe spots obviously , that's what I said, plus you can't really start aoe grinding until at least level 21 and that's if you rush the blizzard talent straight up.
---
Also if dynamic respawn is enabled and you find you're sharing the spot with a mage  you shouldn't be dividing the area but grouping up with them instead and pulling the ENTIRE thing, you get more exp fully clearing the plateau or area rather than splitting the area and trying to tip toe your way around mobs spawning from the other mage's clear, not to mention mages compliment each other due to talents and added novas minimizing risk of doing mistakes, you also position in a way that by the time the pack is going to die you are at the edge of the area where you can drink without bodypulling the respawns.
---
I get you, balance dps is on the low side, but PvP always has been my primary thing to do, casually and rated. The fact that i might have to gear up as resto doesn't scare me, it will only enhance the sense of accomplishment, once fully geared, and ready to melt people in wpvp/BGs. I don't wanna be the 8th warlock or warrior in the raid (no disrespect to those), i wanna prove people that bringing a boomie can benefit the raid. Whether it'll be through decurses, off heals, sick dps on short fights or even stealthed farm runs. 
---
tldr; play what you want lol.
---
link doesn't work
---
Old friendlist should still work though?
---
[Barrens.chat](https://Barrens.chat) is getting better and better. You've made a great forum, and the design is really good. I hope more people start to call it home as Classic rolls out. Good luck!
---
Which link is that friend?
---
Any sensible guild will impose some penalties on players who need a summon every single raid.
---
I originally chose to play a Night Elf Rogue back in 2004, then leveled up a Human Paladin followed by a Dwarf Priest. As much as I want to play a Rogue again, I will be trying out Druid this go around.
---
I know that it will not be the same type of experience as my original Vanilla leveling, but I look forward to being able to potentially flag carry in WSG, tank dungeons, have travel form, and heal in end game content. Druid really does seem like a good fit for what I want to do this go around, despite being a jack of all trades, master of none.
---
You can say you got hacked if they logged on, sold everything and logged off. If they level you in any way then you're out of luck. 
---
Both methods exist, just do what works for you!
---
120 hours of not having fun. Thats a lot of time
---
&gt; Did anyone try it in the demo?
---
Yes. Me and a friend both made Paladins and tried exactly this. Applying a higher rank of JoCru to the target would overwrite the previous rank. If applying it a lower rank when a higher rank was already active it would extend the duration of the original judgement.
---
You shouldn't be having downtime from healing yourself in the first place.
---
i think if we replace the word leave with abandon we get his meaning.
---
Close, however "train" is 5 letters:
---
Classic release tomorrow confirmed!
---
NOOB!
---
It was dead when I first checked it out. Glad it's picked up because it's a good design and the owner obviously put some work into it. Starting a forum community from scratch isn't easy.
---
Farming Rugged leather will be important on a fresh server because everyone will want bags.
---
That hill between BFD and the alliance town. Favorite spot for low level pvp in the game, by far.
---
and mages
---
And I would text back B.T.B., Bring That Booty. -Darryl Philbin
---
Best animations, tier sets and class fantasy. Me too
---
I'm curious, since which expansion are you playing moonlit and what specifically do you enjoy about it? Some classes/specs changed massively over the years in playstyle. I played some moonkin on my druid alt (mainly feral and healer though) on a pserver.
---
Ran into the wrong portal once after a wipe. The group disband after that one :(
---
Considering female Undead Warlock as opposed to Orc simply for the superior animations 
---
I honestly think/hope it will be a good contender for the WoW Official forums. I personally like the art style a heck of a lot more than the modern Battle.Net one, and the people there are far less toxic than those on the official forums. 
---
Eh, several months ago I left a comment saying his videos are getting pretty bad and got downvoted into oblivion. Why it always takes so long for people to realize something's not right?
---
There is a lot of spot to farm but they are pretty much all well know so you might be facing some competition.
---
Satyr in Ashara / Felwood drop felcloth, mana/healing potion, runecloth and some greys item that can sell for some gold.
---
Earth elemental in Badlands drop Elemental Earth.
---
You can group farm Eko's in Winterspring (bonus if you're mining as you can loot some arcane crystal)
---
Never tried this one but I heard that there is a pretty good spot in Felwood with wolf that you can chain kill with nearly no downtime as they repop quite fast and are in large number, for this one you'll gain money from skinning and grey items
---
Reuploaded version of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMCZSCawFc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMCZSCawFc)
---
Youtube banned that for using AC/DC song :-/
---
P.S. What class/spec you're wanna see next?
---
I really feel like this should be more upvoted than it is. It is an interesting read with a different perspective on what class to choose, and I know that is a question a lot of people, my self included, are struggling with.
---
I think you just posted it when everyone was going to sleep and it slipped under the radar. And possibly the title was too boring? I would try reposting this later and see if it gains more traction.
---
This is really great! Thanks :-)
---
The amount of work you put into this is amazing, well done.
---
This should be like stickied or something, especially for newbies in Classic :) 
---
Healing pets is a waste of mana in raids. 
---
"Just git gud scrub" - every max level who ganks in redridge. 
---
Now you can enjoy a free clear with no mechanics 
---
Warriors, any spec, that refuse to tank when needed are the worst trash you find among players to be honest.
---
If Blizzard doesn't release individual realm forums then it would definitely be something to consider to keep a leg up. Realm forums were half the fun of vanilla.
---
Oh great, now I’m a damn Shaman
---
Stop lying, he will never be close to holy as disc. People use optimal  spe for a reason, they're much better
---
Thank you :)
---
You can tank any raid in the entire game as a Druid, except for maintanking a handful of bosses so dont worry about that. You have superior mitigation from armor, high dodge, and unmatched threat output while at the same sharing very little gear with the two other warrior (presumably) tanks, which means your MT and second offtank will have more gear faster to aid in progression.
---
[Wow-pro.com](https://Wow-pro.com) still hosts Jame' Alliance leveling guide from pre-Cata. It has a few quest that were added post-2.0, but it's still over 95% accurate and has a pretty efficient leveling route.
---
It is indeed hard though, that's the entire point of my post. The spots are not as ubiquitous as you claim and I feel like you are making generalizations and assumptions without having done it yourself. How many mages have you leveled on high pop pservers? I have leveled 2 mages on servers with dynamic respawns and am speaking from experience on how the competition for spots works. There are some good guides online that describe all of the viable aoe spots by level. The earliest you can really start doing it is around 28 at the worgen camp in southwest duskwood. Your point about grouping together doesn't work most of the time either due to the solo nature of the people competing for spots. They are also oftentimes Russian or Chinese and will not communicate at all. Hopefully the experience is different for live classic servers, I just wanted to chime in as someone who has lived through this twice and clarify the info for anyone else reading and planning their characters.
---
Enhance sham can be quite squishy as they use 2H weapon and are low on mana but elem sham wear a shield in top of a mail gear, they can throw more than one heal before going oom and have one of the most powerfull burst in vanilla. The only disadvantage is their low mobility but that can easily be fixed if you properly use your totem, positioning, ghost wolf and (engi) trinket 
---
If you end a fight with surplus mana you're wasting healing output.
---
Expect the authentic experience of playing an M.M.O.R.P.G., and not simply an online game with numbers floating, and effect procs. The class identity is really strong, it's not just dumbed down to the typical 3 roles, but rather 9 classes that all do something different and complete each other. (For exemple, the druid is more of a "support healer", the paladin a strong "mono target healer", and the shaman the best "multi target healer".)
---
The MMO aspect is really important too. You won't go far away alone. Be sure to take your time to talk to people, make friends, at any levels, during dungeons or even before playing Classic.
---
The leveling feels like an adventure, exploration and group content is glorified. Don't feel like the game is a rush, take your time  to explore, and enjoy the content. Unlike most of the MMORPGs, Classic is not based around max level content, everything is enjoyable, and level 20 dungeons require to focus and organize as much as level max dungeons, both are equally fun. Low level world PvP, crafting, gathering etc are all revealant at all levels. Take your time to discover the world.
---
One of the only drawbacks is that not all specs are viable for every content. Balance druids, elemental shamans, in example, fall out of mana quickly in raids, or prot paladins simply can't keep the aggro if they compete with 39 other players on one target. Even if they are "not viable" in raids, almost all the specs can be played in dungeons or PvP/Battlegrounds etc (you can still have a few ones on a raid group but finding a spot is much harder).
---
The only thing I'd recommand is to check what are the viable specs in raids, if that's what you're aiming for. You can still level up characters to find the class that fits you.
---
Boomkins aren't the worst ASSUMING guilds use them right. Different encounters require a different number of healers. A boomkin who is willing to heal on heal limited encounters and dps when the healing team doesn't need the extra support (think faster trash pulls) is quite valuable, particularly given they are another source of innervate. I'd never bring them along as a pure dps slot, but I could see running 1 resto druid and 1 boomkin vs 2 resto druids as a net win.
---
same, but also I will level warlock as well, because reasons.
---
Druid main from vanilla till Legion here, I'll probably not do it again. Been messing around with druid a lot on pservers and honestly I don't like them in vanilla. TBC did so incredibly much to improve all the specs that I can't go back to vanilla druids.
---
Ele shaman then boomkin
---
Because assuming your guild is not made up by idiots, they can see the value in having 2 Warriors and 1 Druid as tanks instead of having to split all the tank gear between 3 warriors while giving the druid tank gear to rogues for PvP.
---
[Progressive itemization with patch-by-patch breakdown](https://itemization.github.io)
---
that's great but you haven't answered the question at all
---
It's a good thing the tank is usually the groups leader with the power to remove players from the group then.
---
Lol @ people afraid to play private servers
---
Hmm...but wouldnt my totems buff my party enough to make up for my dps loss?
---
What I mean is maybe I will do 10% less damage, but maybe my totems will increase someone else's damage by 10% that it will equal out. Ya know?
---
&gt;Progressive itemization with patch-by-patch breakdown
---
How could I have forgotten this? Added.
---
Love your work and have been referencing it in other guides on the site already.
---
You're actually implying you ever end progression fights in Vanilla with a surplus as a healer? That's rich
---
&gt;  but I could see running 1 resto druid and 1 boomkin vs 2 resto druids as a net win.
---
No.  I play a resto Druid on a pvt server, my guild broke up last week and I had my pick of most guilds on the server.  All these guilds had 1 resto druid and wanted a second.
---
Also I mean there will be dwarf priests around anyway
---
&gt;He tells me that if they keep it true vanilla (no sharding), then to let him know because he wants to play. 
---
Wow an imaginary conversation with a random co-worker who shares the same over blown niche concern as this sub? Yeah I'm sure this happened, lawl.
---
I asked my mom what she was going to roll when classic releases. She is so far the only one that havent answered with positivity or a concrete plan of what they are going to play. 
---
I know some  4-5 people that was too caught up in IRL to hear about classic that is going to play for sure. I'm alone bringing my partner and my two sisters. The amount of people that want a fantasy world to run around in is huge. Most worlds feels predetermined and things put there for your benefit. For some reason I dont feel the same about world of warcraft, it really feels like the **world** of wacraft and not the video game of warcraft
---
My partner is very picky about graphics. She dropped her jaw when she first created her character and saw teldrassil. Making me even more sure that its going to be a wide success.
---
That sounds like the bystander effect to me. You can't assume that every priest will be a dwarf, especially if your thinking of rolling something different. 
---
What is good about mind flay though is it slows the enemy as it is pathing towards you, so you take less damage in the long run. Also you want to front load spells. If you use mind blast last then you don't regen mana for 5 seconds after killing a mob, which is right where your spirit tap procs, so it is better to kill them while wanding. Also you wand when they get to you because their melee attacks will push back your spells, whereas wanding suffers no pushback.
---
I want to see Smite Priest with the stacked Judgement of Crusader. Because if that is worthwhile you can make whole raid compositions arround retri Paladins and Smite Priests instead of Furry Warriors and Mages.
---
What about it?
---
Yo Teeb, it's Slud!
---
barrens.chat is the best btw
---
The Warlock pet macros are helpful. There are other Warlock specific macros that should probably be added such as the stop casting shadowburn macro. I also think I remember a macro that would manage bag space with soul shards because they do not stack in Vanilla. Nice resource for new classic players. Thanks!
---
&gt; It was programmed that way.
---
In TBC. There is 0% chance of this working in Classic.
---
Not really. Shred does deal higher damage than Claw, but the main advantage of the Druid is that you literally have no downtime, can take on elites, get dungeon groups instantly and can avoid almost any world PvP encounter you dont want to fight.
---
The difference between Claw and Shred should not really matter that much on your overall leveling speed.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I can only assume that OP explained this issue to him otherwise his story is horse shit for sure.  
---
I don't think that's he *really* meant by that comment, cause he goes on to talk about the dungeon finder specifically.
---
It has nothing to do with hardcore vs casual, it has to do with giving up all our convenient QOL changes.
---
And we still know we want it, because those changes destroyed the community of the game.
---
Casual players don't *have* to grind anything in Vanilla if they don't want to but they will still get a much better experience community wise than in retail. 
---
I would never put up with that time vampirism. Summon yourself. Don´t know about healthstones. I don´t see players handing out firepots or mana for everyone so why is a warlock expected to give these out? It requires time to farm them same as farming mats for other consumables. 
---
No, we're just waiting. Plenty of things to organize till then :))
---
That would be awesome lol
---
Ret is viable guys
---
It's hilarious that in a thread devoted to not min/max'ing and just playing what you enjoy, you immediately respond to someone telling them they're wrong for playing the race they want to play.
---
Maybe you care if you could never hit that extra few percentage points of maximized damage, but a lot of people don't. It's not like Vanilla content requires people to be optimized to that extreme. It's unnecessary. You play your play style, others will play theirs. 
---
Paladin leveling is one of the most consistent and simple experiences that I can think of. After I got my Rogue to 60 in retail vanilla, I leveled a Paladin and it was such a stark contrast in effort. It was almost like I had to TRY to die instead of trying to survive.
---
The ability to heal yourself and others, have great buffs, block with shields and higher armor for mitigation...the only thing that you'll have to worry about is finding the time to level. Since you already stated that you want a slow and steady kind of leveling experience, it should fit perfectly.
---
I suggest finding and befriending a mage for free water/food, but since you don't need to save up for your level 40 mount, it isn't super necessary. I would still save up as much gold as you can to help with the level 60 mount [quest](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_the_Charger_quest_chain) as it will still take some time, gold, and lots of effort to get. I will say that it's TOTALLY worth it.
---
Seal of Crusader -&gt; Judgement -&gt; Seal of Righteousness -&gt; Consecration (if talented) -&gt; Judgement (1-3 seconds left of SoR) would be a basic rotation that you rinse and repeat. I don't remember fully what the "best" build would be, but [this build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AsMQBD_P8QQCPIA) would be a decent starting point as it covers a good deal of what you're needing for tanking.
---
Please just remember to have fun. That is key to playing any game, and I believe that Paladins have a great chance of remaining fun throughout as long as you're not trying to speed run to 60.
---
Took a break while leveling last night to help some people do green quests in STV.  Small group running around (no mounts QQ) doing random quests, skirmishing with other ally groups (and a few corpse runs, not too proud to admit).  A very pleasant way to spend an hour before I go to bed.  Not every play session has to be focused on "gotta get 6 bubbles and go to bed!"
---
&gt;This was never Vanilla behavior.
---
[Citation needed]
---
I've played balance druid through all expansions. I like how  balance  feels unique compared to all the other casters (except hunter). And just the feel and HUGE kit that druids have. Another class that i enjoy immensely is Hunters, Marksmanship in particular. Never was fond of melees, although i did main a ret pala through MoP. But yeah, balance druid has always been fun to me, it peaked in WotLK/cata for me tho, those were the highlights of my pvp and pve career, damn i miss those times. Vanilla will do for me tho.
---
Yeah I mean horde players weren't stuck on Onyxia for the duration of Vanilla WoW. If your players are good then not having the dwarf racial isn't going to break you.
---
Well not ever priest needs to be a dwarf, you only really need two and could get by easily with just one so
---
I'll invite anyone to group for what ever role so long as they arent brain dead and/or a shitter i'll invite them back. 
---
I think you've convinced me. I was contemplating priest as I know I want to heal, but the flexibility of a druid is not to be ignored. Plus, great flag carriers in WSG :)
---
I fall under played like a 3 months of TBC, was just a stupid kid and my computer couldn’t run wow. Now want to really play WoW but don’t want to ruin the experience early by playing a ps 
---
&gt;leveling a warrior isnt slow its hard
---
It's objectively the slowest class to level after rogue. Just because someone got third fastest 60 (got a source btw?) doesnt really mean anything. Just means nobody else tried to speedlevel the other classes.
---
Hearthstone healed in vanilla? That’s a new one. 
---
I’m a RuneScape player who came back for the release of Old School RuneScape. The devs at JaGex thought the game mode would die out after 6-12 months. It’s now been 5 years + the player base has over taken the main game and the dev team has gone form about 3 mods to 20+
---
Tbh, I can see WoW classic going the same way. It has a similar demographic and equally devoted audience who have the same complaints as we did, before the Old School version was released.
---
I’m pretty burnt out of RS atm and looking forward to playing classic as I never had the chance to play back in the day due to potato pc (hence RuneScape).
---
I also mained Druid from TBC-present. I want to keep faithful to the class but vanilla druids are something entirely different. So I’m going with their nature cousin class, burst-daddy Shaman
---
I know and I feel you but I’m planning to go full chill mode 
---
the most underrated class easily
---
SFK only two or three times?! *laughs in dagger rogue*
---
Crushing blows deal 150% of regular damage. Druids are armor capped so it's not a concern. The real issue is getting crit multiple times in a row, but when you dodge 1/3 hits against you and got 12k hp it's not a big concern either.
---
Didn't want to write any longer then I had to. There was a lot in the conversation in which I explained my concerns.
---
Idk, all I want is to be able to add a Note to each friend, so I can write down how I got to know them. Many times you have a great experience with someone, you add them as a friend but later it gets lost in your friends list.
---
Awesome. Great job Teeb
---
I did not tell him what he should or should not play. That is his decision, not mine. I used the words "I suggest" very literally. I am not going to dictate what character he wants to roll.
---
Because pre orders are todays bane. Pretty much every pre order ends up being half completed buggy mess, that may or may not need fixing. This was not such a problem when you got reviews before you bought said items, and would buy or not buy after reading at least the initial reviews, instead of buying three months before release because the idea sounds nice or the ingame engine footage seems good.. 
---
This is so wrong. Rejuv is most of the time just going to result in overhealing. Healing Touch really is your bread and butter skill and you use multiple ranks combined with regrowths.
---
Thanks for this!
---
Must not have been a lot of good druids on Nost then. And who the hell cares about healing meters anyway. It means absolutely nothing in a raid setting. It's all about who you heal at what time. Rejuvenating the entire raid to heal up random damage that would have gotten healed up by a paladin flashing anyway is a complete waste when you could be spending your globals doing more useful things.
---
I hate when I see people who aren’t lw skinning at max level. It takes away my form of income. There was a mage on pservers who would sell devilsaur sets and he couldn’t even make them. I never knew why lwers would do that. Stop helping someone take gold out of your pocket. 
---
I find that it’s usually mages. Go aoe farm! 
---
They're all cake compared to enchanting.  
---
There really isn't any other way 😭
---
Damn classic models were ugly
---
Well, a healer shaman can provide that too, but yeah true
---
newsflash, you can overheal a shit-ton and still be effective, in fact, it's necessary as a druid because other classes like paladins and priests will beat you with their primary heal in every race.
---
i was a top 3 r druid on nost and anathema. In MC and BWL you pretty much cast rejuv until you're OOM, and then continue with HT3 or HT4. In later content, you pace yourself a bit more, but always roll Rejuvs and mid-rank regrowths on tanks, especially with t3 set-bonuses.
---
&gt; how many raided
---
Thats the point? WoW is a world, and like the real world, not everyone should hold a "top position".
---
Most guilds bring enough shamans to buff all melees dps, so at most you would provide 20% less threat and a bit of mana regen to your group, which honestly is not nearly enough. 
---
Hell yes! Fury warrior, Blazefury medallion, Thunderfury and Fiery Retributer, the trinket off Wyrmthalak and DMC:Maelstrom and full SP gear or barring Thunderfury it'll be green "Of fiery wrath" pieces.
---
COME AT ME BRO!
---
I would like Shedo's YouTube guide if you could. Spreadsheet is nice, but we need something to help people go feral productively
---
I will make it legal!
---
Fantastic! 6.5/10 for this outstanding work!
---
If everyone's a millionaire, it has no meaning.
---
Imagine claiming you were the top 3 druid on Nostalrius and not even being able to figure this out.
---
Let's see. There's a huge aoe incoming in the melee group. You hot everyone there, the aoe hits. Because there is zero damage coming in the next 20 seconds, you can let your hots heal the players back to full. Instead, all the melee get sniped by Paladins wanting to top the meters.
---
"How lol" lmao.
---
What’s the best way to get bags for a reasonable price? Have a guildmate make them?
---
1. Assless chaps!
---
Solid 
---
Nope.
---
Wildstar tried doing a "hardcore mmo" and it failed miserably, going F2P in less than a year. Oldschool MMOs with high difficulty and tons of grinding are a very niche market. Classic will not be "popular" or have any sort of large playerbase comparable with other modern online games.
---
I'd be surprised if we had 200-300k subs after a year or so.
---
&gt; cant fault them for making money
---
Um, yes you can? Can you fault the mob for makong money? Yes, because they are doing shady shit. "Making money" isnt an excuse for...anything.
---
Some people say you can’t go back home anymore ...

dope work as per teeb!

This.

If it works (and even if it doesn't at first it might be developed) then WeakAuras does exactly what you are looking for!
---
I'm enjoying shaman restro in pvp has so many spells I don't have enough keybinding for all of then lol
---
Not sure where to put myself. I did play some vanilla but not beyond like level 20 or so. Didn't play it for real until Nost.
---
Non-video format?  Just you wait until the buzzards on YouTube rip this apart for several videos a piece, each 10:01 in length
---
AMEN! Lol
---
Speed leveling is fun to some people. 
---
Shapeshifting costs a lot of mana especially while you're leveling as feral cuz you won't have much intel gear on you.
---
Be cautious with your shapeshifting and you're ready for a slaughter fest 
---
DRUID MAFIA: The under dogs of vanilla WOW
---
Yup.
---
That's how I remember it. Better that way.
---
I'm not an expert, but I have leveled 2 druids on pservers before. I don't recall how much I actually pvp'd though.
---
If you spec into something pvp-ish you should be quite strong. I'd recon something like this at 39. Start with feral until you have charge and feline swiftness, then get the 5 points in resto and continue feral. At 24 points you start going feral to get omen of clarity and shapeshifter.
---
Anyway so what can you? Well cats do quite decent burst damage opening up on people, you can probably kill any mage with ease by shifting out of nova's. Hunter and warlock you probably don't have the burst to actaully kill before dots or pet wear you down. Warrior you can end up in a bear to man fight that you will probably win with bash heal. 
---
Doesn't seem all too bad :) Anyway you can always run away if you are having a hard time :P
---
They are the premier class for alt tabbing and looking at porn while you grind.
---
I don't know how people hate on him so much. Lol
---
It's exactly like you say. 
---
Go prot, use gear that inflict damage when getting hit, aoe grind
---
I will make 3 characters on classic launch. A bank/AH one, a farmer and a main character.
---
The bank character will probably stay on 5 for \*very\* long, maybe i'll get it to 35 at some point, but I'am not sure.
---
The farmer will \*grind\* to 60. By grind I mean I'll mostly stop questing at around lvl 20 and just find nice spots where I can kill 1 or max 2 mob types continuously like a robot (hopefully more effective), skin and loot them until they don't give enough exp anymore, rinse and repeat. I have a few farming spots in mind already. This one will hit 60 in a very short /played time and will generate \*a lot\* of gold, but won't be socially connected, won't have much reputation in any faction. Will very likely be a BM hunter.
---
The third character will be my main. I played many different ones to find out which one I like best and I settled on Shaman. As a healer I will prepare dungeon quests and clear them a couple of times with good players. This is the character that I use to figure out who's who on the server, to find a fitting guild or to even build up my own. Since I have a farming character this one can level professions in large chunks and while leveling effectively. It will be slower in terms of /played, but it is important to find the right people to spend the endgame with.

Itll be part of the battle.net launcher and i really have no clue why anyone would think otherwise?
---
What about over healing?
---
Ofc it does. Peeps just gunna bitch. 
---
If anything it further enforces playing with honest and decent players and forces u to friend and party with them. 
---
Obviously you can't force people, but it's laughable that they're not willing to do so.
---
20 is easy. I think 30-40 is the big hurdle. Once you get your mount though, you're golden.
---
becoz thats how that fight works, evryone gets constant damage, so you want your healing output to be constant too and not spikey with a lot of crit. your theory is cool and all, but in reality its just not ideal. you also want to have access to good holy novas in case you need a very quick heal, which would also be worse with 8/8.
---
i healed vael countless times as a priest, 8/8 t1 is just shit for that fight compared to wearing prebis.
---
Exactly what I've been looking for. Not only gives the info I need but helps scratch the Classic itch for late night reading.
---
Thanks for this :) 
---
Leveling hunters say hello
---
I'm hoping for klingon 
---
Since you seem knowledgeable, why the Lol? My biggest concern with private servers is the lack of reliability, why put in vanilla wow effort if the server could go under the day I hit 60?
---
Slam/Flurry spec is still better, just not as good as it is on pservers.
---
Alliance side,  you want to be a dwarf - period. Dwarves receive fear ward, which is amazing. 
---
Horde side is a toss up.  Trolls have a slight edge with berserking (faster cast time buff)  in a raid environment. 
---
If you have pvp interest, the above races are also great:
---
- Dwarves can stoneform to remove poisons,  bleeds, and diseases.  Also receive an instant cast heal,  but it's medium cooldown and only targets self.  
---
- undead have will of the forsaken,  to remove sleep,  charm,  fear. Racial spell is a disease that does damage over time to enemy and heals you. 
---
- trolls have berserking, a 20% healing debuff curse, and a retributive shield that scales very well.
---
Brasil, i know it's not NA but there is not SA server. 
---
As there are not often south american servers, most south american players join the NA servers of their corresponding timezone. So while they're not in NA they use the NA servers as they are most local to them.
---
You know how at work you do all the little stuff that nobody asked you to do like clean the stationary cupboard or make everyone a drink because you have really important stuff that you're pretending will go away if you just ignore it? This is the retail team right now.
---
yeah, there weren't any good druids on the most competitive and populous vanilla private server in existence. you're probably right.
---
who cares about healing meters? clearly the top guilds do. They want effective and competitive healers, and despite this circlejerk shitty healers perpetuate about "meters not mattering", they do. The objective number does not matter, but your relative performance to other healers in your raid, and other healers of your class outside of raid does matter. Maybe you think it's not fair because you sit every fight complacent, thinking you have a specific role and are not suppose to top meters, but that's wrong. There are plenty of fights where, if you do exactly as I describe, you can fill your role and be the most effective HPS healer in your raid.
---
every single fight in BWL and MC is focused around blanketing or spamming rejuvs to be competitive. Luci, blanket melee and tanks on cleave, magmadar, spam rejuv on tanks, dot targets, and to pre-empt fire damage, gehennas, spam rejuvs on melee and tanks to pre-empt rain of fire damage, garr, spam rejuvs on tanks then end fight HT3/HT4, barron, spam rejuvs on melee to pre-empt flame nova, rejuv tanks + bomb target, gehennas, spam rejuvs on melee, decurse, sulfuron, spam rejuvs on melee + tanks, domo, spam rejuvs, rag, rejuvs on melee if you can reach them, otherwise HT3/4 tanks and roll hots. Razorgore, HT3/4 spam p1, then spam rejuvs to preempt fireball volley damage, vael, spam regrowth with 5set T2, broodlord, spam rejuvs to pre-empt knockback damage and spam regrowth on those you didn't get, firemaw, roll rejuvs the entire fight to get Dot damage, other drakes, Ht3/4 spam with rej/rg ont he tanks, chromag, decurse and roll HoTs on tanks, nef, roll rejuvs p1 to pre-empt shadowbolt volley, roll hots on tanks p2 and decurse.
---
i could continue for the AQ and naxx, but the gist is that fights get longer so you need to be more sparing with rejuvs.
---
even if you get one tick on all of your hots, you did more effective healing than any one of the individual the paladins.
---
how do you not realize that, lol
---
you realize that you said 6.5 and fantastic. 6.5 is just over average and if that was a grade, it would be a D
---
.....that doesn't invalidate what I said.
---
I don't understand the need to just lump categorize them like that.  I agree as much as the next guy that a vlog-style video of just talking about news that we can all read isn't super needed.  However, I also love his video walkthroughs of questlines like the UBRS Key, Ony attunement, WW Axe, etc.  Some of them are great videos that I truly enjoyed, and some of them I'm probably not going to click on.
---
I'll watch quest and lore vids all day long, that kind of content is great!
---
If I go Horde, my Priest will be a troll. Mohawk &gt; devouring plague. 
---
Arms was probably always the better choice, but Fury is still a good leveling spec. Fury has more passive buffs and is less dependent on getting your hands on a really good 2hander (no not everybody has twinks/friends to get them WW wep at 30). PH is great for escaping bad situations, there's some great pvp talents, Imp Slam is actually viable if you don't like DW, and you're not hung up on a certain kind of weapon for wep specs. That being said, Arms is still probably the better leveling tree, Imp OP is a shockingly high percentage of the damage you do, particularly when combined with Deep Wounds and Impale, and the flow of killing one to build range into sweeping strikes/cleaving down a 2 pull is probably the fastest a warrior can grind. Particularly if you partner with a healer Arms really pulls ahead of Fury. 
---
Rather than max leveling speed, I'd go Arms of Fury based on the key talents you like. Really enjoy stance dancing? Go arms. Really like wpvp? PH, Imp Execute, Imp Intercept are amazing. 
---
I don't care about the class/race meta at all but;
---
**End-game skinning, fite me!**
---
Completely agreed. The bonuses from most racials isnt THAT big. Sure some help in certain situations (like Gnome Escape Artist) but none of them are class-defining. 
---
All right, let's keep in touch
---
Because it’s just for fun/practice? Idk I guess if you can’t play a video game without emotional attachment I’m not sure you should play.
---
Me thinks he meant Healthstone ;)
---
T2.5 Hunter spell dmg with improved arcane shot. 
---
Well, as long as he can kite Drakk and the adds until the group is ready it should work out!
---
Arms w/ deep wounds and axe spec avoid the sit crit talents in Fury
---
What Atlan said. This is the case hence why I lumped them in with the NA servers. Brasil is a SA country but the realms are NA. Sorry for the misleading language.
---
RPers take up a sour attitude if you're purposely disrupting the purpose of the server. They still talk out of character often and play the game like the rest of us. :D
---
Tauren, right?
---
Nelfs or Burgers , trollls not allowed
---
The CMs OBVIOUSLY only have access to the retail client!!!! Remember this.
---
Thats what happens when you make people wait for shit theyre excited about. This subreddit is exactly the same. For every post about something there are 5 posts of hype (im various forms).
---
Things will change once we can start playing. Then we can dump our time into the actual game vs talking about the game.
---
Devouring Plague would like a word.
---
Turns a shadow priest into one of the most fearsome 1v1 classes in the game. 
---
I’ll be right there with you, auto attacking my way to 60. 
---
nice compilation! thats an instant bookmark.
---
sadly some guides are pretty horrible, like saying a shaman would be the preferred healer in pvp over priest, like wtf?
---
Undead warrior reporting for duty xD
---
The more people to gank
---
Rogue using full +spell power gear, with shadow oils and full spell power consumables.  Get all the applicable +spell dmg debuffs on the target too, like nightfall, curse of shadows, shadow weaving, etc.
---
The guy has experience with other MMOs, and the FF MMOs went through the same evolution of removing the incentives to interact with the player community in order to facilitate accessibility. I doubt they had a in-depth conversation about sharing, but the guy can certainly understand the concept of game mechanics which encourage or destroy community without getting into the nitty-gritty of it.
---
A balance druid can be awesome at solo and small scale wpvp.
---
How so?
---
The melee hunter did 1000 and a ret pally does 1200? OOF
---
thanks, i think I'll stay arms, do you have the time to put me together a quick example of what 10-20 might look like? the rest I can figure out.
---
When those undead rogues come for you, you'll be glad you had a dwarf priest.
---
Have good time making friends..
---
If I play, I think I'll go druid too.  Never played one in classic but I hear they are fast levelers and pretty self sufficient in world pvp.
---
Thank you for this! I'll still weigh in my choices if I'd go for priest/shaman but you definitely narrowed it down!
---
I don't....get it. What do the ongoings of retail have to do with Classic? That there's no silly stuff in Classic, or?
---
Having noobs will be one of the most authentic parts of the experience. I, too, am hoping the tryhards don't run them off. 
---
Is there a twitter account I should follow and have push notifications for Classic news? I don’t want a bunch of random shit from like blizzard official accounts. Leaks are okay too. 
---
Pristine Hide of the Beast is pretty important. It's skinned from The Beast (UBRS) and used to get pre-raid BiS for some classes. On that point, how did players decide who gets the hide? I would say only skinners with enough skill get to role for it. Of course I'm talking ablut a PUG, if you're in a guild I guess it would go differently.
---
its particularly tryhard
---
In other words, "jerks." Is it possible to be a jerk &amp; stay within the guidelines of RP?
---
Worthless until you get a big 2 hander.
---
Sulfuras, ashkandi, dark edge.
---
ermergerd people have fun in retail amiriteguyz?
---
Pointless retail bashing. We get it, you don't like it. Stop obsessing over it.
---
Looks pretty good to me.  Wish Gnomes could be Paladins.
---
As far as I can see, retail WoW lacks content and is fundamentally broken. Instead of fixing it to make it a competent game, they are publishing fish head costume, while ignoring the real issues. 
---
That's the point there I think. 
---
&gt;  If you are planning on being a dedicated tank, you will have a much easier time finding a raid spot than Fury #3093514
---
eh the good guilds usually already got their tank choices done early. Often its the gm himself and some buddies who tank.
---
I'll main a Druid too, though I'll do so in an RP server. I have a backstory prepared and all, it's gonna be great!
---
Play retribution paladin - Get a healing set - Be open about respeccing heal if the guild needs it before joining a raiding guild but emphasize  you want to be a retribution paladin and you will get [nightfall](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169#comments) incase the guild needs one or havent planned for one. If you add that you have no issues getting loot after the regular melee dps you will have 0 problem finding a guild. 
---
&gt;Heart of the Wild is just such a massive stat boost that I highly recommend getting there ASAP
---
Disagree with this. I rush Feline Swiftness asap when I level druids for the movement speed before going Furor. Furor offers a ton of utility in the form of instant charge or stun, or instant use of Claw or Rage on Catform. Definately a must have if you level on a PvP server, and it has great PvE utility too.
---
Once I got Furor I keep going down Feral until I get Savage Fury and Faerie Fire (Feral), and then switch over to Balance to get Natural Weapons and Omen of Clarity.
---
My reasoning is that you want to run heavy on agility over strength for leveling, as that feeds you more combo points through Blood Frenzy (two combo points when a generator crit), while giving you more dodge and overall higher crit chance. You also dont have a total amount of Stats high enough to really take advantage of HotW yet until you are 60 and start getting some gear.
---
Meanwhile, Natural Weapons offer a global 10% increase to all your physical damage, and Omen of Clarity is obviously a very strong choice.
---
I made a comparison image of two identically geared Druids with typical leveling gear for 49, one run HotW+Leader of the Pack, the other run Omen of Clarity. As we can see, the amount of stats gained from HotW at this level really and the 3% crit from LotP dont really make up for a 10% physical damage and 10% chance to make to make your next ability free of energy cost.
---
Great for you man! I'll main a Druid too, though I'll do so in an RP server. I have a backstory prepared and all, it's gonna be great!
---
Rule 1
---
And savory deviate delights, noggenfogger, dortol's rod are things in vanilla. Turns out people liked silly stuff so Blizzard kept adding it to retail - shocking. 
---
decide what factors matter more for you and go from there
---
These types of videos are so stupid and prove nothing. Give any melee or caster max buffs and full BIS gear and perfect environment and they will do 2k dps. Ret pally will always be behind, end of story. 
---
Thanks m8
---
I frequently see Wildstar used as proof that there is no longer a desire for "hardcore" or otherwise more-difficult-than-normal MMOs. While I'm happy to concede that it may have been more successful if released at a different time, the fact that it was just rather bad certainly didn't do it any favors. Character control felt weird; abilities largely felt the same to use, there was no satisfying "crunch" (for lack of better words...) when landing a big ranged crit, or something like a Kidney Shot, and I distinctly remember PvP just being a clusterf\*ck of ground-targeted messiness. On top of that, the classes, atmosphere and the quests were all rather lackluster. Something was off. It wasn't polished, crisp or satisfying to play.
---
I actually think the gaming industry has indicated lately that there's a sizable group of players itching for longer, difficult, more "hardcore" games that you can really sink some time, effort and brainpower into. DOS 2, the revival of the XCOM genre, Dark Souls, the proliferation of private WoW servers and the success of old school Runescape, to name just a few, all point towards a market for punishing games that require (and reward) effort. 
---
In short: I think Classic WoW is going to be quite a success. Will it overtake retail? Doubtful. Will it be more popular than MOBAs or FPS games? Never. Will it have enough people to warrant further classic expansions or additional content? I think yes.
---
He said nothing about progression.
---
also warlocks and rogues may be stronk but it mainly around 1v1s which is rare in bgs
---
Have my upvote for having the balls to say what needed to be said. 
---
I agree that in actual classic there's a good chance it won't work, but even with that smite priests aren't insane, mana is still a problem, + Having to run that much of a strange comp combined with terrible tanks really doesn't work.
---
It's just too much work for not enough reward arguably
---
I recall turning critters into dead sheep while waiting for people, but I can't tell whether I remember correctly.
---
Oh hell yeah we're only a section of people who will enjoy the game
---
Well yes, it will be in the same battle.net game launcher as the other Acti/blizz titles, but more specifically you won't click on say WoW to play classic, in the same way you wouldn't click on starcraft 2 to play SC remaster. You'd click on the Classic WoW icon, hence having its own launcher and client.
---
I liked the mage running into melee range to stop the bandage
---
“We can show that”
---
&gt;the buzzards on YouTube
---
What does that make those of us who are so starved for content that we eat that shit up? :P
---
but shadowguard deals more damage with decent gear than dp, costs way less mana, has more chances to stun the enemy and can be precasted, so you're saving 1 gcd and you can still use inner focus. plus hex of weakness is also super powerful since healing reduction is the rarest thing in vanilla.
---
sure wotf is also a very good racial, but imo it isn't as valuable as having shadowguard, that spell is just so good.
---
Ok, let me rephrase: You're actually implying you ever end *any raid fights* in Vanilla with a surplus as a healer? That's rich
---
Why would you ever waste mana on pets in a raid? You will spend all of it in no time healing players anyway.
---
I don't even know why he brought up ending with a surplus at all, cause that just doesn't happen in vanilla
---
Exactly. I feel like druids are one of the worst offenders of the vanilla design not being that polished, especially resto. They are supposed to be HoT healers, but wasn't until TBC. I'd honestly prefer to play ele shaman in vanilla as well.
---
Check out Harnessing Shadows II, think that has a 5v1 in it

https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/warrior-talents/?tal=0230502130200000000000000000000000000000000000000000
---
I'd start with that. Arms has a loot of good talents in the lower parts. Parry is nice since it's always on and you get a faster swing when you parry, but you could put those two in Imp HS as well. I kinda feel like you either need to pick Imp Charge OR the full 5 TM and Anger Management. AM is all around good, where Imp Charge is strong in PvP to help you get an MS in right off a charge. The important leveling talents to start really are Imp OP, Deep Wounds, and Impale though. All you need is those and a fat two hander and you can drop mobs fast.
---
Sure, wasn't to change your mind. I just personally can't stand vanilla druids. I need my TBC changes to love that class (but then I also do love the class for all xpacs).
---
Oh yeah I get that, I'm from SA (Uruguay) and use NA servers cause they're the best timezone and ping for me. Actually now I reread your post and what you're saying does make sense lol.  I had no idea though that the servers inside NA region were separated by timezones! 
---
Zug zug*
---
I think it's one of those things you either love or hate.  I just really like the way the armor sets look on humans.
---
Jesus Christ, drown yourself?!
---
Idk hearthstones are pretty strong
---
t1 has about 1 useful stat on 1 item, it's really bizarre.
---
Definitely the right way to do it. Levelling in vanilla is a cracking experience and you're best to wait to do it on the official servers.
---
Damn I'm so jealous!
---
It's why I'm playing a character I don't really care about. Fun/practice. Saving my desire for retail.
---
Great point! I will keep that in mind. The only reason I somewhat want to avoid going Warrior/Priest is because it's kind of stereotypical/basic in a way. Not to say it wouldn't be fun, but it isn't as unique as some other options. I will definitely keep it in mind though. It definitely has its perks!
---
I played a druid since day 1 of vanilla. The spec is garbage compared to TBC. A second rate class. I'll be rolling shaman as well
---
# G A L A X Y B R A I N
---
Way too outta context. They did what was right for 60% of the player base. It negatively impacted 20% of the player base. And the other 20% didn't care. 
---
Congrats! I'm looking forward to maining a shaman, even though it means I'll have to main Horde for the first time as a lifelong Alliance player.
---
MVP
---
Any tailor will make them for you, just have the materials ready. Cheaper than buying.
---
It's not very well made then is it, you got all that from a picture of a fish head?
---
For me it's less about emotional attachment, and more a simple time vs reward. Been a long time since I played Vanilla so levelling would be slow as fuck. I don't want all that time to be wiped out at a moment's notice.
---
Off the top of my head I'm not sure what duo would be unique in that way. After thinking a little more last night and today, I'm considering going Shaman and my brother is considering Warlock. It may end up being a nice combo, not sure though.
---
Everyone gets to see the content so having killed the final boss wasn't special. Also, everyone had access to the gear from the raid. The LFR version looked nearly identical to the heroic version but had slightly different colors. 
---
Yes some artist made this instead of making a new raid. Same time frame and job right?
---
You'd have loved this shit in 2005 though.
---
Im hoping by then the server stability issues will be fixed. Not sure if you have played BFA at all but it is pathetic at times.
---
I remember raiding SW back in the day with 3 40 man raids and never having any issues, this needs to be a main priority before classic launches or it will ruin the true experience. 
---
Its a system where a bunch of mini instances of zones is created on the same server to divide the playerbase i to smaller ”shards” to help with server stability, basicly there could be 5-10 STV on the same server, and your rival you want to gank could play beside you and you cant see eachother, or your friend.
---
I think it removes immersion, i want to know that if i go to BRM for example to PvP, im holding the door for the whole server, nobody can get invited to a different shard and just run through me.
---
There should only be 1 immersive world where everyone sees everyone, friend or foe.
---
I'm glad someone else thinks Wildstar was floppy. That was the reason I couldn't continue with it - no crunch or bite to any of the abilities. It just felt "wet", for want of a better word.
---
Thanks!
---
Every thread theres always that one dude like “yea ik u just said your playing what you want to play but let me input how you won’t get raid spots or do one piece of content” 
---
It's like the S.E.L.F.I.E patch during WoD, major issues at the time and they gave us a fucking camera.
---
No one said that.  The Devs said that using a /sit macro to enduce crits to proc certain abilities will not work in Classic.  They're aware of how this was used before patching in retail and it will already be fixed in Classic.
---
It was not a blue post, it was a Dev interview either at Blizzcon or some other media output.
---
I honestly understand if its there on launch when 4000 orcs wants to bonk sleeping peons at the same time, but it better not be there 3 weeks later when i want to pvp at level 60.
---
Million dollar question is, horde or alliance droooood?
---
People that say the game "started" at max level is one of the reasons why leveling now is such an afterthought, the discovery and leveling journey is such a good and fun part of vanilla and in lesser extent BC and WOTLK.
---
My plan is to level the same way as i did back in vanilla,do what i want when i want to do it, run deadmines 5 times to get a single piece that boost my dps,spending a day in WSG/AB, hanging out in ironforge , leveling up professions.
---
People are going to rush to 60 blow through the content, and then bitch that there is so little to do 
---
Okay. So it splits up the initial pop boom on a server so starting zones work?
---
Day 1 droood in vanilla as well. Mangle was a Godsend that made the class a monster.  Without it, its just... to mediocre. 
---
Any healer works honestly. You can go Paladin if Ally and Shaman if Horde to avoid going Priest.
---
add that there are certain things to learn as hunter like kiting etc that may be difficult for some
---
Totally with you that you didn't tell anyone what to do, but I on the other hand find it funny that you suggest someone to be more meta in a thread where people literally say what non-meta they will play.
---
It's fine to suggest to play more meta, but I would think anyone posting in this thread already *knows* they are not meta, so a bit unnecessary to suggest otherwise.
---
You can still be an awesome PVP healer with a holy/reck spec (25/26/0) or go for more PVE-style Ret with 21/0/30 (maxing vengeance and 2h weap damage) where you can still heal fine.
---
Illumination is the big PVE heal ability that paladins need, and divine favor is a big plus as well (guaranteed, mana free 4k+ heal!) so other than that theres a lot of room to spec how you want. 
---
Yeah, but it only runs from 30-60. I'm not sure whether it's better or worse than VanillaGuide because I'm not very familiar with Alliance leveling, but that alone would be a deal breaker.
---
Thats the idea, private servers solves it by having dynamic respawn but killing the same boar over and over with 2 seconds respawn timer isnt exactly true to vanilla either.
---
Yeah I was actually starting to lean towards wanting to play Shaman anyway. This might be the move!
---
He is currently do a run 1-60 and he posted when he hit level 20 that it was 1 hour faster than his vanilla runs.
---
gonna go for something more casual like mage
---
or rogue for stealth shenanigans and good looks
---
I honestly dont care about the launch, i just want the endgame to be true to vanilla with 1 community and no sharding so people can escape PvP for example.
---
You farm slow, but you can still kill stuff.  There are farming things that are better in groups, so if you're doing one of those they'll need a healer.  And you can simply advertise to a DPS that you're willing to be their pocket healer and split the farmed stuff.  I did that a lot in BC.
---
Depends if you have friends or guild members to farm with.  I’d recommend finding a tank or someone who can AOE and your job is just to pull new mobs and stay alive. It’s going to be a while before your healer is 60 with raiding aspirations AND you have a dps high enough level to farm useful items 
---
I’m going through the same decision, back in Vanilla I played resto Druid and considering priest as an option this time around.  Farming items outside of raid was just spamming shitty balance spells and took forever. 
---
How does this look:
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100aPQ3MKdcMZp8Zk\_Xhn2vW-IkYKUY-IKW2QikhjYNo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100aPQ3MKdcMZp8Zk_Xhn2vW-IkYKUY-IKW2QikhjYNo/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Totally makes sense. I remember being one of many toons all trying to kill some mob in the 1-5 zones and it being chaos. 
---
But endgame is a different story. I can’t wait for it!
---
You're twisting what I said to fit your argument, and then going back and changing it. It's impossible to have a discussion if you're going to move the goal post every time somebody points out that I didn't say what you claimed that I said.
---
I do wonder when you say you played "balance druid through all expansions" - does that exclude vanilla (since it is not an expansion)? Because druids had massive changes in TBC. But if you enjoy vanilla balance, great for you! I enjoy them only in PvP in vanilla (especially duels and wPvP).
---
Also, what do you think is so unique about balance compared to other casters? I'd say they are no more unique than a warlock, shadow priest, ele shaman etc. I only feel the real uniqueness of druids after TBC myself, so just curious about your opinion.
---
What about going moonglow build for gearing up? Have you tried testing DPS in a 🌒 moonglow + NS build?
---
In pvp... enhancement. Sweet juicy wind fury procs 
---
Yep, it's up to you to define if this is pointless or not. People can bash retail all they want.
---
but it will still be available for purchase upon release, anyway. And reviews... there is a lot of them... 14 years old.
---
About the modern remaster, well, you won't be getting a lot, I guess. Most likely will come only after release. So, the only change would be that bulk discount.
---
I've seen some crazy Enhancement PvP vids!
---
you may find something special at anytime now.
---
works again
---
arms.
---
It just give your more tools to adapt to wpvp, tank dungeon, and swing kitting is a good way to grind safely.
---
Human Warlock
---
I'd say it's those damn and stupid birds. Rats were in Daggerfall, I think.
---
Yeah, I figure even my friends who have been clear that they don't want to play classic with us will at least give it a little bit of a shot to see how it stacks up to their memories.
---
Yeah man I’m gonna do all the instances, battle grounds, world pvp. I’m gonna live it up 
---
**Sharding** is basically load-balancing.  So let's say there's 100 people in an area, but it can only realistically support 20 people (either due to server performance or due to mob availability).  So then they'll make 5 shards, where you're only with 20 people on each shard.  It might be that everyone is in /General with each other, or it might be that you're completely isolated.  Either way, you'll only run into those 20 people, and the other 80 might as well not exist.
---
**The biggest problem** is that it breaks apart the community into manageable chunks, and you have no control over it.  It makes the world feel sterile and stale.  At worst, it could be that you're in World PvP with someone and they disappear from sight when you cross a zone boundary.  Or it could be that you cross a zone boundary and suddenly there's tons of enemies there that weren't there before.  Or it could be that you see a TON of herbs and minerals, but when you get close they disappear because you changed shards.
---
It makes the community feel smaller and can really take you out of the game.
---
A guild I would love to be in. 
---
Sweet, this is the kind of stuff I'm looking for. I keep seeing people say NO YOU WILL NEVER RET. But people say it's possible. I just wanted to know if it was going to be an 8 month long grind or something. I'm trying to be open about it. Like I'll heal in raids and dungeons I don't mind.. But I'd like the occasional Ret in PvPs. I'm also keeping.aware that rets are not warriors and more a support that can smack with some melee. 
---
Thanks for the advice though! 
---
Exactly :)! But most people ask nicely first, and if they're giving you attitude, it's most likley because you're actually going against the rules over and over ^^
---
So basically, the bad gameplay decision is validated by Activision being a horrible company?
---
I'm a little bit in the same boat - I only started maining a druid in TBC, then changed to Shaman in WotLK - I think I'll pick one of those for Classic but it's tearing me apart trying to settle with one....
---
Yep, there are macros that delete the last item in the soulshard bag when you cast soul leech. It's to prevent soulshards from cluttering the rest of your inventory, especially when you have the talent that gives a buff when the target dies while leeched.
---
I finally fired up a PServer a couple months back. Had been avoiding it for years but surgery for a torn tendon left me holed up in my apartment for a month. Totally awesome. Maybe I can have another surgery when Classic releases...
---
Anyway, I had a lot of the same fears regarding the population. I was worried they'd all be min-maxing elitists who claim to know absolutely everything about every corner of the game. Thankfully, while those people certainly exist, they were a small portion of the population. There were a ton of fresh noobs and old grandpa vets (such as myself) running around, and by and large players across the whole spectrum were friendly and helpful, asking questions and giving answers as needed. It was a surprisingly pleasant experience, and reminded me quite a bit of Vanilla - even down to the random benefactors just handing out low level wands and silver to freshies in Razor Hill.
---
My only real complaint is on the PvP front. Literally everyone, starting at about level 20, is running around with Swiftness pots, FAPs and the like. Everyone has Engi trinkets. It's a bit irritating, largely because it feels more like a contest of professions than the actual classes, but I suppose it's just something we'll all need to get used to. Additionally, I'd like to think that this issue will be somewhat diluted when the population expands for Classic launch. 
---
enhancement is pretty much shit. 
---
Elemental is pretty much OP
---
Yeah, if you don't have friends to do some group farming with/don't feel like running around doing gathering professions on your priest then an alt is usually what main healers go for. 
---
Priests can farm but it requires you to respec from your main healing spec which is clearly not optimal if your goal is to farm gold. As a resto shaman I could gather some spell damage gear and farm somewhat decent but.. I prefer the frost mage for the quick farming.
---
Lock, Hunter or Mage are the best farmers for obvious reasons if you ask me.
---
They are both viable; enh is more proc-oriented but can deal massive bursts, while ele does sustained damage but less burst.
---
Or like...not deal with misplaced loot tickets at all. I don't care if it was a honest mistake, that's like 0.01% of the cases while the rest were just ninja.
---
Too bad they ended up going with this crap "solution".
---
Great!
---
&gt;i could continue for the AQ and naxx, but the gist is that fights get longer so you need to be more sparing with rejuvs.
---
Alright so you admit that Rejuv spam is only possible on the content where fights last under a minute which means you wont really run oom anyway then. 
---
And no, healing meters really does not represent how good a healer is. Your position on the healing meters are mostly determined by who can snipe the most heals and be the fastest players to land a heal after a damage spike. Both of those methods dont help the raid stay alive at all, it just creates useless competition between healers who are looking for a high spot on legacyplayers, as if being ranked due to some arbitrary metric on a third party website has any bearing on how skilled you are as a healer.
---
Again, rejuv has its uses on multiple fights, but Healing Touch will always be your bread and butter healing spell for any encounter where you cannot just power through with the raid far outgearing the encounters like is the case in MC and BWL.
---
Yeah there's even a whole subreddit dedicated to it. It's /r/wow
---
Enhancement is crap. With gear Elemental is one of the strongest pvp classes. 
---
Baby don't shard me, no more.
---
No, I'm simply saying it makes sense.
---
Nowhere did I say it was justified or the right move. I only said that it, with today's context, makes sense. I can understand *why* they implemented Loot Trading, but I don't agree with it.
---
Interesting! I'm used to playing a Mage so Elemental may be better for me anyway.
---
Gotcha, I definitely need to do more research to see which I would prefer.
---
Don't worry there will be lots of hunters too
---
This is the main reason I will be playing classic: for Blizz to see the want of older itterations, so they will release TBC as well! With the exception of flying, it was hands down the best itteration (imo).
---
As if they won’t use sharding for end game. They will use it for server launch so they will also use it for server wide events like AQ opening. 
---
Thank you for this detailed answer. Having not played in this environment, I think I understand why the classic community doesn’t want it. 
---
Yea because people reading this might get the wrong idea, sadly.
---
Yeah I may be leaning towards Elemental since I've played a Mage for so long. I'm more used to the caster play style.
---
If thats what they're into thats fine, I just want the new people to know that min-maxing wasn't all Vanilla wow was about.
---
elemental is very fun - but be prepared to have all the melee yell at you to drop a new WF totem every 2 secs when they are out of range
---
Yea I heard they are better than shadow priests and ret paladins at least.
---
Not really. You use the exact same consumables a Warrior tank with the exception of Manual Crowd Pummeler. Unlike feral cat dps, you dont need a lot of Pummelers as a Tank each raid. 
---
I only bring two to AQ40 where I use one on Fankriss to allow the raid to go all out on DPS. You can also use one for Huhuran if you are tanking there. For BWL you want one on Vaelastrsz, one on Broodlord, and otherwise you are good.
---
Your resistance gear is also far cheaper than a Warrior's, and you dont need multiple Lionheart helmets and other expensive craftable gear to do your job.
---
TBC is probably the type of WoW I remember the fondest, but I'd say aside from flying it was also a big problem that Azeroth and the capital cities became irrelevant. Outland and Shattrath completely replaced it.
---
The Class design of TBC was amazing, tho.
---
Bruh I'd personally rather have a stealth ability as a priest for myself than anything else, and starshards is a great Damage per mana spell. 
---
yikes imagine actually thinking this
---
Depends on it it's a fresh server I guess. If the server is established you can buy 10 slot silk bags for like 40s. Otherwise you can level tailoring and get to 8 slots fairly easily. Or if you've got the connections guildies are always a good bet.
---
I'm not even going to raid in classic, I just like levelling 
---
Yup you're correct about Shadow guard on troll and one of the main reasons I'm rolling troll. shadow guard has a 98% Spell damage coefficient meaning at higher spell damage you can expect 600-800 DMG per shadow guard, which also procs blackout btw.
---
Its almost as if 8.1.5 is a minor content patch
---
You pick up all the high points, much of the rest is personally preference. I'll generally drop imp charge for something like imp hamstring (insane in pvp), and I was never too happy with blood craze, but those are the finer points. You'll have a good time with that build.
---
I guess it's up to you if you want to play the kite game, knowing that you have no reliable way to get in melee range, except a strong snare, only to wait for a proc on a 3s swing once you get there. 
---
On the other hand, with ele you can consistently 2-3shot people from a safe range.
---
I read that as "play without even reading the quests this time". I was impressed.
---
Thanks for in depth response! 
---
That's the core gameplay loop of a leveling Paladin in Classic. Auto attacks modified by a seal that you activate at the start of combat. Paladin is an amazing class, but without a group of some sort, you WILL be either auto-attacking or auto-attacking with a seal modifying your auto-attack. With Judgement sprinkled in sometimes, of course.
---
There are a few pservers with instant 60 and free blues that are fairly good for testing classes and specs in BGs; if you don’t mind that sort of thing.
---
Have you considered female orc? Animations are pretty decent
---
There are associated guides that take you from 12ish up to 30. From 1-12 you are on your own, I'm afraid.
---
Also shadowguard+Hex of weakness &gt; devouring plague
---
Good point! I forgot about that. Yes, a huuge part of classic was that you had to go all over the world. You kinda get that in TBC, but enclosed within Outland. And flying takes away part of that as well.
---
And you're misdirecting. You will not end a fight in vanilla with any mana to spare, period.
---
its a hassle getting the pummelers
---
and you have to carry a bunch of extra gear to fill other roles as needed 
---
I'm trying to stay clear of private servers to deprive myself of WoW until it comes out just so I appreciate it even more, as dumb as that sounds. But I will keep that in mind for sure!
---
You're really not kidding, don't get me started on the roller coaster.
---
Shill for Blizzard all you like but BfA is a steaming pile of shit.
---
Yeah Ele seems the way to go in my mind now
---
Healthstones are on a different CD. Priests can't waste a potion on health, they need that CD for mana pots.
---
Most people seem to be siding with Elemental! This may be the way to go for me
---
Why not just set it up where unless it’s on master looter, no loot trading no matter what?
---
Honestly I have no idea what they look like haha. They were so infrequent that I can't remember any of their animations.
---
Personally, I'd rather be an ele shaman, or a elemental proc shaman special snowflake than go back to being a druid in vanilla.  So many annoyances I'd rather not want to relive.
---
I think you have to be lvl 5 in order to learn enchanting, but yeah, you can d/e any item at any level of enchanting.
---
Duo-level with shaman, would you suggest typical arms level build? 31/5/0 for the most part?
---
Subjective opinion. There are issues yes, but its not as bad as people make it out to be especially after 8.1, and 8.2 is getting rid of azerite armor so its getting better slowly. But again, its subjective, so whatever just dont compare it to shit WoD lmao
---
Druids are the manliest night elves. Warriors and hunters are these lean agile fighters, but a tall night elf who turns into a freakin bear and mauls his enemy? Thats testosterone right there!
---
The one time a hunter who knows what he's doing.. casually rolling his eyes like *Guys, its not that hard, just kill the adds while I pull this idiot 5 rooms down*
---
Fury is the kind of spec that looks good on paper. The reality is that once you enter a PvP area without tactical mastery, that theoretical advantage is all but gone.
---
Wow yes, instead of developing content, they must have spent months, nay, years developing an angle change when you press the screenshot button.
---
The super elitist mentality that exists in Pservers will be totally washed away and diluted by the sheer volume of "normal" players in Classic that I'm not at all worried about it.
---
I think the loot rating is more harmful to the game then not having any GM support or loot trading in the first place. Just let people do what they want and if they make a mistake so be it. And as for a ninja they're going to make it bad name for themselves on the server.
---
&gt;It's objectively the slowest class to level after rogue
---
except its not if you know what you're doing. go look at any of the launched of servers in the last 3years gilnash/monkeynews will be in top10 without any abnormal play time(yes this is dynamic respawns which helps but not more than hunter/lock)
---
the slowness comes from how insane the damage you take while leveling is and having to eat so much but with hamstring kiting/pooling rage methods people abuse now its not slow just far more difficult than other classes
---
This!! I'm a long time pally player, would love judgement armor set on a gnome. I like the way the tier sets look on gnomes.
---
druids are almost impossible to gank after they get travel form. it has a cheap manacost and it removes roots/snares  
---
you must be super mana conservative because cat/bear form cost so much mana and heals aren't free either. it gets a lot better though after you get heart of the wild, natural shapeshifter and innervate
---
TBC might've improved on druids greatly, but they aren't in a sorry state in vanilla either, in terms of the meta. They are undervalued though.
---
They are the best OT with highest  single threat generation and both personal and raid dps, they are the best burst healers with rebirth (for that few seconds till you are OOM) and the most efficient healers (with downranked healing touch). They are better pvp healers than priests in my opinion and the best in many situations. Best flag carriers.
---
They could do that, or just not put Loot Trading in at all, which I'd prefer personally.
---
Horde side especially if you have a shaman buddy, 2h fury is legit.  Especially when leveling up. 
---
I don't want another release of tbc, if anything I want an expansion that takes the vanilla pihlopshy of immersion and insane progression further, to increase world PvP not neutrality, and to generally make things even more sandbox. Tbc was a step in the opposite direction for me. The zones and leveling was cool but not too timeless 
---
All of this while typing that message
---
That tier 3 is 🔥🔥🔥
---
I agree.
---
Is it really? Ive never played Priest on Horde (I played a Dwarf back in the day). 
---
Troll druids are a sin.
---
I have zero intention of playing TBC or later expansions, and will likely quit again if blizzard goes that route.
---
My decision to be horde is totally irrelevant to information potentially not provided.
---
Death to gnomes.
---
Not really. They have 50% drop chance from a boss that is located right inside the back door. It's really easy to farm.
---
You're missing the point, any development time spent on something so trivial during a time when the game is in a pretty poor state is just a slap in the face to a player base that has been raising valid concerns for months.
---
Just by the name of the quest and location of questgivers I can do 1-20 blind.
---
But you are right, I could have wrote that sentence better.
---
On a frost Mage You can aoe farm Hearthglen in WPL, or Tyr's Hand in EPL.
---
Me not that kind of Orc!
---
with full raid buffs, mana pots, dark runes, flask, innervate, I can spam rejuv for a long time. Long enough that I can do so during damage phases of most AQ and Naxx fights.
---
&gt;Your position on the healing meters are mostly determined by who can snipe the most heals and be the fastest players to land a heal after a damage spike
---
You're stating this like "sniping heals" is a bad thing. If every player is in competition to heal as quick as possible, how is that "useless competition"? As long as you have healers dedicated to tanks and decursing, raid healing should be as competitive as possible.
---
I made no claim that meters are the be-all, end-all metric of "skill" of a player. But there certainly is a very strong correlation to how you rank on meters and how much you give a shit as a player. Certainly a top ranking healer is not necessarily the highest "skill" player, because your HPS is a product of how many healers your raid brings, how much damage your raid occurs, and how many healers of the same class you are competing with for overwriting HoTs, etc.
---
But as an average metric of performance, HPS works. Until someone develops a metric that normalizes HPS as a proportion of damage taken and healing capacity available, it's what we got.
---
A complete aversion to meters, however, is just as misguided as a complete investment in them. Your HPS matters. You cannot discount shitty HPS as "ah i was just getting heal-sniped". You have to perform better.
---
Solid advice, thanks!
---
Yeah, I actually really love all of Outland, I just don't like to trade all of Azeroth for it. 
---
your not wrong, I played in vanilla but was very young. by the time TBC came out my highest character was a level 48ish human paladin. no joke I think I had 34+ days played on him. whether it was BG's / running up mountains with the brother / chilling in random towns / running through lowbie dungeons / checking out the AH. never made it to 60.... but was still the most fun I have had on  a character (also no quest addons so was just reading the quest txt to figure it out and running back to the same spot 3 times for differnts quests.... oops
---
Those who don’t do anything hate on those that do. Human nature. 
---
Me and a few friends tried out Wildstar. Even though we were above the recommended system settings, the framerates we got, in spite of the simple graphics, were so poor we stopped playing pretty early on in the leveling experience.
---
im currently at ~420 sd and it ticks for 400-450 depending on shadow vulnerability stacks. however thats just my pvp/offset gear, an actual mainspec shadowpriest with some raidgear would get even higher numbers.
---
dp on the other hand gets cucked by the healing part of the spell, meaning it's scaling is almost non existent.
---
That retail is trash? Real big stretch indeed. 
---
&gt;except its not if you know what you're doing.
---
And if you know what you are doing on any other class you will level faster. I dont know why we have to debate this. Warriors and rogue are both melee classes, meaning they have to facetank every hit against them, while having no ability to selfheal outside of bandage.
---
At least rogues have stuns, gouge, blind, evasion and higher base dodge than a Warrior.
---
To say Warriors is not the slowest class to level is simply not true, because they are. I dont know how anyone can possibly think this is debatable.
---
Thinking that putting a fish head means that they are ignoring all other issues in the game
---
The context here is Harkonen1991's comment that Reckoning stacks will not build up due to sitting. This is correct, this will not work in Classic.
---
So everyone that isn't a direct raid content creator should sit on their arse and twiddle thumbs until you give them the A-OK? The one missing the point appears to be you.
---
Ofc it makes sense. In a sick, twisted way
---
Imo nelf priest insnt as bad. Its bad in raids but in owPvP i'd rather have stealth over fear ward...
---
Honestly I couldn't care less for meta. When I said I don't like druids in vanilla it has nothing to do with any of their performance - I simply think they are in a sorry state in terms of design. I just don't think druids have a particular great design until TBC.
---
I do agree that druids are playable in vanilla in terms of meta, but playing a game without having fun is a waste of time.
---
Regardless of why, they are. 
---
sure
---
Do you have proof that it didn't work that way in vanilla?
---
60 in 3 weeks?
---
How casùal.
---
I'm EU and played on NA servers back in Cata or Panda (can't remember which one) because of a few american friends and had 90-120 ms, not really optimal for hardcore players but completely fine to play normally with. It depends on your connection obviously but anything under 300 works and is actually recommended by Blizzard themselves. It's not like you need absolute optimal latency to level up and do dungeons.
---
As far as I know you can't send EU characters to NA in retail though, so.. the same thing will apply to classic WoW.
---
If people just understood how many of the commenters on this sub are BC babies, Wrath babies, and exclusive retail players,
---
they'd understand why there is so much uninformed opinion and incessant push for flying mount TBC and LFG WotLK expansions.
---
ok
---
This is what I would aim for at level 40.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxbAio0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxbAio0z)
---
I'm still on the edge about playing druid. I like them for 1-60 and wpvp, but I heard many sad/bad stories about raids where they either are not wanted and/or won't get the items they want anyway.
---
Going raiding with 0/30/21 and then heal and get healer items only is not what I think will be fun...
---
Yes, and the sit macro wasn’t the only way to do reckoning bombs. Hence why I asked what I asked. 
---
&gt;Warriors and rogue are both melee classes, meaning they have to facetank every hit against them, while having no ability to selfheal outside of bandage.
---
why are you trying to argue something you have no idea about? in 2006 this would be true its just not anymore.
---
and yes rogues are the 2nd slowest leveling class. warriors are far faster, you can even infinite grind whelps with never eating with current leveling strats.
---
&gt;I dont know how anyone can possibly think this is debatable.
---
go ask anyone in the top 3 guilds atm theyll tell you the exact same thing.
---
the only thing that shouldnt work from private servers is getting auto crit from sitting but most people arnt going fury anymore to level anyways.
---
MC will die before 7days on classic and it wont be the warriors theyre waiting on
---
Well, as it stands Blizzard said they don't want to have 2 MMORPGs to handle. Of course if it becomes a big success they might reconsider, but I don't think it would be in original content, that would pit Classic as a direct competition to their own game. If they go further than vanilla it will most likely be TBC, since then it's still keeping in line with being a reboot of old versions of WoW, rather than having to dedicate a full team to making new content. Remember they would need to basically double their WoW team have devs for both versions. Now they can just remake the old game and then have it running without paying too many employees to "maintain" it.
---
If I could decide I'd probably have TBC but with the change that Outland is level 60 and just new zones for some dailies or something like that, released one at a time (kind of like Silithus in 1.8). And then remove flying mounts, of course. The funny thing is, originally Hellfire were meant to be part of vanilla - so I basically want that original idea instead of how it became a new xpac.
---
In other words, if Outland didn't replace Azeroth and flying mounts wasn't there, TBC would have been a win for me.
---
Lightwell is extremely situational, at best.  It is not worth the point.    
---
If it allowed heals while you're being attacked, that would be one thing, but since it doesn't, its a bust.  Divine Spirit is much more useful overall.  
---
That's a good build. I personally prefer 3 points in Feral Insticts for leveling instead of Feral Agression. Better stealth for PvP and more threat for tanking dungeons.
---
Everyone hypes up Devouring Plague but a Cleanse from a Paladin and *poof* its gone, along with a magic debuff. Shadowguard is easily Purge-able, but guess who doesn't have Shamans.
---
I see your knowledge of Blizzard games is limited. Research, you shall do, young padawan.
---
"Is it a Paladin?"
---
Imp Clap is just...bad. I wish it wasn't, but it's one of the worst talents in the game. Too bad they don't buff it to it's TBC version and then MAYBE it would be worth taking. The wep specializations are way too good to pass up, you have 5 extra points in there that are better spent on a wep spec even if you're not using that class of weapon 100% of the time.
---
The only thing about leveling with a shaman is I'd make sure to rush MS rather than maybe picking up Crulty first since with healer back up you won't be rage starved and MS and proc WF for good times.
---
There are some decent farming places for priests with holy nova.  While nowhere close to what a mage can produce, we are capable of doing some solo farming in certain places.  
---
This type of video proves 
---
1) that ref pally IS behind, which many people were in doubt of/ wanted to convince themselves it wasn’t so bad
---
2) the maximum potential dps of each spec
---
I am truly amazed that you don’t find this proves anything - am I being trolled ?
---
No idea what that has to do with my comment, tho. I simply said TBC had superior class design for druids.
---
Also, stop assuming one can't like both vanilla and later xpacs. I love vanilla, but I also love TBC. Yes, TBC had flaws, but so did vanilla. Two versions of WoW, both great.
---
Hey I looked through the whole list and couldn’t find any addons. I feel some addons are ‘required’ but definitely should be noted as a part to better enjoy the experience. 
---
Comment of the week!
---
Thank you for all your hard work my man. Lots of awesome info here.
---
It has never been dis-allowed. 
---
I hope you like carrying the flag in BGs and buffing raids because that’s about all you’ll be doing lol
---
Hey tmanowen,
---
I did have that in mind but we know so little about addons right now - how they are going to work etc. and there also seem to be no websites out there that are built for addon downloads for Classic alone (future feature for the site). Plenty for private servers but they are neither here nor there in consistency and of little use to Classic players at the moment.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Of the people i played classic with who want to do so again, i have yet to find one that has said.
---
&gt;You know anon, i dont want to play if there's sharding.
---
The ones that dont want to play are far bigger in the idea they did it once why do it again. I find it hard to believe outside of the absolutists that people will deprive them selves an experience because of feature, even if it is a terrible one. On the other hand as a person who lived through launch and knows what popular server queue times were You arent going to convince people to come play your game if they wait from nearly 2-4 hours to get into a game nightly.
---
There's always the challenge of optimizing your rotation. SoC-&gt;Autoattack is fine but slow. SotC-&gt;Judgement-&gt;SoC-&gt;Autoattack is slightly better. But SoC/SoR-&gt;Autoattack-&gt;HoJ+Judgement-&gt;SoC/SoR-&gt;Autoattack-&gt;Hammer of Wrath while weaving with a swing timer feels like you're actually a holy warrior who mixes spellcasting with face smashing and is probably the best bit of class fantasy you'll get in your mechanical content.
---
If you don't like vanilla in all its unbalanced glory, then go play retail.
---
\#nochanges
---
yeah i typed that comment very poorly lmao
---
5 minutes lol okay.
---
Pardon the pun, but WOW!!!!
---
Thank you so much this helps the community so much by centralizing information.
---
I played in balance in late Vanilla as well, you might have taken it a bit too literal there haha. I do enjoy them in vanilla as well. Although as i stated, my favorite time to be a boomie was WotLK through Cata. I think they're unique because they bring a lot to the table besides just raw dps, yes you have SS/HS as warlock, but in the end i just feel like any other "generic" caster when playing say warlock. And i just think there's something super cool and unique about having a dedicated form (giant chicken) for casting. About balance viability, i can't help but thinking that we might have played it wrong during vanilla, maybe we're supposed to stack spirit for more mana regen? I dont know. Not a lot of spirit gear with +hit on it tho.
---
You're most welcome! Depending on what server you roll on, I'd hope to see you around and run some dungeons with you! I'll (most likely) be rolling a druid this go around and want to try out healing or tanking. It sounds like either way we'd cut it, we'd have good synergy.
---
See you in Ashenvale Alliance scum ;)
---
Well if you look at the latest private servers you will notice that the frequency of warlocks become smaller and smaller as the server progresses. I blame min-maxing guilds that prfioritize top caster loot to mages (which is the power house come AQ and Naxx)
---
Enhancement Shaman
---
&gt;why are you trying to argue something you have no idea about? in 2006 this would be true its just not anymore.
---
But I do know what I am talking about, and unlike you I can actually be bothered to argue my case instead of just claiming everyone else is wrong.
---
&gt; go ask anyone in the top 3 guilds atm theyll tell you the exact same thing. 
---
Appeal to authority fallacy as well, that's great.
---
&gt; MC will die before 7days on classic and it wont be the warriors theyre waiting on 
---
Again, another fallacy. I never said Warriors were so slow they cant get to 60 at roughly the same time as other classes. The difference between every class in terms of leveling speed is minor. Warriors are still by far the slowest out of the bunch though.
---
The simple truth is that melee DPS is far more reliant on their gear than any other class. When leveling and just do not have access to good equipment for the most of the experience, especially when trying to level fast which means that Warriors and Rogues will never at any point pre 60 be able to reach the full potential of their class. Every other class apart from these on the other hand have tools or class mechanics that let them ignore the gear gap for the most part and level quite efficient regardless.
---
Now, if you can be arsed to argue exactly what makes it so that Warriors can level faster than some of the other classes then please go ahead. Otherwise I think it's pretty obvious that you are just another clueless person spreading nonsense. It's very common on this reddit.
---
That’s a fair point, but wouldn’t the same go for patch itemization? I thought they claimed it’s going to be 1 patch, and add content through raids / bosses throughout, not based upon specific patches like 1.6 / 1.8 etc. 
---
Also, isn’t this just a compilation of information related to classic? Many people will be looking forward to some addons and be looking for them in particular, is it that wrong to have them in your list? (Even if they won’t work for the servers release)
---
Rogues are definitely less desired in bgs than wpvp but locks are fairly useful in all forms of pvp, premade groups will always take 1-2 locks depending on composition.
---
Generally though a lot more mages are taken in premade bgs than warlocks , that's true but locks have their own useful tools they bring to a fight and their burst in some specs is much greater than mages, it's also worth mentioning that locks don't really need to leave combat to drink and can stay in the fight indefinitely so long as their healers can heal, which is not the case for a mage. 
---
Agony
---
Meme?
---
It is not easy, even if feral you are more of a support and secondary DPS. 
---
You don't have OP burst damage talents like 45% ambush crit and mana management is an issue and you will feel it. But at least you should be able to get away from the fights you can not win assuming the wandering mobs are not an issue (which is often not the case).
---
All of them and more. Before testing paladin on p-server, I was like everyone on this sub who asked about raid viability.
---
Playing on pserver made me realize, raiding is a small part of the whole picture. 
---
I just considered what I want to accomplish, how much time I want to spend in the game. 
---
Stuff like that. 
---
It's a very individual list. But my biggest things were: 
---
Versitlity in dungeons, how good in bg, how much preperation before raids, and how good the class can grind.
---
Wow is all about the grind. 
---
Yep- you will always be somewhat viable if you spec at least 20 (preferably 21) into holy to get full illumination + divine favor.  Also maintaining a gear set obviously with plenty of int, +heal, and mp/5.  Spirit is basically useless for a paladin but other healers (druid and priest basically) get a lot of benefit from it. 
---
The weapon is by far the strongest part of Ret spec- you want something that is slow swinging, high top end.  Overall DPS matters of course, but top-end damage is probably your primary stat.
---
Cheap options for Ret PVP could be the AV mace, arcanite reaper if you want to farm a couple hundred gold, or any 2h mace/sword that you can find from literally ANY of the end-game 5 mans or UBRS.  If you can get into a raiding guild, paladins and warriors can typically claim first dibs on good 2h weaps so if you are a consistent attender you should get high on the list for those.   1st prio is probably 2h DPS warriors or a DPS Ret if you guys actually have it, but after that the healers/warr tanks should have next crack at it. 
---
Yes that's true. Unfortunately Vanilla is probably the most min-max version of the game ever. It's a situation where two players of the same gear can vary wildly depending on how much they are min-maxing with talents, buffs, consumables etc. Especially among melee where you can probably double your dps by using the correct stuff. A good example is dps warriors, if they go to raid as Arms pvp spec then pretty much all they can do is auto-attack and heroic strike. Mortal Strike takes up a debuff and Bloodthirst is in the fury tree so they just end up doing no damage and since it's quite expensive to switch back and forth between specs many warriors will pull every trick in the book to be allowed to raid as Arms. Compare that to a warlock raiding as SL/NF or conflag/NF there's only like a 20% dps decrease over using a raid spec like SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin, completely allowable in raids imo. 
---
Currently In the early stages of forming a Alliance and Horde guild for classic. Pulling from a decent sized pool of former guild members and friends I have made throughout the 15 years I’ve been playing WoW. Members range from casual to top end raiders (Former Never Winter and Vodka Raiders). Nothing is set in stone yet so come be a part of the process of building the foundation of our guilds.

Ret is actually pretty solid in pvp, you just don’t have many great options for gear until aq40 if your raiding. Once you start to get to 1k ap and 25% crit you can actually do really good burst damage. 
---
Its pretty random burst damage, but with a paladins naturally high defences it’s just a matter of time before the dice rolls in your favour. 
---
According to the server very much on pvp, but surprisingly fall off on pve servers. 
---
Zg, Aq, and Naxx have very few bosses that fear. Dwarf priests will only be necessary for speedrunning/world first (and human will probably be better for the raids I listed above world first) and if you want to carry really bad groups.
---
&gt; and the people there are far less toxic than those on the official forums.
---
A forum can only be less toxic if it's heavily moderated, and then you'll get people reeing about nazi mods.
---
Druid is the only class in Vanilla that give me this feeling when I see them: "oh a druid, I'll just run over there and kill him"
---
A fair comment - I know what you mean re: looking forward to particular addons like Yet Another Hunter Timer, Bartender etc.
---
I'm planning to get in touch with addon developers directly in the future regarding their plans and will update accordingly.
---
AGI gives crit which scales much better from 1-59. The dodge also gives you a lot of damage reduction so you can stay in cat longer.
---
&gt;Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?
---
&gt;Charges generated by the forced crit when you sit do not activate reckoning.

---
Male or female nelf
---
That is the million dollar question 
---
Casual players have this mindset, that they deeply care about their savegames/invested time in a character and the like.
---
More hardcore players don't care about invested time because they mostly play to improve themselfes.
---
I have a friend who quit a single player game because after a patch he had to restart his savegame, you can't convince those people to play just for funsies and experience. They simply have a different mindset.
---
I don't know where else to post this but I don't think the base stats calculator has the correct health regeneration values for spirit based regeneration.
---
Warriors have the highest spirit based coefficient in the game, but it shows Mages, Hunters, Paladins, Shamans, Priests, and Druids as having significantly higher health regen coefficients.
---
The correct values are available online.
---
So an unconfirmed forum post.
---
nice
---
No QH for me, never used one. I do know most zones, though - so won’t really need it anyway. Overall I’ll only use a few addons like auto attack timer for hunter and a bag addon.
---
Nah I just misread. I could do the same early but I am working with some old memories. No private servers or anything for me to keep me fresh.
---
The reality is everyone thinks like this and rolls human because they think dwarves are ugly. Then you get a guild with 6 human/Nelf priests and 2 dwarfs. The dwarves get to do whatever they want, show up late to raids, etc. and still get raid spots over the humans. As a result, you are constantly hunting for good dwarf priests and as a human/nelf priest your raid spot is constantly at risk of getting replaced by a dwarf if he ever surfaces. 
---
I'll be playing a Tauren Warrior instead of Orc or Undead because I'm not a fan of the Orc combat animations (they are too hunched over) and the Undead just look too frail.
---
If you wanting to farm in the open world, I would actually suggest playing on a PVP server. The reason for this is that you can pressure the opposing faction away from your farming spot. Otherwise you literally have double the competition and are unable to do anything about it.
---
I use to hide in that tower in hillsbrad to do the cougar quest. it had undead guards that would help me gank them damm rogues lol.
---
Heal spec is really fun, because you have a 2 sec heal, a 2.5 sec heal, and a 3 sec heal to keep it interesting. And, you also get to see your gear.
---
He’s also using the stack building glitch, losing all credibility on dps then IMO. 
---
In this case, the challenge is the reward.  Smite priests would be doing around 650 DPS before gear, which would be pretty insane for tier 1 raids. and you'd have as many fear wards and power infusions as you have priests.  I agree with you that it probably won't work in classic, but if it did it might make for a decent cheese strategy.
---
The original comment I responded to said 5 days played is greater than having fun. I acknowledge that if you min-max your performance will be better, but thats not what this post is about.
---
Alrighty, thanks for the info, hope my university has a good enough internet connection
---
Alliance is a super fun change from horde
---
Visually beautiful early levels
---
Personally I like the dwarf and gnome starter zones better but human still good
---
Do yourself a favour and split levelling between Dun Morough and Elwynn. You won’t burn out, won’t need to grind, and it’s so damn cool the environment change 
---
Yikes. I dont think anyone is going to give Thunderfury to someone trying to do a spell damage warrior build. Also the first 2 raids are full of mobs with fire resistance. You would do more spell damage using normal warrior items  + shadow oil on your weapons.
---
Yup! I want to main a druid, but I want to go balance if possible, and guessing that just won't be allowed anywhere except a very tolerant RP guild . . . 
---
You are not repaired 
---
This is exactly the way vanilla WoW was supposed to be played!  Good video /s
---
enhancement is indeed the inferior spec compared to elemental as many people in this threat have said but this is relative  , I'll go into details to give you an idea.
---
First and foremost , regardless of whichever spec you decide to play both shaman specs rely heavily on proper gear and stats to play optimally, this is even more emphasized for elemental as early raiding and dungeon gear does not offer good spells damage/crit options for a decent elemental build, this forces early elemental mains to go the BGs route and try to rank up for that R13 set asap prior to BWL ( as that is where gear from pve onward starts being useful to ele shammies), for Enh you can grab a few craftables from here and there but they don't even come close to the R13 set, the closest thing to that would be AQ gear which is quite some distance away, on the upside though you can get sulfuras early if you're in a raiding guild and that weapon is broken on enh shammies.
---
Now that we've spoken about the requirements i'll go into details about the specs:
---
\-Enhancement : is an extremely rng spec, sometimes you can 1 shot clothies , and most often you will do nothing but auto attack for 30 secs straight, the problem with this is that you have limited time to connect to the target as most fights or players will not stand there letting you auto attack.
---
Another big issue with enhancement is their vulnerability to being kited , unlike other classes who have some form of gap closer, shamans just like paladins have to run up to their target fully exposed, ghost wolf has a cast time of 1 sec even if talented and does not remove snares , hunters will kite you for years and make you cry as enh, but there are ways to counter this , mainly using free action potion and rocket boots but even then your uptime on the target will be limited and might not be fruitful rng-wise, i'd say enh is better vs immobile classes in general , especially warlocks/priests.
---
\-Elemental: is heavily crit reliant but once you reach a certain gear level it will become a very dangerous spec, their spells have high co-efficiency and with a bit of SP/ crit you will delete people, however ele has mana issues and you will be unable to stay in any fight for too long, as such your job is to delete a target asap and then get out of the fight to drink.
---
Elemental is mostly a premade group pvp sort of spec just like warriors, that's where they shine best, solo pvp on an ele shaman is okay i guess but is significantly behind other classes that have the potential to fight multiple targets at once ( like mage for example).
---
\-Resto shamans are very bad in pvp in general, they have mana issues, their most powerful heals (chain heals ) are never used in group pvp and their single target heals are weaker than other healers, they are very prone to being tunneled and killed as they are the least durable healer of the 4, the only reason people want shamans in pvp is for totems / purge and off heals via lesser healing wave, all of which can be done on an elemental shaman without costing a healer's spot.
---
Hope this gives you an idea on the subject. 
---
Makes sense, good point. No go on the PVP though, not a fan of it and I'm playing on a PVE server at the moment and will be moving with the guild when classic come out to a PVE server. 
---
Damn fine resources +1 respect. 
---
Hey there,
---
Believe my I have searched far and wide for 'correct' values for spirit health regeneration - accurate figures just don't exist on the internet. If you have access to these values yourself then I will gladly review it again.
---
I adjusted them for the third time a week ago but there is still some contention on exactly how much they should be :)
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
Any raid leader that replaces a consistant, skilled and good Nelf/Human priest for a late/crappy dwarf isnt worth their salt.
---
Seriously, whilst Fear Ward is unanimously better than StarShards or Feedback, it's perfectly possible to do those encounters without it. Warriors have a personal fear break for a reason, and it's not like there are THAT many encounters with fears.
---
I absolutely loved raiding and dungeons in Wildstar, way ahead of it's time. Basically mythic raiding and mythic+ in WoW nowdays, but no easy mode difficulties. Despite the bugs and terrible performance, the game was amazing for hardcore players. To bad many people didn't give it a chance because of graphics. The game will always have a place in my hearth R.I.P.
---
I probably had not enough gold :)
---
Yea, cruelty is definitely after MS. Thanks for the info I will forever forget thunderclap, I thought it would be decent for us doing aoe pulls while leveling?
---
Lol?
---
that sounds like a toxic guild and nothing like what i've experienced. Any guild that is gunna drop good raiders over bad raiders because of fear ward is probably not a great guild to be in anyway. If you're a good healer and show up with consumes and on time you'll be fine finding a permanent raid spot in a solid raiding guild.
---
I think a big part of the reason people complain on forums is because they think it matters, like Blizzard is going to read *their* message and take notice. Same thing with /r/wow (because we've seen that they actually have taken notice of things being posted there). 
---
But here and on the unofficial forums, not so much. And it's the same demographic, but surely less incentive to ree about how "ret pally sux, buff pls but no changes" or dumb shit like that.
---
Either that or the mods here are so "nazi" that we don't even notice them anymore.
---
&gt; I have zero intention of playing TBC or later expansions
---
Same, I quit playing in TBC for a reason, and I have no desire to return there. 
---
&gt;My decision to be horde is totally irrelevant to information potentially not provided.
---
Also same, I like the Horde zones and lore better, plush I have an affinity for all things horror so the undead fit me and I them like a glove. Although, I do plan on actually leveling some alts past 30 this time around and I really want to try some Trolls, probably a Shaman and/or Mage, maybe priest but we'll see. 
---
I honestly have no idea if they still do that, but last time I picked a server.... prolly... in... TBC there were different time zones.
---
I really enjoyed his onyxia attunement videos 
---
I'd like to see feral dps.
---
Totally agree! The amount of people who played when wow was at its absolute cultural peak is ridiculously high. I think this is going to exceed expectations by a landslide and we might have a whole new MMO revival. A boy can dream... lol
---
Also when did your wow diary get delivered? Do you live in the US? I want to pick one up but heard they still hadnt arrived from one of my friends who was a backer.
---
Great choice. Super underrated class. For me it was a long battle between priest and druid. But the druid won, so much versatility. 
---
See you in moonglade!
---
The skills is good if you have rage to spare and are taking more damage than you'd like, but the talent is rubbish.
---
It's basically splitting the server up into lots of temporary mini-servers.
---
In classic, the developers are planning to use sharding in the starter zones to stabilize server populations, as a lot of 'tourists' from BFA will likely be flooding the start zones for the first few days. The aim of Blizzard using sharding in classic is to prevent servers from becoming full/locked due to how popular they are, causing players to funnel into other realms, only for the tourists to leave, resulting in some realms being dead. 
---
Classic fans can over-react, and you can see people in this thread claim that it means PvP will be disrupted and bosses will be on different shards, with people inviting other players to swap between shards. The reality is that the developers have confirmed that they know sharding is bad for classic, and they know it's especially bad in areas where players are competing (for either resources [nodes], world bosses or pvp), and they've specifically said it needs to be time-limited.
---
It's a trade-off, you can either shard elwynn forest on popular realms on release, or face the chance of your realm dying pre-maturely due to unstable realm populations. Some would rather some servers die to satisfy the "no changes" mindset, others (including blizzard) prefer having a higher chance at stable realms in return for temporary start zone sharding.
---
In consider that pretty satisfying. Not crazy burst but some survivability. Sounds fun! 
---
“Good healer”
---
The personal fear break has a cd that makes it impossible to immune all fears on the bosses. When people make this argumemt, I just assume you have never been to AQ40 or fought Nef without Fear Ward. By your same logic, they gave each race a fear break in addition to a warrior's for a reason.
---
Sure, its possible to do the encounters without fear ward. Its possible to kill Ony with 40 paladins too. Doesnt mean you should, especially when trying to progress. 
---
I would agree that you shouldnt replace a reliable priest with an unreliable one but if you do find that reliable dwarf you will be getting him in your raids.
---
Please. This community loses it's shit over the smallest things, with long multipage rants about how the game is ruined forever and about how Blizzard is staffed by stupid cucks, etc, etc.
---
I mean... have you seen unbreakable? Is this really a question?
---
Agreed. Shapeshift is a big mana drain. if you pop out for a moon fire root heal dot, you have *justtt* enough mana for another shapeshift but that’s it 
---
Yup, ff11 was the big mmo alongside everquest prior to wow.
---
It indeed made a lot of the same mistakes that invalidated old content by adding a bunch of level cap increases and expansions, and afaik they did it even faster than wow did. It was a much more hardcore game with exp loss on death and having to farm hundreds of thousands of gil to afford gear just to be viable in xp parties to go level up. When wow came out it was considered the easy carebear MMO haha! Which is saying something considering these days vanilla wow is the "hard" mode...
---
It's when you think your just going to fart but some poop comes out.
---
Shockadin is tough to make work early in the game. You need tons of spellpower gear and the Zandalari trinket and a weapon with a spell dmg proc to get those fat bursts. Early in the gearing cycle, spell power is low compared to survivability. This scales in the Shockadin's favor throughout the game if you can get full T2 and stuff, but until at least BWL/ZG are on farm, you're gonna be hurting for burst damage.
---
I'll keep this in mind thanks! 
---
If you're concerned about making gold just pick professions to make you money. Perhaps double gather mining/herbalism. Or herbalism/alchemy. A mostly noncombative method of making gold. I was a prot warrior and generated most of my gold via professions and AH
---
I will pm when servers go live :) will see how it goes
---
I think you misinterpreted what I said. Obviously you dont want ro replace reliable humans with flaky dwarves.Thus, guilds are constantly trying to find reliable dwarves. My point is more that it's harder to find good dwarf priests than you might think and that everyone rolls human thinking some other guy will roll dwarf and make up for it.
---
Sounds like a free HK either way
---
You shouldn't really have any downtime as a feral druid by level 30 or 40, especially since you get innervate by then.
---
As long as your gear is up to date you should be able to kill 3 to 4 mobs in cat &gt; shift out and cast 1 or 2 heals &gt; go back to cat. By the time you're done killing the next 3 mobs you'll have regenerated back to full mana.
---
At that point you're only limiting factor is how fast you can kill mobs. Technically OoC is a dps increase because you get more Claws but it doesn't compare to the dps increase + extra utility you get from investing those 11 points into the Feral tree sooner.
---
Think of it this way, imagine two level 30 feral druids, one took OOC first and the other went straight down the feral tree. At that level the OOC druid has 10% dmg boost (Natural Weapons), the occasional free spell, and -5 energy cost on claw. The pure feral druid has -5 energy, 30% movespeed, 6% crit, +45 AP (Predatory Strikes), double combo point generation, and either Faerie or 10% dmg on Claw.
---
So yeah, you could cast the occasional Regrowth for free and kill things at a snail's pace or you can kill things fast with no downtime anyway.
---
That please. 
---
- Online players have the WoW icon next to their name.

In all seriousness I plan to play the main tank of the guild I'll be forming, hence thunderfury.

This is probably the most rewarding part of vanilla WoW. It's so much fun helping along a fellow guildie or friend and getting them psyched on the game. Bust out those few elite quests to get some cool gear, do those really long arduous escort quests, running them through a dungeon so they can complete the quests and get a ton of gear upgrades. That's how you build friendships!

I just haven’t seen an issue finding dwarf priests who are good tbh. Pugs sometimes seem to struggle but honestly good players roll dwarf Because that’s just who they are 
---
I see why you had to pug so much.
---
Exactly this. I find the people that complain about the "grind" are the ones that don't actually try to enjoy the game, but force their way through content like its some kind of job.....Then complain about it not being fun.
---
wow launch druid is on a whole other tier of garbage.  people talk about how good they are at leveling (which is true by 1.12) but most people don't remember/understand the pain of trying to level a druid at launch.  too lazy to find the patch notes but the amount of buffs cat and bear received is ridiculous and the talent tree (not fixed until 1.8) is also laughably bad.  not to mention innervate wasn't baseline until 1.11.  
---
If you launch current WoW directly through it's .exe, it will prompt you to log in just like classic. I'm sure it's not too difficult for someone to create an identical 'fake launcher', with the play button just linking to the .exe. It sounds like a fun little project, actually!
---
You'll also get to manually log in every time.
---
All of the above if you ride the road in STV you better be the big boy in the zone.
---
no ur fucking dumb using a pig/owl over a cat LOL its the first time ive heard of anyone suggesting that
---
Ah so this won’t work for the fury damage talent either then?
---
Awesome vid. But also reminds me not to play meele. That buff bar is ridiculous. 
---
yeah agi gives crit and also some armor and dodge, however your most valuable stat is still AP and you get far more from strength than from agi.
---
agi is still your 3rd most desirable stat, but str and sta just provide more.
---
I’d just stick to any eu server, not much point in playing one with higher ping just seems counter intuitive.
---
I'm fairly similar. Hopped on brother's account early on, got to 30-ish doing lord knows buying white vendor staves. Tried filling in for his friend in MC, got him kicked out of his guild. Finally got my own account and then got to about 45 before BC hit.
---
I don’t get why so many people dismiss bear for cat levelling
---
Even fully talented, at level 30 bear is more efficient than cat
---
It kills *slightly* slower by such a small amount that the better regen and armor allow you to chainpull and rip through mobs at a far faster rate than cat which you have to stop to heal every couple mobs
---
Bear gets such a bad wrap but it ruins cat for grinding
---
If I have a spare 20min, I will sometimes log on and just help random people out. Offering my services as defense against the enemy faction. I have made loads of friends this way and sometimes people even tip me gold for helping :)
---
I thought the title said "Sun priest" and then I immediately thought how awesome a priest based on sunlight would be.  
---
That's exactly how you play the game. None of this rushing min/max rubbish.

PRAISE IT

Ordered it during the kickstarter, I'm thinking October or November. I got it at the beginning of the year. Halfway through and have enjoyed it so far. It's semi technical, but focuses on events, culture, and mindset.
---
The only other glaring issue with TBC was the hallway dungeon design, I don't know why they thought it was a good idea, but it took so much away from the interesting dungeon layouts in Vanilla.
---
Feral with powershifting can actually deal like ~80% the damage of a combat dagger rogue, its really not bad if you go the extra distance and effort.
---
Until you run out of mana to powershift and spam shred, at least, then your dps really drops.
---
I haven't seen the video in a long time, but isn't it just a bunch of crit porn?  
---
Just got arms, get a 2hander and kite with hamstring.
---
Take your upvote and be gone!
---
Some people insist it's true vanilla but the general consensus is that facestabbing is a private server mechanic, likely caused by server refresh/update rates.
---
I played a shit ton of rogue/druid back in vanilla and would bet pretty much anything that it won't exist on official servers. I even did some quick searching and couldn't find any results older than 2011 referencing facestabbing/fronstabbing/frontshredding.
---
The absolute MAXIMUM potential DPS that a ret can do is the average dps of a rogue or fury warrior in T2/T2.5
---
Sounds about right, actually.
---
I am confused about this fix though, not trying to deny it or whatever just not sure how its fixed. I play paladin and so when I sit, I still get crit? does it just not add reckoning stacks unless I'm standing and get crit or what?
---
I think it will do really well, if it ever releases. I've been hyped for so long I am numb!
---
Um... I've had at least two conversations similar to this one in the past year with acquaintances. It's more common than you'd think.
---
Nope. Crit aura just affects ppl in same raid group. So 5% crit for 5 people isnt good enough that dps loss. Maybe one feral in melee group is viable, but its not optimal.
---
It would be nice if we can have a server of each type with a a rule that streamers can have there accounts suspended.
---
The feelings that the general population has about enhancement are usually based off of crit porn videos that they watched back in vanilla. A crit porn video is where the video is just a massive collage of the biggest crits they were able to achieve, without much of the actual toe to toe game play in between. It's super easy to string 50 huge crits together in a video if you played 200 hours of PVP and stripped away all the times you *didn't* crit and got absolutely shit on.  
---
Lets get real here though, most PVP videos are just showing the highlights, but no where does that happen more than in enhancement and ret paladin PVP videos.  
---
Elemental could very well also just be a collage of crit porn videos considering how bursty they can be, but between the two specs, they're more likely to have gameplay in between bursts that is still of a high skill cap and wide range of use. [For example.](https://youtu.be/ouM4uCQF3ik)  
---
If you do one for rogues or warriors, I'd kill to see a comparison between humans and non-humans using sword spec.
---
That's the case for a LOT of classes, honestly. Ret paladins feel like the spec they were meant to be in TBC, and not woefully incomplete, like they do in vanilla.
---
The only thing I really disliked about TBC was Resilience and how it shit on builds that depended on burst crit to PvP.
---
I suspect that an add-on like [ShooShards](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9041-ShooShards.html) will be updated for Classic which can also solve that problem.
---
(It's a very simple slider that lets you choose how many shards not in a soul bag you want to hold on to.)
---
I know, I'm mostly just curious about what the max potential is.
---
No, he’s just an idiot who has no reference point for dps, so he thinks 1200 is high for a buffstacked max geared dps. 
---
This is kind of what I was getting at. Screw the racials, maybe I wanted to play a Tauren Hunter or a Night Elf Warrior.
---
On retail if you sit, you still get crit but it doesn't proc anything.
---
At low levels, Druid’s don’t have the survivability they need to really do anything other than tank people a few levels below you. I ganked as a kitty but it involved stealthing behind someone who had just downed a mob and then being a dick. 
---
The good thing of course is that if you don’t immediately kill them you can always run away.

I remember doing neffy, Ony, and other such feary things in a guild with zero dwarf priests and we just did regular tank swaps. Every time a Warrior popped their fear break one of the off tanks ensured they got feared so they could take over. 
---
Given how may convoluted mechanics there are in raids nowadays, adding a tank swap to the much simpler Vanilla raids didn't make any of the fights much harder. 
---
I'll never argue that Fear Ward doesnt make those fights easier, same as grounding totem, but its nothing you couldnt solve with a couple of prot warriors tank swapping whilst their breaks cooled down.
---
Explain to me why cat is better with out saying "LOL moar dmg u scrub" or some other brainlet nonsequitor. I'm 100% sure you have never played a hunter; at least I hope so. If you have, you were clearly the epitome of "huntard". You don't know what pets are good or why, and you just went with cat because you heard attack speed is good.
---
My whole comment was about how attack speed in virtually irrelevant for leveling, because it doesn't do shit except for frenzy procs which are MINIMAL when you are talking about a .2 increase. So it was literally directed at people like you who don't understand what makes pets good and just listen to other idiots.
---
You clearly don't even know what screech is. You don't know what it's like speedrunning pets and not having to worry about food and bandages. You know nothing about pets other than attack speed, which is why someone recommending other leveling pets is blowing your mind.
---
If you think BT is an auto get, you're also just completely ignorant and haven't even played on private servers. It's extremely time consuming and 100% not worth it unless you are doing end game pvp.
---
You’re gonna have a blast!
---
Agreed. It's ignorance and unwarranted fear is all.
---
Nice I went from choosing paladin to landing on shaman. Chain heal for dayZ
---
Because he mainly wants classic to make money while the real fans that actually played classic just want to have fun.
---
He didn't even play vanilla.
---
[Fury Warrior Guide from Hiddeh](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-fury-warrior-guide/)
---
Noticed there wasn't much of a Fury guide outside the spreadsheets.
---
The math checks out.
---
Classic will have a fuckton of players early on. Streamer influence will be huge for the first months. 
---
Troll is optimal in for most stuff, isn't it? Berserking is broken AF.
---
I don’t roll warrior because I like the rogue class. 
---
Bc improved everyone, but most of all the hybrids. Warlocks too
---
This is such a cynical outlook, and I don't think it's really based on anything.
---
On private servers where their talents are bugged.
---
I was 100% set on Shaman healer but then I remembered how the druid T3 looks and boy...
---
Give me the class design of tbc with the vanilla world. That's the dream
---
30/0/21 elemental / resto build... I think is the most consistent performer... high enough damage and heals to keep you from getting owned...
---
Nature swiftness is amazing.
---
PUG BG = Horde
---
Premade BG = Alliance
---
Added.
---
They are separate issues
---
If you like a game and it’s fun, play it
---
If you feel like your life isn’t progressing properly, sometimes comparing yourself to friends can be healthy other times it might just serve to make you feel bad.
---
You can both play Classic and achieve your life goals in tandem
---
I’m the opposite, I love vanilla Druid but don’t care for it much after.. I’m worried they will go to TBC and I don’t wanna play Druid.. my dilemma.
---
Horde has higher representation in PvP, but I think most would agree Alliance is stronger in organized PvP.
---
Solo Allies do have a tendency to avoid WPvP I think its fair to say, but as long as you find a guild with an interest in PvP on the Alliance side you shouldn't have any problems.
---
Man, you'd think pservers would have people who know what theyre doing, but the amount of huntards is ridiculous. Had a hunter need on ravager axe and win it over my warrior. So as valid as your argument is, there is a large portion of hunters that do not understand their class.
---
Without fear ward, there is always a chance to blow up your raid with shadow flame on Nef. MT gets feared into the raid, OT picks up boss. Fear breaks and MT is standing in raid with top threat. Boss turns and blows up raid with shadow flame. 
---
It is low likelihood if your OT and MT are good at immuning fears. But its still a real thing that happens from time to time. AQ 40 Bug Trio is even worse. 
---
Yeah, launch druid was a whole other crapshow, but I feel like vanilla took it from little more than a concept of the class (launch) to what should honestly not be more than an alpha version. TBC took it to something that you can have in a released game.
---
Launch was a shitshow in terms of class design overall.
---
I agree, most classes got way better designs in TBC. I also feel like hunter won quite a bit in design.
---
Still, I just personally feel like druids in vanilla were another tier of shitshow, hence I feel TBC improved more on druids than any other class. Never played much paladin, so can't comment on that class - the only one I haven't played enough to know properly.
---
Well I have not read the comments but I was Full ret with 20 points into holy. I got a solid red gear after some time. All I can say is, I loved beeing a paladin especially the fact that I could heal in raids but for pvp and dungens i could be ret without respeck:)
---
Check this out and you're good
---
https://youtu.be/zkF8Xz_hnoc
---
Get the nicker as a 2hand and skullforge reaver + 6/8 lightforge +2 spelldamage plates (BRD Arena/DM) and you can start 
---
Well put. Yeah, I think for launch day Blizzard probably has the right idea. Although, it's looking like they'll probably split it into too many shards, to the point where it'll give new players the wrong idea about what's to come when sharding ends.
---
But personally, I gotta have no shards at all for the fresh servers that come out after the initial launch, when they don't have the "too many new players" excuse.
---
Yeah, I would agree that druids benefited most from their TBC redesign.
---
"Im just gonna comment Lol? instead of making a proper point so everyone think I am an idiot"
---
Server merges. You don't need servers like "Illidan - Vanilla" "Illidan - TBC" "Illidan - Wrath." 
---
Also, threat is going to be a bigger issue now that everyone knows the optimal way to play their class. Obviously, the MT can push much more threat if he isn't feared for half the fight. Having fear ward can nearly half the time you spend fighting the boss. 
---
Again, its possible to do everything without fear ward just like its possible to do these things with 40 paladins. Doesn't mean you should, and fear ward is not just something that makes the mechanics easier. It increases threat and therfore increases raid wide dps.
---
I'm nearly there on deciding to main druid as well. Def want to tank for BiS'ing, and can remain an OT for raids or switch to healing. Then-- you still get sweet hybrid skills for PvP.
---
&gt;They are supposed to be HoT healers
---
Where does it say that?
---
? Lol
---
Classic will die if it's split into 7 different expansions, it will also die if we're stuck on Vanilla with 1 new raid release per year. 
---
&gt;The only thing I really disliked about TBC was Resilience
---
You cant have played much Vanilla PvP if you think Resilience is a bad thing. Once AQ has been out for a while, PvP mostly comes down to who can oneshot each other first. It's not fun.
---
You're not much of a PvPer I guess? Flag running is kinda fun.
---
&gt;If you're going to "upgrade vanilla" route, you need a massive team to push out fast content and balance changes.
---
I would prefer that over going back to fucking wrath(downfall of WoW). and I think vanilla content lasts much longer considering how long it takes clear and gear up from content, compared to retail where you get gear thrown in your face 24/7
---
Eh, probably. But I've accepted the fact that Classic wouldn't exist at all if Blizz was forced to optimize servers to support 2000 people standing in one spot at the AQ gates. 
---
What are you talking about? They have two competitive healing specs, and a very competitive tank spec that work for every raid in the game.
---
https://youtu.be/C8BPATSVpRg
---
Push your limits and you'll have no time for even thinking about cutting your wrists... okay maybe if you're traveling, but sure not infight.
---
Shapeshifting used to be on a 1.5 second global delay. The Natural Shapeshifter talent in the balance tree used to reduce that global delay by 0.5/1.0/1.5 seconds.
---
I love Druids but they were laughably bad in vanilla. It took Blizzard two expacs to bring them up to par with other classes.
---
I remember back when I played Runescape somebody got me with the "free gem cutting" scam. I added him to remember to report him daily. Then a couple weeks later I totally forgot who he was and just messaged him like "hey what's up" assuming he was just a friend. 
---
Nice anecdotal evidence.
---
What do you consider "much" PvP?
---
My Mage main was a Knight-Captain from casually doing BGs when I wasn't raiding, and I had several 49 twinks of rank 4+
---
I remember TBC and giving up on PvP because it was straight up impossible to kill healers. They could just spam instant casts and out-heal and damage I could do.
---
I'll take drying to crits in 3 seconds to that shit any day.
---
Not for me, I've always played Alliance and I will be ally on Classic too.
---
I do have also one Horde char to see the stories from the other side, but I'm so used to ally places that when I play Horde I forget what faction I am, get way to close to ally outposts out of habit and guards one-shot me every.single.time LOL.
---
That's just like how it was in Vanilla.
---
The black horse of all classes.
---
I think some non-hardcore raiding guilds might take a Balance dudu, specially in a 40 man, if only for Innervate, battle res and that 3% crit buff for the party. You'll do great in 5 man though.
---
I think everyone would prefer that, but the problem is that it's not going to be an option unless Classic brings in enough subs to support the team. Which just seems extremely unlikely. 
---
You know what makes sense? Not that, not at all. What makes sense is doing -nothing-. 
---
I kinda assumed for 5-person I'd have to heal. Be awesome if I could actually run as balance full time.
---
&gt;I also feel like hunter won quite a bit in design.
---
disagree really hard on this one. I definitely agree with you that most classes got improved in TBC, but hunter imo was not one of them. I say this as a hunter main from vanilla launch day until cata. In vanilla, hunter's have the arguably highest skill cap and "complicated" playstyle in raids of any class. And in pvp they are considered up there with the highest skill cap as well. I really, really enjoy vanilla hunter. In tbc, you spec beast mastery the whole expansion for both pvp and pve, and in pve you literally can put your whole rotation into a single macro and put that on all your key binds and do max dps. TBC hunter is pretty braindead and has no spec variety. 
---
It's mostly the same add on system as legion, with a few changes to keep it more of a "vanilla experience." 
---
Short answer: No real details yet 
---
yes
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I love shaman but don't want to be forced into resto by tier gear and raid viability. I don't necessarily mind healing for raids, but I don't want to have to respec multiple times a week.  I might just do 30/0/21 in order to avoid that. 
---
I predict the WoW Classic Playerbase will be even more toxic than private servers currently show.
---
It *does* make sense. They knew that there would be a bunch of CMs and GMs missing from their staff due to their projected earnings for 2018, as they had to downsize.
---
It's fucked up. It shouldn't of even been implemented at all as loot problems shouldn't be Blizzard's worry. It seems like they want it to be their problem for some reason, but I can't guess why.
---
Thank you! I'm so excited to play around with the different talent builds. The original talent trees were amazing!
---
Private servers manage 10k people at one spot. 
---
In T6 using new character models.
---
Speak for yourself. I like vanillas bursty pvp, it's more fun imo. Resilience made pvp more slow paced and boring imo. 
---
I think troll is the best for shaman, at least in PvE. 
---
Why use Corrupted Ashbringer and not Might of Menethil?
---
Same! Whenever my friend couldn't attend a raid I would ride my moped down to his house and play his rogue for him. I remember once I got him a weapon (I can't remember which but since it was MC it might be Perdition's Blade) he was so happy that he promised to buy me a mount when I got to level 40. Little did any of us know that this would happen about mid-wrath haha. 
---
Nost just completely enlightened me and ignited my lust for vanilla. Blizzard owes them and the rest of the emulation developers a huge apology imo.
---
&gt;I love Druids but they were laughably bad in vanilla. 
---
1.12 druids are not bad. Good lategame healers that scale better than any other, and beasts in world pvp and premades (mostly WSG, but pretty good in AB as well). 
---
Same goes for paladins and shamans. Hybrid classes in vanilla were pretty underwhelming in general. While I don't like much about BC it did greatly improve the gamely and concept of the hybrid.
---
Unlimited for unlimited annoyance 
---
I'm flip flopping myself between a druid or a warlock
---
If you never played official servers you can't talk about classic as nostalgia. It was my sub and the subs of millions of others that allows you to experience all that great content for free. Going back to a pserver after to experience it again or if you missed a period is one thing, but to only play those as I read this is a problem in my opinion
---
Well yeah but I wasn't really talking about 1.12 Druids. Once they got their class rework in 1.8 they were fine.
---
They do have Power Word: Solace on retail 
---
Username checks out
---
Garbage compared to TBC because druids were straight overpowered in TBC. Druids are not bad at all in 1.12 vanilla. 
---
Overall it seems like Elemental has a higher skill-cap, which I love. I like a challenge. It seems like Enhancement is run in and get lucky with procs
---
Noted, though I feel Elemental has a higher skill-cap and can be better overall.
---
are u fucking dumb? frenzy procs are NOT minimal first of all while leveling the extra 0.2 attack speed is insane.  But ok lets say you don't want to get BT at level 37, lets just compare cat to anything else.  Cat has highest dps, he can use claw and bite and sprint, he can actually do damage so he can hold aggro? 
---
THe fuck is ur boar gonna do? eat some fucking mage bread and charge? who the fuck cares about mage bread, buy some meat u cheap fuck, don't even get me started on owl screech, or owls in general.  
---
Ur just fucking bad if u don't use a cat to level period LOL
---
&gt;Resilience made pvp more slow paced and boring imo.
---
You mean you had to actually rely on being skilled instead of relying on a pom+pyro macro? ;)
---
Private servers aren't running 7.3 
---
If I'm not mistaken, couldn't you blow all the charges of lightwell if you spam clicked it? Could also just be a private server thing. Even if it wasn't true, it's not a good talent.  
---
And respawn timers set to 3 seconds too.
---
Couldnt I get plenty of gold from dungeons, fishing &amp; herbing? Going herb alch resto sham, most by raid buffs should be covered from being alch, trading food buffs for brilliant Mana oil. I just can't see what else I'd need lots of money for. 
---
Leveling an entire alt just for $ sounds like work, to each their own there.
---
I was alliance and I remember running it a  handful of times on my characters.  The instance I remember running 100+ times on all my characters was SM every wing had something for everyone just blast through the dungeon, see who wanted to stay, fill group back up and go again.
---
I want the original server caps, the lower the better. The world was not designed for massive amounts of people.
---
Let me quote someone from a PS forum:
---
"A higher population doesn't equal to more social interaction. You have tons of players around in todays retail WoW, still everyone is playing for themselves. Because they're not depended on each other. Same principle applies to the world of vanilla. The fewer players are around, the harder do quests get. And the harsher and unforgiving does traversing hostile locations become. Because of this, you really start to appreciate the company of other players.
---
I've played plenty of pre-Cata retail and p-servers with blizzlike caps. Of course it is harder to build a group for specific quests if players aren't just presented to you due to overcrowding. Just waiting for another player close to an elite creature could be very well pointless for hours. But it was this exact reason why my friend list was full of people of my level. So we could contact each other in case of group quests. I was changing zones to help them and they did to help me. Somtimes we even re-did pre-quests together which one side has already completed, so that we both could profit from the task. And it was this adventures and challenges that lead to getting to know each other and to forming friendships.
---
In contrast to this, having too many players around is - for a start - diminishing roleplaying aspects like world building and immersion. I.e. locations loosing their dangerous atmosphere and meaning, due to always having players around steamrolling enemy ranks. So places with a story and certain peculiarities, that you might have struggled with and created memories from, simply turn into just another grinding spot. Plastered with NPC corpses and people farming. More alive, sure. But no longer as authentic, vast and scary.
---
Every zone in the game is more challenging and dangerous if you're approaching it alone. Not pulling too many mobs in buildings/caves, fighting your way in and back out alive from enemy territory, keeping an eye on your cooldowns and HP/mana, not letting them run off into another group when they're low on health. What made vanilla great for many people is trying to survive in this world on their own. Attempting every quest alone, and either improving and succeeding. Or realizing that some task are too much for a sole adventurer. That you're not supposed to do this alone. All of this gets negated and obsolete if you have so many players around that you can just make your way through a cleared path right to the quest target. And if there's no incentive to group up with other people other than being able to tag the mob.
---
Having too many players also can lead to competition, where you start to disparage the presence of other players. Because they're killing your quest mobs and looting your quest items. Just going to the spawn of an elite mob and joining random players by typing "Inv" to quickly kill it doesn't lead to forming bonds. No, this can entirely happen without anyone exchanging a word or emote. But having to actively build that group in town, traveling to your target location together, fighting your way to the elite, maybe even wiping in the process, and finally killing him, did. This is where my most memorable pre-Cata moments come from. Failing a quest over and over, therefore seeking someone who could help me. Finding that person, doing the quest, maybe even fail together. Become friends in the process.
---
Retail Pre-Cata: Me and a friend slowly fighting our way into a scourge base, having to fight our way past zombies and monsters. It did feel like an adventure, because the scourge hordes were dense and one mistake could mean the end of us. No one was hustling or competing with us. It was up to us to infiltrate the base and make it to our target. When we finally arrived at the elite creature, we attempted to kill that thing 5 times. We died, but we tried again. We improved our gameplay. We read into the quest text more and spotted something helpful that we missed. And then we finally did it. It felt epic. It was rewarding.
---
P-Server with non-blizzlike population: Me and a friend go into a scourge base. It's already full of players farming and there are hardly any mobs around. Getting to the elite mob is no problem at all. The elite is dead, there are 3 people waiting for the respawn. We type "Inv" into /say, get invited. We wait until the mob spawns. We kill him in no time. One guy says thanks, everyone immediately leaves the group and we head to our next quest. Not epic. Not rewarding.
---
I've played plenty on &lt;redacted&gt; PvP with their concurrent player count being exactly at 5k. And sure, there are tons of players around and you're joining groups frequently. But it is a lot less personal than it used to be in vanilla retail. And not as rewarding if you don't actively build the groups yourself. The world most certainly feels more alive, but it also feels a lot smaller and cramped. Also non-existent world PvE challenge, broken roleplaying immersion, competing and rushing with other players for quest mobs/targets, joining and leaving groups becomes an unpersonal routine. It's almost like people are just playing for the population hype and not for the game itself."
---
Remember that if you have fun playing optimally, you are wrong! The only way to enjoy the game is to be as slow as possible.
---
5-6k if they allow dynamic respond, 2.5k otherwise. I played Nost when it would peak at 4-5k and before dynamic respawns, the game was unplayable. 
---
Wow I very much appreciate all the information! I think ultimately I will end up choosing Elemental as I am more accustomed to a caster play-style. It seems like Ele has a higher skill-cap and has the most potential to be dangerous, which I love. Never really played Shaman at all so I'm excited to dwell into a new environment. Thanks again :)
---
Sure, resilience made pvp more balanced and skill based (though arenas was still really unbalanced in tbc). I still find vanilla bursty pvp more fun. And besides, high end vanilla pvp with engineering and other pvp consumes still has a high skill cap. 
---
You people clamoring for Vanilla only and saying others don't want the other versions are no better than Retailers. Same excuses. YOUR favorite is the best version. Any other but YOUR favorite version will divide the community too much. Every version but YOUR favorite was a mistake.
---
The best answer I can give is just wait until a beta when they decide to release it. You can bet whatever needs an update will be updated from there and ready for the real release.
---
The way you entered this world was by leeching off your mother’s life force. Billionaires leech from the middle class, the poor leech (and I say leech very lightly here) from the middle class and billionaires, while the middle class leeches from their families and friends. 
---
It is a cycle that would be broken up if you chop the head off, which I do think will happen soon enough.
---
I'll be a warrior in vanilla, but a warlock in TBC. I'll have the warlock to 60 by the time TBC launches.  
---
New expansion is a "reset" and allows me to devote to another character instead.  
---
I'm playing a 60 priest on a pserver now, with some tier 1 &amp; 2 gear. I leveled entirely as shadow (best bet, for sure). I made the switch at 60 to a healing build. I honestly have not played around with my build much, other than trying out a holy nova build for DM:E farming. 
---
For world pvp (or pvp in general), I wouldn't suggest anything other than shadow if you want to be a damage dealer. Otherwise, you're probably going to have the most fun as a disc priest in pvp. 
---
If you try to 5-man PVE as a holy DPS, people will not take you seriously. Even as a shadow priest, you may have problems finding 5-mans. Other casters dont want to compete with you for gear, and most groups will basically just ask you to fill the healer spot.
---
&gt; By all technical means the servers don't have a "language" 
---
It's not technical but servers *do have a language* and it means the "official language" that people are expected to speak in public channels.
---
On the EU client there are currently different selection tabs for English, German, French, Spanish, Russian and Italian. Each of them has its own selection of servers dedicated to those language-speaking communities.
---
I fail to see how this is relevant to OP's question, considering he said he does *not* want to do Tribute runs.  
---
Lol
---
"it is popular therefor it is correct"
---
Furry has two r’s.
---
If they don’t want it don’t join it. It will 100% exist though.
---
I counter your proposal to a world chat, and offer you instead the option for all Horde players to join the barrens general chat from any location in the world.
---
&gt; pretty good spot in Felwood with wolf that you can chain kill with nearly no downtime as they repop quite fast and are in large number
---
Is this private server info?  
---
To be fair, the leveling experience was mostly the same in TBC, so he will still be familiar with most of it. Trick is to go to zones you are not familiar with
---
Please don't disrespect Chromie with a misquote sir.  
---
Even if I don't help the OP there is a chance that I help somebody.
---
I agree that, while there were limitations, Blizzard still put thought into the cap. One of the things i'm waiting for most in Classic is a server that isnt constantly pushing 5-9k, where the city is just a clusterfuck instead of alot of people you've seen before.
---
What ? No ! Spawn timer of named should stay the same :( it make us group, farm around and tchat 
---
I wasn’t sure if he was being sarcastic or not. Also watch out we got a badass over here Tardigrade89. You’re already on my ignore list for classic. You are far superior to me in every way. 
---
That sounds like a whole lotta nope sir.  
---
Here's my approach to leveling: Auto attack &gt; Continue watching TV  
---
As a vanilla vet I still plan on joining a nice casual social guild, raiding guilds in vanilla tend to be very very toxic and unforgiving to eh...pretty much everyone lol, but a nice casual social guild just wants to play and chill.
---
Lol you amateur. Everyone knows to use a second monitor for maximum porn viewing while leveling a paladin.  
---
A server that recently launched had about 6-8k on launch, and would hit near 10k for the next week. They had to ramp up dynamic respawns so high that the game was unplayable. Even when I was in my ~30s, i remember Stromgarde Keep respawning elite ogres faster than we could even kill them, and this was at least a month into the launch.
---
Well, that’s rather embarassing.
---
It's a safe assumption that nearly (but not quite all) every gold making guide come from private server info
---
Which is fine. If you're just leveling to get to the endgame, do that. If you enjoy the leveling and want an actual mechanical challenge along the way, do it the other way. Kinda like driving an automatic if you just want to get from point A to point B vs. driving a stick if you enjoy driving itself.
---
I was entirely joking! Unlimited cap and really high respawn timers would be a pretty horrible way to experience the game.
---
Congratulations on having two socialist governemts give you a very bright outlook on your future. I doubt you realize how much your location of birth statistically inclined you to “launch” as you put it. Half of these United States are governed by low spending conservatives who do not invest in their country, certainly not in the education of their children. 
---
Birthright is very much alive. I live in one of the better states and was able to complete two years of college while in high school, entirely free and funded by my state. I wasn’t even spectacularly qualified, I just applied to the program.
---
I know such opportunity is scant among large sweeps of flyover America. So I can rationalize why these people would see WoW as their life to live for. Much of my country has allowed evil to govern them, and their children are paying for it.
---
With Shaman's windfury PUG zerg tactics seem to work better in pvp. While with the Alliance Paladins seem like they want to try and be more tactical, communicate more, and try to draw out the battle.
---
It’s not a big deal to have x servers running with a particular expansion.  It’s really what they need to do as a matter of coaxing people back in to playing.  At the very least, they need an avenue to get resubs from people who quit 3 expansions ago and have no idea what is going on now.  
---
The server structure is more or less in place at this point anyway, since it’s less about servers and more about sharding these days.  The only thing that’s even necessary is to have to get everyone who’s playing at 60/70/80/85/90/100/110 able to interact with a large enough pool of other people that they can actually tackle the relative content.  
---
They will either have to stop it at vanilla (the only "expansion" that is no longer playable on retail) or they will have to do it for every expansion.
---
Outland and Northrend is still completely unchanged, so they can just do their project 70 or 80 and play almost identically to TBC/Wrath.
---
If they go up to wrath, then they will have to do Cata/MoP etc as well, and there will be no end to it.
---
This is effectively a Pserver info but 99% of the info you'll find comes from Pserver.
---
I would recommend checking Frostadamus on youtube, he makes very good content and I'm sure you'll find some video about gold farming outside instance.
---
Are you for real? This would have taken literally one second to test back then. Walk up to mob. Sit down. Get crit. See if Reckoning procced. 
---
So your thesis is that the creator of this guide, and thousands of people who followed it and commented on it over many months ALL them got this wrong, never checked, never noticed? Please fuck off this thread, you’re actually hurting my head with your idiocy.
---
Its lackluster, if it were to scale with healing in anyway it would be very popular but its not the case.
---
Vanilla WoW was estimated to bring in 400k people, and they still it would be profitable. and that developing the entire game from scratch, so how could i possibly not be profitable for them to keep developing it?

it doesn't even look good on paper, fury for leveling was always the worse choice on a pvp server.  ppl who went fury were just bad XD, its so boring to play too vs sweeping strikes whirlwind everything
---
You can definitely farm as a priest, just not as efficiently as classes like mage or hunter.
---
My 60 holy priest, for example,  is currently grinding on a pserver for the crusader recipe, which will sell for decent amount of gold (in my case, I want the recipe!). Without even respeccing, I can still kill all the mobs as quickly as they can respawn. 
---
Priest can also use holy nova build to farm DM:E, for example. I personally don't enjoy this type of farming, especially if I need to respec to do it. Much of my income comes from dungeon runs (righteous orb drops!), selling mooncloth, and playing the AH.
---
FWIW - I am currently leveling a mage to 60 - partly, but not entirely because this will make gold farming easier. 
---
The pet hierarchy also depends on server coding.
---
He doesn't gatekeep, either ;)
---
But you have posted a picture of two hunters
---
Good choice! 
---
I am doing the same myself. 
---
Leveling 1-58 in tbc wasn't terribly different than leveling in classic.
---
7 priests in my guild, 0 dwarfs.
---
Lack of fearward can be annoying on some boss but it's doable anyway.
---
How do the OT pick up nef since he is immune to taunt ?
---
Can you elaborate on how WOTLK was the downfall of wow? I personally think it was hands down the best expansion, backed by the peak subscribers during it. I likely won't make it back for vanilla as it has no place for all but a niche group of dedicated people now, but if WOTLK came back I would resub in a heartbeat. Everyone has their own opinions..
---
I hope the name Legolas gets taken by like, a bunch of Tauren and Orcs this time around.
---
I'm not supporting Loot Trading, I'm only saying it makes sense that they tried to rationalize the decision with "low GM resources" likely because they would not have the resources come Q4 fiscal year 2018.
---
He has second threat and immunes the fear.
---
During vanilla, I made money by simply running dungeons. I also did righteous orb reserved runs as well since I was full MC geared and didnt need anything from 5 man dungeons anymore. 
---
we wont get the old macro system back so you would need to update those with modern macros.
---
Its not a true tank swap, its a temporary tank swap that lasts while the MT is feared. 
---
It's still somewhat huge even on private server.
---
They gutted progression, tuned the raid/dungeons to ultra-ez mode. Removed attunements, homogenized classes/raid-set ups, added LFG, and overall it was just a complete faceroll. And along with that, it doubled down on everything that sucked about TBC(flying, and entire expac based on a tiny continent).
---
Good questing and music tho, PvP was also good.
---
Honestly Supp room was easy last time I did progression. Didnt even break my first FRD before we killed Brood. Took 2 attempts. If you can kill Vael, you can make it to Chromag. 
---
So clients have gotten worse over the years? 
---
B-buzzards?  I only have one analogy in this puny brain of mine please understand
---
The kind of TV I watch has a certain mechanical element if you know what I mean :) :) :)
---
How much time do you have to play? Sounds like a lot!
---
I thought a long time about my class. I considered going back to hunter like I did back in the day, and doing it right this time(I was super bad in vanilla). I considered a priest, warrior and warlock.
---
But in the end I decided on Druid. My original plan was not to raid at all(other than a 20 man pug here or there). So if I was only going to do dungeons I wanted to be able to do more than 1 role. That is when I learned Druid had a spec that would enable me to tank/dps/heal in dungeons as long as I had the gear for it. HotW spec
---
For me the most important thing was having access to more than 1 role with 1 spec. There are some other classes that can fill that, but I felt Druid was the best pick for me. I have gone and changed my planned spec a dozen or so times. I finally fell on one that will allow me to Tank perfectly fine, even in a raid; DPS to a passable level; And heal just well enough in raid given the fight doesn't last too long.
---
Just a heads up for people looking at Kargoz's amazingly well-put together guides:
---
The Rogue / Druid guides revolve around front-stabbing, a private server-specific bug, and the Paladin / Warrior guides feature builds that 100% rely on /sit macros to gain Enrage / Reckoning, a trick that was patched out long before 1.12.
---
From what I've heard, other than these four classes, his guides are fantastic—probably the most polished of any guide out there right now.
---
But if you're thinking of playing Rogue, Druid, Warrior, or Paladin, he unfortunately refuses to update them to remove known private server exploits.
---
Survival hunters became viable in TBC PvE. Anecdotal evidence is that I was topping charts at the start of black temple. You had to stack a certain amount of agility before you became competitive. Before that, you’re just providing a debuff. 
---
Not having a gathering profession is a painful idea because raiding consumes tons of materials, unless you have an alt that can gather on, or you are a hunter that can solo farm dire maul/mara, you'll likely want herbalism. 
---
First of all Ret PvE is pretty stupid.  Its not super fun.  You have to get all consumables.  Spell power and melee to be max.  Many paladins go holy and than get ret gear while raiding.  To be honest it should be your main priority.  I think the first ashkandi should go to the holy paladin.  Many people think prot is better to grind with.  This is also wrong.   Lawbringer gear is very good to AoE Farm with.  Judgement gear is pretty much OP to AoE Farm with. Holy Shield is pretty much useless if you have more than 5 mobs on you.  Just Consecration Retribution Aura.  Holy is the best paladin spec hands down.  Demand the 2hers from your guild and you'll get them.  The best set for Ret are the pvps sets so just pvp and get those sets.  The WSG exalted pants are OP AF BiS the whole game.  You'll find more premade pvp groups at a holy paladin as well.
---
Maybe viable but not optimal, BM was always the top dps spec if you were a minmaxer, in all raid tiers.
---
I mean it almost did die until they started updating it. So they weren't completely wrong. It dropped to like 8k players at peak times.
---
I know you're not. I read the post. I am just using your thread as a platform to promote my ideals :)
---
I’m American and I’ve been living in the UK for 6 months, returning home soon but I was playing BFA with an NA account on NA server to be with friends and honestly it was just fine. I had 110 ping and was able to dungeons and even raid just fine. 
---
I think the blizzlike numbers are right on point. 3kish seems to be what the world is tuned for.
---
Was feral a thing in Classic? If so might roll a nelf feral. I love darnassus
---
that's amazing lol
---
In preparation for classic, I've written a reference spreadsheet for my guild. Feel free to include it. It features:
---
1. The Stat Breakdown tab describes the effect of each attribute on class functionality.
---
2. The Azeroth Map tab provides a complete world map with level ranges, flightpaths, dungeon locations, and more.
---
3. The Crafting Guide tab provides a leveling guide for each of the 6 crafting professions.
---
4. Class tabs outline near-ideal level 60 gear and enchants for each class and spec for entry into WoW 1.12 PvE raiding.
---
4.a. These lists ensure entry-level raid viability at minimal time and resource investment. **They are not strict BiS lists.**  
---
4.b. Not included are items bought from reputation factions, PvP rewards, crafted BoP items, tier 0.5 gear, or ultra-rare drops.  
---
4.c. These lists assume that Classic is in stage 1 and has implemented 1.12 itemization.
---
5. The Consumables tab catalogues every end-game consumable and world buff with color coding for raid roles.
---
6. The Raid Composition tab outlines class specific raid utilities and an example raid composition.
---
7. The Commands tab lists many useful chat commands available in Classic.  
---

Ok, I thought you meant whole vanilla since you said it took 2 expansions to bring them up to par. 
---
Fair enough.
---
Sounds about right, do you remember the video or what it was called? 
---
Good observation, cheers.
---
World chat is a default channel on private servers. It won’t exist in Classic. 
---
Sure you can create a custom channel called world, but it won’t last because some troll will get leader eventually and just lock the channel. 
---
Yes you will lol. What are you talking about? 
---
Wow that’s awesome and gives me hope that it won’t be too laggy! Thanks! 
---
Herbalism, its easy to level and constantly produces gold, the more gold the higher level you are. If you raid its super nice to be able to just go pick the herbs you need for potions. 
---
Not if you include the debuff you give the entire raid. Don’t get me wrong, beast mastery is better for personal damage. But if you have one hunter and they have to pick a spec, the survival debuff &gt; being beast mastery 
---
Good observation, thanks very much for this.
---
Isn't that exactly what I said?
---
Well that is news to me, all I can say is I've never seen hunters in top end guilds speccing anything but BM all throughout TBC. But maybe I'm wrong. 
---
I would probably agree. Idk was a bit loose on the 3 points there honestly. I like it for fero bite later that's all.
---
The inverse is true, too.  When a vet says *"lol, look at this dumbass warrior not even using demo shout for AoE threat,"* well then that person is a jerk who I'd rather not play with, regardless of how good they are.  If a vet says *"Hey tank, FYI using Demo shout is a great way to pick up AoE threat on packs like this,"* then that person is friendly and helpful and a good candidate for the ol' friends list.
---
Surprised not alot of people here mentioned warlock+ healer. Warlock can life tap endlessly with a healer behind!  
---
Elemental is insane in PvP. You will not be disappointed.
---
Word of advice from someone who just leveled an Ele Sham on a server that may or may not be illegal: Grab Elemental Mastery (31 point talent) ASAP while leveling. When you first hit 60, you can keep EM for grinding gold. Mana is the most limiting factor for an Ele Shaman and getting a free spell (+ guaranteed crit!) is pretty awesome.
---
Eventually, respec into 30/0/21. You have to watch your mana much more carefully with this spec - but once you learn the playstyle it's definitely better for PvP. Cast efficient spells + rank 1 shocks to set up kills, then dump your mana on shocks + Chain Lightning, burst them down for the kill, get out of combat, and drink up. Nature's Swiftness can be used for an instant Lightning Bolt, instant Healing Wave, or instant Ghost Wolf to run away from a melee. Spec looks like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZVoez0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZVoez0xo)
---
I mean, I'd be surprised if retail Classic will be Americans on our EU servers. 
---
think of it this way. 
---
everything is a spell. even procs.  
---
you can not use spells while sitting.  
---
when you sit, your spells and talents don't go off
---
I bought it right after school on release day, I was in 10th or 11th grade.  Took me all day to download the game and I turned it on at like 9 p.m.  I remember I logged in, took me like 30 minutes to pick a class and customize my toon. I remember I initially rolled a NE Rogue.  
---
I then logged onto a server and ran around, lagging like it was my job. (512 mb of ram lol).  I then called my buddy and asked what he was doing. 
---
We were both Night Elves and were like level 2, so we jumped around looking for each other for 30 minutes.  We then realized that we weren't on the same servers.
---
My mom then kicked me off around 11 p.m. and I had to sneak back down into the basement and I played until 4 a.m. and slept all day at school the next day.
---
After finally getting into the game and on the same server as by buddy, I wound up rolling a NE Hunter and got to like level 6 over the entire night lol. I don't really remember getting disconnected a lot at all. I just remember extreme lag from tons of people in the starting zones and having a crappy computer.
---
They have 2 hots, priest has 1 and paladins and shamans have 0.
---
My GM made me respec to survival during ssc/tk and we saw a raid increase in DPS. I got poached by my servers top guild during BT. Unfortunately, quit right before sunwell. Wasn’t topping charts in the top guild anymore, but they wanted my debuff. 
---
4k at max. 
---
everything else is too cluttered. 
---
2-3k is probably the best
---
The misconception most players have is that sharding is about server load. *It isn't.*
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that you're not forced to do the following:
---
* Create too many realms at launch
---
* Change starting-zone mechanics (spawn rates, graphics-throttling, etc.) like private servers do
---
Well, whats wrong with creating enough realms at launch for everyone who wants to try out Classic? The more the merrier, right?
---
Because we all know from past experience (and private server data) that within six months, realm populations will plummet when all the tourists leave. This will result in lower than optimal populations across the board. This is especially impactful in Vanilla because you're far more “locked-in” to a realm than in retail.
---
At that point, the only long term solution is majorly destructive realm-mergers. A lot of folks don't remember, but last time they merged realms in retail the playerbase nearly revolted.
---
One final note: Sharding starter-zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, tops—of your total /played Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues at peak times. Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of these solutions is sharding starter-zones only for the first hour of leveling your first character. 
---
I think it bears repeating: Unless you never leave your starting-zone for the first couple of weeks, sharding at launch will only be noticeable for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character. That's it. That's what this is all about. 
---
&gt;I'd much rather spend my time on wow being a better dude than I am in the real world
---
You know you can be a good dude in both right?
---
There is an argument that the cap we're all referring to is not the total cap, but the concurrent player cap.  
---
Using that as a jump off point, I'd prefer the concurrent player cap to be 4,000 people, and whatever total cap is appropriately mathed out from that point.  
---
His point stands. Half my friends don’t even know what a torrent is. (Then the other half is the hyper-nerds who have downloaded 1000+ torrents) 
---
All that is easy for you, but the majority of WoW players were and will be casuals. I knew a lot of people over 35 and 40 in BC
---
My friend and I will say #1 in discord, and #2 in party chat.
---
The problem I have is most people don't want unsolicited advice.
---
Wasn't it possible to use the Noggenfogger elixir in conjunction w/ the gnomish shrinking device? 
---
I vaguely remember a gnome using both in a WSG match and he was nearly impossible to find, and they were the flag carrier. 
---
Not exactly a direct response to your questions - but I co-founded a guild recently on a private server, and have made a few observations.
---
Our server is quite mature in the sense that there are a number of guilds who already have naxx on farm. As a player that didn't have 3-4 nights a week to dedicate to raiding, I found it difficult to find a guild that was interested in going to MC one or two nights a week. Everyone seemed to be either already beyond that, or still leveling up. 
---
We founded the guild to address this problem, and generally describe it as a "Casual raiding guild" for people who are just looking to learn the early raids before classic comes. 
---
My experience so far has been that a lot of folk just want to take advantage of us to get their Pre-BIS, then they jump ship to a guild with BWL on farm for some easy tier 2. Not many want to "put in the work" to get there as a guild. To be fair, this IS a private server, and we haven't been as disciplined as we could be in promoting guild activities.
---
TLDR; Most people expect the guild to give them access to easy gear upgrades!
---
Again, it depends on the player.  If the tank is talking himself up as the greatest thing since sliced bread and is yelling at everyone else for how terrible they are, that's a perfect time to call him out on his idiocy.
---
Yeah noggenfogger, gnomish world enlarger and then get an enemy to shrink ray you and it’s like Pokémon in tall grass
---
Interesting! Someone else talked about the 30/0/21 talent build. Seems like that's the way to go. I'm excited to try it out once Classic hits. I'm a pretty decent mage player so I think ele shaman might be able to translate over (hopefully). Thank so much!
---
Serious question: Did they confirm it would be a modified 7.3.5 client, or did we all just assume that because it's what the demo was running?  
---
Real question, because I don't know the answer.  
---
Sharding has never been about server load.
---
It's about not having to create more hard-split realms, thus diluting the total playerbase even more.
---
Semi-Hardcore guilds will accept you. Balance Druids are fun and casters will love having you in their raid group. You can’t expect to top the DPS charts but going the extra mile with consumables can make that difference. I’ve played Balance Druid and people will go out of their way to 
---
/chicken you. With the release of ZG, you’ll start pumping out more DPS as you’ll have more %spellhit. If you want more info, feel free to PM me :) 
---
Implying there's a difference ;)
---
I've played Cata till BfA on official servers. I've paid my share. No need to be butthurt asshole.  
---
On the other hand, if it wasnt for private servers, many players would never join to pay the subs in the first place.
---
Only by completely changing the game's mechanics. They hack the spawn rates and spell graphics, amongst other non-Vanilla mechanics.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
So increasing spawn rates and throttling spell graphics is all blizzards needs to do? Gotcha. 
---
Compared to all other classes? Yes. Yes they are.
---
No, they are objectively not the same. Talent trees are gone. Weapons leveling is gone. Mounts have different level reqs and costs. Spells are different with different stats and class pruning. And scaling doesn't fix this issue. There's a ton wrong with your statement.
---
I encourage them to "have no end" let people play the expansion and playstyle they most preferred. Most people liked more than 1 expansion. And despite you believing that x expansion is crap, to some people, that was their favorite version and YOURS was crap.
---
I look forward to the day that I can play WoW with my guild/friends in cycles on expansions we are interested in replaying.
---
There's a reason that veteran private server players all strive for higher pop servers.
---
But I guess all those tryhard players are all wrong because you think it won't be good without having even tried it, or gave up after at lvl 30.
---
Do you have a link or a source that confirms that Blizzard intended them to be HoT healers? No you dont. You are just drawing a conclusion based on the fact that they happen to have HoTs as part of their toolkit. That does not even close to imply they are "meant" to be HoT healers.
---
How? They are great at world pvp, great at lvling, best dungeon tank in the game, weak healer in early raid tiers but scale really well and become beasts in later tiers, great in premade BG PvP. 
---
It didn't work back then, if you'd have played then you'd know that. 
---
Give it a rest you jive turkey
---
I can’t wait for modern MMO dicks to reap the punishment of their behavior when they realize the people they play with aren’t from 10 servers away who they’ll never see again. 
---
All one server, and the server remembers. 
---
Ironically proposing dynamic spawn rates in Classic?
---
Lol, unironically, I'd much rather have dynamic spawns and shared quest mobs than sharding, but the playerbase would revolt. Sharding preserves all game mechanics as they were intended. 
---
Unfortunately there were no dynamic spawns or shared quest mobs in Vanilla.
---
&gt; all blizzards needs to do? Gotcha.
---
It isn't all they need to do. Here's a guide on all the ways you need to hack Vanilla to support the entire pop cap of a realm existing in only eight zones: [http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf](http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf)
---
Fear ward tank is overrated, pre fear warding your entire raid before every encounter and refreshing fear ward on all the rogues is heavily underrated.
---
exactly
---
I would think they would stop at Cataclysm, the world is basically the same now as it was in cataclysm. there are some slight differences and different quests but they should definitely go up to Wrath and stop. 
---
It wasn't a blue post, it was a Dev remark at Blizzcon or some interview...don't remember, but others have said the same.
---
Im concused as to what you mean. 
---
Why should they? The talents and stats are not the same as they were in cataclysm. There are lots of changes there as well to the present day game.
---
Outland is exactly the same, and so is Norhtrend. Vanilla 1-60 is the only version of the game that has been almost totally reworked besides MC, BWL and AQ.
---
It will be running the current client, which will cause some issues with addons and such. There is talk of them limiting some of the addons because with the client now, you are able to do some things with addons you weren’t able to in classic.  
---
That’s how they are able to do sharding at the release of classic, and hopefully only then. 
---
But best thing to do is wait and see! 
---
I was not aware of how good shadowguard was.  Sounds like a great alternative to undead.
---
You thought wrong. Have a nice day.
---
Nobody knows, except that there will not be many druids, that is a fact.
---
I like to go to the gym, but if there was a non 0% chance that all my fitness/muscles could disappear tomorrow, I'd stop going. I like to build and make progress, the fact that you find that odd says more about you than it does about me, to be frank.
---
I don't want a population less than 3K... so make pops 5K and I think things will even themselves out.
---
I originally played wow on Mannoroth an original launch server.... at the time of launch it was laggy and queue times it sucked to be honest... we did the free server transfer and ended up on a server with no queue and no lag... sounds good right?? well it was for a while but even before TBC was announced it become quite the ghost town and BG queues were AWFUL, even after pooled BGs were a thing cuz apparently it was a pool of low pop servers.
---
Now on Pserv these 10k servers are pretty fun minus launch days with over crowding in the zones....but i think 10k is a bit much, economy and open world farming is overkill...
---
So I'd say the happy medium to original blizz and pserv ... 5k max pop would be ideal.. just my 2 cents.
---
but 99.9% of the game is still exactly the same for TBC/Wrath.
---
There is some different dialogues that NPCs will react with. You can see then here. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ravenholdt
---
Other than that, having rep with them changes nothing.
---
Healthstones aren't a raidwide thing with the exception of lotheb (and there is a room of constantly respawning easy trash there just to farm them). But it is nice to hand them out to tanks and melee. Its a different cooldown and far more health than anything else you can use on that cooldown
---
Awesome thanks man!
---
That’s the thing- so many people spew nonsense about druids and perpetuate the idea they don’t have real strengths.
---
Warrior, Mage Priest Rogue will be ~70% of the population.
---
The other 30% will be Sham/Pala, Hunter, Warlock, Druid in that order by terms of % pop.
---
&gt;Meet people, run SFK two, three times.
---
This will be one of the only instances pre-60 I plan on running a few times. It's just SO good, the lore behind it, the dungeon design and the fact that I'm rolling undead means it's in the second zone I'm going to visit. 
---
Nothing against the other dungeons pre-60, but SFK is just something special to me. 
---
&gt;he ganking won't get to you as much because you can view it as character building, and growing a healthy hatred of the opposing faction instead of someone wasting your time and reducing your efficiency.
---
Truer words are rarely spoken, or...typed, w/e. Despite all the bickering that went on internally in our faction (Horde, Arthas US) there was one thing we could all agree on, we all hated the alliance and when push came to shove we all had each others backs. 
---
All the private server veterans prefer high pop. There is a reason they all pref high pop, they have come to a conclusion that it is better.
---
Everyone in here are just giving their opinion based on just pure speculation instead of actually having tried the various pops.
---
I will be skinning while leveling. If I see you advertising that you are willing to buy leather slightly higher than vender sell, I would be ecstatic!! I’d definitely add you to my friendlist so I can sell you leather whenever I get full stacks.   
---
Yessss came here to link Thunter fury
---
*laughs in PvE server*
---
Exactly my words. +1
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure the &lt;1% figure exclusively comes from the population of level 60 characters
---
Citation?
---
Fighting WSG against the tried and true 9 person alliance turle is so cancerous.
---
AB Premade and pug tend to favor Horde more because alliance's defensive nature and paladins tend to favor defense more, which is less beneficial.
---
A good Druid is quite powerful in PvP- a great Druid is amazing. No idea why you would feel that way. 
---
eye twitches *
---
In World PvP, horde seem to have the tendency of literally dropping anything and assisting nearby players in world pvp regardless of who started the engagement.  Alliance seem to be far more passive and not as open to help out other alliance, oddly enough.
---
Well yeah, repeat the same lie enough and people will start to believe it. 
---
My tip: Don't read tips. Just play and find out.
---
Exactly. Same here. The guy above who replied is exactly who I tried to cut off at the pass by saying anyone who thinks otherwise has never worked in IT or customer service lol. The majority of people could not figure out how to even install it much less edit the realmlist. It is indeed very simple to do, but that doesnt change how most people wouldnt be able to do it.
---
Youre so right that the majority of players were and will be casuals. This was my point I was getting at too.. WoW was so big they had TOYOTA commericals about it... literally everyone and their grandma knew what you meant when you said you played WoW.. south park episodes about it etc..etc..
---
And to the guy above yes, the nature of what we are doing now is very illegal lol. Obviously we still find it acceptable, since we do it, but you are kidding yourself if you dont think most people run away as soon as they hear about what it entails. The first response from a normal healthy contributing member of society is "What the hell isnt that copyright infringement? count me out..."
---
And no I am not a 70 year olf computer illiterate.. but thats also my entire point. When WoW was huge, 70 year old "computer illiterates" (thats not a noun by the way) DID play the game. Anyone able to buy a box off the shelf and press Next 15 times was able to play. 
---
I suspect we are going to see a huge wave of subs that even blizzard isnt prepared for now that the entire generation is older, wants to get back into it, and has the disposable income to get their own kids back into it as well.
---
Yeah they definitely still weren't on par by the end of vanilla. Just not terrible.
---
So sick of the word cuck.
---
I’d guess next week when 8.1.5 drops on retail. After that they have a lot of downtime till 8.2. I’d expect some news or even a beta test sometime then. 
---
&gt; PvE server
---
&gt;!lol!&lt;
---
The hype is underrated.
---
Classic is Blizzards ONLY release this year.
---
Ya, this will be bigger than some expect it to be. It will work out for the best as release will go smoother will less initial hype, but word of mouth will have this game grow quickly.
---
This won't be a massive cash grab for Blizzard as they can't wrap it within their normal RMT model of front line games, but it's influence may help shape how they host games for an audience with more tailored interests in a positive way.
---
My bold prediction of the week is that rogues will be disgustingly over represented since people keep saying “play what you want”. Many people will make warriors and most will not make it to 60. I’ve seen people with high hopes of being a pally and a Druid so I think they may even out with shammy. Quick guess 1. Rogues 2. Mages 3. Warrior 4. Priest 5. Hunter 6. Warlock 7. Pally 8. Shaman 9. Druid. If I were to guess my top 4 are right everything else is debatable. I think rogue will be at least have a 8% lead over whatever is second population wise.
---
I asked [this exact question](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/) a month ago, when I started leveling a Warrior on a pserver, and the comment I found had the most accurate info was [this one].(https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/edv0fxw/)
---
The general feeling I’ve got from peoples posts is that at the starting zones it makes sense. I’m seeing people more concerned in the later content of the game. 
---
Thoughts on that?
---
So some people say it's going to run the current client, and some people say it's going to run 7.3.5.  
---
Which means without a direct source, we don't really know.  
---
It's always been fairly obvious to me that Classic would run on and follow the current client as time progresses forward, but the chatter about 7.3.5 is a constant thing. So now I'm source-searching.  
---
Way to assume. I've played servers with pops from anywhere to 2k-10k. I don't think there is a massive audience that wants 10k. Nostalrius themselves only made the cap unlimited because they didnt want to have to manage multiple servers as a passion project.
---
Even if hardcore private server veterans did unanimously think a crazy high pop was better, why would you base the game around the experience of that fraction of the community?
---
I've also played Vanilla when it was Vanilla, and the lower, more reasonable caps were much more enjoyable than the massive populations. I'd also think more people prefer something more reasonable than a clusterfuck of 10k.
---
I don't think i agree really, on par with what exactly? Sure, they're probably the worst raid healer, but they have other roles where they're above par, such as lvling, dungeon tanking, world pvp, premade PvP, etc. If you're strictly talking about their PvE raid performance I'd agree they're probably slightly below par, but as a whole I don't think so.
---
I think leveling guilds are just swimming in this game, they just exist, do/achieve nothing, and sometimes they waste their own time, if you want to have a TRUE WOW experience, level-up a character from 1 with your IRL friend, and join a guild TOGETHER which has progress, so you can achieve something, and feel the success which YOU and your FRIEND made.  
---
Best feeling ever  
---
Unless if the GM is a jerk
---
Do you think rogues will also be super overpopulated on PvE servers, or mostly just on PvP servers?
---
My first toon to 60 was a hunter and then I played a rogue for most of vanilla.  I feel that I had way more difficulty as a hunter getting groups. I rarely had issues as a rogue. I feel that I got gear really quickly and always had a raid spot.  Idk if i was lucky or what, but I never noticed any issues.
---
However, as a priest during WOTLK, I felt really needed.  
---
The class spread will be nearly exactly like every single chart from original vanilla through all private servers. It rarely varies at all. Just look those up.
---
There will be a slight variance between pvp and pve servers but not dramatically for several classes.
---
&gt;The really competitive and good players, don't give a fuck what your specc is and what you play, because they are going to carry you through a Dungeon or Raid regardless
---
The really competitive players only play with other competitive players they don't carry anyone. I am not sure how you have convinced yourself of what you posted. 
---
&gt; realm populations will plummet when all the tourists leave
---
What shardplebs fail to realise time and time again is that people will not only leave, but join in later after the launch.
---
There is literally no reason to shard launch, other than ruining the launch experience for everyone
---
Night Elf Warriors are sick tbh. Shadowmeld is so underrated, even the gimped Vanilla version.
---
I played a Human Priest as my first main in vanilla. I remember seeing Starshards for the first time and being so confused. I thought I somehow missed learning an ability or didn’t pick up a class quest or something. 
---
This is same argument classic fans have pushed back against for classic. They player base is already split up in pservers or on a long break. Giving people what they want will just keep more people playing overall.
---
And who cares if it did split the player base into fractions, thats still plenty of people.
---
Warcraft 3 Reforged will also see a release this year.
---
They are great at running away in world pvp or wearing people down over time. You normally don't have that time. You don't die much (one on one) tho.
---
They can tank 5man dungeons but since they can't really raid as feral a better geared warrior will do a better job.
---
They are the worst of the healers in pve. Don't have a rez out of combat. 
---
While they scale decently, it doesn't change the fact that most of their healing will be overhealing since the other healers will snipe them with their shorter casttime.
---
You brought 2-3 druids to raids mostly because healers were in demand and to not waste gear.
---
They are great at flagrunning. And it's great fun too. 
---
Still the weakest class in game overall in vanilla.
---
&gt; people will not only leave, but join in later after the launch.
---
At an exponentially lower rate. A 1:1 replacement rate for a peak launch population has never been observed in any expansion.
---
&gt; There is literally no reason to shard launch, other than ruining the launch experience for everyone
---
This has never once reflected reality. Please stop spreading misinformation. You're not making Classic better, you're just making r/classicwow worse.
---
This trend is noticeable and accurate across many private servers. It may not be the Alliance culture on every Classic server, but be aware that it certainly trends commonly.
---
Blizzard is gonna see an all-time high sales record for name changes and server changes in a single month. 
---
My usual leveling experience -
---
Guild - Whats you're guys' /played time reaching 60?  
---
Guild - 12days, 15days, 10days, 13days, 16days
---
Me - 47 days
---
just join a classic guild discord now and make friends before launch
---
The original implementation wasn't about server load. Doesn't change the fact that it has had a major effect on server load. 
---
Clients haven't gotten worse, rather the server infrastructure has changed. 
---
That's why sharding is kind of a necessary evil.
---
A while back, Blizzard's official statement was that 70% of players don't make it past level 10.  Assuming that something vaguely similar holds true, there is no way we're going to avoid mass server merges if they don't allow 10k pop servers with sharding for the first several days.
---
I'm as big a critic of sharding as the next guy, but when your alternative is playing on a 500-population server that ends up merged after 3 months, how is that any different from having played on a 3-month long shard?
---
LFG channel was global in vanilla from 1.11 and forward. It was spammy and removed sometime in early TBC, but it did exist during vanilla. People are only hating on it because "grr private servers are bad".
---
There's a poll that was done with like 11,000 answers on what classes people will play in Classic.  
---
Where ever that thing is, it's about as accurate as you're going to get.  
---
Watch the Classic panel from last Blizzcon. That's all you need to know about their stance on sharding outside starting zones.
---
The devs have repeatedly made it clear that this is a tool to make launch smooth and stable.
---
At this point, anyone seriously arguing about sharding in Classic post-starting zones are either:
---
* Not paying attention
---
* Too cynical to be reasoned with
---
* Willfully trying to spread misinformation.
---
&gt;At an exponentially lower rate.
---
Ah yes, on vanilla launch back in the day people came in day 1 and barely anyone joined the servers after that. Jesus christ you shardplebs will ruin the game.
---
&gt;This has never once reflected reality
---
Ah ok then. So no one wants the 800 gnomes vs hogger raids on launch? Sure buddy, just ruin the game
---
/sit was patched in 1.10
---
Yeah at that level of players, the game is just broken. You need a lot more than dynamic respawns to make Vanilla compatible with 10k people. 
---
This is an old comment i made on the classic forums under a similar post.
---
-Officers who communicate with their people.
---
-Officers and gms that listen to their experienced players suggestions. Even if they don’t always follow them.
---
-Don’t hoard mats like core leather for tb rep turn ins from the person you have deligated as the guild lwer. Core Leather belt is amazing for healers. Also, don’t make someone who isn’t your guild (insert profession here) get the mats in raid. Ie: letting a random warrior skin the core hounds when you are the guild lwer and will end up with the mats anyways. The point is your designated LWer shouldn’t have to spend their own gold on mats to make stuff for the guild. If they attend the raid they are entitled to those mats as much as the officers.
---
-I hate rolls/+1. I’m not a fan of dkp but I’d use it if people are too adverse to loot council. If you have a solid raid team/guild loot council really helps your raid team. People who rarely show up will get gear over people who are dedicated with rolls. It prevents people who are lucky with rolls out gearing the guild and leaving for better guilds.
---
-I want raiders who know their class and show up on time with consumes and are vocal about if they will miss a raid. I don’t judge people for their reasons just let us know if we need to find a replacement. Ohh and don’t expect summons. If you can get it cool but if you are prepared you should already be making your way to the instance. 
---
-Additionally, if raid time is at 8pm the first pull should be at 8pm.
---
-Use your experienced players. If your friend is a rogue that doesn’t necessarily mean they should be class lead. Even if they have been in the guild from the beginning. Make them an officer sure but let your people who are better suited to helping their fellow classmates get better be the class lead. Especially, if your lead does nothing to help those of his class.
---
-be vocal with what the guild bank needs. If a player asks they probably really want to help. They don’t want to spend 4 hours farming plaguebloom if the guild already has 500 of it. So don’t say whatever you want to donate to those who actively want to help.
---
-help your guild mates with dungeons and quests even if you don’t need them. Helping them will help the guild even if it doesn’t right away. At the very least you can teach them how to be a good player. They will appreciate it later.
---
-don’t hide your farming spots from your members. I was taught by a player who took me under their wing in vanilla. They showed me, in their opinion, the best spots to farm. Because they helped me, I was willing to help them with anything they needed.
---
-keep your members in line. If they are ninjaing/ causing problems on the server let them know you don’t stand for that. The name under your character name is just as important. A few bad players can give your guild a bad rep real fast. That can backfire on your good friendly players and on the guild when they leave because people won’t run with them because “people from x guild are bad players”.
---
-don’t halt the whole raid to distribute loot. Make the ML someone who isn’t a tank. Someone the raid can continue to clear trash without. Those who need loot can stay behind but the rest get moving. This will cut down on raid time drastically. If the tanks need loot well sometimes that happens.
---
I know some of these things can be taken advantage of but people who do that will become apparent quickly. I’d rather know I’m being used for mats/items sooner rather than later. These kind of people only think of themselves, do nothing in return for the guild, and don’t help their fellow guild mates.
---
End rant.
---
No they don't. Don't know what fairy tails you are on about.
---
Watching ugly male lion all day as female tauren. A++ would recommend.
---
Doubt it. World chat will be a thing. 
---
&gt;They can tank 5man dungeons but since they can't really raid as feral a better geared warrior will do a better job.
---
this is outdated info and kinda shows you don't know much about vanilla druids. They've been theorycrafted to death now and feral is considered a good raid spec, as both OT and cat dps (wolfshead helm, manual crowd pummeler and powershifting makes their dps almost as good as rogues, in addition to all their utility). They just take a high amount of dedication to make work because you have to farm pummelers in gnomeregan for every weeks raid, but they are now regularily brought to raids in top end minmaxing guilds on private servers. 
---
The same reason people hate dungeon queuing, it prevents you from having to physical move some place to interact with other players. This has a net effect of shrinking the feeling of the world
---
How? The total pop cap of a realm is fixed, so what difference does it make on load if everyone is in the same zone or not?
---
Sharding was about keeping the zone-by-zone internal mechanics, like herb and ore amounts and quest mob spawns the same against huge population spikes.
---
You should add WoWHobbs original videos haha
---
The question is whether they make LFG global. It was global during vanilla up to 1.11. 
---
There are issues with the "player created global channel" option. Because the leadership is passed around almost randomly, and any given person can password it and ban/kick people from it. 
---
We need the Classic devs to know we want official World chat. 
---
Seconding this. Maintaining stable server populations is Blizzard's main reason for sharding. It allows them to put the initial population cap very high in anticipation of tourists leaving.
---
Nothing you said countered anything I said.
---
Yeah, if you think really competitive players in 2019 are going to be carrying people you are delusional. You think Method aren't really good players because they have 20 all stars? 
---
So should we have a version for each patch as well?
---
I think WotlK is fucking garbage past ToC, but its playable before that, will they do a 3.1 (I think) version of WoW as well?
---
There was a poll with 10175 participants on this forum. 
---
918 Druid 9%
---
951 Hunter 9.3%
---
1816 Warrior 17.8%
---
1281 Priest 12.5%
---
1154 Rogue 11%
---
729 Pally 7.1%
---
718 Shaman 7%
---
1375 Mage 13.5%
---
1233 Warlock 12.1%
---
Pserver players don’t remember what it’s like to play on your own regional server. The problem was since we were all stuck on one server you needed outrageous caps to fit everyone. There weren’t different servers you could be on.  When there is more than one server that problem goes away. 
---
Original survey results: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a43hch/survey\_results\_subreddit\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a43hch/survey_results_subreddit_update/)
---
&gt; how is that any different from having played on a 3-month long shard?
---
It isn't. People who advocate server merging as a substitute for sharding are honestly a special kind of stupid.
---
It hasn't increased or decreased server load, rather it has allowed the load to be distributed across multiple pieces of hardware rather than all existing on one beefy server blade. 
---
That's how pretty much all major user-heavy software functions these days. 
---
Warrior/Mage/Priest/Rogue will be more like 55% of the popular.
---
Jim Carey would be proud 
---
So instead of saying server load, what would be a better way to refer to it as?
---
Remember that Feral as a concept only begins at level 20. This means key abilities and talents are not available to make it concept complete like a rogue is at a much lower level.
---
You will find that Feral becomes concept complete (and WAY more effective overall) around level 36, but level 40 for Dire Bear is the true sweet spot due to it's impact in pvp along with having access to the Wolf's Head helm for true powershifting (in pvp this works best against soft targets and momos who ignore a Feral at their back in group pvp ... and oh lordy, do a lot do that lol, enjoy your 1k+ crits chaining every GCD at your back. Pretend to be a hunter's pet in pugs too. You are often ignored for a few more seconds if hunter pets are running around too). 
---
A pure feral pvp twink in the 39, 49 and 59 brackets are godly, especially against certain classes. They are the defining anti-mage class when played right. Geared hybrid specs outshine pure feral at 60 in pvp however.
---
In vanilla Zerk isn't that amazing to be honest, no one really has the mana to pump spells. It is good to get me wrong but not like on retail where it is nutty on burn phases, because burn phases don't really exist (C'thun aside)
---
From everything we've investigated we can't say 100% for sure which patch it was because it wasn't documented in any patch notes, but there are blue posts talking about the change.
---
That's fine at the rate retail seems from the outside looking in is... it's more of a dungeon crawler pay to win media interface. There's a way to release TBC with its story but entirely different to make things more sand box, better more unique dungeons, large scale raids, and the same style of progression. No dungeon finder. No lfg. Nothing like that. No flying mounts. No cross server b.s. maybe also include some updates for azeroth that include intensifying conflict between remaining horde and Alliance. Basically azeroth becomes some huge open PvP free for all, and there's ways to change the world thru it.
---
That's the way It should go 
---
I don't know about the rest of the playerbase. but on Aerie Peak NA for Horde. AV was serious business and everyone tried and did it the way it was intended. I DID have some of my best pvp ever in those times. I was there. There were of course the few that whined and asked people to give up or turtle but they were overhwhelmingly shouted down in chat because Horde on my server just liked to kill Alliance.
---
Rogue 11% lolol
---
Agreed. I like Tips. His videos get me hyped for the game and I love his a dungeon and quest guides. If he gets the occasional thing wrong I don't really care....
---
Tier is for ironforge though
---
&gt;New players join an expansion after launch at an exponentially lower rate.
---
Absolutely wrong. First of all, classic isnt an expansion ffs :D
---
And vanilla didnt have peak pop during day 1. It took 2 expansions to reach peak pop (wotlk).
---
&gt;yada yada yada...in any expansion.
---
See above.
---
&gt;Bad-faith commenters who argue otherwise are not making Classic better, they're just making r/classicwow worse.
---
I dont really give a shit about the reddit sub, I want the classic launch experience to be good. You don't.
---
Its actually funny how you can see the rise of american twitching zoomers here, everyone supporting destructive ideas like sharding at launch, just because they dont have the patience to wait for 5mins for quest objective.
---
Sharding in any way is making Classic WoW worse. And thats a fact
---
Tanking, healing, DPS. You listed activities, not roles.
---
It makes going into caves completely suicidal. Mobs respawn in your face before you have time to regain any health.
---
It's in many ways far less true to vanilla.
---
I consider all private server DPS data as invalid until Classic numbers come in. Even very minor differences in class and game mechanics can alter the viability of hybrid dps in Classic.
---
These are really good points! Ultimately I think there is more to be gained by allowing the tourists over the long run, some of them will become long term players.
---
I'm going to need to see a quote for this claim of "you find that odd".  I apologize if you do have one, because it seems like you are twisting words to try to start a reddit fight :D
---
Wow this site is great. I may have found my home for when the game launches.
---
Don't know much about vanilla druids...
---
I actually played a druid in vanilla. I raided as one. Somehow I don't think you did.
---
Feral is considered a spec that CAN work if the player put in a shitload of time. No one is considering feral to be a good raiding spec.
---
I would be happy to be proven wrong. But somehow this seems like a child's fancy.
---
I disagree.  I think they could stop after Wrath.  Cataclysm was the turning point between the Legacy and the Live crowd.  There were always people who wanted Vanilla over TBC, and I personally prefer TBC over Wrath.  But every poll I've seen has had the vast majority of players in one of four camps: Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Live.  In WoD, there wasn't much of a push for Cata and MoP servers, and in BFA I don't see a push for WoD and Legion servers.
---
That's not to say people don't want them.  I'm sure there are.  There are some memories of MoP that I honestly want back, and for the most part I prefer Legion over any expansion after WotLK.  But I'd say that rough guess is the number of players who's ideal expansion is about 22% each for Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Live, and about 3% each for Cata, Mists, WoD, and Legion.
---
As for fracturing the community?  I think that's a red herring.  It will bring in "new" players (who are not currently active), give active players who need a break a different outlet.  And for less popular expansions they could reduce the number of available servers.
---
ok, but by that logic you must think hunter is the worst class in vanilla, and even more below par. They do worse DPS than feral druids and only have that single role to fill. Yet they aren't really considered below par, because they make up for their low raid dps in other areas of the game. 
---
every thread this exact same comment. lame
---
If they go OSRS it will fracture the community a lot worse than if they release expansions.
---
On private servers, and probably when WoW classic comes out, they only had \~6% of the player base. So when it comes to finding a raid, its ezpz, plus because of the low player base, you'll likely only need to compete with 1 or 2 other druids in a raid for gear. It's not unusual for a new druid to go to a raid and get several items because of it.   
---
Sure, rejuv gems are highly contested but so are all trinkets, items like nef mace are bis for druid while the cromag dagger is better for shamans so on horde side at least there are several items druids have very low competition for.   
---
My druid had full bis AQ40 and below tank gear as a healer because if I didn't take it, it would have just gotten DE'd (this is despite us having a druid tank which obviously had prio on the gear.) Honestly, the biggest problem I had with druids is that they don't have a normal resurrection for 5 man dungeons, that is the biggest issue imo. 
---
Yep. The only reason why Hunters are brought to raid is for Tranquilizing Shot.
---
Misdirect was the best addition to hunters in raiding... I used to do this just to kill the raid leader mid speech.  :D
---
Pretty much exactly what you said, with one addition. A organized, highly used website. I like having somewhere else to go look at guild events, progress, and discussions. 
---
Played from 500 all the way to 10k.
---
Honest opinion? - 3k ish works the best.
---
Why? :
---
Any less and time issues become problems. I was on a 500 server where you couldn't do anything at all and my Vanilla server was around 1200 for a time and I had 7 hour BG queues and more.
---
Above 3k however and imo you start to see spawn issues, you never see rares, lag becomes a factor in normal play, and citys becomes crowded. It's a little to much from my experiance on 4-5k realms.
---
Go to 10k and it's insane. The good part is the diversity of people from all over the world, but that won't be in Blizzards Classic realms due to regional servers (assumption) so it's moot. At this population however, general chat becomes twitch chat, community dips as you're unlikely to see people ever again purely due to how many people there are, trolls and Ninjas get away with anything because 80% of the population will never know them, Lag is consistent in most areas and peak time becomes unplayable for most, server log-in queues become normal and new server launches/AQ size events are a no-go, community is boiled down to guild subsections as you won't ever see the same random twice, server identity is all but lost when compared to Vanilla, world pve becomes exceptionally hard/impossible without a group of 2-3, and world pvp changes drastically into giant fights like SS vs TM everywhere. That 1v1 your thinking of starting? won't ever happen. Give up with the stv arena, and frankly give up with most open world stuff as large groups of people start monopolising certain areas and reagents, so you can't get them (This happened).
---
10k or anything near it imo, not only won't be authentic, but it will be horrific to play/unplayable for your average player.
---
The only issue I've experienced at 3k pop is the Battleground issue if locked into individual servers. With win trading and premades at higher ranks. That happened in Vanilla and was solved by CRBG (also a Vanilla feature). But whatever your opinion is on that:
---
I believe it needs to be 3k-ish, as Blizzards OG servers once were. 
---
All pretty good pieces of advice. I'll add one as well
---
\- Never be a guild leader and a raid leader.  If you are the guild leader, find someone or teach someone the ins and outs of the current raid you are progressing (if they don't already know).  Also affectionately known as the "raid whip" in my circle of friends.  This will not only save you headache but will also prevent the "50 DKP Minus" effect.  (You don't want to be the guild leader and then have to come down hard on someone, if necessary, during a raid; as it can cause strife or backlash.)
---
\-Be willing to take advice.  Despite the fact we've had 15 years of knowledge distillation of WoW raid mechanics as well as now know where ever BiS piece is found, don't think of yourself as infallible.  People will forget mechanics.  They'll forget strategies.  They won't have BiS gear. Being able to adapt and overcome quickly and effeciently will make you a popular guild/guild leader.  No-one wants to wipe on Garr 4 times cause someone keeps forgetting to run away with living bomb.
---
There's really no good term for it. The reality is that this distributed structure could run a 2500 person server easily, or theoretically a 500,000 person server. But it needs to be specifically programmed and designed around that. 
---
Current WoW is designed around sharding. It could probably support a billion shards without choking and scale up infinitely. 
---
What would be the best professions right away? I keep hearing about skinning. 
---
Same here.. also considering putting up with being a druid in vanilla to eventually have that God-Tier arena healer. 
---
I suppose a good compromise would be having a druid now and it could just be an on-the-side Alt while in vanilla and switch to main in TBC... so many options lol. Good thread to think on.
---
This is mostly accurate. An elemental shaman will makes most runs FASTER due to their insane burst and dps. I've run many 60 dungeons as elemental and I had to sit and drink fewer times than ANY mage of near equal gear. Stacking tons of nature and spell damage gear makes lightning incredibly mana efficient. 
---
It just isn't mana efficient enough for raids for the most part (although you can easily get into Pug raids as the TTK is short enough on fights for them due to being carried largely).
---
Kinda agree but also kinda disagree.  This feels like a gatekeeping opinion you're making between "real" wow classic players and "retail tourists".  Which should have no distinction.  You're either a game or not.  Everyone can love different versions of wow without calling them subtly derogatory names like "retail tourists".
---
&gt; Absolutely wrong. First of all, classic isnt an expansion ffs :D
---
You think you're being clever, but you're not.
---
A new MMO launch is not what Classic is. Classic is a game-mode within the already existing WoW subscription. It's available for free to a population of players that already exist.
---
Not every retail player is going to join WoW: Classic. In this way, it's more logical and practical to think of it as a retro-expansion than as an entirely new game that nobody has ever played before.
---
This is hugely important for discussing the possible population curves you can expect for Classic. I'd argue that the most likely pop curve will reflect a huge launch, followed by a slow settling in as all the tourists leave. 
---
That's what an expansion looks like.
---
&gt; And vanilla didnt have peak pop during day 1. It took 2 expansions to reach peak pop (wotlk).
---
&gt; I want the classic launch experience to be good. You don't.
---
Then you're arguing against yourself. The actual launch of Vanilla won't be replicated—but it'll never be, even without sharding. For most people *there wasn’t even a proper launch,* due to realms crashing, log-in queues, etc. It might have been part of the experience in 2004, but anyone who seriously thinks this is a viable way to launch an MMO in 2019 is not living in reality.
---
Furthermore, sharding starting-zones will impact maybe **an hour**—an hour and a half, tops—of your total /played Classic experience. And only for your first character on the first week of Classic.
---
That's far less disruptive than all the core game mechanics you need to change to support the entire pop cap of a realm existing in only eight zones, the way private servers have had to do it: [http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf](http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf)
---
no offense, but a lot has been learned about vanilla druids since retail vanilla. Nobody knew to use crowd pummelers, wolfshead and powershifting back then to max their potential. They aren't just considered viable today on private servers, they're considered optimal, again, they just require a lot of effort. You can search for pages upon pages of feral theorycraft as well as raid logs to see just how good they actually are when minmaxed. Shedo the druid is a good place to start, he's the best feral i've seen so far, regularily doing similar dps to rogues, and this in an extremely competitive minmaxing guild. 
---
Rogues are a top 3 dps the entire duration of classic, and you can still que for PvP so there will still be a strong presence. With that being said I think you will have a more even class layout on a PvE server.
---
ignore devilsaur leather, my expirience is no one want or buy it.
---
skinning vendor is cool. if you have additional leatherworking you can make rugged leather sets and use or sell it later for the first darkmoon.
---
i roll priest but take skinning and leatherworking 
---
fast cash vendor 
---
1200 darkmoon Tickets or i sell the armor kits 
---
with 60 and a bit of luck i will crafting one of the cloaks and sell it if i found recipe
---
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's a below par class in vanilla. They are still absolutely crucial to any raid, not just for tranq but also for certain kiting strats and making things easier with their pulls. And they are of course very very strong in vanilla. Below par in pve raid dps =/= below par in the game as a whole
---
Ahaha
---
I like how the guy explained perfectly why world chat won't exist in Classic, and your response is "I doubt thats true, world chat will be a thing". Hysterical. 
---
With all the spell power, the proc on CA is probably several hundred damage higher than base (which is about 200).  MOM only scales of weapon damage.  I assume with enough crazy buffs/consumes/etc that CA would be superior. 
---
CA proc is also a shadow effect, so it should be helped by shadow weaving / curse of shadows. 
---
You sound like you are 12, and you've made it clear you don't know what you are talking about. Pet DPS is minimal, and if you are pulling off of any pet you're almost assuredly already playing wrong. It's not about paying for food it's about being able to grind continuously feeding your pet off drops. It's about bag space, but you'd know that if you actually knew how to play hunter. The fact that you just dismissed owls outright is just reinforcing that you don't know shit about any pet that isn't a cat, and you already know very little about cats. They aren't highest base DPS, they're tied with several other full dmg pets.
---
Charge has a stun, making it ideal for kiting and interrupting heal caster NPCs. Just saying frenzy isn't minimal doesn't make it not minimal... It's less than a 5% overall damage increase, and that's only when it's active. So then you need to account for the time it isn't active, and the time it would be active anyway on a slower attack speed pet. So tops a 1-2% dmg increase. Wow what a game changer.
---
&gt;You think you're being clever, but you're not.
---
I think Im right and I am.
---
&gt;it's more logical and practical to think of it as a retro-expansion
---
Well if it suits your crumbling argument I'll take it happily, love seeing people grasp for straws.
---
I know we can never have original launch, but we can have something as close to original, following the classic wow guidelines.
---
Can't you just stop with the drowning and admit that you dont want a good launch that brings people joy and happiness? You just want to blast through the starting zones without having to wait.
---
You dont have to answer this. You can lie to me all you want, thats ok. But you cant lie to yourself man.
---
I just want the best for classic wow and I hate to see people like you actively trying to ruin it. Just drop it and lets make classic wow good together ok?
---
&gt;I disagree. I think they could stop after Wrath. Cataclysm was the turning point between the Legacy and the Live crowd. There were always people who wanted Vanilla over TBC, and I personally prefer TBC over Wrath. But every poll I've seen has had the vast majority of players in one of four camps: Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Live. In WoD, there wasn't much of a push for Cata and MoP servers, and in BFA I don't see a push for WoD and Legion servers.
---
But why? Only 1-60 changed, 60-80 was exactly the same just with new talent trees, and even early stages of cata tried to go back to the TBC roots. 
---
I even think MoP is a far superior version than wrath, but hey you think you do but you don't, so you can't have it but up to wrath is okay for some reason (altough 60-80 is not changed at all besides the removal of the battle for undercity).
---
So I think they either have to stop at vanilla (which is the only version of the game which has almost entirely been reworked) or they have to do it for every single expansion (otherwise we would be massive hypocrites "We want classic-TBC, but you can't replay Cata/MoP").
---
I think the best option would be to learn from Jagex and just have one good version of the game, and one shitty mobile game version.
---
That's interesting to hear. I can imagine there being not that many druids, yeah. And maybe...well later on there might be some balance patches and druid will get some love.
---
Most kiting strats can be done by multiple classes. Hunters happen to get the job because their DPS is the lowest and they have a few tools to make kiting easier.
---
They're great in PvP, but again that's an activity not a role.
---
Well put. I know the purists are also almost uniformly about "NO CHANGES!", but this will be officially WoW 1.13... and tbh they never *actually* finished Azeroth before TBC came out. I'm all for some new shit-post-Naxx.
---
Yes i mistakenly wrote role instead of activity, doesn't change any of the points i've been making. Below par in pve raid dps =/= below par in the game as a whole
---
Why? It’s just a word. 
---
if you were really sincere when you said you'd love to be proven wrong, then i really do urge you to look it up, because it's absolutely true. 
---
if you were to go full hardcore mode, I'd personally want a druid as 3rd tank (2 warrior MTs, Druid tank, and then 2 Warrior OT playing fury but with interest of mainspecc tank -tps tank- in case one of the maintanks quits)
---
We didn't even play the same game mate. So what is there to prove? Private servers =/= Vanilla.
---
&gt; your crumbling argument... grasp for straws... stop with the drowning... you cant lie to yourself man... actively trying to ruin it.
---
Okay, since you're clearly too emotional for this conversation, I'll keep it nice and simple:
---
Sharding starting-zones for a week will impact **an hour**—an hour and a half, tops—of your total future years of Classic. As someone who's played on p-servers for a long time, starting-zones take about an hour of your total game time.
---
That's far less disruptive than all the core game mechanics you would need to change to support the entire pop cap of a realm existing in only eight zones—the way private servers have had to do it:
---
* [http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf](http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf)
---
So until you can actually engage with these facts in a non-emotional way, without emotionally loaded language, then you're not ready to have this discussion.
---
&gt; You dont have to answer this.
---
Of course you want to end this discussion. You know you're out of your depth and that the facts don't care about your feelings.
---
&gt;Sharding starting-zones for a week will impact an hour—an hour and a half, tops—of your total future years of Classic.
---
Ok so a little shit is better than no shit at all.
---
Just drop it man. You dont have to embarrass yourself anymore in front of everyone.
---
Lets make classic wow great, together ok?
---
No sharding, at all, ever, never, at any shape or form &lt;3
---
So he never played WoW before, but he's interested in Classic if there's no sharding?
---
At what point in this story do you want us to all stand up and clap?
---
20k with dynamic spawning.
---
Nostalrius was the best version of WoW I ever played, felt so much more alive than retail ever did, and that was because of the huge population. Actually having multiple guids crash into each other on their way to MC or ZG island was truly something awesome.
---
Some of them are better. Others are worse. No one will convince me that vanilla Tauren looks nicer than than new ones.
---
Without sharding, all realms will be low pop unless server merges happen within six months.
---
I can't agree with someone who seriously thinks that merging servers and destroying realm communities is the proper way to handle a launch.
---
The one who wants to destroy Classic is you, and you can't even see it.
---
No its not, because then you end up with fewer guilds to raid with, dungeon timers will be longer.
---
Just replicate what the Nostalrius guys did, or even better let them manage the project.
---
I wouldn't know how to do it in the newer engine and API of Classic, but if Blizzard emulates the old API's functions, you'll be able to macro the Paladin's entire pve rotation to one button.
---
I did this on 2 Paladins. You can change the abilities in the macro as you gain new ones and can adjust to any build (Ret being most effective however). 
---
The point of this is to make combat mindless which allows you to focus on support more efficiently in groups. Paladin has boring combat for this very reason, so making it even easier actually improves the class and makes it more fun and effective.
---
&gt; Lol @ people afraid to play private servers
---
Afraid has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
Private server class mechanics are 100% functional as they were in retail vanilla. You again show your ignorance. The things that are potentially wrong in private servers are things like how much resistance a particular mob has and how a quest event is scripted. 
---
Ask not what your guild can do for you, but what you can do for your guild
---
&gt; Blizzard still put thought into the cap. 
---
Technical limitations back in 2004.
---
It would be awesome to have this as a one time event where everyone is absolutely gargantuan and you have titanic PvP battles.
---
playing on a private server is not only beneficial to help you explore and enjoy the game at your own pace and figure out if you like it without spending a penny, it's NECESSARY if you want to play anything besides the most current expansion
---
and yeah, /r/gatekeeping
---
Maybe for you? There is plenty that are. :D
---
I'm hoping that ancient Cosmos zip file is been to lazy to delete will finally come back into play. 
---
&gt; Didn't they keep old versions of their server cores? They just deleted everything? That's a bit hard to believe.
---
2004 game design was almost a different universe, my dude. I'm *shocked* they actually found the data files in cold storage back-up after fifteen years.
---
*That's* the real unbelievable thing.
---
It was a limitation, but the game was built around having a population that size. They knew their limitations and built the game in a way that it would function at that population. 
---
Im pretty sure in a John Staats interview, he says that even though it was a limitation, Blizzard still intended it to have numbers around that point. Compared to debuff-slot numbers, which was a limitation that actually hampered class gameplay.
---
Yep, the higher the pop the better. Vanilla WoW works very well with a huge pop because of how the continents are designed, and the amount of zones people are scattered around in.
---
The higher pop also fixes some of Vanilla's issue like long ass "queue" timers for dungeons,limited raiding guilds and questing later on while "everyone" is already 60.
---
The dynamic respawning would have to be cranked so high it would feel like retail in spots, right?
---
&gt;Without sharding, all realms will be low pop within six months unless server merges start happening.
---
Yes, you can pretend I didnt demolish that argument already. You can pretend, thats ok. Its part of coping, the truth will come later to you.
---
Classic will be glorious when we will make it unsharded &lt;3 tourists will leave, new people will come in masses to replace the ranks. It will great, I know you already know it, but I'm just reassuring that to you.
---
Feel free to DM me anytime to talk about how great anti-sharding is, now that we agree on it
---
If you wanna spend hours and hours getting ganked in STV you go right ahead. I'm not the one paying your subscription. I want to play Classic for PvE.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
Your answer is in this video.  
---
Sure. That's why private servers got warlocks pet summoning wrong all those year?
---
Like I said. I would love to be proven wrong but privateservers are not the same game. Feel free to remind me when vanilla is out and feral druids are in every server first kill. But they won't be. And they won't really be viable.
---
&gt; Feel free to DM me anytime to talk about how great anti-sharding is, now that we agree on it
---
Yeah, it's clear you want this conversation to stop being public as fast as possible because of how insane you sound right now. Holy shit.
---
Pre-cataclysm changes will kill current questhelpers and we won't be able to load up vanilla addons as they won't work with the legion client. I'd guess addons which won't reference missing mechanisms (spells/items etc) like Bagnon will be fine. I wrote a poison reminder addon I'm looking forward to fixing for classic - a month before launch I'll probably resub and get it working properly on retail as I'm guessing there will be minimal tweaks needed to convert it to the classic client.
---
I wish I could use a dwarf steam tank as mount
---
I don't have any expectations, really. Humans are a mixed bunch and unfortunately, even when guilds advertise themselves as something, that doesn't mean they provide it. 
---
What I am generally searching for when looking for a guild is: Compatibility. Guilds are made of people with their own goals and viewpoints, I have my own goals and viewpoints and those need to align somewhat. 
---
Specifically, I'll be looking for a guild that makes their chat a bit of a safe space. I just plain don't want to deal with certain unsavory topics while gaming and if others do, that's fine, but they'll have to do it without me. 
---
Other than that, my interests are diverse - I like RP, I like raiding, I like leveling alts and I can enjoy structured PvP in battlegrounds as well, so I'm not fixated on anything in particular. Raiding of course is a goal, but I only have so much time and I'm not willing to compromise point one, so I might have to make other compromises instead. We'll see! :3
---
Then they can have low pop and HUGE pop servers, and all the hipsters can play on their 1-2k pop PvE realms, and for us who likes MMORPGs can play on the huge pop servers.
---
Night Elf Warrior tanks are pretty good, 10 nature resist and the 1% increased dodge chance are really strong bonuses.
---
Lost jobs, divorced, dropped out of school and more. 
---
The salt on you will dilute soon, dont worry.
---
Just be happy that you have finally found the light.
---
Troll mage is great because berserking
---
this is the most disingenuous interpretation of an argument i've heard in a really long time, and that's saying ALOT.
---
Are you really so smooth brained that you think you have to be able to read the minds of the developers in 2006 to interpret the intended functionality of the existence of a toolkit?
---
Come on. Even a 16-yr old programmer keeps older versions of his code. Subvsersion exists since 2000. And we are talking about one of the greatest video game producers of that time. I just don't believe all this, maybe they present it as a "reconstruction" for more hype.
---
it will be nearly identical to the [class population distribution as it was before](https://web.archive.org/web/20050804002226/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php), with some minor variations. i expect warlock will be a bit higher, and orcs/dwarves will definitely be much higher.
---
Yeah, if you were surrounded by like 200 people. Then it should be fast as well, but I still prefer that over sharding.
---
Another negative against enchanting -- you can level it all the way up and get to max, and still be dependent on your Guild actually giving you the recipe to really make any good money off something big like healing power or spell power. You might just be stuck doing nothing but crusader over and over again if your Guild Master decides they also want to be the guild enchanter, or if there are 15 other enchanters in your guild etc. Or even if you ARE the designated enchanter... and you miss ONE single raid where it drops... 
---
lol no pressure tho.
---
Splitting the player base isn't an issue when one subscription covers the entry for all. The audience isn't competing against each other.
---
The only issue is the time invested to emulate each expansions vs the projected gain on subs. The moment Blizzard discovers that their effort to recreate the old expansions doesn't gain enough new subscriptions, consider it dead.
---
No amount of player whining will bring an expansions not worth making.
---
"60-80 was exactly the same, except for what was different."  Vanilla leveling was better than Cata leveling.  TBC and WotLK end game was WAY better than Cata end-game.  So you get a downgrade in both areas.
---
I'm not talking about what I think as an individual.  I'm talking about every poll I've ever seen on "what is the best expansion," what the general consensus is.  There is a much higher demand for Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK than any expansion other than whatever is current.
---
If they want to do more past Cata, I don't think they shouldn't.  I just don't see that there's a big enough market for it to be worth it.
---
Great for levelling
---
Releasing ZG and BWL together (Dramatically reducing BWL difficulty) - *I sleep*
---
But Blizzlike EU Dire maul release for raid you can complete in greens - **REEEEEEEEEE**
---
Ok, warlock demon summoning is part of the 0.1%. But damaging abilities have a tooltip describing exactly the damage and scaling they have, that is publicly available information that private servers didn't have to guess. And even if there was some small discrepancies, that won't make feral go from being an actual top tier dps to trash tier in classic, they'd at most be very very slightly weaker if there turns out to be small mistakes. And, it's a pretty recent discovery on private servers that feral druid are as good as they are, if you go back to nostalrius days people still thought they were trash. But today they are generally regarded as awesome.  
---
Will be playing as a human mage most likely since I can't stand the look of gnomes even though they are the optimal race.
---
I think anyone who thinks Dire Maul being out a little early will drastically change the difficulty of the game is over-reacting.
---
I've seen the video and it is not convincing for the reasons above.
---
They need modern development and hosting tech.
---
It's that simple. 
---
End of story.
---
Don't look so much into the word "retail tourist" when I use it as a derogatory term. I simply mean people who are here for the hype and have no plans on actually playing classic. 
---
A lot of people like the populated realms and plan to play on nothing less, even if it means long ques. It's going to be hard to discern which is going to be a main-staying population server (like Tichondrius always was for example) just by going off of population numbers on the initial launch. The first time around, it happened to many servers and many people were begging for mergers: I believe this time the same will happen but on a much bigger scale at a much more accelerated pace. 
---
A friendly environment above all else.
---
You can raid without being a bunch of dicks.
---
you can BG without being a bunch of dicks.
---
you can make jokes and tease people without resorting to being an edgelord.
---
Being an "adult" guild doesn't mean there wont be social consequences for douchbaggery or bigotry. Adults dont need to be edgy like that for attention, children do.
---
Good choice. I was lucky enough to get a spot in a hardcore guild as a feral offtank, so I'm happy too.
---
Of course, as I said, this requires minimal modifications in the original code. Nothing fancy. Can be done by professionals in a couple of weeks.
---
I mean, you can disbelieve it all you want but I appeal to all the IT / programmer dudes in this sub (actual professional ones) to back me up on this. 
---
You'd be *shocked* at how much companies don't follow standard practices for a million different reasons. Or stuff failing. Or basic human error. 
---
Like the saying goes: You don't want to see the sausage being made. It's not sexy.
---
Great synopsis, I had a similar one I had made for my own personal use when deciding what class to roll and to help my friends, and I was surprised to see some of the things here that were word for word bullets on my own. Some things I thought I would add for anybody interested in more, or if you want to add any to your own:
---
**Warriors:**
---
* You're not only competing with only other warriors for gear, but other melee in general, including popular Rogues. Some of the BiS DPS gear for warriors isn't plate.
---
* Very weapon reliant, you will need to keep your weapon updated as you level, as if the leveling experience wasn't painful enough already. And because AV will almost certainly not be available at launch, getting a good weapon(s) will be challenging.
---
* Expensive to play because of both repair bills and heavy leaning on consumables. 
---
* Many poor matchups 1v1 in PvP, but strong against Rogues.
---
* Because of the reasons above, they are best suited for very hardcore players early on, as they require a lot of playtime to level and gear, and you will need to be raiding in order to feel like your investment was worth it. But if you do, you will reap the benefits as the strongest DPS in PvE and powerhouse in PvP, where you're a juggernaut if you have heals.
---
**Rogue**
---
* Rogues will be a very popular class, and you will have a lot of competition for gear (see above). But they aren't as reliant on gear as Warriors are.
---
* Generally have balanced or favorable matchups against anything that isn't a warrior. 
---
* Anybody can play a rogue, but they have a high skill cap.
---
* If there is no sharding on realms, then you can expect a devilsaur mafia to be controlling the devilsaur leather market, which means getting pre-raid BIS items will be challenging or expensive.
---
* If you want to play a melee DPS and aren't a hardcore player or raider, I would recommended Rogue over Warrior at release because of easier leveling, easier world PvP, and less gear reliance.
---
**Mage**
---
* Mages will be another popular class, as they have very limited downsides.
---
* Decently high skill cap in engaged PvP, but the unnoticed mage can volley nukes from the backline and contribute large amounts of easy, uncontested damage to the team.
---
* Mages are a solid pick for any player who wants to be good all around and doesn't mind playing a caster. They aren't for players who want to be toe to toe with their opponent or do not want to rely on evasion and control in PvP.
---
**Warlock**
---
* Warlocks are one of the few classes that have a versatile PvE and PvP spec (SM/Ruin). This will save time and money to players who want to both PvP and raid without having to respect constantly.
---
* Having a free mount at level 40 on a brand new server without an established economy is a huge perk.
---
* Locks are relatively easy to gear for PvE pre-raid, as many great items can come from Tailoring. 
---
* Rogues are a tough matchup, so this may not be a good class for players who are easily triggered by them. Otherwise they have balanced or strong matchups.
---
* Some people may remember Warlocks as a poor class in Vanilla, but this was before they received buffs in later Vanilla patches. Since Blizz has already said classes will be released in their 1.12 forms, you can expect the buffed version of Warlocks from the start.
---
**Hunter**
---
* Pets must be leveled up, fed, etc. But pet taming/collecting also gives Hunters an exclusive aspect to the game.
---
* They are quite hard to escape from PvP. They have a significant skillcap at 60 though, especially if they don't get the jump. Hunter who cannot kite will be preyed upon, and Hunters who can will thrive.
---
* Aspect of the Cheetah at 20 is great.
---
**Priest**
---
* Shadow is not only very strong in PvP, but has a low skill cap, can heal dungeons if necessary, and isn't very hard to gear for even outside of raiding. Because of this, Shadow priests are an excellent choice for players who know they won't be raiding but still want to be strong in PvP without a high skill cap.
---
* Having an offensive and defensive dispel is often overlooked.
---
* Because Shadow is completely capable of healing dungeons and groups, it will be much easier finding groups as a healer than as a shadow priest DPS.
---
* Prepare to drink a good bit in PvP. 
---
**Shaman**
---
* Many of the people interested in Shaman will be because of the notorious enhancement shaman windfury procs they remember, but people often forget what it's like when your Windfury isn't proccing: auto attacking and shocking on CD. It's much more likely you go on a bad luck streak without procs than a good luck streak with several. It's a very RNG playstyle, not controlled. It's also a difficult gearing process unless you grind out the PvP set. You've been warned.
---
* Ghost Wolf at 20 and reincarnation are both great. Relatively speaking, shamans are average levelers.
---
* If you plan on raiding in a raiding guild, you probably will be asked to respec to Resto, unless you have Nightfall and they don't have a nightfall enhancement shaman already. 
---
* However, shamans are not required to go deep into Resto talents to be capable healers. This opens up a very versatile 30/0/21 spec that allows them to PvP, raid, and solo without changing specs. In raids and dungeons you will be a dedicated healer, but in PvP you play a unique support spec that dispels, drops totems, damages, and heals. You also won't feel helpless when out in the world solo. This is a great spec for players who want to do it all without respeccing. 
---
* Purge in PvP is huge.
---
**Paladin**
---
* Holy is the only real viable spec in PvP and PvE. Protection is fine for groups with good AoE threat,  but relying on a quickly-draining mana pool sucks. Ret is not only very dependent on heavily contested gear (which you will probably have to heal in groups/raids to obtain anyway), but performs poorly compared to other DPS specs and has a very boring rotation. Reckonbomb spec is gimmicky, and you would find more consistent and effect results in other classes.
---
* As mentioned, Holy is very strong in PvP and PvE. Outside of survivability, throughput, and mana efficiency, they also bring plenty of strong support tools like Hammer of Justice, Blessing of Freedom, Blessing of Protection, and cleanses.
---
* Unfortunately, most of the best healing gear in the game is cloth, so temper your expectations of your physical appearance (see: [https://i.redd.it/mlbep5i1d4z01.jpg](https://i.redd.it/mlbep5i1d4z01.jpg)).
---
**Druid**
---
* Yes, leveling is quite fast and easy thanks to heals, stealth, travel form, etc. They are probably on par with or just behind Warlocks.
---
* Balance is a niche, gimmicky PvP spec capable of incredible short term burst only if properly geared, but quickly runs out of mana and must drink or die.
---
* Feral druids trade off the damage and tools that rogues have for the ability to heal themselves and decently tank. 
---
* Because of these jack of all trades aspects, you should not expect to play into one role or animal form. In PvP, you will constantly be swapping to different forms/toolkits regardless of spec, and therefore, this class has a very high skill cap.
---
* Druids are incredible flag runners, and make for exception world PvP healers if that's your thing (thanks to stealth). 
---
* Druid is definitely worth considering if you want to play a challenging and unique class. If you want to do one thing very well, another class will probably be more satisfactory to you. 
---
Inb4 comment about dire maul being out for EU release and how 1.12 talents are a bigger deal for raids than dire maul.
---
It's pretty much the opposite. A global server needs way less peak because it has a more steady population, a region server with 3k peak is completley dead any time but peak time. 
---
Thankyou!
---
With a lower population neither of those are problems. Personally, as someone who tolerates 8-10k, 20k would be so far removed from Vanilla, to the point where it would be unplayable for me. Can you imagine the speed Trade chat would move at? You would be able to rotate between 2-3 herbs because theyd be respawning so fast. Any questing at launch, and the following months, would be clusterfucks. The respawns from a recent launch of a server that was at 5-10k were already out of control. 
---
This is a great plan except for the fact you need 2 bank chars!
---
That's the age old problem with casual guilds. 
---
 On LH I was one of the top players in a casual guild. Now I am an average player in a semi-hardcore guild. I do less work now and enjoy faster raid times and more loot since we clear the content starting the first week it is released. There is also less drama because people know what matters and what doesn't. In the casual guild we had people quitting because they didn't get a doom edge drop lol 
---
Ok if they were so dumb and "deleted" everything, then how are they supposed to recover "hidden" game mechanics such as drop/proc rates etc. etc. where private servers are inaccurate? So there are 2 possibilities, either a) They were indeed dumb, and classic wow will be like Nolstarius or b) They have the code, and they just play with us for hype.
---
Wanting to know the people on your server doesn't make you a hipster.  And I don't think anybody *wants* a 1-2k cap, they want the numbers Vanilla had to offer, which are anywhere between 2.5k-3.5k.
---
I also wouldn't mind them doing optional sizes to appease different kinds of folks. 
---
That's actually probably a good thing then. I don't think I'd even want to play the game with someone that doesn't even know what a torrent is.
---
What a great source, hopefully it holds up to the product we get.  
---
Could you possibly change the spelling of ‘leveling’ before it kills me though 
---
The correct way to release Dire Maul, would be to make it available on US Classic realms 4 months after release, on European Classic realms 4 weeks after release, and on Korean Classic realms 2 months after release.
---
China Classic realms are, of course, expected to launch on the Burning Crusade expansion.
---
Have they specified what exactly is meant by "stage" for these releases?  For example, does "Stage 2" mean that BWL, BGs + PVP Rewards, and ZG are all dropping like *same day?*  Or could it mean that maybe they each are still going to be their own patch, and the "Stages" are just how they are internally thinking about the patches in terms of like, dev flighting?
---
Its really simple, no they don’t. ONE reason soo many people are asking for TBC as well is because of the lack of dungeon finder. 
---
Dungeon-finder alone changed the entire way most people played the game. No traveling to dungeons, no making your own group, and rarely even seeing people from the same server in your random groups. I know a lot more runs where done in complete silence once this was a thing, because no one wanted to waste time with people they would never see again.
---
I know plenty of people aren’t looking for old content that was changed later, they’re looking for the World of Warcraft that still feels like it has the “World” part. I know after TBC, I hardly know where any of the dungeons were located on the map, because game design allowed it to be that way. That’s sad, almost like humans using GPS, we can hardly get anywhere without it now. 
---
3-4k being the cap but with cross-realm battlegrounds
---
Difference is OSRS pushes out new content, classic can't unless they fuck the lore up or decide its in a different timeline.
---
Why not? They help the company pay the bills and they make for easy honor when you gank them or queue against them in a BG hahah
---
Having them on your team is another thing though... thats why 40 man raids were rough, those type of players could hide amongst the ranks and get by on a friend status for a while.
---
In fact thats why blizzard made the hunter class LOL jk hunters... &lt;3
---
I just did a lot of time on [unnamed private server] with Human Warlock. PvP is definitely tougher than it is as horde, and Gnomes' Escape Artist is very useful.
---
I don't think Humans really buff locks in any way, that said, if you *want* to play hard-mode, Human Warlock should be your choice.
---
But I would do Gnome or Orc if I did it all again.
---
My friend makes 80g/hr on his prot warrior by farming duo dme with a shaman, more than a mage
---
Reading comprehension please. I'll repeat what I already said:
---
&gt; I'm more shocked they actually found the data files in cold storage back-up after fifteen years.
---
If someone is asking, it means they care.
---
Stop being an ass.
---
Night elf isn’t bad. Have you seen the star shard pvp build? Brutal shit
---
&gt; Any questing at launch, and the following months, would be clusterfucks.
---
Thats the case for every release at least up to wod or something when they changed the looting system. And its fucking glorious.
---
And I don't disagree, its a complete shitshow in the early stages BUT when things settle down, and you don't have 5000 people in STV, but maybe 300 its a much better experience.
---
&gt;As someone who tolerates 8-10k, 20k would be so far removed from Vanilla
---
I don't care, the pop cap was a technical limitation, and I believe higher just makes vanilla better (it makes TBC/Wrath worse) but when you want to do content its easier to find people.
---
Biggest one for me is a NO political, religion, social issues rule in guild chat.   Carve that rule in stone.
---
I'm not sure why it's so hard for some people to keep that junk out of guild chat but man it's always a shit-show if that rule isn't enforced.
---
My money is on an alternate timeline server eventually. But that should be years after official launch and only IF the population dies like it did on RS.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about if you seriously believe this.
---
I bet you also believe that because it takes one woman nine months to deliver a child, you can just pay nine women to deliver a child in one month.
---
Rag wasn't killed before DM release. DM was out before any significant portion of vanilla raids were complete. 
---
The 1.12 itemization and talents are a bigger deal. 
---
Yep, as much as we might like the idea of an upront monetary cost to offset the tourist problem, having a few million people who are already invested in the WoW universe get a chance to check it out and possibly stay with vanilla will be a net-win for the vanilla playing population.
---
Are you a programmer? I don't think you have any concept of how complicated it would be to modify netcode from 2004 to work with modern cloud server infrastructure. They explained all of this at blizzcon.
---
Yes, they can make a working 1.12 server - they have done so and they say as much at the blizzcon where they talked about designing WoW Classic. Getting that 1.12 server to work with their modern server architecture was not possible. So they took what they could from the 1.12 server, mushed it into a new server on the battle.net cloud, and since then have been fixing the things that broke when they did that.
---
Why did they do it that way? Because rebuilding the netcode from scratch would take a lot longer.
---
lol okay pal.  
---
I'm 30 years old and I work a 9-5.  Through the week I'm in the same boat... perhaps 2-3 hours a night if I plan for it.  Friday and Saturday nights I plan on hitting it hard, though.
---
I, personally, am not worried about the ganking.  Sure, it will happen.  And it will slow things down, absolutely!  But it doesn't have to ruin a night if you don't let it.  There are other zones you can go quest or grind in.  There are instances you can run while things cool off.  If you aren't going crazy hard rushing to 60, there's no reason not to just *leave* any given camped zone and do something else for a while.  Though, if you're rushing to 60 like that anyway, odds are low you'll run into many people that much higher than you, so I wouldn't worry about it then, either.
---
For me, the feeling of persistent danger is a lot more valuable than the safety of playing on a PvE server.  It makes the end goal that much sweeter.
---
World of Warcraft is a hodgepodge rat's nest of code. Even at launch it was a mess.
---
To get that code working *well* (see: not private server well, but like, actual-built-out-game well) with their current architecture while also ensuring that everything works the way it should is a hell of a task.
---
Likewise, Nost (and the other private servers) never were able to replicate a true classic experience. They got close enough, but "close enough" isn't close enough for Blizzard.
---
I'm debating between the two for the same reasons. Going RP either way for the generally more mature player base, but a few nights of getting corpse camped on pservers has me unsure about RP-PVP. Like you said, in high school that'd have been a non-issue, but 50 hour work weeks make it a lot less palatable.   
---
If Blizzard would announce a release date already so I can book off that week with PTO, that'd be a big swing in favor of RP-PVP. Greater the lead ahead of the pack, less odds of getting camped while leveling.
---
&gt;Wanting to know the people on your server doesn't make you a hipster.
---
Weird, cuz I knew tons of people on Nostalrius, and we even had multiple rival guilds that we were competing with. This "you turn a faceless no-name" on a high pop server is a fallacy imo, if you have full tier 2 or whatever you still stand out from the crowd.
---
&gt;And I don't think anybody wants a 1-2k cap, they want the numbers Vanilla had to offer, which are anywhere between 2.5k-3.5k.
---
I think it will hurt the game because of all the downtime (which is not necessarily part of the game, but due to lack of players, and you will end up with 2-4 raiding guilds per server and if you are not in that sphere, then GL to you.)
---
&gt;I also wouldn't mind them doing optional sizes to appease different kinds of folks.
---
Yeah, they should. I want a huge pop server, I've played on low pop and high pop and from my experience high pop is always superior (besides the launch shitshow)
---
You can also go regrowth spec during MC/BWL and have a -0.5s cast time proc (+5pc T2) ending up with the fastest cast heal in the game at 1.3s.
---
Delete is a strong word.  Typical corporate process is to back up, archive, and then destroy records after some retention period.  The thing is that period is usually so long that the more likely outcome is that things get filed away and then someone else has trouble finding where it was stored, ESPECIALLY in the case of IT assets, which get archived on a server with a gibberish name and then shut off unless someone needs it, and even then it’s not a physical server so much as a virtual machine running on a virtual machine running on a virtual machine.  
---
You have to factor in as well with live data tables running, people are less concerned what the drop rate on Bear Asses was 15 years ago when we can tell you what it is today.  
---
They're not running the game on a separate client, they're running the game on their current client but in different servers. The amount of changes to coding, the engine, and everything in between ARE drastic. I don't know where you're coming up with this minimal change to coding thing but I disagree. For a game from 2004 to run on a current client is like sending a soldier from medieval Europe into WWII. The amount of technological advancements since then is vast.
---
Think about every single lamp post, every single chest, every single chair, every single terrain tile placed. It's an extreme amount of work. And if you think about it, considering the size of the game and the time frame from it being announced to the proposed release date is not that long. A lot of games are developed over the course of 3-5 years. They're doing it in 1 1/2. So it's not that long if you think about it, just feels that way because of all the hype.
---
&gt; Boomkins aren't the worst ASSUMING guilds use them right. 
---
If Boomkins aren't the worst caster DPS spec, what do you think is? Mages, warlocks, priests, or shamans?
---
Starshards is a pretty good spell while levelling, and probably makes NE the fastest race to level as priest.  It's more mana efficient and does more DPS than mindflay at a longer distance.  It's also staggered between ranks of smite and mindflay, so you almost never experience levels where your spell ranks are underpowered.
---
Plus, shadowmeld + mind control is the best PvP combo, nothing else comes close.
---
If they add the ability to use potions in bear form + barkskin that might not make them too powerful, but if they do too much they will be completely overpowered, druid threat gen in vanilla is really good and they already have the most health and armor, even when they get crushed they can just eat it, and for resistant fights like Rag which only do fire damage, having a ton of health plus fire res is better than any warrior would be able to do. The only thing they really lack while tanking is a way to ward fears from bosses, maybe they could add that. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8)  
---
As for cat form, the dps is already quite good, just below warriors/rogues in the bwl tier, that said in aq40/naxx there are a lot of fights that favor range for various reasons so they aren't that good, but neither are warriors/rogues on those fights. Plus they can offtank with just a few talent points, (maybe they could make windfury work for cat druids but that might make them OP)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyKoxMgqrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvyKoxMgqrM)   
---
And for healing, pre-Naxx they are only slightly worse healing than all the other healers, all the healers are quite balanced and it really depends on which healing targets you get for who tops heals on fights, plus they provide so many things like mark/thorns/decurse/heavy single targeted healing/innervate/battle rez, so idk if they would rework them. In Naxx gear they out scale the other healers so they will often top healing then, but at that point it doesn't really matter.    
---
Boomkins are pretty garbage though, so maybe they could rework that. 
---
Great list. My favorite raiding guild did things almost exactly like this and it made raiding a lot of fun because we got stuff done. 
---
Another thing I'd add is quick wipe recovery. No strategizing or bitching between pulls on progression. Strategies should have already been discussed on the guilds discord/website beforehand. Designated melee, ranged, healer channels that get used between wipes is great but I dont want voice chat cluttered with people arguing strats after a wipe.
---
&gt; The 1.12 itemization and talents are a bigger deal.  
---
I'm not denying that, but at least there is some evidence about this Dire Maul thing. There's no evidence about itemization changing. In fact the only evidence we have is that it won't.  
---
I find this stuff so interesting, didn't know they had a video on this - cheers the the link! 
---
This is how I look at it:
---
RP-PvP is only as good as the guilds who exist to care about RP. It will still end up playing 90%+ the same as a regular pvp server. Hopefully the population won't be too low either. It does often have guilds who organize and run world pvp events from a more RP perspective, if that that makes a difference.
---
RP-PvE will likely have strong RP guilds. It will still have active BGs. It may have come open world pvp at times but I wouldn't count on it being regular. What makes PvE fun is the social aspect, at least for me, and RP servers tend to have very social guilds. If maximizing pve enjoyment is enough alone, then an RP-PvE server is a great choice. This doesn't mean they raid better. It certainly affects the leveling experience for the like minded though.
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, because four black lotus spawns every 2 hours for a server that routinely hits 10,000 people was well-managed.
---
&gt;Dungeon-finder alone changed the entire way most people played the game. No traveling to dungeons, no making your own group, and rarely even seeing people from the same server in your random groups. I know a lot more runs where done in complete silence once this was a thing, because no one wanted to waste time with people they would never see again.
---
That already started in TBC with summoning stones, so who cares? Its only cross-faction thats the issue (that you never see those people again as you said).
---
and obviously there are other issues with TBC (Faction balance is AWFUL, horde just simply objectively superior to alliance in TBC, so most private servers end up with 80/20 H/A ratio or something similar) There is flying which makes the game feel small (outland being a small continent to begin with). And the continent of Outland itself which is not a well designed continent for faction balance due to the zones being so contested (no eastern kingdom supremacy for alliance, or kalimdor for horde).
---
TBC is still good, and playable. But there is still a lot there that I don't like, and it just increases in the following expansions.
---
Same here brother.  Bear buds unite &lt;3
---
That was a sneaky pun
---
I wasn't a herbalist, but the AV rushes were always funny.
---
Even the amount of people bitching over devilsaurs, good times. Better than any server Blizzard ever had.
---
I loved watching Horde duel outside Orgrimmar too! :)

I am saying DM in bucket 1 will have zero impact. They have said we are getting 1.12 so I doubt we will see itemization changes. It is what it is. But DM isn't a worry. 
---
I 10,000% doubt that the first thought a "normal healthy contributing member of society" would have about private servers is whoah dude isn't that CoPy RiGhT iNfRiNgEmEnT
---
Its hard to understand it if you dont have a general idea how coding and software infrastructure works. I am trying to think of an example i could give you that matches the situation but i can think of one for now. Running world of warcraft needs a shitload of additional "programs" to run it smoothly.  For example connecting all of the players to a server and having them enchange data and match with what others can see. All of these " additional programs" have been constantly updated over the years to fit their modern coding. But vanilla still has old coding, therefor giving their "additional programs"  a hard time reading this old code because it is used for what their coding "style" is now. Its more complex than this and this is a little of from whats going on but i hope u get the general point i am saying.
---
I hope there will be dueling. On private servers there’s no much dueling going on. Everyone is either ranking or raiding. Dueling is seen as a waste of time. 
---
Agreed. It makes sense that cities should be communication and gathering hubs. A big social aspect of Vanilla was seeing impressively geared players in the cities as icons to look up to. If no one has to return to town to find a group, then key social and even economic aspects of the game will be different. The argument that these channels existed at points of time in Vanilla is moot because the vast majority of people did not actually use them unlike the modern PS scene. There are a myriad of subtle and interconnected ways an "official" global chat would impact the game in a non-Vanilla way.
---
Give us your best Vanilla, Blizzard. Not some fat-free PS knockoff.
---
Elemental shaman hands down, but that's not the point of my post. The point was that if you think of them as "caster dps" then yes boomkins are utter shit. If you think of them as a healer who can swap to a dps/support role when you don't need extra healing (comes up often) then a raid could find a useful place for them.
---
Summoning stones and dungeon finder are FARRRRRRR from the same thing. The two honestly should never even be in the same sentence.
---
Hi, /u/captainkaba
---
Nice elitism.
---
Blizzard should charge 10 cents per world shout like a JRPG.  They can give 10 megaphones to new players when they start, and 3 for special events, and you can always buy more in the cash shop.
---
4k cap. If two servers consistently drop below 2k peak population then they get merged together. This way the range of peak populations of vanilla servers is 2k to 4k which is a pretty healthy range.
---
DPS is pretty boring, only tanking/healing present some challenge in PVE, but taking is pretty easy. Healing, especially when you have shit gear, at least presents a challenge, so healing it is.
---
I'll start: I believe, all these minmaxing threads, guides for BiS and leveling optimizations which are a large part of the discussion here are part of the poison that killed vanilla wow. 
---
EU didn’t release with MC in EU. Stop spreading misinformation. 
---
And because MC is easy they should try to make it even easier? Reeee indeed. 
---
there were no troll druids in vanilla
---
Well if thats 99.9999%? thats still can be called "invalid"?
---
YES! Awesome writeup. I didn't think ret would be too good but that IS motivating stuff. I'll keep this in mind
---
pet DPS is minimal while leveling LOL just stop talking, ur the kind of player that makes people hate hunters, don't know shit
---
Plus they be even tougher to see if people are using modern graphics settings with all the extra foliage.
---
Doubt it all you want, its true lol. Obviously all of us here agree that its totally fine, since we play on them multiple times over and are discussing the details about an impending official launch of the game. But nothing changes the fact that vanilla WoW had the widest and most diverse playerbase of any game in history. They literally had toyota commercials for Wow, thats how big it was.
---
All I'm trying to say is you will definitely see a much broader range of player archetypes when classic releases than you do now on private servers. I am still friends with a ton of my former guildies, and even a lot of the no-lifers who had multiple 60s and raided 5 nights a week refuse to play on private servers.
---
DM is an additional problem on top of the itemization changes. It might only be the smoke of the fire, but it's still an issue.  
---
the fuck did u call me?
---
Yeah, because that's the people the OP talked about. HE CLEARLY DID NOT.
---
But if:
---
Then at least I will have something to laugh about, how professionals, raid "competitively" a 14 year old game..... talking about second hand embarrassing.
---
I feel like there's gonna be a lot more Rogues and Hunters at launch.
---
Agreed, not sure why this seems controversial to some of the people replying down below. I guess it makes sense if you put yourselves in the shoes of someone who never saw wow at its peak and how truly diverse it was.
---
&gt; Strategies should have already been discussed on the guilds discord/website beforehand.
---
This is so incredibly wrong.
---
A strategy that you've discussed, and isn't working, is the wrong strategy.
---
it’s a thing, just requires a lot of extra work to be good
---
Well because it kinda shows they don't use a computer a ton, aren't really a part of that internet and gaming culture. So you can't really assume they know how to play or have done any research. They definitely haven't not even taken a peek a a dps or best in slot spreadsheet. As an enemy? Sure. As someone who I might end up in a dungeon or a raid with? Absolutely no thanks.
---
Tech issues from amateur self-funded servers (lag, viewdistance etc.)
---
and on-release issues which settle down after a few months (you won't have 400 people on every quest by then, thats when people have started to spread out across zones due lvl differences).
---
Dynamic respawns can be improved obviously, still a far superior solution than sharding.
---
Identity and "server identity" still remains and even flourishes on high pop servers, where you still recognize people with tier 2 (as most people won't have it), or thunderfuries, raggy hammers etc. And in addition you can even have guild rivalries on the same servers (completely unheard of on retail WoW), and even better multiple raiding guilds per server so you can't just be freezed out of the community if you don't get a long with the few available raiding guild-leaders on 2-3k pop server, as there will be 2-4 raiding guilds per server (both factions).
---
10k+ is obviously a shitshow on-release, but when its settles down the game feel much more alive (and superior imo) than WoW ever did on retail. Like an actual MMORPG.
---
How about we give EU the ACTUAL authentic experience we had in NA?  How about we all get the full experience instead of all getting the abridged version?
---
Why are people absorbing Blizzard’s obvious excuse-making as a valid argument?
---
It won’t ruin the game to launch Dire Maul with Classic, but we will miss 3.5 months of a specific slice of experience/content. Isn’t this what Classic is about?
---
Why are people SO eager to settle for an experience inferior to that of some private servers? I don't get it.
---
From TBC on, Elemental Shaman could play similar to a Mage. But Vanilla is a different animal because Frost Shock - a Shaman's only tool for keeping distance - has diminishing returns. Vanilla Mage is all about avoiding damage, while Vanilla Elemental is a tank.
---
Cast Lightning Bolt to your heart's content when you have distance. But when that Warrior gets in your face and puts Hamstring up, your best option is to melee him back with Flametongue Weapon and use max rank shocks to deal damage. You can sneak in a couple Lightning Bolts or Lesser Healing Waves when Eye of the Storm procs, but unlike the Mage, you will be casting with the Warrior on top of you.
---
This means that armor is an extremely important stat. A good shield with high armor is the most important item for an Elemental Shaman. As long as you have that, you can get away with cloth on your less impactful slots (bracers, belt, boots), but for the most part you will prioritize mail gear over all else. Hand of Edward the Odd (BoE epic) is also very good for an Ele Shaman - though that can be replaced with a high spellpower weapon like Lok'Amir if you're lucky enough to get one.
---
The only melee class that you can escape from relatively easily is Rogues. You can slow them with Earthbind Totem and then cleanse their Crippling Poison. But even then, you're only ever going to create enough space to get off maybe one cast before they're back on top of you again.
---
Because proc makes Ashbringer better than MoM as for ret pally.
---
Proc is scaled by spellpower and its crit can trigger Vengeance. (btw Drake Talon Cleaver is perfect in that case - its proc takes melee crit chance)
---
True. The people replying in the negative lack the perspective those of us who have seen it for ourselves. Not everyone has the time to simply reroll and get another toon to 60 when they have other responsibilities. Same for the people arguing about why some people would raise an eyebrow about the illegality of it all. 
---
There are a whole ton of people who would never risk private servers for a lot of different reasons. Just because those reasons arent stopping us doesnt mean theyre completely invalid for someone else with a different perspective.
---
you deserve more upvotes. great answers 
---
I disagree, summoning stones not only fucked the identity of the warlock, but also made again the world feel smaller, since you can just get summoned all over the place.
---
Never again will you see guilds running as a raid from X city to Y raid as a full group, you can traverse the world faster and easier than ever before and in turn it makes faster and less immersive.
---
Obviously summoning stones aren't as bad, and putting portals to all places of relevance in shattrath is a bigger disgrace. But its the beginning of QoL changes that turned the game into the abomination that it is now.
---
Quite the opposite
---
How? If MC was not cleared before DM came out, how can it possibly alter the experience? You'll be able to get kill onyxia with DM out. That is the only change. It was an available object for every raid first clear besides Onyxia in vanilla. How specifically will DM change anything else? Make early MC easier? That is the only foreseeable change.
---
Sure, it was out a month later when the vast majority of players were not even max level. In the context of its impact on raiding it may as well have been out at launch. 
---
To start with, the PI smite build is a meme spec that doesn't even work until late aq40/naxx gear so put that on hold. At start your best bet is PI disc healer. It saves you a lot of mana and if you play together with a warlock/ele shaman you two can lit a group of 2-3 people up really fast. You can also raid with this spec, which is great. For endgame (late BWL and beyond) the trispec is the best pvp spec. For both BGs and 1v1. I would say it becomes available once you hit 6.5k mana without speccing into mental strength (while still having 4k+ hp)
---
I'm in the same boat, but I also don't  care how fast I level up so I'm sticking with PvP. If you are however concerned with keeping up, particularly if plan on being in a raiding guild at launch, then maybe consider PvE. It's all about what your priorities are. My priority is to take my sweet time and play how I've always played. 
---
Of course it’s possible! Just won’t be as efficient because your damaging abilities towards NPC’s will be lackluster, and you’ll be questing more often than running dungeons, typically speaking 
---
I plan on stopping showering, so as to break out in acne for that authentic experience of being 15 years old again.
---
Picky about graphics but her jaw dropped at 2004 shitty textures? Amazin lol
---
I don’t think that word means what you think it means.
---
Just level enhancment and keep some healing equip. You dont need the healing traits in dungeons until 60.
---
I really hope there are plans to keep WoW classic going post Naxx. They do not need to add new zones, just more content. Continue to add raids to help fill out gear sets for other talent specs that are less played. There are a ton of zones that could be tuned into level 60 5/10 mans or 40 man raids. Ton's of unused Scarlet Monastery content in EPL, add Karazhan in Deadwind Pass, Caverns of Time has literally unlimited potential. Being able to do off raids to get stuff like a Ret paladin set or Balance Druid set that makes them viable would be amazing for the game. World PvP events, and additional battle grounds could go a long way also. 
---
People still shouldn’t argue. It should be the officers or RL talking about what you’re going to do next time. Also, sometimes it’s not the strategy but the people executing it improperly that is the problem.
---
Best guild name so far and Horde. Shame you guys aren't US :(
---
Yeah that part definitely sucks, having someone like that in a group. And its even harder to get a whole group of 40 together to raid without some of the people being leeches for a free ride from the better players. I think thats part of the fun though, when you find people who are as good as you and make your social groups around it and bond over tryharding together. Thats fun for me anyways, it can definitely be frustrating too.
---
Not just that
---
I payed vanilla and I veeeeeery rarely saw a dps warrior in a raid environment 
---
I’m quite sure even the best PS messes with the defense values and numbers of many many raid bosses , I don’t expect to see many of those fury leet dpsr in classic , however blizz themselves lost their original data and are working on shady backups they found on a landfill computer or something , I doubt it will be 100% correct but the thing is , no one knows what the actual vanilla values/numbers were 
---
Group 1 player here. Still an active Mythic raider on retail. Briefly toyed with private servers, and now flatly reject them.
---
I think that Classic will appeal to old vanilla players who don't have the time to keep up with the 'play the patch' gear resets that the current game has become, but there will be others who will miss the fast paced combat of the current game (even putting some cooldowns on GCD has many current players feeling like the game is 'sluggish', and it is still vastly faster than vanilla ever was).
---
What actually worries me the most about classic is the private server echo chamber community of enthusiasts who will vigorously shout down anything or anyone they deem impure (or rather differs from their preferred implementation as done on their favorite private server), and how that carries over into the released game.
---
I’ll be looking at an RP-PvE most likely, assuming this server type is available. I began on an RP-PvP (Lithoof), and ended on a straight PvP. This was while I was the early stages of my adult life/career. The ganking sucked and did cause frustrations when I had an hour to log in and do some quests, and a pack of 60’s were off’ing lowbies and having a circle jerk over the corpses as if they accomplished something. 
---
Now I am more settled into a career, have two kids, and my hobbies include more than just computer games (they didn’t at the time of WoW vanilla). I don’t have time to waste while the kiddies have their joint wank.
---
I am a casual looking for Casual NA Horde PVE.
---
My pserver went dead when eu went to bed. It was those in between times when both regions were online at the same time that was the issue. We could have easily had a 3-5k pop when it was primarily na players.
---
Laugh it up. It’s going to happen. That’s the first thing pserver players will do. 
---
Female nelfs on tight leather lingerie
---
That’s hot 
---
I hope so too. And I think we will see it come back, since there will be a bit of permanence to what we are doing on live servers.
---
On private servers, every moment is precious since it can all come crashing down at any time. Hell.. even if you just take your time leveling to 60 at a slow rate there might be a new F R E S H server that comes out and makes 90% of the population jump ship right as you start hitting 60 :(
---
"Look forward to dialogue with the community in the coming months" 
---
i lold.
---
I bought a bunch of early Linkin park albums and an old hi-fi. I'm ready. 
---
I dig the RP-PvP servers.
---
Escaping a gank camp is more rewarding to me than finishing a dungeon or killing a rare.
---
Another big point people (especially the few arrogant pve players) overplay is ganking.
---
Often they give hypberolic stories about how they got camped for hours on end in every zone, every times of the day which is just totally untrue.
---
Or alternatively people compared the amount of world pvp happening on the mega private servers with ~10k+ congruent players online at all times to how it will be in classic.  Also untrue, just by virtue of these servers have totally unrealistic player population caps that won't be present in classic servers. Many of these people like to parade nonsense like "omg only 4k people online, dead server" both ironically and unironically.  With the server feeling "dead" to them with about double the MAXIMUM player population of 2005 vanilla servers had.
---
Ganking will be an absolute non-issue.  And its not even a big part of pvp servers with a lot of world pvp.  Most world pvp will happen at groups waiting at BRM for instances, DM, or hillsbrad just for nostalgia in stage 1 content of classic.
---
Its because for some of us, its all about the end game. 
---
A factor is also what class you play. I much more inclined to take a side-route on a rogue that shits on most classes while leveling and on the warrior I wanted to quit the game everytime I got ganked because I had no chance what so ever. Just back the chair out and let it happen and prey they are happy with one kill.
---
A hunter is also like a Rogue but with tracking. Put that mark up and let the chase begin. 
---
30/0/21 (31/0/20 at first when you hit 60 as someone mentioned is fine too) is the one and only build if you're serious about pvp as a shaman.
---
Sorry. I can't get on board with that mindset.
---
I don't like seperating people into two groups, and I'm glad its "free" and open to everyone who wants to play. The more the better for the game and us imo.
---
That *is* the dream.
---
I think they can add new content several months after Naxxramas is released, as long as it keeps the classic wow feel and doesn’t raise the level cap
---
I'd prefer 8k with dynamic respawns.
---
5k without dynamic respawns.
---
Fuck sharding.
---
Experience: vanilla beta, vanilla since launch 1-60 x3, Nost 1-60, and Nost's successor 1-60.
---
Bro I’ll boost you for toxic revenger runs if you want :) quicker than meteor shard 
---
This, so much this.
---
Yeah, well as I understand they are only talking about doing sharding for a limited time in starting zones - so at least after launch we should get regular no sharding starting zones.
---
If you are trying a strategy, and people are unable to execute it correctly after enough attempts, your immediate problem is not the people. Your problem is the strategy.
---
Unless you have a dozen people sitting outside the instance, ready to come in to replace the people fucking up, adjusting the strategy is going to get you better results then shrugging your shoulders, and going "Well, these morons can't execute, I guess there's nothing we can do!"
---
So you play basically how you want to play.
---
Or what is going on?
---
If you enjoy open world pvp go for the rp-pvp server even if it might take longer. The game shouldn't be a rush but a journey you enjoy. Also on rp-pvp servers people might be not inclined to gank as much as on regular pvp servers
---
It won't. Because I'm going to put a password on it. 
---
Thank you!  
---
Even if it's a rumor it still slightly satisfies my curiosity!
---
yes but if we're honest ppl are goong to level an alt at some point anyway. especially if your main is healing/support speced. i think if you level them simultaneously, with your farmer being about 10 levels ahead you actually save time and resources overall.
---
I've had 2 different conversations with people I barely see once a week about classic WoW.  Just randomly talking to people they brought up vanilla, and this is unprompted, they had no way to know that I was obsessed and was planning on no lifing it.  I think it can be really really big.  No game is filling that niche.   Semi-hardcore MMOs (harder than current but not insane like old 90s MMOs or Korea grindfests) like Vanilla no longer exist and I can't wait.
---
&gt;Hopefully leading to true RPG/DnD style games coming back to life instead of the slot machine cinematic hero theme park adventure. 
---
What do you think the whole Pillars of Eternity Project was for?
---
Any idea what talent is bugged here?
---
They could easily make it an alternate timeline kind of thing imo, they already fucked with timelines in recent expansions so why couldn't they with classic. I think they could really turn Classic into WoW's osrs but they'd have to be super smart in how they do it, which is hard to ask for from modern blizzard. 
---
DM had a colossal impact on raiding. I hope they don't release it with MC in Classic. 
---
i might scale that yes, creating one is a very small investment anyways.
---
Yeah, I like to thinks it's sun ray. And Im from Norway and Sol is sun translated
---
It trivializes content and pre-raid BiS items. MC becomes easier. Dire Maul has so many BiS items that are better than MC items for many casters. The reason why is +spell dmg +healing +attack power and so forth.
---
But there's no use explaining to someone who hasn't checked out progressive itemization and progressive content release with Dire Maul.
---
The goody-goody morally-superior players who refused to play on private servers are always right. Because private servers are for naughty pirates and all.
---
And killing beggers in main cities. Toggle at war with the guardians of centatrius or whatever and murderfuck them
---
I generally but 60 between 5 and 9 days played depending on, in order of importance:
---
1. Fuckarounditis
---
2. Professions
---
3. Class
---
4. RL
---
I’m expecting to ding 60 between 6-7 as I plan to max professions on the way up so I can pvp quickly. 
---
It’s got to a point now where even if I’m fucking about I still seem to be very quick. 
---
Wrong! Eu release was 2/11. DM release was 3/7! Feel the shame of a slight timeline error!
---
Who's lieing...I'm not lieing....you're lieing...
---
This is precisely what we're doing it for! Thank you for sharing; you made my day! :D
---
private servers make a great case for why world chat is a bad idea
---
&gt;actually thinking DPS is more important that uptime
---
&gt;not understanding that pets do less than a third of the DPS your autoshot does, and minimal DPS increases are overrated
---
&gt;thinking cats are the only viable leveling pets when they are at best par for the course
---
&gt;pretending to be a 1337 hunter when you've clearlyonly gotten to level 25 on a WotLK private server
---
&gt;[TFW](https://imgur.com/gallery/kI1B9)
---
There is no point is going resto while leveling. In reality you get 5% crit and 10% extra base heal and 5% lower mana cost and mana tide totem at 40+. Thats nice but in reality it makes a tiny difference in dungeons when you can drink between short fights.
---
You will run dungeons maybe 1-2 tines when you have quests. 95% of the time will be spent doing quests solo so it makes no sense to go resto.
---
With that said. Its not a super big difference to level as resto either. You will have the same spells and can use a 2h staff with windfury or rockbiter or 1h+shield and its not a huge difference in damage and level speed.
---
Personally I will level as enh and at lvl 40 spend the rest of the points into resto. That way I can be a pretty optimal dps in groups and totally viable healer with a set of int gear ready.
---
Thanks for setting up the site. I think it's more approachable than the old spreadsheet
---
They have more HoT spells than any other class and they have the strongest HoT in vanilla. Also, their direct heals are the weakest. That pretty much gives it away. We all know vanilla classes didn't exactly pan out to actually *work* as intended, but it's often clear to see what the intention was.
---
That along with how they became clear HoT healers in TBC and all xpacs since then does indicate that was the intend.
---
absolutely, fishing/herb/alch is likely the best value machine in terms of profs. i plan on engineering though, meaning i need a high longterm income of materials and gold. also i love grinding with a hunter, not so much with a resto shaman.
---
I've seen the argument made before that the OSRS population eclipsing the modern version is a good indication that the classic population can and might overtake the modern WoW population.
---
The incredibly huge difference in these two products is the size of their population (tens of thousands in runescape compared to millions in WoW). By comparison the Runescape population is tiny which makes it a niche market. It's not unreasonable to see an already niche market favor an old school version of that game, it is unreasonable however to expect a gigantic casual market to favor a non-casual friendly version of WoW.
---
Don't get me wrong, Classic WoW will do well but it has zero chance of overtaking Retail in population (especially considering there are 0 plans to support Classic with new content unlike retail)
---
is this supposed to be a viable argument? u just making urself look even more bad :D
---
I still don't what sharding is and it's probably better I don't know.
---
I mean, I'm still going to assume it's what happens when you eat too much sugar-free ice cream.
---
[Skarm Tank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ) has started posting [some videos recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo) focused on Druid Bear tanking, including specifics for particular raid encounters, and the pros and cons of Bear Tanks. 
---
This is why I suggest that everyone makes a second character that they keep rest xp near maximized. This is your selfish character.
---
Do what ever you want with it outside of caring about the level rush.
---
Oh man! As a casual who is going to take his time with the game, I am excited for the prospect of content slowly being released.
---
Haha I don't need an argument anymore, you haven't made a single point or refuted any of the ones I've brought up. You're just flailing and going "MUH CATS THO" without any type of argument other than "AtTaCk SpEeD". 
---
by the time this guy even starts playing (if he does) sharding won't even exist (if it even exists at all in the first week or two)
---
Is sharding a niche concern here now? Sharding for a week or two in the starting zones was never a concern for me but there were always lots of people speaking out against it.
---
It’s when you fart but a bit more than you expect comes out. 
---
I’ll try to find video. Paladins were demigods on private servers. There is a bugged talent that allows them to get massive holy damage.
---
I have never experience progressive itemization outside of starting from day 1 in vanilla, and the last 3 private servers that have done their bastardized version of progressive itemization. 
---
Can’t take damage if you’re sitting pretty in the Shady Rest Inn *taps forehead*
---
*cheapshot noise* 
---
&gt;If you wanna spend hours and hours ~~getting ganked~~ ganking in STV
---
fixed it
---
Well, going by the initial trailer at least, isn't the lore reason for the existence of Classic just Chromie having some fun? In which case we could do just about anything without affecting the established timeline. 
---
Lol you're real helpful to this community, spewing a bunch of misinformed nonsense while downvoting people who happen to have the experience you lack. You realize I want the game to be better for you too, right? Keep it up champ.
---
&gt; when I see a warlock I piss my pants and run away.
---
That made me spit coffee on my keyboard. Take your upvote.
---
I'd love to throw my mindset back to a time when positive people existed on the internet!
---
&gt; pets do less than a third of the DPS your autoshot does
---
uh huh, have fun leveling with ur pig noob
---
Dat non-contested territory ganking...
---
I agree that hunters probably had the highest skill cap in raids in vanilla, but that does not mean it was even remotely hard. It just took at least something more than literally spamming frostbolt. Autoshot timer and it's not that hard. Not saying TBC is harder, but wouldn't call it easier either. I at least liked Steady Shot.
---
As for PvP, you got your information all wrong. BM was not the only PvP spec through all of TBC. It was certainly strong, especially in S1 (scaling with pets allowed for high dmg) and quite strong in S4 as well if paired with a resto druid. However, deep SV with Wyvern Sting and Readiness had absolutely ridiculous CC and MM were quite strong with scatter and silence. From S2 / S3 I'd say all specs were viable. In S3 specially BM were the worst of the hunter specs. Overall hunters were among the luckiest for PvP spec balance, having all specs usable for large periods of the xpac, no other pure dps class had that.
---
and please tell us exactly what thing is bugged.
---
P.S. On that vid theres no any "super high numbers" - thats just default numbers for when youre on 2.5k attack power and \~1000 spell damage.
---
When the MT is feared Nef looks for the second highest threat on the table. 
---
Thank you for the response. I have no knowledge of enhancement at all, especially in classic, are there any good guides/builds you could point me towards?
---
Also, should you sue a 2h or 1h as enhancement? I never really understood which was better.
---
Hi, /u/ggxmembersonly
---
Lol you're a riot dude, I can't wait for you to start up classic and give up at level 30 when you realize how much longer it takes than retail. Please stick to hearthstone.
---
We "should" have a global LFG channel because that was part of Vanilla.
---
Personally I am torn between yay or nay for a global channel. Both have it's positives and negatives.
---
Classic is going to be huge. Alot of older players will be returning. I myself is 45. Even the kids which played Vanilla back in the day are all now grown up and some will be returning.  
---
Now saying this im not talking about instant millions of people trying to get into the servers. But i do expect a huge influx of players maybe in the hundreds of thousands. 
---
On a fresh server skinning is good because it's basically extra loot every beast kill you can vendor as you level. It's easy to level and hurts the least to re-roll when you're ready for a different profession.
---
Cool! Unfortunately I can't remember my original accounts info nor character names so... I am screwed. 
---
I remember doing that, once, in BC. Fun times.
---
You dont have to be resto to heal while leveling as others have said. However it is good practice to level with the resto talents if you wanna main resto at 60. You get a slightly better feel for cast times, mana costs, and healing power.
---
Lol I’ve been raiding vanilla for the past 10 years. Druids are only good for their raid buffs and for carrying the flag in BGs. Everyone knows that.
---
watch out boys, we got a professional coder here
---
u really believe pets do less than a third of dps autoshot does while leveling? im genuinely curious 
---
I'm a diehard death knight fan, so my classic characters are always 2h fury with lifestone and healing consumables. With an edgy name of course. 
---
Agreed. I have already been in contact from 1 person on my original server too. Granted they were actually an opposite faction ganker that I remembered from ganking us back in the day, and not a guildie LOL
---
Still I hope it gets even bigger and people get more eyes on it to gain popularity as that will bring even more folks into the fold
---
Even though Classic will officially be 1.13, it will attempt to emulate the progressive content in four given stages. If an item did not exist during the current content stage, it shouldn't be there. This object was implemented towards the very end of Vanilla. Having this object at Classic launch would either be a mistake or an inaccurate emulation.
---
Define colossal.
---
DM gear isn't going to be the reason people can/can't clear MC, I promise you.
---
Trivago
---
Not totally. If you recall your original realm you can search and see if you recognize anyone that you may want to reach out to. So not 100% screwed, just 50% screwed.
---
Since a thread was created I'll hijack this a little and say that it is indeed working.  I recognize one name from someone on my faction/server but hoping to find more.
---
Anyone from Alleria on Horde reading this?  (Vanilla/TBC era)  I was in the guild Tendrils of Mannoroth.  We had [this recruitment video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07tc2jafa4) from back in the day (even if you're not from Alleria, good for some good old fashioned PvP+rock music circa 2005)
---
You're not exactly wrong, but keep in mind that playing on a private server is completely free, and they usually lack any serious moderation. Trolls have very little to lose.
---
Maybe throw in the BC raids? At least Karazhan, that belonged in vanilla
---
Pvp servers and the greifing/time loss isnt worth it to me. If you really like the few times of rewarding open world pvp, and think getting camped/locked out of certain zones is part of the experience then go for it. Otherwise stick with PvE, you can still do bgs, and you can still world pvp at your choice instead of the opposing 60s choice.
---
I plan on taking a few weeks off work. Switching my mobile off. So people think im on holiday lol. Buying some energy drinks "im 45 getting abit long in the tooth" Im divorced so no nagging wife or kids. 
---
The full Nostalgic trip im ready. 
---
I did the same when vanilla was out all them years ago. I took a few weeks of work and booked my wife and kids a week away in south of the UK. Didnt need the energy drinks back then but i did have the beer :)
---
This is my priority when joining a guild respect and common courtesy is not that difficult.
---
How good are hunters in pvp?
---
Both are viable. 
---
https://youtu.be/hhJ78qfgrK4
---
This is a lengthy video but it's really helpful for someone starting to level their first totem mule, err shaman.
---
I really enjoyed the part about not face tanking every mob, and to instead drop your earthbind totem and kite the mob in and out of your melee distance so you're not getting smacked while you're waiting for your next melee swing 
---
And you'll be able heal dungeons as enhance during the leveling process. Just get another set of gear stacked with intellect 
---
What is a Pvt server?
---
Your iso probably just cared about the torrenting for the client, which you can get away with as long as you dont make a habit of it.
---
pvt= private
---
I also found a guy I raided with (not till wotlk tho) its neat and I certainly put my info in! 
---
Strange that you’re taking that ambiguous comment and applying it to Dire Maul. And regardless of the comment, of course timing could move for DM.
---
For the record, I still think the concern is overblown.
---
What did the email say exactly? I think the hosts of the servers may face some legal issues depending on where they are hosted etc but I don't believe playing on them would expose you to any sort of legal issue. ISPs are private companies and can set their own rules but I'm curious as to what your ISP is actually saying.
---
relatable 
---
Druid Question:
---
Can you cast the thorn buff on yourself, gather every mob up in a lowbie raid, say sub level 30. And just kill them all by afk-ing letting them kill themselves?
---
you really don't wanna go low bracket. it will be easy to get most gear. maybe not pants and hammer of beastial fury due to world dragon bosses... but i mean... full scope of pve gear for feral druid? you are gonna be a fucking nightmare for anyone in pvp. I had no problem in my guild at vanilla and I actually spent alot of time wiping on c`thun :p twin emps were that dreaded fight like "okay is this gonna be okay or are we just gonna get CB rekt :S"
---
They said something about using a torrent and playing copyrighted wow and if i continue doing it they have the right to terminate our service 
---
But when everyone looks like kings none does and those fighters look badass. 
---
It is no cloak for me all the way.
---
I always leveled as Elemental and geared for elemental while leveling.  Basically same gear you would use for healing.  Don't really need healing talents for dungeons while leveling.  I never had any issues.  Pull with 2 LB then use shield and 1h with flametongue + Lightning sheild to finish off.  Once you get EM, you will one shot people with LB followed by instant crit chain lightning lol...it's fun...well I guess that would be a 2 shot.
---
I read Druid is main tank on KT in Nax as in bear form is immune to mind control. So they're quite important really for the raid 
---
Broader? Are you calling me fat? 
---
And when bfa came out if I wanted to play a prot warrior I would get laughed at and told to go fury or arms. Wow has literally always had specs that are flat out bad for raiding.
---
What's your point?
---
Tbh getting clips like this requires a lot of luck. Not to take anything away from Rup - he is a very good player - but he also got really lucky here.
---
If a Hunter, Druid, Paladin, or even Warrior has showed up at some point it’s a *lot* less likely that he would have survived. (Or if any of these Mages had a clue about how to PvP).
---
This is honestly the hardest part of making a PvP movie or even just doing solo world PvP for fun - the stars have to align in terms of what classes you’re fighting and how bad the players are
---
You got hit because you torrented the client without a vpn.  You won’t get in trouble for playin the game, only for downloading the client (a one time download).
---
I don't believe, I know; I monitored my DPS on the last hunter I leveled, at best it was doing 40% of my damage and I just SS/AA with HM and occasionally arcane shot. At worst, it was ~30%. Ofc continue to throw names and spaz out though instead of providing anything useful. Or go ahead and say "buh you didn't count just auto shot" yeah I was exaggerating for effect you brainlet, the point still stands that a 5% pet dmg increase ends up being tiny overall at the cost of way more downtime. BUT AGAIN, I don't know why I repeat myself since you are just ignoring 75% of what I say anyway.
---
It adds no damage for a non bm hunter, attack speed is mostly a pvp stat
---
Another poll people seem to not bring up, https://www.strawpoll.me/17425758/r. Participants are Sodapoppin's viewers/followers on twitter. 
---
Their purpose was to conquer. 
---
You can easily micro your pet out of the dragon aoes
---
The game was designed around a specific cap. That cap was chosen deliberately with community in mind.
---
So I think the original cap is the best. No point in changing things that go against the original design, if we want changes there are always private servers. 
---
I’m going to counter this with please don’t create a website. Discord works fine for those things and people are free of the hurdles of an ugly websites that rarely sees activity anyway,
---
Same here, man! I wasn’t even a South Park fan, was just flipping through the channels and saw a South Park episode that looked completely different. It looked interesting so I watched it, thinking “what is this?” Not even realizing it was a real game. LoL! A few days later, I started thinking about actually trying the game out. The rest, as they say is history.
---
I was always under the impression pets did the same amount of auto attack damage and thus the hit speed was the reason that pet was the go to choice for damage (PvE not just PvP), until they got normalised. Probably wrong if that's the case. 
---
Wait, are we talking about 3k cap on logged in players or 3k total active players on a server?
---
&gt;And in addition you can even have guild rivalries on the same servers (completely unheard of on retail WoW), and even better multiple raiding guilds per server so you can't just be freezed out of the community if you don't get a long with the few available raiding guild-leaders on 2-3k pop server, as there will be 2-4 raiding guilds per server (both factions).
---
I played on Shattered Hand EU that was a high pop server, we had in excess of tens of raiding guild horde side even before the server transfer to Frostmane. There where also plenty of guild rivalries, both on the same faction and in alliance, some that went unanswered or unknown like kill order for all Order of the Hammer members they most likely did not know we had, and some that was natural and both sided like the contender for being second best guild inbetween Gosu and Fishbone. But perhaps you meant todays retail wow and not old classic, aswell as being frozen out of a smaller active population then Shattered Hand EU had?
---
I couldn't say if it changed at some point in vanilla, but in 1.12 a pet that attacks twice as fast does half the damage with each attack
---
Its Official. OP is deluded af. 
---
I was under the impression that the raid content was going to be progressive, but the rest of the game was 1.12. The classes will be 1.12, BG system will be 1.12, Professions will be 1.12, etc?
---
I'm taking the comment, which was aimed at the staged content release buckets, and applying it to Dire Maul, which exists inside the staged content release buckets.  
---
How is that wrong?  
---
Your wife loves vanilla wow? Damn you are one lucky man :/
---
From what I have researched Resto Shaman is slower to level, but it is still doable. Here is a video that shows you some tricks to make your life easier: https://youtu.be/lBUm58le8UU. It was made by a guy who leveled Resto Shaman to 60.
---
Level 5 characters to 60 and you will change your mind. Its a wonderful experience the first and even the second time, but once you have played through vanilla several times you actually start having fun from tryinf your best and pushing the limits. Thats why people rush to 60, not because they want to skip the content but because they have different goals that make the game fun for them.
---
is there anyway to get around this? 
---
Use a vpn when you torrent.  Private internet access is cheap and easy to use.
---
This is great! LoL!! 
---
I’m happily married, but I’d be lying if I said part of me wasn’t jealous of your plan!
---
*embarrassment 
---
so you hear it alot?
---
It’s not wrong, but there is a lot of content and you made a thread about how it applies to one thing on your wish list. We already know the buckets aren’t final. There is no indication that DM specifically is moving — there’s no news.
---
Quick question, did you have to pay for that article that was written about the website? I forget who published it.
---
"Working" is a stretch with how awful the website loads.
---
I normally main Shaman so I just get a grin because I know the free honor is about to try to kill me. Rogues can beat shamans but the number of rogues that can beat shamans who will immediately equip their shield and drop poison cleansing totem is pretty limited.
---
My point is if you wanna level on a pvp server look up all the tips and tricks your class has to deal with rogues. Most rogues are noobs and will fall apart when you throw a spanner in the works. You will be getting ganked by rogues more then any other class so this stuff is important and can save your guy.
---
I can tell you I am considering playing a rogue during classic when it drops and, I promise you even though the leveling match up favors the rogue. If I tried to gank me playing my shaman. I would get my ass handed to me. I have dabbled in rogue and I'm pretty terrible at it. lol
---
And is a no-log VPN.  
---
Exactly,this is the key. All of OSRS’s new content is pitched to the the community by the devs and only goes into the game of over 75% vote yes on it.
---
It’s basically blizzards chance to update and expand the game slowly and carefully and not fuck it up like they did the first time.
---
Cool idea for a video, and I dug the visuals!  The track wasn't bad, either.  But your mic was pretty strange sounding, and the balance sounded all over the place.
---
No point being resto specced for levelling dungeons, just a huge waste of time.
---
So just use the vpn when i download? and can i uninstall the torrent after the download and still be able to play?
---
ask the guy who made the website. I have no idea.
---
It was a brand new game. People didn't know what they were supposed to do or what was waiting at max level therefore the very long lifespan of Ragnaros. 
---
Im not /u/MajesticDruid but it makes sense to me.
---
Wow graphics hold up incredibly well compared to other games of the time because of the cartoon-ish art style. It makes for a timeless appeal that other games lack when they tried to be more serious/realistic
---
There are hundreds of polls posted here just go look for them
---
Typically horde is known for having better PvP racials. But you can still PvE as horde and still PvP as Alliance. From what I recall Alliance won AV more and Horde won WSG and AB more. Does anyone else feel the same way or have a differing opinion?
---
Your math seems to be missing a lot of factors for bite damage, but since you didn't post it I can't say for sure.
---
Bite has a 10 second cooldown and its damage is reduced by armor, so its dps is certainly less than lightning breath. You also won't have the focus to bite on cooldown if you are growling on cooldown
---
You also ignored the difference in auto attack damage, wind serpents will do 7% more damage than a wolf.
---
In my experience wind serpents and cats (properly micro'd) are about equal after zg, and wolfs are behind them by more than the 15-20 dps howl contributes.
---
I've played Warrior and Priest and all I can tell you is:
---
God damn, they are a pain in the ass. I don't even know if it's worth it to kill the pet.
---
I can't wait to exclusively play dwarves, gnomes and orcs.
---
Thinly veiled self-promotion.
---
They're out there. My wife is fucking stoked.
---
As I don't think they're going to ever add expansions, this escape may be more than temporary. :D
---
Wrath was my escape. Was in my early 20s and life and all it's prospects were all fucked up. But who could worry when Wintergrasp was going every few hours? :D
---
I'm surprised no one has said Skinning.
---
I remember a few recipes required access to Rugged Leather. I think it was those awesome 14-slot bags. Personally, I love looting beasts twice. First for the meats, vendor greys, and then again for them useful hides. :D
---
Damn where have I been looking for a gf? :/ Congrats mate.
---
Ah cool, thank you!
---
I'm gonna say yeah probably. That's assuming it wasn't essentially self published.
---
Role, raid viability, quality of life (gold making, convenience, etc.) in that order.
---
Well you will have to forgive my lack of BFA knowledge as I haven't played since wotlk, but that doesn't sound like a good thing any more than the example that I provided.
---
Literally never heard of the Pillars of Eternity Porject, and I have played many different MMOs.. I think classic will be my 6th MMO? And thats not even counting re-playing privates multiple times as separate ones of course lol
---
I think you underestimate how much of an effect the wow cultural explosion had on the country, and how much of the advertisements reached a wide audience. That Project I presume is more niche and tied to people who were into Elder Scrolls type games? Ill have to read about it, sounds interesting. If things explode again though with classic I would definitely call it a wow win and not an obsidian... Ill check it out and see though, maybe there is a bigger following than I realize or something

Depends on what you mean by "trouble." The vanilla client is very old, and you know what happens with very old internet-facing applications. At this point it's basically a very entertaining attack vector for hackers -- including the ones operating the pserver to which the client connects. I only run the vanilla client in a virtualized sandbox -- when you're getting down with an older lady it pays to wear a condom.
---
Private servers usually have pops in the tens of thousands while Vanilla had server pops of about 3k. I loved global chat on my medium pop server in vanilla
---
*Hi human!* It's your **5th Cakeday** Wizecrax! ^(hug)
---
The secret to what made classic wow such a stand out hint is simple. The game is Highly accessible and easy to pick up and play. While at the same time allowing for deep complex play and mastery. For example at it's most simple all a warlock really need do is spam shadow bolt. As long as you can even pull off that minimum you can play. No barriers no walls no cut off. Your Dad, Mom, Wife, ect.. ect.. can all be brought into the fold and it never feels like too much for them.
---
The new game has been completely gutted. All of the casual aspects have been scaled back on or stream lined as just steps to the "real" game. Which blizzard considers raiding to be. The problem with that attitude is almost no one raids or cares about raids. They are a cool thing hard core players do. Not the game itself. Classic wow before anything was an adventure. Not a place to farm gear and raid. 
---
Professional IT dude here: I back you up on this.
---
I'm often shocked at best practices even today.
---
Backups are much better today, but it's still hit and miss. It's also always a question on "how important is this data"? Sure, the server core two releases ago is not unimportant, but no one will go to jail if this data is lost.
---
And there have been many advances in the past two decades. Storage cost has nosedived, and software deployment is much more flexible. Today, you can just make a snapshot of all your servers, including the databases, and dump it into the cloud, and keep it for a 100 bucks a month. In 2006, that was just not possible.

U guys seems to forgot DM went out in 1.3, only 4 month after MC release in 1.1. By the time people were able to go in MC, they were also farming DM
---
Druid bears can get mced by Hakkar
---
The maps and quests are (I think). Literally nothing else whatsoever, particularly since mob scaling was introduced.
---
Exactly the same for me. It took many months, and I saw level 60 as having finished the game. While leveling I wasn't even aware of end game raiding. I saw all level 60's as the same, and really looked up to them. Only when nearing level 60 I became aware of the importance of epic gear, high PvP ranks and raids.
---
Damn, this really kills the whole idea of the game.
---
Reminds me of how the did 'phasing' for the Undercity quest in Wrath.
---
Although the video is enjoyable, it's made on a fun server so numerical values cannot be taken seriously 
---
I think Warlock will be a lot more popular than in vanilla. 
---
Yep, hit 60 over Christmas, 7/8 t2 and 3 pieces of AQ gear.  Multiple offers from raid guilds after my guild broke up last week
---
Imagine if you met your wife in Vanilla Wow.  Oh wait that’s me.  Scarlet Monestary run in 2005.
---
When you gain stats that increase your hp or mana does your hp/mana stay at its previous value or at the percentage it was on? If the latter would removing your gear increase the efficiency of food/drink?
---
People are so weird about DM. Almost no one was progressing through MC before DM was released anyways. 
---
Personally my guild wiped on the FIRST TWO GIANTS when we stepped into MC. Everyone sucked lol 
---
totally agree 
---
"It was a 15 minute conversation guys, didn't want there to be a novel here."
---
Know your audience you S.O.B. lol I kidd. Glad to see I am not the only one who is hype.
---
Nope, none of it is even final, and it even says "Current thinking:" right on the slide. The panic is a little premature.
---
I am going to RP as an anti-ganker at 60, saving lowbies everywhere, who might be in-character themselves. Bring on rp-pvp! 
---
Anyone complaining about Dire Maul being available on release isn't complaining because of it's effect on the authentic vanilla experience, they're complaining because of it's effect on their experience relevant to private servers.
---
Just thought I'd share.
---
5K
---
Just like they were looking forward to "partnering with the community" after Blizzcon 2017, right? We then proceeded to get exactly _one post_ about classic throughout the entire next year.
---
It wasn’t better than WoW but I loved Final Fantasy 11. 
---
If you haven’t played it (and even if you did), listen to the soundtrack on YouTube, it’s one of my favourites. 
---
HP and mana stay at their original value when you gain or lose stats for any reason. Unless your new max hp/mana is less than the current value of course.
---
4k-5k is the sweet spot for me. I am okay with the world being bustling. In my opinion too many people wanna schedule time for something then when they can't do it get upset. For me I prefer the mindset of log in and it's time for adventure. Not everything goes to plan on an adventure.
---
take a point out of imp charge and put it into am
---
&gt; Has there been any news about this?
---
We don't know yet. Ion did say that they want the historical recreation and that Classic they want it feel just like 2006 World of Warcraft so, yea, we will have to wait and see.
---
My concern is with it's compounding effect that it will have with 1.12 itemization and talents, which are not Blizzlike just as private servers are not Blizzlike.  
---
I mean remove DM from the equation all together and there is still a massive problem by keeping 1.12 itemization around.  
---
Oh man. I completely forgot about this part of the game! Lots of good times outside of Stormwind and the Ironforge bank by using the glitch. 
---
There isn't really any non-concurrent player cap on a server.
---
It's definitely not worth killing the pet except as spite if you 100% can't reach the hunter and are resigned to your fate. Hunter pets have good hp, armor nearly on par with plate wearing players, and usually have resistances enough to reduce magic damage by 20%+. Even a leveling BM hunter's pet deals half the DPS its owner does, at max level the typical marksman hunter pet deals far less damage, so killing it doesn't change much considering how much damage it will soak before dying.
---
As long as you know what you're getting yourself into.
---
Druids can do fine in many venues, either as the mainstream resto healer or the crazy support in BGs.
---
They are also really strong in world pvp, can tank dungeons really well, got a niche dps role which has a fun and involving rotation and people will love you for playing a Druid.
---
lol
---
Especially if you're on a pvp server, arms is king while leveling. Imp overpower, anger management, deep wounds/impale, and sweeping strikes are absolutely huge gains compared to 5% crit, piercing howl, imp BS, and enrage/DW once you take out the guaranteed enrage proc from sitting. Not only that, but it's better for tanking dungeons.
---
So doing the tried and true ony strat over and over is the problem and not positioning? Sometimes its just the players fault. 
---
Very interesting!
---
I thought the meta for leveling a warrior was to use a big ass beefy two hander as arms and trade one hit for one hit with npc's using hamstring to kite. Am I not up with the times?
---
https://gfycat.com/bitesizedinfantiledingo
---
And the usual 3 Hearthstone expansions.
---
I hope so, this is important in my opinion.
---
If you prefer questing to level, PVE is a better leveling experience. If grinding, PVP. It's very frustrating to get constantly killed while questing, and also very frustrating if someone is taking your mobs you want to kill while grinding. PVE and PVP servers solve each of those problems, respectively.
---
&gt; I only run the vanilla client in a virtualized sandbox.
---
Hey that’s pretty smart. I gotta start doing that.
---
Dagger spec vanilla rogue levelling. Sounds fun..
---
If sit doesn't work for some reason, it's still best to go down the Fury tree until level 20, then respec to Arms, kind of a waste of a respec if you ask me so I'd stick to arms from the start.
---
That's what the all Dwarf guild I was in would do. It was awesome.
---
If they kept ganking we'd initiate the full nuclear option and purge the entire zone. horde town, flight masters, npcs, lowbies ... scorched earth.
---
Nothing cooler than a raid of Dwarves sweeping across the zone. Shit was kinda scary even.
---
&gt; Didn't they keep old versions of their server cores?
---
Actually no. When they released a new patch they would overwrite the old. They was lucky to find a backup inside an old backup that contained Vanilla 1.12.1 but they said they dont have any data from earlier patches. The said that they have the original client and 1.12.1 database for internal testing for Classic.
---
Yup, exactly! This is why I have told people to speak up about these things all over the internet since Blizzcon, if you want something then go tell them, be very vocal about it.. they are literally asking you to give them feedback so the classic experience will be the best one possible for the classic community.
---
But summer is getting closer and closer (2-4 months away from release) which is why we need a large update on these things, have they changed their minds or not? Like.. damn Blizzard, the community is working 24/7 to give you feedback but we need to know how much the official plan changes in order to give you UPDATED feedback.
---
I don't doubt this limitation will stay in place. Players who want to roll both factions on the same server can choose PvE servers.
---
It’s one of my favourite things about old wow!
---
Ha... Ha... Not funny. I am not so lucky haha. But yea keep the jokes comming :D
---
At no point did 1.12 itemization and 1.12 talents exist without DM.
---
Therefore, having 1.12 itemization, 1.12 talents, and DM is closer to a recreation of an actual state of vanilla than having just 1.12 itemization and 1.12 talents.
---
The number of "NO CHANGES!" people who actually want this kind of change is staggering, and the use of "NO CHANGES!" to shut down discussion on changes they don't want is nothing short of pathetic.
---
There is absolutely no path to a release of classic using 1.12 that doesn't lead to early endgame content being easier than it initially was. Change needs to happen, but I think it would be a much more authentic experience for that change to happen by rebalancing the content than by haphazardly withholding random aspects of 1.12 from us.
---
Adding to my list of resources, thank you!
---
Sure, feel free to hop on our disc.
---
Yeah, it's definitely been a bit of an eye opener for me. It's hard, if not impossible to get 40 "casual raiders" to show up without becoming the very thing we set out to avoid becoming, a hardcore progression guild. 
---
If I had given out a link to the new Discord, then maybe that would be true.
---
I have nothing to do with vanillafriends. You can see my borked up entry because from when it was a spreadsheet, and a more recent entry with contact info I did when the site was set up.
---
Quit being so cynical.
---
I met my wife in TBC. We were both druids and bear tanked raids together. Now we're married.
---
Mine as well.
---
*Potentially*, Blizzard could sue players for breach of contract and/or copyright infringement. However, Blizzard has nothing to gain from that except an enormous PR backlash. I don't think any MMO company ever did something like that.
---
It's way easier to go after the people who run the servers, and Blizzard is extremely reluctant to do just that.
---
Please note: I'm not a lawyer. Don't trust what I say.
---
HAH, only noobs will need these 8)
---
Eh, it's a hundred thousand players online at any time usually, but that isn't the total population of subscribers. Hell it's probably not too far off bfa's numbers considering what a dumpster fire that was.
---
Should just ignore this kind of replies, they obviously do not like theorycrafting and therefor just devalue all your effort. Focus on the people that enjoy your content and want more.
---
"I know" rofl k now I know uve never played the game, Arcane shot for leveling, lol enough said
---
With the amount of increased non-consensual world pvp. I can't imagine they want people talking to each other. Even though Ironically being able to speak to the person camping you generally results in being camped less. I remember when I played AoC wich had FFA pvp. If you simply asked someone politely to stop. 90+% of the time they would.
---
Got goose bumps scrolling the list of people on my server/faction.
---
I hope this becomes a thing! I would totally use and pay for this!
---
As a fellow priest, Holy and Discipline absolutely kicked ass in Alterac Valley. I remember just chilling in the background at a choke-point like the Bridge and just healing and shielding everything. Players would come and die but I'd just be there indefinitely helping.
---
And being able to heal the tank at the raid bosses. Man, it was great.
---
Dat booty 
---
This is cool, and sweet. 
---
Yeah I feel like this small poll on this subreddit don’t reflect what we actually see in game. A lot of people on this sub have played private servers and are in tune with what works and doesn’t work in Classic. The general population, which will be what most of the Classic players come from, won’t have this knowledge. 
---
I too, will expect a lot more hunters and rogues specifically. 
---
You're perfectly fine healing as Enhance in dungeons.
---
Just hang onto some caster quest rewards or dungeon drops with +int, +heal, +mp5 type stuff you find along the way.
---
The only place you may find difficult would be the deeper parts of BRD. This is due to warriors are also usually still in arms/fury based specs.  Two non-dedicated specs can get messy.   
---
I usually swap to resto/holy type classes around 55 when I focus mostly on dungeon quests.  Largely because I feel like an asshole rolling against the healer for pre-bis heal gear as a dps class.
---
I don't see why I would do that, especially since execute is used to finish off almost every mob.
---

Dire Maul isn't a problem.
---
I would be open for suggestions, but I only ever heard these:
---
* denial of the problem
---
* dynamic respawns, which are just as unauthentic if not more so and are prone to abuse for farming
---
* server merges
---
Server merges are actually not that bad an idea. Blizzard could secretly pre-determine servers for merging after some time. Names would be unique across those groups so merges would be painless, and it could be used to level out faction ratios. However, no implementation of this could solve the massive effect of literally millions of tourists in the first two weeks.
---
I saw a survey that showed RP-PVP servers having as much interest as regular PVE servers. RP-PVE servers had the lowest interest and regular PVP servers had by far the highest (more than the other three combined). 
---
I’ll be playing RP-PVP. I wouldn’t worry too much about ganking. You’ll make friends, and the added sense of danger is fun. 
---
Is it just an open board without categories? I’m just seeing post after post none of them correlating
---
Seems like you would enjoy a rogue. They have lots of chance on hit stuff going on with poisons and's weapon talent specs. Such as a stun on maces or an extra attack proc on swords. I think there  might even be a decent build of rogue that uses spell power gear and a bunch of chance proc on hit effects to raid.
---
Thank you, was thinking the same thing. We didn't even have optimized leveling guides then like we do now, the % of 60s by 1.3 couldn't have been that high.
---
I didn’t read the reply and thought you were talking about wearing a condom.  
---
I did a similar thing only I am too dumb to understand those terms. My "sand box" was paying 45$ for a crappy old lap top. Still runs 5+ classic wow clients at 45+frames though lol.
---
Adding on:
---
Rogue also has a bunch of "fun unique" abilities such as distract, sap, 
---
 and pick pocket
---
How do elemental shamans do workout BWL / R13 gear?
---
Hunter sounds like your class no?
---
It can be both simple and easy  OR  complicated and hard to master if you want to push the class' limits.   Slap on the engineering skill and you'll be drowning in utility.
---
And from my experience has horrible speeds.
---
I literally quit wow because of sharding. But I’d put up with it for launch if it is never ever to be used again. 
---
I find it amusing how many people have answered this guy without inquiring to where he lives. Where I live in the U.S. (PA) I have never heard of a regular person losing internet service or getting into legal trouble for playing classic wow. I used to do it all the time and I know plenty of others who did the same.
---
Depending on where you live. Music most likely got you tagged far more then wow. The game prolly just got caught up in a general sweep. Also if you torrented it. It's possible you left your torrent open. So you were technically sharing the game. Meaning you didn't just get in trouble to downloading. You got in trouble for distribution. 
---
You're spot on. It delays and transforms the problem but ultimately does nothing to solve it better than sharding.
---
im in the us as well
---
&gt; Blizzard could secretly pre-determine servers for merging after some time. Names would be unique across those groups so merges would be painless, and it could be used to level out faction ratios.
---
#That is just sharding with more steps.
---
Dwarf remodel is best
---
Yea honestly if your plan is to just fuck off and be super casual. Other then mages no one has it as good as rogues. You are pretty much T1 at everything other then grinding HW. Which a rogue doesn't need anyway.
---
From what i remember, those with the skill level required could roll for it after the actual loot drop was rolled for. In a 10 man group you might have 1 or 2 rolling on it and a couple more not caring for the hide. 
---
Haha, that's an understatement :D
---
Credit to Sams, wouldn't have been a site without him :)
---
Enhancement is a meme spec. Don't get me wrong you can pvp and be devastating on one but, that has to do with gear more then class quality. In classic wow if you are willing to put in the work. You can pretty much get away with anything.
---
All that being said. Elemental is no meme spec. It can blast peoples balls off and heal it's friends. The ele/resto hybrid spec. Sacrifices almost nothing in pvp for resto. While fleshing out a mage like mega nuker. It's mucho powerful.
---
Rogues has lots of chance on hit effects.
---
But in terms of fun/unique skills and easy leveling, that goes to Warlocks and Hunters. They have tons of fun abilities they can do with pets and they’re the fastest classes to level. 
---
Am I the only one that loved resilience?
---
The only aspect I ever hated about WoW was that you had to PvE in order to PvP, and resilience completely removed that. It finally felt like players could specialize in either PvP or PvE. 
---
If you wanted to PvE, you could raid and be rewarded with gear that made you better at PvE. If you wanted to PvP, then you were rewarded with gear that made you better at PvP. It made perfect sense to me
---
It is a necessary restriction for PvP servers. It would be too easy to make a cross-faction alt to spy on world locations, or to talk trash to the other faction.
---
Yes people can buy a second account to do this, but there are a lot less people willing to buy a second account just for this than if it were free.
---
If only we had some kind of sick search engine
---
You really think WoW concurrent players are in the millions?
---
Aughagagh, of course!
---
DM being out right before 95% of the eu pop even getting to 60. How could I be so blind.

CANCEL CLASSIC! DM BEING AVAILABLE AS CABONICALLY AS IT WAS IS GOING TO RUIN EVERYTHING

If you plan on going elemental, Tauren&gt;Orc. Not even funny how strong warstomp is on a Shaman. 
---
[Reminds me of this classic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D97gwGlMFE)
---
Hunter... Druid... Priest...
---
Ahhh, which one?!
---
I resonate with the hunter;
---
The priest suits my gameplay preference;
---
And the druid is exactly in between.
---
I’m a massive WoW noob, and hate to press many buttons. I suck at keeping track of things, too.
---
I feel like the hunter would be too difficult, as with the druid. But priests are mana hungry, which also sucks... AH. Please, please. Help this Horde (Rp)PvP noob out!
---
Druids were incredibly well done in vanilla. I feel that what TBC did to Druid was blasphemy to good design. TBC removed hybrid tax which I feel is necessary, and this is coming from primarily a hybrid player. TBCs druid made me question why should I roll a mage when I can make a boomkin that can also tank and heal? Why should I roll a rogue when I can druid instead? Why should I roll a warrior/priest when I can tank/heal and do so much more on druid. I really hated this, I felt a good Druid in vanilla was able to accomplish important roles without being the best. Sure they were primarily a healer in raid but they could also OT. They were great in world pvp and 1v1s and Bg they had a niche that no one else could fill. They truly were the jack of trades master of none. Not this BC and onwards nonsensical jack of all trades master of all.
---
If you've been "raiding for ten years" and haven't gotten the memo that druids bring competitive tank healing, huge consistent raid healing, and the best single-target healing cooldown in the game, then I dunno what to tell you. You're either impossibly dense or just a truly awful player... ^or ^a ^jackoff ^who ^lies ^about ^their ^experience ^in ^video ^games ^to ^validate ^their ^opinions 🤷‍♂️
---
They don't need R13 gear and wouldn't use it. As far as Viability pre BWL. It's pretty weak Elemental shamans may benefit from AQ40 patch more then any other class to be honest.
---
Deathknight
---
Because it doesn't make fuck all a difference and the only people who complain are the people who play private servers religiously.
---
5-6k for me, I want the zones to feel alive. More than that and spawns becomes too contested
---
But I'm not OK with "vanilla" 2.5k as it leads to empty feeling worlds even at cap
---
I'm sure you will have fun raiding MC for months when your blues from DM are better than the Epic loot.
---
Because Anal that's why.
---
It was probably a DMCA notice for torrenting the client, and not related to playing on a private server.
---
Yes.
---
And no need to yell.
---
Hold up China is getting classic TBC?
---
Surprised no has said shaman
---
You’re just mad because Druid’s are the least wanted class in the game unless you’re playing Warsong Gulch. If you want to talk about huge consistent raid healing I’m sure there’s a separate thread for Shamans and Priests. 
---
Start vpn.  Find torrent.  Download torrent.  delete the torrent when it’s done.  Not the files that it downloaded tho.  Then exit your torrent client and disable your vpn.
---
Yep by 1.12.1 enhancement took major nerfs. The biggest nerfs being to WF. As of this patch it has a 3.0 internal CD. This means you can not proc WF off WF by this patch and even worse. If you have a 1 hander the slowest you are going to find is 2.8 seconds. This means you can't even proc back to back WF when you switch to axe and board. Enhance is kinda dog shit lol.
---
Elemental is way more fun and trust me you will be meleeing people to death in that spec too.
---
A guild called the scarlet crusade perhaps?
---
World chat was largely responsible for giving my private server an even better sense of community than my retail server ever did. I wouldn't know half the people on my faction if it weren't from bullshitting around with them in world chat
---
Honestly, I think it's pretty bliz like to have it around for European and Korean players as European's got it pretty quick after our launch and Korea had it at theirs.
---
I feel its a negative if the US can impose themselves on everyone.
---
Plus... good luck killing a class that can run away from any undesirable situation.
---
So basically shaman isn’t the best class to go if you want to do well in PVP unless you’re a hardcore raider?
---
I can't wait to see the private server crowd try to do MC without Decursive XD
---
A lot of people complaining probably won't even be high enough level to do the dungeon by the time it comes out. I'm sure most of them have no experience with the original DM and think that it is a level 38 dungeon when in fact it is a level 56 dungeon (the level was reduced during cataclysm).
---
No pop cap
---
I agree entirely with rebalancing content. I'd prefer it over changing the release schedules, but the likelihood of them rebalancing raids is beyond low.  
---
2.5k is too low. I played retail Vanilla and BC on a medium pop server and it was pretty dead. Hope they do 4k.
---
Careful now, the #nochanges crowd will lynch you around here for saying that 
---
So what's your response to 1.12 talents and 1.12 itemization then going into Molten Core for the first time?  
---
NO ONE HEAR HIM OUT!!! BURN HIM LIKE A WITCH!!! I GOT THE TAR AND FEATHERS RIGHT HERE!!!! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!!!!

Honestly, I would like to see a maximum pop for each faction (as in logged in pop) at any one time. Give a better balance when the server is maxed out etc.
---
You really thought it was a good idea to take pictures of your monitor instead of just taking screen caps? Can’t even see anything. Plus this is a repost
---
Gamma second this.
---
More times than not its the individual fucking up for being bad at the game in a key role.
---
If they can't step up. Replace that persons role if possible.
---
Yes, it's like a subreddit 
---
Ha!
---
It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. Most of the MMO friends I've made over the years (especially those who I met around the time of Vanilla WoW as teens) have stopped playing MMOs completely because life got too busy (work/family/etc.) Retail WoW is far too much of a time investment for them, and Classic WoW is 10x the time investment of Retail. I can see a lot of old school players coming back strictly for a few weeks, just to 're-live' a few moments of their childhood, but I doubt Classic will draw in many gamers that are currently teens, or many older gamers who were around when Vanilla WoW was a thing, but didn't play it.
---
I suspect the first week will have a large number of players, and everybody will blather on about what a smashing success it it and how retail should die, then by 6 months in it'll be down to 100-200k and that will be that.
---
Did you just simultaneously mock OP for not taking screenshots properly and not posting the content in the first place? That's a doublethink right there...
---
Also, get your eyes checked. 
---
Well, at least that's not as toxic as retail. 
---
Exactly, sometimes you should change things up but there doesn't need to be a long discussion after every wipe. People need repetition to get comfortable during progression. I know as a dps, I always approached a new fight trying to learn all the important mechanics first and then figuring out different ways to min/max dps from there. My dps was usually a lot higher on the 10th pull than the 3rd or 4th. Changing a strategy early because "our dps is too low" is a mistake. That's all I'm saying. 
---
Female orcs have amazing animations and look really good in all gear
---
Yes - no need for categorisation/sub categories as we're not very big yet :)
---
It was SotC or SoC on Nost that was using too high of a coefficient or doubling up on applying both AD and SP iirc. 
---
If its giving you +1 rage every 3s that's +5 in a 15s fight, it also lets you retain your rage pool for longer giving you more time after killing a mob to kill the next two even faster with SS and high rage
---
Execute is rarely used to finish off a mob, with obvious exceptions like you're too low on hp to kill another one or you have to travel far to find the next mob
---
Honestly I think itemization might come with tier .5. That's how it was back in vanilla patch 1.11 I believe it was? That added tier 0.5, that was the same patch that itemization changed. So there's a solid chance we might have dire Maul but the old version of the items. Which aren't as powerful post itemization.
---
Tier .5 is stage 3 I think? 
---
Levelling - British English   
---
Leveling - American English  
---
Sorry I'm the stuck-up kind :P
---
Personally I just need temporary to get me through until Star Citizen/squadron 42 releases 😁
---
1.12 talents with pre 1.11 itemization while still easier wouldn't be as bad as both talents and itemization in terms of how easy content would be made. 
---
I'll be losing the robes to a Mage a dozen times before I get them. Hehe
---
BRD.  Running it 10 times per night with 2-3 man groups at lvl 60 for fire resist gear for Onyxia/MC/BWL
---
Feel free to open up your own enter database website then. ;)
---
I am a casual and I may just roll a cat and try to be a cat at 60. Just wish I could hold daggers like a rogue but that is ok because I will be a cat.
---
There is 0 chance that is accurate. The server cap was decided by what they felt the servers could comfortably hold at a consistent performance rate. Implying they were clarevoiant and could see exactly how every spawn, every dungeon group, every leveling area would work out in 2004 right when the game launched is insane to even try to claim.
---
Nobody from very oldschool Kel'thuzad yet so I started it off. Horde Gone Wild on Horde side Kel'thuzad! 
---
I'd really like to see Arms, I'll admit I'm cheap and don't want to respec out of PvP if I don't have to.
---
Lets roll that back a bit. "So basically shaman isn’t the best class to go if you want to do well in PVP unless you’re a hardcore raider?" 
---
Assuming you mean *Elemental Shaman. The answer is simply no. They are not very good at pvp if you are not willing to put out the effort to raid. The class works by getting high level mail and shield with lot's of crit. You need it all to be mail to survive and you absolutely need the crit to kill.
---
When you first hit 60 if you are trying to force being ele. You will have to sacrifice either the mail to let you live or the crit that lets you kill. You get squashed by that sophies choice. Also as a elemental you are very dominate with your ability to heal as well as attack but, for attacking you rely almost soley on raw power to overwhelm foes. Where as a mage can use finesse.
---
This means while a mage can pvp with the clothes on his back and still win. For a deadly Ele shaman trinkets like TOEP and Hero charm are an absolute must. They boost the shit out of your spell power allowing for those hand of god lightning strikes you need to win. 
---
Playing an Ele Shaman is almost like "revenge of the nerds" You are stuck being a healer and a support for a while that gets kicked around. It's your version of high school. That being said after college when you are an educated cow. The world is your oyster and the thunder rains down on your enemies. It's honestly a really fun an sudden reversal of fortune lol.
---
I’d really identify what you want to do outside raiding and if you want to make an alt regardless. Also, if you go healer, you can also go s gathering profession for farming
---
Hey this looks great, I've added it in as 'Sub's ideal pre-raid entry guide'.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor... 
---
Tried looking up my old friends on there but couldnt find any :( 
---
Hell I was average among my friends in terms of hitting 60. Took me 5 months IRL. A few were faster, a few were slower, but most took about 4-5
---
I have a hard time understanding why anyone is opposed to something they don’t have to be involved with. It’s as though its existence offends them.
---
Appreciate the info. Played a hunter in Vanilla and switched to Shaman in BC and on.
---
Looks like I’ll be rethinking my class then. I do plan on raiding but given my schedule getting to AQ40 (and having to wait for it to even come out) will be unlikely.
---
I know there are many other threads, but would you recommend a few classes that won’t require you to have the best raid gear that are good at PvP and pve? I’ve almost always played support roles, but down for anything.
---
Thanks very much for the good wishes. Lok'tar!
---
Is a two hander actually optimal if your running a spell power build?  I wonder if a thunderfury with righteousness would output more dps with all of those soc judgements. 
---
1.  Not my screenshots
---
2.  It's a crosspost from another subreddit
---
3.  If this is a repost then how could I have taken the pictures myself at the same time, wow
---
You don't happen to remember a Human Warrior named Vonkilington, do you? I was in Kolat at one point.
---
Other characters were Epicsfury (Draenei Shaman made in BC), Flaminglord (Gnome Mage), and Vonkilingtoe (19 Rogue Twink, can't remember exact name).
---
Wow, bring back those stacked female trolls!
---
Hunter - melee only and no pet summoned. Hours of laughter, 
---
My goal on my server is going to be to be the first guy to make it to the barrens. I want to be the first one to walk on that sacred soil to crack a Chuckie Norrs joke. It would be so amazing if blizzard put an easter egg in the game that made the barrens quack for like 3 seconds upon the first mention of the name in general. 
---
baby druid on the way
---
You’ll have no issue getting Ret gear. Paladin tier pieces are good pvp gear and warriors don’t use most two handers. If your guild is loot council and knows you’re a pvp pala and like Ret they should give you a two hander np 
---
At the end of the day, having itemization in there is literally only for a small portion of the community that will appear.
---
At the end of the day for quality of life and ease of use for the new members of the community. We should avoid major changes as that is more than likely to cause issue's for those new players that will be learning the game.
