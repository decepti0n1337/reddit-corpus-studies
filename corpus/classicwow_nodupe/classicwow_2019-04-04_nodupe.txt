---
definitely not low key.
---
Orc males are the ugliest rogues. Change my mind
---
Given the Hunter dead zone, I'd be inclined to go Tauren for the war stomp. Gives you another tool to buy a second to get some space. Plus the Tauren asthetic seems more Hunter-esque to me. 
---

---
Neither is a bad choice. You should be happy either way. 
---
That's too ridiculous not to believe.
---
We've waited yeeeears! We can wait a few more months. Hold strong!
---
Haha. I guess if I were you Id suck it up and play Alliance. Be glad your wife is into WoW. I imagine you will have a blast playing together.
---
 Hell I cant even get my wife to touch PC gaming. Shes a console pleb. Lol good luck man.
---
Orcs also have the command racial, which increases pet dps by 5% and axe specialization as well. Just a couple of things to consider for rolling a hunter. 
---
I believe you have your cause and effect reversed, sir. Trolls are the Glorious Progenitor Master Race. Elves are the cheap, hippie knock-offs who hang out in a big tree all day and refuse to cut their hair.
---
I truly don't understand why people make these posts. 
---
Well, *were* I guess. These days people know how strong they are.
---
Can someone cryptofreeze me until classic comes out
---
Talk about virtue signalling... its nothing to do with ethics and I think its you that needs to grow up and see the bigger picture.
---
 If we start picking and choosing things to add to classic that weren't a part of the game back then where do we draw the line? BC brought with it so much change to the UI, Unit plates and cast bars, should we add that in too? 
---
Clearly you have no comprehension of what this can lead to, NO CHANGES means that we have to take the bad with the good. Classic is a time capsule, not a patchwork of all the things you would like to see in WoW. 
---
Stop with that"gUrlZ dOnT gaMe!" crap. It's old, it's tired, and it's provably untrue. And please don't bring that shit into classic wow with you either and mess up chat with that sexist bullshit.
---
Kind of like when you're downloading a game and it says "Ready to play" and then you get on and it honestly only lets you open the main menu.  
---
I'd be okay with just opening that main menu right now.  
---
PvP and PvE are just the ruleset that the server follows for PvP combat. It doesn't stop you from doing raids or anything. 
---
You tried
---
What are you talking about? Sylvanas never was war chief and if she was, she would do everything to protect the Horde.
---
Maybe you are having a fever vision from a future that will never be. A fever would also explain how you could belief that the alliance is "peaceful" for even a second.
---
Gank that thot[tbot].
---
Switching to shockadin is not a bad idea, it's the most versatile too. Vengeance rarely procs in leveling gear and can be wasted on last hits, and the other ret talents further down are decent at best. I will be an enchanter as well, so I can get the run speed enchant on my own (from trainer thank god). The strong leveling talents in ret are all early in the tree which offers great flexibility for the more unorthodox routes.
---
it's hard to RP as someone with a brain defect, who would have thought? 
---
\[X\] Hide cloak
---
Hold up a second. We all know Horde is the superior faction, clearly. With that established, dabbling in playing Alliance is acceptable - it's better to know thy enemy, no? See it as an experiment, or a strange sort of holiday from where the heart really is.
---
Paladins are very capable tanks though..
---
Can you all please try and answer Op's question without bringing sexist nonsense into this conversation? Let me tell you something, women have been gaming since the days of f****** Donkey Kong. Women played arcade games, MUDs, Atari, Nintendo, the early RPGs like Ultima Online, EverQuest, etc etc. Women have always been gamers. 
---
You know why you don't know how many women are in game? Because a lot of women hide their identity. They roll male characters or they use male gamertags because the environment is often pretty toxic for them. Keep that in mind next time you don't say anything when a troll is spewing sexist garbage all over world chat. You want more women to play? Make the environment more hospitable for them.
---
(e) I'll play Alliance with your wife and dumpster you every time you try to gank either of us. Lemme get her phone number bruh.  
---
fair enough
---
If you don‚Äôt play with your wife, somebody else will üòâ
---
And who are you to ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù expectations? You‚Äôre insignificant, and borderline retarded for caring if there‚Äôs people who only play for two weeks. What are you thinking of?  
---
Needs more dots.
---
Neat though. 
---
How much does the spirit increase as a human come into play as a shadow priest? I can‚Äôt decide between a human and a night elf SP.
---
This would be a side character, I‚Äôm not interested in playing a dwarf SP.
---
I think they go hand in hand.  once people stopped communicating you had to build your dungeons with that in mind.  All dungeon design from LFG on had to take into account some large percentage of people would be doing this dungeon with 4 other randoms and no one would say a word the whole time AND the barrier of entry for tanks and healers was low enough you could expect wipes to cause them to drop group.
---
So when groups won't talk and wipes break up groups (more so than before) you're going to have to design easier dungeons.
---
Fire has ignite as a moderately big portion of dps and the tree only gives 6% bonus crit to your fireball 10% to your blast with longer spell casts / less survivability / fireball takes a lot more mana; frost gives you 100% bonus crit damage, 50% crit chance of all spells on frozen units AND tons of kite-ability / aoe farming
---
Honestly it isn‚Äôt even close, frost simply out performs fire as you level; later in the game you can make fire work because of ignite and other talents because of crit chance... the post above you is right
---
I feel like this was a waste of a unpopular person trying harding to become popular.
---
As a Paladin, they were CERTAINLY the optimal way.  
---
A hero has to struggle, or it is not a hero. 
---
If the game is hard, get better or die trying. Once you get better you've earned all the rewards that come with your new skill level. If you fail, you get a life lesson on your limitations.
---
Bell dwarf priest -- was there for first rag kill, came back for aq40, and nax
---
It gave me Tauren Shaman twice in a row.
---
Feels like it‚Äôs trying to tell me something lol 
---
I will say that in cyclone battlegroup(?) and on perenolde server.  The rogues who were orc were always the most skilled.
---
I played vanilla. A rogue. Never had issues with threat. We had good tanks 4 of em with Thunderfury, made it easy ok but there were several classes with threat lowering skills. Priest Hunter Warlock Rogue Mage. If u had threat and died it cost you dkp for being dumb.
---
exactly..
---
In an organised premade, you wouldn‚Äôt really ever be in catform bursting anyone down.
---
It‚Äôs running flags in WSG - so think prowling into base, hots rolling in bear form, travel form etc. 
---
Your job is to avoid the battle &amp; be slippery.
---
AB you‚Äôre on flag defence.. hold a base, preventing a cap, while you wait for the cavalry to arrive.
---
This is all with a resto/feral spec for max survivability.
---
If you roll a druid expecting to be a killing machine, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed at 60.
---
With that said, a well balance played druid is a 1v1 god. https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Ease wasn't the issue with LFR. It was the lack of substance. MC is easy but the substance is still there. 
---
A good story about brothers? "Joseph and the Coat of Dreams" . it's in the bible, read it. Deuteronemony 4:20

"CAN'T DO THAT WHILE STUNNED"

Play a human priest or paly and just not heal the gnomes.

I picked this link up a while back.  It's pretty much the definitive work on the vanilla hunter.
---
A) I lol'd.
---
B) Girls do play. Some of them even do so in the correct faction. The fact most of them seem to prefer being wrong all the time is their problem, not mine.
---
Elves are for eating.
---
Gnomes are for punting.
---
The only good pointy ears is one with tusks.
---
Lok'tar ogar, brother! *For the Horde!*
---
option E: make a secret character who keeps killing her.
---
Search by controversial and you'll find the real unpopular opinions. 
---
I've been grappling with this question more and more.  Originally, I pretty quickly decided on mage.  However, I've convinced my gf to play and now I'll pretty much base it off what she chooses.  If she wants to be a night elf anything, then I'll probably go druid.  Otherwise, ideally human mage.
---
This describes the situation well.
---
Fuck that guy, not my blizzard
---
It‚Äôs not unique, but I loved raiding the Crossroads. I never had a character beyond like level 34 but it was still high enough to kill hordies with my friends and guild. Also doing those awful Alliance warlock quests with my friends who helped me get through them and just going to random places like the Tanaris racetrack. 
---
So ive been alliance since 2004 minus a few breaks that ive taken. Getting excited about classic coming back i was just thinking if i roll horde for this then not only will I be going back to a great game and time but the new experience of playin horde will almost be like playing a whole new game in a sense. Im still debating of course as ill have to learn layouts of different areas/ cities but I think I am going to give this a try. So maybe give the alliance a shot and you get a partner to play with all the time.
---
Or just gank her all the time for fun :)
---
Not "had my number" but "had many incredibly intense fights that went back and forth", he was also a server abusing lil bitch boy but that's not important.
---
I played on a TBC server right after nostal died, it was called lookingforgroup or something (hellfire?).
---
I was a gnome warrior named cyrilfiggis and me and this female orc elemental shaman (name starting with a k maybe? haha) were mortal enemies
---
Man we had a ton of good fights and we were always hunting for each other until the server kind of died off.
---
There's a series of the gamegrumps trying wow. Do the exact opposite of that and try to see the female POV (a woman later comes onto the show and shows them how to have a good time).  Levelling up is part of the fun when learning the ropes for the first time.
---
Might be the best thing about the Horde. 
---
Very little until it makes a little difference about naxx level. 
---
Diplomacy is the best reason to go human. 
---
Damn it man you said it. 
---
I have the same stupid problem. A buddy of mine (he played vanilla as well) and I are trying to pick what we‚Äôll play at 60 based on its arena viability at 70. 
---
So stupid lol. 
---
Looks like we‚Äôre going rogue / priest
---
Thanks!
---
MC has stuff that's BiS forever. BWL too. Even ZG and AQ20, which are mostly catch-up raids, have a handful of pieces that are truly great for a lot of specs and hard to replace.
---
TLDR: People can run every single raid for a long, long time before they get fully geared up.
---
well paladin is grossly OP as a twink so don't feel *too* bad.
---
Impedes*

(I gave you silver to make the correction less dickish... or maybe it‚Äôs more now. Guess we‚Äôll find out.)

Invite him for a feast and make sure there‚Äôs an ‚Äùaccident‚Äù in the lift. üòà
---
Warlocks have been polling higher than mages lately. I think they're going to be big in classic. 
---
The best were the extremely late night pugs for MC lead by 6-10 people from the top guilds that were midway through Naxx or better. 
---
Such a great way to try and play catch up and get into a BWL guild. 
---
I sort of have the opposite issue in that playing Horde feels kinda wrong to me, however I think Dwarves are probably the most "metal" of the alliance races, if it comes down to picking a race.
---
Can confirm. Source: Played a night elf, was Literally The Worst.
---
Fortunately, I got better. Now it's Mulgore for the Horde all the way.
---
Horde or die! Just gano her over and over again and she will eventually switch. Or she get fanned over and over again while you are not.....or play both
---
minor correction, but epic flying was 5k. Nothing cost over 10k until the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth 3 person mount with vendor was released.
---
Ty!
---
Not that it was a major point of that, but for the record I have ADD (no hyperactivity though) and still enjoyed Classic. 
---
And the dumbest post award goes to...
---
May I take your fedora, kind sir?
---
In LFR i would often afk, not dps/heal, maybe if we were half wiped on the last boss i‚Äôd help the hard carries finish. LFR not only ruined raiding, it made me a worse person.
---
I don't know if you played classic, but there are so many "dailys" for endgame it's insane. They aren't listed as a certain objective but collecting for raids, getting gold, getting drops for attunements, etc. are as intense as dailies now. 
---
It was the go-to for most of the group‚Äôs I played with here in the US between 2006-2011. Then it started branching out to Mumble, TeamSpeak in a few cases, even Dolby Axon for the short period of that that it existed.
---
As a horde player, I found a Dwarf to be satisfactory the expansion my friends wanted to play Alliance.
---
* You won't believe this one weird trick about finding groups.
---
* Think you're good enough to tank for us? 90% of people are denied.
---
* Fastest dungeon clear! Scientists don't want to let you know our method.
---
People say we're better gamers in this day and age, but one thing I know for sure we're much better at generating click-baity titles. I don't think getting groups together will be a problem.
---
I was a mage primarily.  Tons of DPS with decent utility and versatility.  I had no problems finding my way in dungeons, raids, and PvP alike.  Everyone likes a mage in the party for buffing the healers with more int and handing out top quality food and water for free.  Also, portals were a nice luxury in the vanilla era.
---
For me it was mainly Ragnar√∂k Online as that game's skills were *all* in English, but Wow definetly helped, too. 
---
Being on the internet playing videogames and reading/watching videos in English made me learn the language very easily. Never lifted a finger in school to learn for it and still got a 1- on my finals (A- basically. Abitur in Germany).
---
I'm very thankful for this and I keep telling people that if they wanna learn a language, they gotta immerse themselves within it; surround yourself with the language. Spend a lot of time infront of your PC? Change its language and browse websites in that tongue. Watch movies or shows on Netflix? Watch 'em with subtitles if you're not too familiar, and try watching it again without them. 
---
This concept was only taught to me in Uni when it can help you a ton when you're younger.
---
There's no simple raid logging in vanilla. You need a lot farming to prepare for raids
---
i can't play horde myself because the general aesthetic of the horde is simply terrible.
---
my greatest reason to not play alliance tbh. I can't stand gnomes...
---
A retribution paladin is exactly this in vanilla.. retribution... if you get smacked in pvp, you get to smack more.. 
---
That is because of talents like reckoning and eye for an eye.. look them up.. the best ret pvp spec goes pretty deep in prot to get reckoning.
---
Seal of command or seal of casino works better with ultra slow 2 handers because of its proc per minute rate.
---
All in all ret paladin is a completely different class than wotlk.
---
Source: played ret from vanilla and up to wotlk. Planning to main ret again at classic :)
---
WoW vanilla is too good to be explained in emojis.  The illiterate will have to suffer the misery of knowing we're enjoying an incredible game, while having no comprehension of it's greatness.
---
If you want a not hard time finding groups being a dedicated warrior tank is the #1 way.
---
The warrior/tank IS the group the other 4 members are just tag-alongs you find in minutes.
---
Just subscription 
---
Easy mode has never ruined a single player* game
---
Who doesn't want to *bombard* their gf...in bed? :V
---
You get what you put in. If everyone can stumble through content without effort, the reward for doing so has no value. Instead one is just reminded of the time they wasted doing something so easy.
---
Please don‚Äôt.  That reflects badly on you, friend.  
---

---
dwarves are just tall gnomes
---
Could get in the Org AH with it too.
---
Has she seen the female models of the horde chars? Also if you like vajayjay go ally with her 
---
The biggest thing I think is to let her play the game how she wants to play it. 
---
Once you get her to try it just let her go off and have fun. Don't push her to follow quests or immediately bring her to your favorite city.
---
My gf already played video games before we met, but she never played wow. When I started playing with her I made these mistakes and she didn't like the game at all. 
---
It took her going back and playing by herself to learn to love the game for her own reasons.
---
It made getting a group together so easy (to the point of being trivial) that it negated the need to communicate, and thus destroyed a fundamental pillar of the MMO experience.
---
Thank god
---
they do a pally buff thats already better than 75% of classes.
---
Get her to play a cutie pie Night Elf, women love night elves.
---
&gt; You know why you don't know how many women are in game? Because a lot of women hide their identity. They roll male characters or they use male gamertags because the environment is often pretty toxic for them.
---
Literally me. I rolled a female UD mage in 2004 and had to reroll before I hit level 20 because of toxic and/or thirsty dudes being shitbags. Now all my characters are male and my mic is broken.
---
Spoiler alert, my mic isn't actually broken. 
---
WoW was never hard, even in vanilla. It may have been tedious, but it wasn't difficult. Now Final Fantasy 11, on the other hand, was hard. So was Dark Age of Camelot.
---
Actually Warlocks don't have any way to decrease threat, but anyways so you agree that the far and away best dos class in vanilla warrior (that you will probably have atleast 8 of in a raid) has no way of lowering their threat other than to stop doing damage?  While those players are doing no damage because their threat capped does the boss agree to take a timeout so your healers aren't wasting mana? 
---
A tank with Thunderfury does produce a lot of threat, but they still can't compete with dps warriors in terms of threat unless they also sacrifice mitigation for increased threat.
---
Definitely won't regret it. They're popular because they're fun and they're good. Just don't be a huntard.
---
I agree play what you want. I personally probably over value soul stones and summons because I find them to be convientant utility for a lot of things that aren‚Äôt raiding. 
---
Botmbishboi sounds about right. 
---
Agreed. And they were all in the same spot.
---
Then there was that one that sent you to the Razor mountains and I'd be like lol fuck no.
---
&gt; Imagine thinking orc racial isn't the most disgustingly broken counter to rogues in 2019.
---
My first toon was a Warlock about 4 months after release. Was hunted mercilessly in STV by an Orc Hunter about 10 levels higher - to the point I would literally only move around in bushes and dart from hub to hub behind hills. Real jungle type shit.
---
Kind of just randomly chose a Soul Link build at 60 since I didn‚Äôt know any better for raid DPS and there were literally zero other Warlocks in the guild to chat about specs with. Went out of my way to murder that Hunter whenever I saw him. Every. Single. Time. I wasn‚Äôt particularly good, just no one knew what locks did or how to deal with a 50% damage reduction and a pair of Sacs.
---
Then one day that guy decided to run in circles around IF screaming ‚Äúu no kik dogg!‚Äù in broken Orc English about every 12 hours. Was just too damn funny. Left him alone after that.
---
&gt;I mean, it will be fun but it will also be frustrating, grindy and sometimes tedious.
---
You just said "fun" four times.
---
What's not to love?
---
You took that way to heart 
---
This is the Chad answer right here. 
---
I feel your shame. Last night I was watching a YouTube video on choosing Alliance or Horde based on game lore, aesthetics, and intangible feelies. My aged mother sat down to watch and I demanded that she choose a side. She choose Alliance because of there connection with "order". I was very disappointed with her. Fortunately for her, she is still strong in battle and doesn't require that I chew her meat, so I allow her to stay in my hut. 
---
If you go 30/0/21 you have all the shaman utility and tricks, high on demand burst, and good armor and heals for survivability.
---
CL-&gt;NS-&gt;LB-&gt;shock can be enough to one shot someone in low gear, or just chunk someone since it all hits within about a couple seconds.  Or, you can instantly save someone with a NS heal.
---
I think that was in TBC; I think the stones in Vanilla were placeholders for a feature they hadn't added yet. 
---
Reflects to who? The alliance and people I'm killing?
---
Ffxiv in the meantime
---
I‚Äôd have been fine with the slow and thought provoking Dunedin‚Äôs.  However, everyone was conditioned to want it to be like all other heroics they had done from Wrath.
---
I remember a bunch of salt and rudeness going on.  At that point, I made Cata my PvP expansion and never touched PvE content.  Barely even considered dailies.
---
Waste an inventory slot to save yourself 80 seconds twice a week.
---
:thinking:
---
This guy raids 
---
Shaman do pretty well against Rogues. Mail + shield is more armor than a 2H Warrior. They can cleanse your slow (or outright resist it with the nature resistance totem) then kite you. DoTs to break your stealth. Searing Totem to keep you in combat. And if they have their big cooldown, they're either going to take off half of your health with a guaranteed crit or instantly heal to full. 
---
You shouldn't beat a Shaman in a fair fight. But that's why you have stealth.
---
Gank her ass
---
You should be going for 5/5 Wand spec before going into shadow tree. Wands are insanely efficient for leveling. Doesn't answer your question, but just my advice :)
---
So you want the real vanilla experience then haha
---
That and the fact that you can do lfr, not do anything, get a drop, get a titan forge, and have a better drop than people raiding on heroic.  The reward for doing difficult late game content is so much less than it used to be. I remember the good old days before damage dampening when getting geared let you two shot undergeared level cap toons. That was literally my favorite part of the game and it's not around anymore because they're tryin to turn an RPG into an esport. 
---
Vanilla had queueing, just it was so bad no one used it. TBC added the ability for them to summon (with 2 people helping).
---
My wife said the same thing that the horde are hideous creatures. I've convinced her that we'll be horde because tauren druids can shapeshift into cats.
---
you're hired
---
You'll get to experience a whole new set of quests. It'll be like a new game. 
---
That's both a blessing and a curse. Having a hobby entirely for yourself is pretty nice. My gf played and raided with me. All I wished for is that she'd become bored and quit so I could have some time with the dudes. 
---
Would love a 2-D World of Warcraft game 
---
It‚Äôd be like Golden Axe but better LoL 
---
I want to gank your wife so bad. I‚Äôd gank her all night long. 
---
So it's treason, then...

Ah; okay. That makes sense. I'll admit I didn't do many dungeons when I started playing back in 2006. It was my first MMO and I had no idea what the fuck I was doing.

Night elf is also great for shadowmeld. A great little trick with shadowmeld and stealth in general is to hide in bushes. Alot of times even if people detect you they still really can see you all that well. I've survived in Ashenvale against 60's hunting me down due to this

Make her play undead female and buy her a shit ton of deviate savory and an orb of deception

Can you give an example of this apparently common bigot cicrcle jerk on this sub?

D is the one true answer

there is much fun ahead of us my friend =)

Yea, unfortunately gear feels like a matter of course right now. It‚Äôs such a stark contrast to WoW‚Äôs initial release with gear feeling so special. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the name of a single piece of gear I‚Äôm wearing on my Mage right now ‚Äî it‚Äôs all just random purples with varying ilvl.

Very cool, but fix the hind-leg ankle's connection to the claws. they stick out since it's such a major piece of the animation.

OP I'm not sure if you have a particular example here, but this subreddit has been mostly extremely positive.  The official forums are of course another story, and they have always been that way.

Play horde and buy or farm loads of deviate fish, turn yourself into a human pirate or ninja, gank the wife while having alliance look. Win-win

As you can see , there will be more warlocks than mages on horde this time around because everyone thinks they'll be getting free epics and raid spots + free mount, so now warlocks will have trouble finding spots :p

I have played both Horde and Alliance about equally and no I don't know what you are talking about.

Hi Bicepman 
---
I‚Äôve spent dumb amounts of money of video games in the past. Most recently my purchase of the knife for wraith in Apex.
---
I think you‚Äôre going to sell a ton of runs. There‚Äôs a bunch of people on Reddit that just can‚Äôt fathom spending triple digits on a video game. Fuck those people. 
---
Now to me if it was say $350 USD I would jump at it. This makes me think that‚Äôs too low. A full clear of any MC gear I want is valuable. 
---
$800 - $1000 prices me right out of it. Which maybe means I‚Äôm not your target audience. That‚Äôs a ton of money to spend on wow imo. 
---
I think your best bet is around the $500-$600 range. Like I said though maybe there‚Äôs true whales out there that would spend more.
---
I‚Äôd love to hear where you land on the price. I‚Äôm very interested. 
---
IMO Pursuit of Justice more than makes up for any lower DPS
---
Nah its that its pants on head retarded easy too. 
---
I am planning on playing a warrior in classic and hopefully tanking at max level. I am not a min/max person and I am not going for any server firsts. I am torn between an orc or a tauren. And I am not sure what professions I should snag while I level. Any help is much appreciated. 
---
Another piece of excellent games journalism 
---
What I've seen so far is that there are a lot of people who write here, played on private servers before and were also active on reddit. My suggestion is search for the ps reddit and see it for yourself. It's a mess filled with lots of insults, flames and trolls. And some of them will come with wild arguments without any prove. I don't think that the community will be like that, at least not all of it.

Why are you doing dailies if you don‚Äôt like them? This is a video and you should have fun playing it. If you hate dailies... don‚Äôt do them?
---
C
---
Whelps even side! Handle it!!
---
Forced is the right word. Dailies are basically Blizzard raping you tbh.
---
Certainly the content over the mechanics for me.  I'm sure I can speak for many folks when I say we all know there was a lot of jank and issues with vanilla mechanics.  Yet the feeling of hearing a dungeon boss refer to us as certain animals that may rest on your lap is hard to beat.
---
That's strictly adhering to your question though.  I still think folks are mostly looking forward to the community aspects.  
---
My wife joined in TBC, she currently says she won't join me in classic because the grind is too slow.   How do i get her to fall in love with the grind, fall in love with the vanilla slow-ride experience?  
---
Hell, blizzard could knock me out, kidnap me, dump me next to a river with that hastily scribbled date in my pocket, and I wouldn't even be /that/ mad.  
---
Thanks for the kind words!
---
Mm... that's why some people are hoping they go with the "Oldschool Runsescape" approach and, after they are done with Naxx, they will add on content to Vanilla WoW. Keep the mechanical basics and just give us additional things like Kharazhan instead of moving us on to Burning Crusade. 
---
If WoW was never difficult then why did so many struggle to kill Kael or Vashj in TBC even after all of the fixes and nerfs? There's more examples of this (anything mythic or when Heroic was mythic) but you get the idea.
---
I think there certainly is genuinely difficult content in the game. 
---
After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.
---
I did. My poor shame. I have fixed my mistake.

Make an alliance character to play with her and switch back to Horde main.

---
apologize to my friends that i wont be at D&amp;D for the next few weeks, lock all the doors in the house, turn off my phone, and begin power leveling while coordinating with my group so we can get a guild going ASAP.
---
First order of Horde Pride, you never spell Sylvanas' name wrong.
---
Stress tests test the hardware, yes, but even if they use the same hardware, in the same physical environment, and everything else is exactly the same, they can't guarantee it will have the same execution metrics because the software is different.
---
Also, there is going to be a beta. From everyone's comments, I can't tell if they are confusing a beta with an open beta or not, but a beta version is normal for any software development project, even if some technology is recycled.
---
She is playing Nelf because she doesn't want to look ugly. Female Trolls with the good face (the 6th one, i believe) are very pretty. And Female Taurens are cute.
---
If she still is going to play Alliance, i would say option C.

If mechanical gameplay is core to the experience of the game, then I would argue that an easy mode can ruin the experience. 
---
Take something like Mega Man or Tony Hawk Pro Skater, now give them an easy mode. Do you think that easy mode provides an equal experience to the regular game? I would say it doesn't.
---
Challenge, struggle, and overcoming obstacles is one of the most fundamental aspects of game design. Easy modes lessen the various emotions a certain degree of difficulty can inflict, and imo lessen the overall experience. 
---
Hey guys. I've mained healers in pvp and dps in pve since I can remember, but mostly a pvper. So my question is, what is the best pvp healer? And is that healer's dps spec viable? If not, which class would you consider to be about as equal balance as healing pvp and dps pve? 
---
The janky old mechanics allowed for more creativity. Perplexity vs Monkeynews just got released on YouTube and it is an excellent showcase of just how much you can do with vanilla mechanics.
---
That being said, PvE rotations are very fun on live. At least Legion Enhancement was.
---
It's simple: if anyone says something you don't like then ignore them. If anyone is harassing someone and being really mean for no reason, sure they can get some kind of restriction. But to actively moderate a trade chat or such is just insane. I hate this new online culture where you can't swear or say something without packing it with bubblewrap. (Also bigotry? Really‚Ä¶?)
---
&gt; I dunno, man... if you've been horde since 2004, isn't it about time you experience the other side of the game? 
---
*Warchief Thrall wants to know your location*
---
Just because you couldn't do it doesn't mean it couldn't be done.
---
Flip a coin. Equality. #2019
---
ah yes, the ol' tremor totem to cancel out the rogue's fear ability. A timeless classic.
---
I think that certain aspects of the Alliance leveling process feel more refined, but Horde leveling is just plain easier.  Quests are more centralized, flightpaths are more convenient, the Barrens, leveling instances are far easier to access in general, quest rewards are nicer in general at least for weapon reliant classes which is who really needs gear (look at the rewards for WC, BFD, and SM for example), the Barrens, no need for a lvl 10 deathrun across wetlands to access good quests, total domination of STV geographically, and also, the Barrens.
---
On the other hand, Alliance have the amazing quest chains for Fordrings and Windsor (this whole chain is one of my favorite things in WOW), lots of awesome lore quest chains across Westfall and Duskwood, Sprite Darter Hatchlings, Thunderbrews Flask quest chain, the cool but unfinished Missing Diplomat, so definitely they get the good stuff for flavor and immersion, but as far as min-maxing, horde own leveling.
---

Hang on, nobody said it couldn't be done (also I did kill those bosses - I got 6 bosses into BT and then my guild fell apart). I said it was difficult. You said WoW was never hard. 
---
Why should you care? If someone tells you that you're eating bananas the wrong way, would you care? I hope not.
---
Also, just because someone believes the game will be better by 1:1 patch progression, does that make them a bigot when they express their views?
---
Yeah it would be great if they did a massive overhaul of the game and brought it back to its roots, but I think it's too late for such a massive change and I think Blizzard knows that which is why they are simply bringing back classic for the section of the WoW community that wants the oldschool stuff.
---
Old mechanics, the stats and everything is also more important to me, it makes the game more pleasing no matter the content that exists.
---
It's not hard.
---
Its the CIRCLE OF GAAAAAANKKKKSSSSS
---
You know that Blizzard kept trying to balance paladins against shaman throughout vanilla. But with TBC, they figuratively threw their arms in the air and said "fuck it, let both factions have both classed".
---
Well said. Ill check it out thanks!
---
Pre-Raid BiS has a lot of Molten Core gear beat for the most part. Pretty ridiculous, I know. Professions give some great items. PvP has great gear if you wanna do that. Just by doing dungeons you're going to be in great shape to do Raids if you see a PuG Raid or something like that pop up.
---
Why tailoring over leatherworking?
---
Would just level with skinning. Vendor skins. Maybe keep enough to level LWing at 60 for the Hunter. Hopefully get a few devilsaurs . Then drop skinning for enchanting, then do whatever.
---
This doesn't work.  Trolls are alright but the run (oh man, the run) and the animations just don't cut it.  Undead may be repulsive but they have cool animations, possibly even as good as NE. 
---
You can still do it on private servers to great effect. 
---
All of the above  in that order. Then in a different order.
---
Stop being wrong üòÇ
---
If you did that other stuff, you were being less efficient. People respond to incentives, and people were incentivized to do dailies over traditional farming/alternative tasks.
---
Okay hero, you're the best player in the world. Get yourself into method and get on that sponsorship boi.
---
Indeed! Meeting Stones were literally "Meeting Stones" in Vanilla: a spot where the Group could assemble and move out to the instance portal, which was usually guarded by Elite Mobs.
---
I don't have a specific case but more of a general case from what I've seen here, everytime someone tries to state an opinion outside the general consensus they get instantly rejected and flamed, like for example someone talking about the viability of an less than optimal spec for endgame or anything to do with a particular case that the general population has adopted even if no one has really experienced it for more than a decade, especially when it's anything to do with any changes or wishes or any remark about anything really.
---
I mean I'm just highlighting an issue with player mentality , not even contradicting anyone nor am I saying I have any issue with how classic is going to be and already people downvoted me , this is the prime example :p
---
Night elves are snob nature lovers.
---
Taurens are true and open nature lovers.
---
Didn't you hear about Thunder Cheeks? 
---
Yeah sucked into a plane engine.
---
I'd say welcome to humanity is more like it, but I was expecting more openmindedness from people who love the same thing :p
---
It's to keep threat higher so dps can go harder, right? Which is something Druids do naturally, having higher threat generation than Warriors. We good?
---
I thought it cleansed blind? But that must be poison cleansing totem if it isn‚Äôt tremor 
---
You're right , should've thought of that one sooner :p
---
&gt;usually guarded by Elite Mobs
---
God yes - just getting to the portal was usually an endeavor with the few exceptions like ZF. RFC and WC. 
---
Typically was a good way to test if the group was going to get any traction in the instance at least. 
---
Yes, I agree about those dwarf beards.  The ones I've scalped from the corpses of mine enemies look mighty good hanging on the walls of my hut.
---
Why do I like Horde?  Their banner emblem rocks!  And the words "For the Horde!" flow off my tongue much smoother than "For the Alliance".  Oh, and Barrens chat.  You haven't experienced vanilla WoW until you've experienced Barrens chat.
---
Good comparison... but i wouldnt mind classic going into tbc personally. Tbc was my all time favorite but i know everyone likes different expacs more than others so i think the old school rs approach would be best, hope they go that route
---
Correct. I've love to have a difficulty slider on some games for my parents. I think they'd love Walking Dead Season 1, but they can't read all the options in time, even if I play and they just "direct" the game options. 
---
Hey Guys,  just wanted to share this little animation that my ex did a few years ago back when we were playing on Emerald Dream.  We were both studying animation at the time and she made this in a weekend for a small game she was working on.
---
Here is a link to her website.  [https://www.agerstmann.com/](https://www.agerstmann.com/)
---
I mostly agree. 8% faster speed vs 7.5% DPS increase is nearly identical (assuming travel and fighting take up similar % of your time)
---
But boot enchant will likely be available at this point at a reasonable price. More damage + equal speed.
---
I use satellite internet for downloading updates (wow, cell phone, pc.) Then I use a jetpack for playing.  You cannot play on satellite, your ping will be around 700 ms.  You have to keep track of data usage on satellite and cellular even with unlimited, because you will get throttled on both.
---
But... there already is?
---
Mine is empty.. ü§î
---
I want... certain mechanics from TBC. Hard Paladin Taunt. I think that was when druid got a true res. But the content? Khara, BT and Sunwell were awesome but a lot of the other content wasn't great to me. 
---
My gaming PC is dead and I don't currently have one that can play *anything*.
---
So I guess I'd just sit here and despair lol
---
If you are having a problem with a big part of the classic playerbase maybe the problem is your own sensitivities.
---
Do not expect discussion on the internet to be anything like real life discussions. 
---
Not at all, I was mostly talking about arguments regarding the inability of even considering other people's opinions, if I liked apples and you liked bananas, I'd respect your opinion even if I don't particularly like bananas , but if you come and tell me bananas are the way and apples suck because "trust me bro" and "I saw it on youtube" or my favorite one " that's how I remember it", then that is the issue I'm talking about.
---
And the biggest problem is when said person convinced others that apples suck and suddenly you have hatred towards anyone with an opinion about apples just cause that's the general consensus, I was hoping these things would not come to classic but the majority of players are already on these forums.
---
I've played both Horde and Alliance. Each has advantages and disadvantages. I'd suggest that you support and encourage your wife in playing WoW. So roll Alliance and Horde. Suggest she also roll her Night Elf, and a Troll alt. Then both of you play both characters. Which one for this session? Flip a coin. Do rock, paper, scissors. Do anything. When you get both to level 10 or so (still fairly fast, even in vanilla), decide which faction you two are enjoying more and stick with it. 
---
The game doesn't play out like the pic. Spoilers.
---
/r/im14andthisisdeep
---
Long term Alliance player here. Got roped into it in Vanilla by siblings and friends.
---
I actually prefer horde races universally to ally races but once you play Ally you really can't go back. Our cities are sooo much better. If she actually prefers ally races as well then you have a 0% chance of conversion.
---
If I was your girl I would eliminate you before betraying my faction to play horde.
---
Quite the predicament OP. Are you going to remain loyal to your faction or your girl? Either way you're getting into top 10 anime betrayals of all time territory.
---
Factions preferences should be disclosed at the start of relationships like STDs or any so far undisclosed offspring.
---
I'm rarely affected by much tbh, in fact I post these threads because I'm mostly curious if people are aware of their actions, I bet you anything the majority of people who reply angrily at this thread are the very bigots I'm talking about :p
---
I admit I did this to some degree facing off against horde on my Dwarf rogue.
---
Lose a fight for whatever reason, then return and stealth around following him.   Wait until I see him blow a specific CD and then attack and kill. 
---
Then leave the area lol.
---
I don‚Äôt get what the problem was with just normal and heroic mode? Why did they have to add LFR and mythic?
---
The only class that can heal in PvP and dps in PvE that will ever get a raid spot in a serious(ish) is priest (and raids only take 1 shadow priest).
---
You could probably find a raid spot as an enh shaman if you were to accept a very casual guild.
---
It is extremely rare that any guild wll take a ret paladin or balance/feral druid.
---
"I was asking if they could add dual specs to classic and people told me to back to retail"
---
OP probably
---
Tbf ud racials are pretty strong as well. Also yeah, a sneaky orc just seems super awkward.
---
Ok so best piece of advice is to destroy that box so they have to install a new box this time with one that you too can also plug into. And by destroy I mean any fucking means necessary because it‚Äôs classic dude/dudette comeon. Don‚Äôt hold back shotgun fire sabotage fire? Acid axe to the pole so it comes falling down idk get creative. Do it stealthily quick and make sure it‚Äôs fucked up! And if they replace without a box big enough for you do it again. They‚Äôll get the point! Nike has a good slogan for this ‚Äújust do it‚Äù
---
I dont think anyone here solely just wants WoW to remain Classic and and only that. In many ways Classic fans have come to terms with what modern Blizzard is, and have realized that this is the best they are going to get.
---
We dont dislike Modern WoW to be cool, we are sad that its come to this, that we have to play a old game. 
---
Diablo fans were angry at Diablo Immortal, but if they were being honest with themselves, they know that Diablo 4 will be a shitshow, even bigger than Diablo 3. This is just not the same company anymore and its not worth it to agonize over.
---
I was leveling a mage a few months ago on a private server. I had some extra gold so I bought some + fire damage stuff and tried to go for it. It was rough. Kill speed was quick but it would have been fast if I bought + frost gear.
---
The biggest issue is mana. Frost can kill 5-7 mobs before drinking while I‚Äôd have to drink after 2-3. 
---
I really regretted the decision. You don‚Äôt need to go AoE frost to lvl. There‚Äôs a great single DPS frost damage spec for leveling. 
---
Race: Play what you like to look at because you will be looking at your character for hours upon hours.
---
Professions: Some will say blacksmith to craft some of the items you want/need, but those can also be bought. Take whatever professions interest you because those are the ones that you will excel at.
---
Slow until about 40/50 when aoe with Holy shield / consecrate becomes insane

---
Because these topics are being brought up here 100 times per day, just sort by new. 
---
Everyone is sick and tired of explaining why it's a terrible idea to balance classes, add dual specs, LFG, etc etc.
---
jesus grow up
---
I plan on switching to Linux only playing once it gets ironed out with wine/lutris.
---
From my point of view you are very sensitive to some actions but somewhat blind to your own.
---
Depends on what you mean by viable. First off pretty much all the hybrid dps specs suck in pve, raids usually want 1 or a hybrid shadow priest for debuffs. Raids might let you swing nightfall on ret or enhance, but they both suck at that too compared to a hunter/warrior, ele runs out of mana insanely fast, moonkin even more so. Feral is the only real dps spec that puts out decent numbers, but you will have to be alliance for blessings, be fully world buffed, farm harder than every other pure dps and play even harder to be decent dps.
---
Just gonna do a quick rundown of them all for pvp
---
Paladins are by and large the best pure pvp healer, great heals, plate, defensive dispel, great cooldowns, 
---
ret however is probably the weakest of the dps pvp specs for a healer.
---
Priest is the next best healer having good heals, but you spend more time dispelling because you can offensive and defense dispel, good instant casts and fairly durable with PWS/inner fire/fear
---
Shadow priest great in 1v1 pvp and random bgs, not generally invited to premade pvp, suffers from mana problems, limited range, and a good bit of your damage being dispelable.
---
Shaman, is kind of an outlier because pure healing spec is rarely used and  the meta 30/0/21 spec doesn't really play like a traditional healer, more of a battlemage or a bard kinda thing. Buff teammates with totems, lots of offensive dispels, and swap between heals and burst depending on the situation. Sort of slow to become good though, you don't really get much in the way of gear until aq.
---
ill mention enhance just for completion sake, but its similar to ret a fun meme spec for random bgs but you aren't gonna end up in any premades and good players are going to exploit your weaknesses and make you hate your life.
---
Druid, druids claim to fame is flag running, they are sort of weak healers but they are nearly impossible to kill, you can escape nearly any fight and be a major annoyance. Their pvp dps specs are kinda bad, feral is great in 1v1's but they suffer the same problems rogues have in group pvp their kit just isn't made for it and unlike rogues they don't have like 4 different CC effects so they aren't particularly suited for guarding flags like a rogue.
---
oomkin runs out of mana alot, they are fun in random bgs but trying to get gear for it is damn near impossible.
---
Orc Rogue with Eshkandars claws named ‚ÄúSniktbub‚Äù. There can be only one.
---
Lol, nice story.
---
Baby
---
&gt;Does every member of your group physically need to go to the entrance of the dungeon to get into it?
---
Yes
---
&gt;Can locks summon? If so, when you port out, where do you end up, last place or at entrance of dungeon?
---
Yes. When you leave the dungeon you're at the entrance, unless you use your hearthstone. 
---
&gt;Was there a group finder tool in game? I remember something where you could add your name to a list. It wouldnt auto form the group &amp; port you in etc, but you could find people this way and message them.
---
I believe that was the original purpose of the Meeting Stone outside each dungeon. 
---
It made plenty player worse people.  Assholes would roll need on shit they clearly didn't need to disenchant or vendor, completely giving zero shit about players who really wanted the item from a particular item.  One of the main reason I stopped playing live Cata and went back to guilds/dkp on a private vanilla server
---
&gt;It seems the hardcore guys will race to 60 then spend the next 5 months bored and complaining
---
Everyone always says this, but as a speedleveler (who expects to ding 60 in sub 120 hours) that has speedrun from TBC through BFA, it's not accurate.
---
Once we hit max we have PLENTY to do... that's why we rush to get thered.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs honestly both. MC is pretty damn easy when you overgear it, sure, but you can still cause wipes quite easily by your team not being on their game. An extra trash pack, a firelord spawning adds, a lack of decurses, no tranq shot in time, or the backup hunter fucked up. 
---
Meanwhile most of LFR is so easy that there is no *risk*. That‚Äôs half of the fun of MC, when you clear it perfectly you feel relieved that you did well as a group without a wipe. 
---
Also, I‚Äôd argue you kind of mute the substance of the raid with every added version. I kind of enjoy Cata or WotLks setup, where there‚Äôs 10 and 25, and normal and heroic. 
---
There‚Äôs an easy and a hard. But having soooo many difficulties just kind of makes it a slog in my opinion. I lost a lot of interest in WoD and onward when you would just charge through normal mode before actually giving a shit in Heroic. Or feeling obligated to do LFR when you‚Äôd rather lick wet paint :/ 
---
"I saw it on youtube" LMAO that's a classic line. I see your point, but on the internet its pretty easy for "A &amp; B" to become "A vs. B" solely based on the fact that A is different than B. Better to just let it go. Ignore them!
---
&gt; I dont think anyone here solely just wants WoW to remain Classic and and  only that. In many ways Classic fans have come to terms with what  modern Blizzard is, and have realized that this is the best they are  going to get. 
---
Nicely said
---
Try-hards will also probably be on the PVP servers. Getting to 60 first will assure their initial dominance in top zones putting them ahead of the pack.
---
I'm with you though - I'll have a couple hours a night to give up to WoW. I'll be on a PVE server and leveling several alts at once so I'll be even slower than average. 
---
Amazing 
---
100% OP.  I would love TBC mechanics minus flying, but with different content.  CC needs to be mandatory.  LoS pulling needs to be a thing.  The current zergfest mechanics are only fun to me on a DK tank.  They ruined dps classes imo.  I would like the reduced cooldowns on the tanks with more self sustain than vanilla, but I‚Äôm just going to get excited about classic anyways.  
---
My friend and I used to do that all the time just go to crossroads and fuck them up lol
---
Man i remember seeing the dwarf hunter shooting the dragon with his group on this box art during bc when i was like 11. I had no experience with games and thought it looked like the most fun thing of all time lol
---
Mage.
---
Yep, blind is a poison. Why druids used to cast abolish poison on themselves while fighting against rogues. Well, in TBC at least, I can't remember if they had abolish poison in vanilla.
---
Ton's to do at 60....
---
Wasn't really talking about any of those things though, to give you an idea of what I meant, things like shamans being considered tanks, balance druids being a joke or hybrid dps alltogether, pvp/pve viability of classes or their respective position in actuality not in everyone's minds or whichever general consensus everyone has agreed upon over the years, a lot of things might seem different, like a person arguing how a class is op at something only to then realize it's not op, just okay at it but only becomes good after certain gear has been acquired etc.
---
A lot of things are viable but not optimal and it's okay to want to play something that isn't optimal so long as you don't expect to achieve great results, but a lot of people just refuse to accept things as even viable because in their memory in whichever patch 15 years ago it sucked and that's how it was remembered ever since ( and mainly because they were bad).
---
As a speedrunner, I enjoy seeing how I can beat my own PB to 60. It‚Äôs a fun and crazy pace that makes its own adrenaline. Launches are super competitive and pushing to be in the top 5 is a big buzz!
---
If I‚Äôm not doing a timed run, I enjoy lazy sociable levelling as much as the next person ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
WoW was made to appeal to an ever broadening audience. An audience that, as it grew up, realized that having to spend ages on any task to feel like any sort of progress was made wasn't something it had time for anymore. Over time, the core approach to the game by the devs changed to support a different type of audience. And a lot of different things contributed to this; from the rise of micro-transactions in games to the fact that the core game features force the game to be somewhat static.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
The things that concretely 'made WoW worse' are mostly symptoms of the changing philosophy, which was in itself influenced by a lot of different circumstances. To point at one, two, or even five or ten is to undercut 15 years of changes in the gaming community, Blizzard, technology, and triple A culture.
---
Great write up. Quick question though, the 30/0/21 shaman spec you spoke about, is that for pve or pvp? Not gonna lie, I have a soft spot for shaman, as it‚Äôs been my main on live for a while. 
---
Why is a warrior wielding a hunter's weapon?
---
Man I remember typing /who and harassing tanks and healers. I was a UD rogue so ppl hated me but I was good at pulling everyone together. 
---
Eventually rolled Human War and had a ton of fun tanking and then people annoyed ME haha
---
It always bothered me with this picture that the player's name is not capitalized
---
Is the stun resist better than stoneform? Do orc rogues beat dwarf rogues  given they are equal skill?
---
Everyone is partially blind when it comes to self flaws, at least I can agree to that , what about you ? 
---
If you're here to tell me it's pointless to try to reason with people on the internet then why did you post in the first place ? :)
---
I hate leveling. Hate HAte HATe HATEeeeeeeEeEee. It is hands down the least enjoyable process in MMOs for me. 
---
I also love PVE raids and dungeons. I can do them all day, everyday and not get bored. There's BiS to farm, rep to farm (for upcoming AQ/NAx etc), raids, wPvP, etc. So much to do, five months might not be enough time for me even IF we STARTED at 60. Much less leveling up.
---
Some people enjoy different aspects of WoW. That's what makes it awesome. You can enjoy leveling casually with your buds, and I can have fun no-life leveling so I can get to the part of the game *I* want. If I want to enjoy leveling, I can enjoy an alt in my down time.  
---
It‚Äôs really hard to make a non gamer learn to enjoy games. I think some of us have had our reward centers modified since we‚Äôve probably played since our earliest memories. I also think as a man my brain is satisfied more by accomplishing something rather than just sitting around. Before I‚Äôm called out on my oppinion being wrong or sexist I‚Äôm sorry this is just a loose idea I‚Äôve mulled over before. I also believe non gaming men that weren‚Äôt introduced early to games sometimes just don‚Äôt get the same enjoyment someone that‚Äôs indoctrinated into gaming has. 
---
Only Blizz knows what's really in the 1.12 code. I guess we'll have to wait for a beta or for classic go release to be really sure, and even then, i feel like it would have to be a lot of research and time to be sure.
---
I know MC is easy and all, but I dont see how you can possibly clear it while mutiboxing. 
---
Like how are you gonna do Garr and Geddon? Even some of the trash pulls seem impossible, double firelord pulls are harder than some of the bosses in there.
---
On your primary target, sure. Where Imp SWP shines is multi target pulls and/or any PvP situation. Bubble, pain on 3 targets, wand primary til dead, mb secondary, wand until dead, mb 3rd, wand until dead.

I don't know man, Scarab Lord is such a feat it will demand respect for years to come.

Let's see now.
---
Enslaved Orcs. Result of Orc PoWs from loosing a war the orcs started. And can't really consider it enslavement since the orcs were not being used for labor.
---
Gnome and biological warfare. WTF?!?! Can't find anything about gnomes doing this, but can find the forsaken actively researching a new plague and using the results on prisoners.
---
I'll agree on the night elf racism.
---
Beardless dwarf females. Why do you consider that a bad thing?
---
The races.
---
Forsaken - Most evil. They can't reproduce on their own and simply want to destroy the Lich King. Killing the living is also high on their agenda because humans didn't accept them back. Basically revenge at any price and damn the consequences.
---
Orcs - Reasonably honorable, but overly entitled. "We were tricked by some bad people and thereby destroyed our world and invaded yours, starting an unprovoked war which we lost. So please share your world with us. Also, we still have some orcs who still want to go back to war and kill you. But don't worry. That's not our official policy."
---
Trolls - The other tribes of trolls are fighting us, but Thrall is willing to help us, so we've joined the horde.
---
Tauren - The orcs have helped us against the centaurs, so we are in debt to them. We support the horde.
---
Humans - We try to be good, but we're willing to shaft our workers if we're short on funds.
---
Dwarfs - Where did we come from? We gotta go everywhere and dig artifacts up to answer this question. Meanwhile, let's drink and party.
---
Gnomes - Oh, that's neat! What will happen if I press that button? Oops, sorry about that new crater.
---
Night elves - Bad shit happened 10,000 years ago and many of us, including our leaders saw that personally. We don't want to see that happen again. Go away.
---
Overall, I'd saw the Alliance have the greater moral authority. The forsaken is simply looking for revenge and is willing to harm anyone in their way. The Orcs screwed up royally and desperately want a "do over". They don't really deserve it, but they do need it to survive.  
---
I wish I could get my friends on board. :\\ Hopefully I'll find a good guild. 
---
Yeah, you're right. Teebu's Blazing Longsword is just too rare. 
---
Believe me it took a lot of convincing, dw wow communities great ull make friends in no time
---
How do people get paid to write this absolute trash
---
I think my number 2 choice would be scarab lord and rank 14 would be my number 3. Rank 14 is atleast possible without a guild carrying you for it (although a guild helping you would make it easier)
---
On my server, every Chinese Gold Farmer was a rogue. They would almost all grind Tyr's Hand, and we non-mages would give them 1 piece of food to ease their suffering.
---
Classic released right now. Hands down
---
In terms of men being more likely to enjoy games because they'd rather accomplish something than sit around, that's definitely false. I'm not sure why more millenial women don't play video games, but generation Z females almost all play games and don't even consider the fact that games are separated by gender. I think it might be that games coming out now are marketed less towards boys (fortine, roblox) and are more gender neutral. 
---
Green rank 14 most ill probably ever get myself is 12 and that is probably optimistic
---
already going to get 4 weeks pto for classic =P
---
and i got some things i want to finish before classic comes out
---
You don‚Äôt have any extra chance to resist, the duration is just 20% shorter. Back in the day you were correct though.
---
I still have this picture lying around in the box. I will say - I never looked at it closely, but consider this shit for a moment: what we're seeing is a level 60 warrior with no helm, cape, second trinket or bow, and with no stances learned and his auto-attack ability still bound at max level, who seems to have nevertheless completed [You Are Rakh'likh, Demon](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:You_Are_Rakh%27likh,_Demon) for the 16 slot bag, aggro a supposedly weak mob in the Dwarf Starting Zone while a Warlock who he isn't in a party with runs up to him and casts Demon Armor.  
---
Show of fucking hands if you've ever seen anyone in that situation in the game itself.
---
Female dwarf rogues.
---
Oh, I'm sure I will. Just need to find a large enough pool of casual night owls that I can secure a pool for dungeons. 
---
I'm... talking about classic, we're on the classic sub lol
---
Orc rogues have ap buff though so they are better than dwarves if you aren‚Äôt comparing only the two cc racials 
---
that was 2.0, tbc pre patch
---
RHEEEEEE!!!1!
---
Isnt the answer blue, then you can still go for two of the others.
---
I think it could be the first or second one but not the third.
---
The language ("_increased_ by an _additional_") would seem to suggest it's the second, a flat 25% on top of the base 15%. If it was just "increased by" then I think the first would be more plausible, a 25% increase of the base.
---
Whats with your bias of private server, rather aggresive. Jesus christ lmao. Let people have fun.
---
Are you trying to reason with the people you call bigots? Kinda feel like some of my opinions could be those bigoted opinions that you do not like. 
---
Example: If you want to play a balance druid, you should respec for raiding. 
---
You can make orcs and trolls "pretty" also tauren female are cute! Just got to show her the orc dance!
---
Yeah thats gonna be a bitch, my friend has limited internet so if u wanna duo in some dungeons ill probably be playing druid or hunter on an alt
---
But then the devs see that people aren't communicating and instead of trying to directly address that issue, they just make the dungeon design more streamlined and success less dependent on coordination, hence making them easier.
---
No.  My moniker is an homage to the poor souls from Star Trek who gave their lives in the pursuit of knowledge:  "Captain, I've found something.  Aaaaaaaaiiiiieeee!"
---
Definitely learnt to type from MSN and WOW back in the day.
---
Still not great but &gt;60wpm is decent and gets me by in my job pretty well.
---
&gt; Another interpretation of this is to take the base of 15% and add the 25%, making that total chance to resist 40%.
---
That's what I've always seen people says, except base stun resist is 5%, so you get a total of 30%. And some people claimed that it was 33% due to w/e math they used.
---
Having played an alliance rogue, 30ish% does seem about right.
---
Well it isn't too likely that we'll be in the same server, faction and level at the same pace. I have 4+ alts I'll be leveling. I appreciate the offer though. 
---
One can dream....

---
A very accurate take on paladin's ability to do solo content from the times.
---
What a great picture and memory that is! But look again... it‚Äôs actually the gnome mage in the background throwing that fireball and not the dwarf‚Äôs gunshot. I just recently learned that here on reddit too.
---
Yellow, due to my belief that being one of the first 60s on the server equates to establishing a foothold on the economy, hitting the ground running and setting one's self up for long-term success.
---
Gotcha u gonna be doing pvp or pve server yknow yet?
---
Oh wow, I truly hope it's the 18.75% interpretation. 
---
Not to take anything away from Orc fans, but a 25% resist is so OP in PVP that it doesn't make sense to play anything other than an Orc (for their classes). 
---
That's basically the #1 reason why I'm not playing Horde, since I really dislike the Orc character aesthetic, but don't want to feel silly for playing a weaker character in PVP. 
---
If they get a more moderate (even if it's still technically best) racial bonus, I might have to reconsider playing on my favorite faction again. 
---
Sounds like people are getting salty they can‚Äôt beat sekiro 
---
Married her prior to her playing WoW.  Had I known that she would have a weakness for the Alliance....
---
STV is probably the best place to level up in terms of XP gained from quests, the amount of quests given by the same person, and how close and relative they are to the quest giver. Also a lot of them requires you to have some luck in looting quest items, so you probably have to kill a few more mobs to get what you need, which also does not hurt leveling.
---
But this is just my two cents on the matter.
---
Hey. So I really enjoy healing or caster dps and PVP, some PVE.
---
I think the most fun I ever had in game was resto druid with tree of life form and all those stackable HoTs. However, vanilla doesn't have tree of life form, let alone more than like 3-4 healing abilities.
---
Balance druid was also fun in MoP but in vanilla it has similar problems as resto druid with few abilities and relying on delving into the other specs.
---
Shadow Priest was really fun in WotLK but in vanilla it has mind blast, mind flay, shadow dot....and that's about it. Might be OP because of mana conservation and good damage, but not sure if it will be all that fun to play endgame with.
---
For some reason mages never really appealed to me despite loving caster classes. Maybe I should give a POM + Pyroblast mage a chance? Were arcane mages a thing back then? For some reason every time I rolled mage it would make me want to play a healer instead but maybe I should give them a decent chance.
---
Warlocks are really fun but the whole soul shards taking up bag space before bgs and raids seems really cumbersome. I kind of have OCD and that sort of stuff might get on my nerves, even if it's petty. However, I like going deep into destruction so not sure how that is in vanilla pvp (19/1/31)
---
Holy Priest was fun in MoP because of aoe healing +other abilities that did not exist in vanilla. Also pretty sure leveling as a holy priest in Vanilla would be basically impossible or  super annoying. Can't respec as easily as I would in MoP.
---
And I am not really sure about Shamans resto or elemental.
---
I probably like healing more than dps but healing doesn't seem as fun in Vanilla because resto druid/shaman are limited in abilities and overshadowed by priests (not paladins I don't play alliance). And priests has its own catches that I mentioned earlier.
---
If I were to be a healer what would you recommend? and what would you recommend for caster dps? And should I roll healer or caster dps?
---
Also a lot of competition, and pvp. Desolace is desolate. Easy grind. 
---
That would be ideal. Should change it to choose one to throw out!
---
thanks, thats very encouraging
---
To be fair, it *is* the Darnassus of the Horde. Sweet city, location bad enough you never go there.

Let's upvote this until it becomes the 1st result on Google when people reverse search this image.
---
‚ÄúAdditional‚Äù it‚Äôs additive, yes Orc is that good.
---
Taurens:
---
* Biggest hitbox in the game. This means they can be hit by melee from further away than other races and vice versa.
---
* War Stomp is a great 'get off me' button.
---
* +Health is not the greatest but better than nothing.
---
Orcs:
---
*  Hardiness gives you more chance to resist stuns which is pretty good.
---
* Command pet damage is handy.
---
* Blood Fury + Axe spec is ok. If you're forced to Melee you can bake in your Blood Fury to the same macro as your Melee button and do a lot more damage with it.
---
HA HA you have offended many fragile nyybs today!

I lived in the Tarentaise alps for 6 months. Love the French outside of Parisians... They were rude and horrible in general. Others were really amazing and even let me practice my bad French with them (and would try to Anglaise when I struggled)

Oh look another post talking shit about people who take the game too seriously.
---
You should just roll alliance with her but keep a secret horde named Compromise that you gank her with all the time. To the point where she verbally complains to you about some dickhead named Compromise, yet that's just the second account alt tabbed behind the alliance front that she can see.  
---
You mean to tell me I can just take this pill... keep all my time off... and just get to be the best geared warrior on my server? Where do I sign up?
---
I think you‚Äôre correct 
---
Sekiro is dope as fuck. Can I get a shout out from all my Shura enders?
---
I appreciate you for not skewering me on what could be a controversial topic. Thank you for adding to it and I agree that games have been moving towards a more inclusive marketing and design. 
---
The tooltip does not dictate what the spell actually does though. 
---
&gt; in ....ummm... whatever the name is of that Tauren high rise you don't visit after level 30 or so.
---
Oh you mean that village in the high mountains where I camp all my bank alts? I call it Good-for-Banks Mountain.
---
It depends, resisting a rogue stun really messes them up, but it's also random. In some fights you might just be stuck with the AP buff.
---
While I think that hardiness is overall better than stoneskin, being able to break blind or use it to drop bleeds/poisons before restealthing can give you pretty big advantage in rogue vs rogue scenario.
---
Agreed agreed. My thing has always been immersion so the racials weren‚Äôt too big a thing so much as class/race fantasy. I also think orc warlock is a bit awkward looking but it‚Äôs also part of the lore somethings I can accept even if I don‚Äôt think it fits personally lol
---
In all fairness, she did play Horde until level 40.  Then she realized that the Horde couldn't get a nightsaber mount, and that was all she wrote.
---
Yep, that's why I was talking about what it suggests, not dictates.
---
Are you me?
---
I can relate to this so much. I've played original vanilla for the entire duration as Horde. I played four more years on two seperate PTR servers as Horde, and now I will go with Horde again.
---
Worst part is that Alliance have it easier in BGs and PvE progression, and I still go Horde. Am I retarded, or am I just devoted to my faction?
---
Oh she's hot alright.  She gets hit on constantly, both IRL and in game.

Well there's your problem.

---
The best part about our common goals and support as a community is that as soon as those servers come online we're at each other's throats, like savage dogs who wandered upon a moose carcass.
---
There are so many different types of games I think the argument gets confused, but for some ‚Äúskill/mastery‚Äù type games, I think a difficultly option does impede on the ‚Äòreal‚Äô version the devs crafted.
---
Getting to see that end level, or the cool gear or the story conclusion are the best incentives in games, and mastering a challenging one feels rewarding in the long run. (For games that are designed around mastery)
---
Giving an easy mode to experience the shallow rewards of winning without mastering the game takes away from the experience since mastery is where the joy comes from, the rewards are partly incentives just to stick with it. 
---
Like in live WoW, if I had to do an actual raid to see the content, experience the story, and make my character look cool, I probably would carve out some time for a couple of months to try and get it. In the process of going for those rewards I would develop a mastery of the game and be required to develop relationships, which take work. But now with LFR and transmog, there just isn‚Äôt enough incentive for the time investment.
---
Same for dark souls, I rarely play single player games, but that game I have hundreds of hours in. I quit multiple times only to come back months later and master it. Now, remembering back in my time with it, it was an amazing game, probably my favourite single player game of all time. If there was an easy option, i probably would have tried it after giving up the first time, and I would remember it has an ok game and have much less incentive to play again on a harder mode.
---
I had to convince my boyfriend
---
What a garbage sword
---
Thanks, that's a great idea!  By seeing how mean the Alliance are to each other, she'll be more open to rolling Horde!
---
Interesting way to look at it. Being 60 first will also save you time from getting ganked.
---
Give me yellow. Don‚Äôt even care too much about getting a head start, but getting paid for two weeks to play would be a dream. 
---
I'm not sure it would be additive, as percent increases don't usually work like that.  Looking for proof one way or the other though.  Like I said in the post, it's entirely possible that pservers have applied that buff additively which has greatly contributed to the perception of the orc racial as "that good"
---
anonymity brings the racist out of people.
---
They're usually just trolls tho looking for a reaction.
---
I just can't wait til they find out that Blizz don't play that game.
---
Free money always sounds good to me

I believe that CoT wasn't active until Burning Crusade

---
I haven't frequented r/WoW much for Classic news, obviously.  Whats the general feeling around it there?  
---
You can get to 60 in 150hours with full professions and all sub 60 dungeons atleast once. Ill be taking it even slower this time around though, i want some gear along the way. 
---
No need to hate on the speedrunners though.
---
In all probability, I will end up rolling toons on multiple servers.  Though managing the identity crisis might be an issue, unless I can develop a multiple personality disorder to compensate.
---
&gt;That doesn't mean people want to raid with Empty Spots even if it's "viable"
---
Empty spots wont take my gear.
---
Just like every other free service on the net...
---
Base chance to resist stun = 5% which goes down 0% if rogue has 5% hit. Orc racial was additive along with talents to resist stuns as well. Iron Will (warrior talent)  Increases chance to resist Resist Stun and Charm effects by 15%. So Orc Warriors with Iron Will had over 40% stun resist. It rly was 25-30% stun resist for Orcs... I played vanilla for over a year /played as an Orc rogue from 2004-2006. GLHF.
---
Id go priest. Healing in vanilla is in my opinion more fun than later expansions. Managing your mana is a skill in itself and it always feels like more of a challenge then mindless spamming like in later expansions. Down ranking spells and managing your way through a fight without running out of mana can be intense. You can also go shadow or heals for pvp both are great. Ofc you need to be prepared to spend a lot on respec costs to switch between the two every week. 
---
If you decide to go pure dps id say mage. They are versitle and have a lot of utility. Great in pvp and pve and they are also top dps in vanilla alongside warriors. 
---
Alternatively you could just go for druid or shaman. Both can heal fine albeit druids a bit weaker, and while not the most optimal, they both can shine in pvp as well as boomkin or ele. Just my two cents, Hope this helps!
---
WC definitely had elite mobs in the cave before the portal, and ZF at least still had mobs near the entrance. People just usually hop on their mount and try and run past em real quick into the portal.

Bfd is black fathom depths?

I live in the country, no viable options except satellite. I use the hotspot on my iPhone exclusively. With Verizon unlimited plan, each phone receives 15 gb/month hotspot at full speed which is plenty for gaming, but lacks on patches.  Our family has 3 lines, so we have 45 gigs before throttling. 
---
The iPhone hotspot streams video better than our cable internet at our prior house (given that was a few years ago in a busy area). If using hot spot I found I have a better connection when I connect via usb instead of WiFi. 
---
I can relate; my wife is of Italian descent as well.  And when she gets mad, oh boy, watch out....
---
This was absolutely not a 40% stun resist for most of vanilla- along with the similar priest ability for example.  I believe that it was either totally broken it it worked multiplicatively- ie, 25% of 
---
It‚Äôs additive. It‚Äôs that good. Source is my memory from the era, not pservers. 
---
&gt; Base chance to resist stun = 5% which goes down 0% if rogue has 5% hit.
---
so you're telling me it would be impossible for anyone except orcs or those with stun resist talents to resist a stun from you if you have 5+% hit?
---
WoW was ruined by easy mode, now only comes in WoW Lite. Looking forward to the proper game having a small revival, far too excited for its return.
---
I still think LFR is a good way to get people familair with what raiding even is. I started playing like a year ago now and LFR was a nice way for me to see how gear drops work and how raid groups work with tanks and healers. It's not like LFR is dropping gear that's super good or hard to get, it's the equivalent of running an M0, something that you can do pretty easily with world quest gear. Ironically that's probably a faster way to get gear anyway.
---
Besides there's already an easy mode, it's called normal difficulty. Any guild or pug with about half a brain can clear it with ease. To the people who take the game seriously LFR is completely useless.
---
He's also a guild master lol... actually that makes sense
---
When I play a pala and try to stun an orc they have 100% stun resist but when I play an orc it's like 1%. 
---
I played back in the day too and the only relevant thing I remember is the lack of people complaining about how OP it was.  I'd still like to see some kind of proof though, I'm sure someone out there has conducted tests but I can't find anything.
---
Exactly. Especially when the release date falls at a crucial time. I would take that, and not look back. I‚Äôd probably need another vacation to deal with just the disgustingness I would allow myself to reach during that time haha.  
---
I played a shaman in vanilla and a particular mage in our guild often wanted to duel. I beat him all but one time. He kept at it but I just always had his number. Vanilla was like that from my experience.
---
This was awesome. 
---
I as a paladin I happily healed 3 bear tanks all the way through BWL. After that they had to respec Resto obviously but, hey it was fun while it was viable.   Read Not optimal 
---
Yellow pill so damn hard dude. Hell, Gimme 4 of those bad boys.

God damn that tranq shot comment just gave me a wave of dopamine in memories, The first warrior with TF on our server would tank for us in MC sometimes, and he would just dump truck through it.

Just be better than the rest, if you play with a guild/friends you‚Äôll be fine.

Honestly at launch I‚Äôm expecting to see heaps of every class even Druids to be honest... it‚Äôs launch.
---
Play mage man it‚Äôs a grind to 60 and youll be more invested playing the class you want.

I plan to play rogue (it was my first toon) and I know there will be heaps of us. But oh well

‚ÄúIn vanilla you could go from a two-hander to dual wield in one gcd and change stances or go from 1 set of dual wield weapons to a to a different set of dual wield weapons‚Äù 
---
This is correct, i believe I just worded differently and didn‚Äôt include stance swap possibility.
---
I main a warlock so I felt strange testing this but I tested for quite a few hours before becoming positive of my work/research. 
---
The main two things that are the most drastic are that items labeled ‚ÄúOff-Hand‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt trigger any form of GCD ever. And they do on the new engine. (Biggest problem presented here is that warriors cannot go from Dual-Wield to Sword/Shield without having to wait on a global. And rogues would not be able to swap from a PvP item such as from a  ‚ÄòSkull of Impending Doom‚Äô to an Off-Hand dagger shout waiting on a global. 
---
And that weapons should be able to be swapped during a cast with no GCD, but with the new engine they can‚Äôt be swapped during cast. 
---
I‚Äôll write up a strongly and clearly worded summary tomorrow and post that on the Blizzard Forums. 
---
I have also brought this issue to the attention of Two Classic Content Creators in YouTube I hopes of sparking a larger conversation as it IS something that NEEDS to be verified and/or fixed by Blizzard.
---
The fire mage can be specced and played in many ways for leveling.  There is some inaccurate info in this thread.  Just don‚Äôt forget rank 1 frostbolt as a fire mage.  And you still have frost nova.  And blastwave.  Single target mobs do die faster with fire on average, assuming grinding them back to back.  Two mobs at once die faster as fire as well.
---
Also realize that aoe farming as a frost mage is more difficult than a lot of people think.  When it‚Äôs mastered it‚Äôs beautiful.  I predict a lot of mages reroll that have not vanilla maged yet.  Some of these responses sound like legion answers, not vanilla.  You will drink a lot as a mage.  Fire or frost.  If you aoe 10 mobs you will be oom.  If you don‚Äôt aoe, fire is fun and deadly. Frost shines on elite melee mobs.  When frost nova gets resisted you don‚Äôt have to panic.
---
Pyroblast is overrated.  Keep that in mind with talents.
---
It doesn‚Äôt do any of that. 
---
...yet it's mostly true
---
The things I would do for just two haha

Fake News

OMG, that comic strip was friggin' hilarious!  I'm still laughing.  Thanks for sharing!
---
Usually rogue vs rogue is determined by who gets the opener first. So stun resist is basically 25% chance to win the duel.
---
I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T DECIDE - STOP PRESSURING ME
---
I honestly don't know what side you are on. Till the telling a shaman he is not acceptable.

If not the case. Rock on.

Great story. I‚Äôm pretty sure I helped a gold seller once. This was in Cata though. The player sold me a bunch of spectral tiger mounts for 15k each.
---
With rep grinds, or gold grinding, or whatever, its totally up to me, and my schedule when I get my grind on.  Oh, I'm working 80 hour weeks and have no time to really play every day?  Its okay, I'll catch up on my gold farming next month when I have off time and can play for 14 hours a day for a week.
---
Current system with dailies: Oh, I'm working 80 hour weeks, *guess I'm just ***fucked***.  There is no "catching up", you're just X number of days behind your potential from where you'd be if you played every single day.  Sure, you'll finish your rep grind or whatever, eventually, but you're perpetually behind where you could have been, and no amount of "make up" grinding can replace actually being ~~forced~~ able to log in daily.
---
Pretty sure hit chance and stun resist are completely separate things.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking that a similar fate lies in store for me, try as I might to resist it.

The dailies in legion and boa are way better simply because they weren‚Äôt rea≈Çly dailies or that important after a little while. Feeling like you have to log every day for dailies was awful.

Different players of a single-player game might have different skill levels, motivations, and available amounts of time, though.

"Easy" mode might be the only possible mode for someone who is maybe unacquainted with video games generally, or someone who is too stoned and just looking to chill, etc.

If you get "more experience"  playing the harder mode, the availability of the easier modes doesn't preclude your enjoyment at all‚Äìif anything it elevates the sense of pride and accomplishment you receive.
---
I understand the calculus is entirely different for an MMORPG for fundamental competitive / game theory reasons, and disagree with the article as a result. But for single player games like the ones you mention, I'm all for as many different difficulties as the developers want to provide.

It's the only one that, even if you have the physical ability to do it, you might not be chosen anyway because your guild master is probably going to reserve it for himself and you won't have time to farm another one. And if you do, the first officer will get that one as well.

The mechanics in LFR DRAGON soul were way more complex than anything in Vanilla raids but dont let facts get in the way of your vanilla circle jerk
---
Russia is here with you. I think WoW was sort of motivation for me to learn english. It was kinda hard, because we have pretty bad limited internet back in the days, so we couldn't play on official server and we made our own local network in neighbourhood with \~20 online dudes and one geek friend somehow managed to establish pirate classic WoW server. It was mindblowing back in the days! Anything was not working correctly, we barely know 50 words in english, but we've strived and there was so much passion about it.  
---
It's sad that nothing thrills me now like it was back in childhood internet exploring era

And yet the majority of players find their way to a UI addon.
---
I would say priest and pally are equal in terms of pvp, just depends on how you want to play. Paladin makes a better heal bot, good around defending flags and you flag carrier. Priests make better healers to go after the efc or attack flags in ab.

Pto 
---
yeah lol
---
Lmao. Somehow I don‚Äôt think a more realistic screenshot featuring a dwarf in rainbow, unmatched plate gear with a ui disaster of 50 buttons thrown all across the screen would be as strong of a selling point
---
I think that's what other people don't realize is that pve doesn't mean no pvp. It just means yoy choose when you want to do it.
---
Base stun resist is 5%. The Orc racial is additive. So in effect you have 30% stun resist. 
---
I never tested the racial in Vanilla but I did test the nerfed version in TBC and it‚Äôs definitely additive. Orc‚Äôs resist a lot of damn stuns. 
---
IMO doing mythics and mythic+ runs have reinjected this back into the game. LFR isn't even as utilized anymore as you can get similar/better gear from mythics.
---
I wonder how this compared to Vanilla.  Were Dwarf priests the most common, or is that just because people now know the utility of fear ward?  Before hunters were associated with low dps at endgame, were they also so underrepresented (esp. Horde side)?
---
That's not rude to disagree - but I'm curious how I am wrong. Did your experience differ? Or are you basing this off of private servers? Because I played a warrior in Vanilla, and it is NOTHING like playing on any private server.  
---
I'm actually quite confident that if the class is anything true to its original nature, the vast majority of people who try to play one will quit and play something else entirely. Just like in the original game. Even with 1.12 as a starting point. Especially if the Arcanite Reaper is fixed (which, when it was broken, was basically the only time when warriors were OP in the game, until the select few managed to get enough T3 gear and a solid 2H weap to smash people and break things).  
---
Fury warriors constantly fought with rogues for 1h weapons, and rogues were largely considered better DPS, so they were prioritized first. Tanks were prioritized over plate-dps, and most of the gear was the same, so if you wanted the good gear, you tanked. Most servers had only 2/3 DPS warriors per faction in progression guilds - if they even had a legitimate progression guild.  
---
And on the horde-side, a shaman with WF was the #1 tank aggro assist, and pretty much the only way a raid would bring along an enh shaman (after their 2h dps was nerfed, sometime around 1.6?). This threat was far greater than what alliance tanks could generate, even for humans with +5 sword/mace.  
---
So what am I missing?
---
Except the gear from lfr is marginally worse than what you get from normal raids or even mythics in a lot of cases.
---
Indeed it will be impossible to resist the stun. Although you can still dodge/parry the stun, but if the rogue has 5% hit and kidney shots you from directly in the back you will get stunned 100% no matter what. There are pro tricks to dodge/parry attacks from behind (such as backstab) even if the person is behind you... such as strafe running (ur char will be running forward but his head will be facing to the left or right as if he/she is looking behind him/her) which will take you hundreds of hours of practice to adapt into ur play-style. GLHF
---
That's Mr. Horde Fanboi to you, Toots!
---
PVE - I'm too old and have too little time to waste to get corpse camped and lose an entire night of gaming to frustration. 
---
This. Also the fact that it makes all previous raid tiers irrelevent. Which is strange considering blizz's favourite thing is reuse content. If there was only 1-2 difficulties then people running the next tier down wouldn't even be that far behind. MMOs are supposed to feel like an investment that you are rewarded for. It's the same shit with sekiro and souls games. Like 99% of games cater to casuals and when one game doesn't it gets hammered for being too hard. Like it's not surprising they have trouble with these games when clearly they're disabled enough to go out of their way to spend money on niche games that they know full well they wont like, just so they can complain about it not being like every other game they've played.
---
True. Although I finally joined a private server and tried it out. It was nothing like what I remember. Either my memory is way off, or warriors on that particular server are a lot easier to play than I remember. I'm fairly certain quite a few things have been tweaked, that if Blizzard keeps things as close to original gameplay as they seem to be, will make this transition far more difficult than these guys seem to anticipate.
---
This sounds fun, I'm interested! Though I am not exactly a 9-5er. More of a PhD student. So daily schedule and weekly workload will fluctuate.
---
I'd would, with no sarcasm, appreciate it if you'd elaborate. 
---
If my more detailed argument as a tailor/enchanter means being one of the first enchanters with any decent recipes (crusader, agility to weapon, etc.), tailoring meaning wands/cloth with spellpower contributing to being one of the first decent AoE farmers, how does being one of the first level 60 mages AoE farming and learning enchants not "establish a foothold in the economy"?
---
Did they? It's been real long time for me. I vaguely remember rushing past the front mobs of ZF.  
---
I like the info sharing anyway - I'm not sure I'll even clear BWL with a warrior though, tbh. I never got past 3 bosses into BWL during classic as one. So I'm probably going to stick to a much easier class, like a mage or warlock.
---
Probably being in IF for the first time, my PC i would use to play WoW on was the family PC and was a piece of shit like couldnt go into BGs and IF at all otherwise it would crash ( Had to get my friend to log in and get me out of IF and purchase what ever off the AH ) then one day i bought 256 of ram felt like Hackerman spent the next 3 hours running around IF and making an UD to check out UC.
---
Just play alliance lol
---
Lol i gotcha, i got my first job this summer but im still rolling pvp, i need a way to flex my no life right? Anyway ive seen hunter wpvp and it looks like a blast
---
I'm not trying to force her at all, I simply want to put her in the best position possible to enjoy it. She has expressed a willingness to play with me already, but i want to do what I can to make sure she enjoys it. 
---
Mostly its just that I know that the game can feel daunting to someone with very little gaming experience, so I'm trying to find a way to her get into it without it feeling overwhelming and also looking for ideas on classes she might enjoy.
---
I made an identical thread on r/muse.
---
PvP, Shamans are more pure healers in PvE, drop totems and chain heal spam
---
Ah, that's the one. Thanks! Thought it broke fear, too. Guess that was just the undead warriors - which was so useful!  
---
PoM was the instant case CD... (Working nights and was reading this stuff trying to stay awake at work).
---
I bought her a sub and left her to it (I helped when she got stuck) . I didn't convince her to play as much as the other people she met in the world did. 
---
Well.. almost every site and company you use online does anyway so does it matter much?
---
Once video games became popular they had to get closer to being a passive, no-risk experience, where you identify with the hero, feel all warm and fuzzy inside when everything magically works out, then turn it off and go to bed. You know, like TV or movies. I've had people tell me that they can't relax while playing games because it feels like "the outcome depends on them". Well no sh*t...
---
I've been playing since TBC, my first raid was LFR Dragon Soul. It got me into raiding, I don't know if I ever woulda had the confidence to attempt to get into raiding on my own because I hate being that guy that doesn't know anything and sucks. I hate LFR now... but I still think its necessary to introduce people and hook them, but I'll be honest it gives you too much confidence nowadays from what I've seen
---
I'm OK with them adding in an easy mode to most games, even though I do generally think of it as a waste of developer time, but for games like Sekiro, which is the center of the discussion here, what exactly is the point of an easy mode? The entire point of the game is the challenge of it. You don't take a helicopter to the top of Mount Everest - there's not really a point. You climb Mount Everest yourself, because the challenge is the point of the journey. It's the same with these games. If you remove the challenge or dumb it down, why are you even playing it? 
---
Eh I'd say Pallies are better, and way more popular with the PvP crowd. Get a geared warrior and add blessing of freedom....strongest PvP combination in the game.
---
Priests have that advantage of being offensive dispellers.
---
I did the same thing you're asking. I want to play a class that is good, but needed. I love tanking, but I joined Retro-WoW to practice Vanilla tanking. It is MUCH harder than it was when I started in WOTLK. I also tried healing, and it's not like now where there's one spell rank basically that upgrades with each level. You have to put multiple ranks of heals on your bar and know which ones to use at the right moment. Conserve mana and heal appropriately. It's tougher for sure, but tanks and heals are needed the most.
---
Here's how I got to my decision.
---
Step 1 - Admit to yourself what you're aiming to do when you get to 60, more PvE or PvP. In my case, I said PvP. I will do casual raids and pick up groups when available, but I don't have the time to commit to a raid guild. So I chose PvP.
---
Step 2 - What do you want to do in PvP? Do you want to be stealthy? Do you want to heal? Support? Burst? Be great in world PvP? Be great in group PvP? Be great in duels? And on the flip side, What do you want to do in PvE? Tank, heal, or DPS? I decided that for PvP I like to kill stuff. While I have played classes that support and heal and heals for BGs are extremely needed, I am not great at it, but I am great at killing stuff.
---
Step 3 - What class seems most interesting to not only level but play end game? For PvP, I narrowed down to 3 classes: Mage, Warrior, and Hunter. I leveled a Warlock and have done it all with him, so I don't want to do it again. Rogues aren't great in group PvP so they are out. The three playstyles I like the most are these 3. 
---
What did I ultimately decide? So far I'm about 98% on Hunter. I will play when I can. I am okay with not being top DPS min/max in raids if I go. Mages and Warriors will be overpopulated for PvE purposes, and in PvP, if you don't have the great gear for them, you are going to have a really rough time. Hunter though the playstyle appeals to me. I've always been a fan of bow and arrows in real life. I love what they can do. They are solid all around in all aspects of PvP. They are necessary in raids for tranq shot. And honestly I'm probably going to solo PvP a lot unless I can find a guild that does groups a lot, so Warrior is not the greatest choice since healers are almost always needed.
---
Really long post, I know. But this is how I decided what I wanted to play. Watch some videos, get some tips, see how the class you really like plays out in the environment you want to focus on, and go from there. You won't have a problem finding groups, you can always set them up to be honest. And if you find a leveling guild, you'll be bound to find a tank / healer at some point.
---
Hope it helps.
---
To each his own - that's a pretty good resume though! O.O
---
Yup - was posting while very tired...
---
I believe they were elite in front of WC. Its been a while for me too. I know there were at least a ton of mobs before the entrance and not being able to get there alone unless i was a rogue.
---
It was to deny people that would think that.  It might have been better to not even bring up the idea, but I know how people on the internet read into things that aren't there.
---
I love Orc Rogues. They look amazing in the gear in my opinion. Like thugs, with capes.
---
If it isn‚Äôt additive then it‚Äôs multiplicative so you still end up with &gt;36% resist lmao. Orc is the cr√®me de la cr√®me.
---
&gt; MC won't even be entered for the first month so why ship with it?
---
The most hardcore players will likely clear it within the first 2-3 weeks.
---
Troll is considered best because racial gives a nice threat advantage, but you said you're not a min/max player. Orc and Tauren are both nice too, depends what you like, Orcs have better axe skill and stun resist, Tauren have stomp and a little more health. Pick whichever you like more.
---
As for professions, it depends what you're looking for. If you want to enjoy enjoy professions while leveling, you can go with mining/smithing, which provide upgrades while leveling. If you want to focus on making money, you can go with mining/herbalism/skinning/enchanting while leveling. The gathering profs bring in mats and disenchanting greens can sometimes yield higher value mats than vendoring the greens.
---
Engineering is great in that it gives you unique, practical advantages, like grenades, but it's quite expensive to level and use.
---
When you're 60, it's nice to keep the gold-making profs when you're gearing up, you still go out farming and you still get stuff to disenchant. But you probably want to aim towards getting engineering eventually for the advantages.
---
I say....
---
play horde, level through same/close enough zones
---
when fellow alliance aren't helping her, or taking all her nodes, etc., you go gank them.
---
when fellow hordes aren't helping you, or taking all your nodes, etc., she (or you on her toon) goes to gank them
---
Teamwork baby.
---
But you're assuming that games need to please every demographic of player, which I don't think they should. Music shouldn't appease every single listener, films shouldn't appeal to every audience, and games shouldn't be intended for every type of player. I would even argue that when a given artform does try to appeal to everyone the end result is generally watered down and less enjoyable for all. If a player is bad or just wants to 'chill', then they should play an easy relaxed game.
---
A great example would be the Soulsborne series. I don't know if you're a fan, but I can guarantee you that 95% of the playerbase would agree that multiple difficulties would absolutely ruin the experience of those games on almost every level. From fragmenting multiplayer to eliminating the binary sense of 'did or didn't defeat x' to eliminating the sense of community that stems from knowing everyone went through the same shit. If Dark Souls were made to be accessible to everyone then it wouldn't be the special title that it is. It's like making an endgame raid accessible to lv1 players, it ruins what makes the endgame raid special.
---
Now if your only goal is to tell a story, then sure, add an easy mode that let's the game play itself. But video games are just that, games. They are a challenge to be overcome, and if it's a challenge made such that anyone can do it, then there's really no challenge and no real 'game' aspect at all. 
---
I've been playing in a house with three people on 12down 1up for about 15 years. Its absolutely fine for wow. We can watch netflix and play wow with no issues at all. The only problem came when we needed to download stuff and it took aaaaaages. Usually let stuff download over night.  To give an indication of latency I generally sat on 45-48 ms.  I just moved house last week and now have 100mbs fibre and the ping is down to 36-37 constantly. The change is barely noticable. The only difference is the ability to download anything anytime and I can now have 4 ppl streaming netflix in high res without noticing a change.
---
Divinity 2 has been me and my friend's multiplayer game of choice. If you're waiting for Classic with some buddies, I HIGHLY recommend it.
---
Granted it doesn't play like Classic, but its a damn near perfect turn-based RPG.
---
I'm pretty sure it did in vanilla, but it's been a long time, and I'd have to google it to be sure.  
---
The concept of using a faster weapon is mostly for rage dumping, so you're right about that. But if you can hit your target for, say, 50 damage every second, this is better than doing 100 damage every 2 seconds. This is because the rage awarded for damage done is applied sooner, possibly giving you what you need to apply your next sunder even just one second sooner - which can be a lifetime during a rage-starved threat race.
---
Found the guy who plays PvE
---
Bonus Points if someone tries to go from 1 - 60 killing nothing but boars in Classic
---
You get better gear from normal/heroics and the mechanics are different and fights harder. This silly hate for enabling more to experience the content but at the cost if worse gear is baffling to me. If you want the hardcore raid experience and the pug groups. It's still there. If anything the new group finder made pugging easier because you put yourself on a list for others to peruse to find the groups they want to join. You can only pug mythics and mythic+.
---
definitely does help, thank you.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be going pretty slow this time around.  Just don‚Äôt have the time to play like I did when I was in high school.
---
I think there will be a large population of players that will find themselves not having the same amount of time they used to though.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVmtay0OpSo) is a (bootleg/"archived") video of Drakova doing 1h holy/reckoning with deathbringer, and discussing the playstyle. Although the video focuses on facing hunters in duels, the strategy of preventing enemies from resetting and closing the gap while trying to outlast them persists in almost all matchups. He also discusses other weapon options.
---
1h holy reckoning is basically the best. Your job in pvp is healing, dispel/support, and damage absorption. This is a master of all of those and can then go in for a bit of burst without having to over-invest in mana and trinket gimmicks like a shockadin would.
---
2h holy reckoning is also powerful and will do fine in pugs and wpvp against average people, but isn't as good for pre-mades or against very good players because sustainability is what wins fights.
---
ret/reckoning (SoC) is basically just worse (and 1h is worse than 2h) because you are significantly worse at healing and surviving without getting significantly better at dealing damage, imo. And I think Drakova prefers holy reckoning too.
---
I was also torn on this, and I ended up choosing Orc despite really wanting Tauren. 
---
The Tauren hit box is larger, however the dead zone distance for hunters remains the same. So Tauren hunter dead zones start at a longer range than all other hunters. This means that an Orc hunter could shoot something that a Tauren hunter could not, because it‚Äôs too close. 
---
While this isn‚Äôt necessary a big deal in pve, it absolutely is for pvp and it‚Äôs why I decided to go Orc. With stun resist and pet damage it‚Äôs a really good ‚Äúfallback‚Äù race.

If you are a casual player, it isn't impossible to raid without a guild, but you may need to wait a while.  Eventually guilds will advertise to fill slots for content they already have on lockdown.  The catch to that is they often will charge or have gear reserved.
---
My favorite part is how the first letter of his name isn‚Äôt capitalized.

Or, rather than putting the 'constructive' in 'constructive criticism', you could just down-vote from the shadows?  
---
:P
---
PvP because we did PvE in vanilla and always kinda felt like the juice woulda been worth the squeeze to go PvP. 
---
It all boils down to preference.  You're going to be putting in many hours on your character so choosing what you look like and lore background are the most important measures.
---
Decent comparison video -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj8\_Uiu5OkY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj8_Uiu5OkY) 
---
spell power makes you worse at aoe for the most part.
---
Wish you all the best on your LFG. 
---
But I would love to hear your r14 story. With grinding yourself you mean you were still part of a premade with allocated slots and such or did you actually did all solo?! Cheers.
---
Why can‚Äôt people understand there are hardcore guilds and casual guilds. OP if you don‚Äôt want to raid with meme specs, that‚Äôs fine...join a hardcore guild and your wish is granted.
---
But if someone wants to play a meme spec they will join a casual guild, and it doesn‚Äôt affect you at all. So stop complaining about literally nothing.
---
You mean the 1.8 buff to 1h? Because while 1.12 DW damage was definitely improved, it still required a lot of +hit, which for any ring, neck or trinket was almost always highly contested by rogues/hunters/shamans/ret pallies/druids/someguynamedjoe... also 1h weapons almost always went exclusively to tanks or rogues. So gearing up a fury warrior is (was) a frustrating, time consuming and most serious process. And while some guilds may have had one or two guys they were willing to gear up, it usually came at the cost of losing serious players to better guilds.  
---
This isn't going to (shouldn't) be like pservers, where hit caps and boss tables have been modified, or loot tables are more forgiving/plentiful, or you can find a raid nearly every day for anything you want... the original grind (including 1.12) was not condusive to utilizing a DPS warrior. And if that has changed, it's nothing like vanilla.
---
Show of hands who already knew that the dwarven warrior's name was somehow 'hammerfall.'
---
Not 'Hammerfall,' 'hammerfall.'
---
I got the PTO, gimme that bug mount!
---
Looks about right, everyone's dead.  I'm trying really hard to figure out what zone that is...
---
Also, is it possible to have the first letter in your name lowercase? 
---
&gt; Assholes would roll need on shit they clearly didn't need to disenchant or vendor
---
Or to trade to other assholes who'd also rolled on items they didn't need in case an asshole rolled on an item they needed. 4.3 was such a shitshow that many LFRs had 5-10+ people rolling on *every* item and, often, gathering at the end of the dungeon and linking the item in chat to offer it for trade. 
---
So then I had to start doing that too or get cheated by it. I hated doing that. 
---
if you want to play a not ready version check out a pserver. there's a fresh one rn..
---
You're right. I was tired.
---
Don't underestimate how difficult it is when you don't have a single well geared person in the raid. Don't get me wrong, it won't stand long, no raid will, but 2-3 weeks is still far too short an amount of time.
---
Yeah, I understood the process, but now I understand what I was missing.  To me, 1000g per month in Classic is one of the furthest things from casual I could think of.  Even if you are just saying it for an example, even 500-600g per month sounds somewhat crazy to me.  So I was wondering why someone would put in so much effort to farm Classic gold to trade for Live gold instead of just playing Live WoW itself for gold.
---
Then again, now I see how that brings your second point into consideration: exchange rates.  If someone is really willing to spend that much real-life money for Live Gold in order to trade for however much Classic gold, then it's fair to say that it may become more efficient to spend time farming gold in Classic to gain Live gold than just playing Live WoW.
---
That's rather incredible to me people would do that very much, but I know that's just the internet, and I shouldn't be surprised.  There really is always someone, bleh.  And yeah, I know the idea of, "if the community is just "good" enough then it won't happen," is a little ridiculous.  The internet's a great place and also a pile of shit simultaneously, lol.
---
They are both similar - pick the one you prefer the look of :)
---
Both races can train both guns and bows. 
---
The answer to LFR was always to have it one raid behind. When it was released in 4.3 it should have been Firelands, not Dragon Soul. 
---
It's been done on private servers with ease in that timeframe, with people not even at max level in the raid.
---
Yup. That sums it up nicely. And tbh, if that has changed "because we have more information" I will actually be a little surprised.  
---
I actually expect that if classic is anything like vanilla, most people will realize that playing a warrior on a pserver is nothing like vanilla used to be, and I really hope that is the case.
---
Annnnnd i‚Äôm an idiot, thought we were on the WoW sub. My apologies!
---
&gt; I'm all for as many different difficulties as the developers want to provide.
---
That's the catch. "Gaming" journalists are notoriously bad at games and this is an example where the idea behind the game is to have its difficulty be where it is at and making the game easier completely changed the experience the devs want the players to have.
---
The 'get rage sooner' argument doesn't hold up when you look at the entire fight, and track how rage is generated from the first swing.
---
Also, if you can't convert every white hit to a heroic strike then slower is better. With limited rage, a greater % of your white hits get converted to yellows with a slower weapon. This is important because yellows can't be glancing blows.
---
As someone planning on rolling a warrior, gimmie dat green pill.
---
Having full HWL gear while everyone else is still in greens and maybe 1-2 blues and still has a missing second trinket and all?
---
Oh yeah.
---
I hope for a completely new old school style mmorpg before I freaking die of old age.
---
As much as I love classic wow I would much rather have a brand new tougher, more in depth and much more dangerous game.   More along the lines of ultima online / eve online.   Skill based and ruthless pvp.
---
I had made a lot of friends leveling and in PVP, I found healers that realized when they healed me we tended to win and they tended to live longer. 
---
 That grew into premades of friends with like minded interests in pvp and ranking up.  It was never as difficult as some servers with the politics and such. I was ranking up every week and people took note and wanted to play with me, so we in turn ranked up together. 
---
The server I played on was very young, I ‚ÄúOnly‚Äù had to pvp for 10-13 hours a day for the grind.  It wasn‚Äôt too bad to do solo when you had just graduated high school and not yet in college. Man I miss summer vacations.

is basically as good as warden staff. good option to save 200-300g
---
&gt; There is also a big thing in France around preserving the integrity of the French language as a matter of pride, which I sort of understand, but they take it too far. The Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in particular consider themselves as the "official custodians of the French language" creating their own versions of words like Internet and Sandwich to "preserve the integrity of the language"
---
This always makes me chuckle a bit. 
---
The differences are minor unless you choose to PvP primarily or min/max PvE. So what context are you asking?

I like this idea - seems like it could preserve named characters by allowing new characters to be created in alternate servers, without allowing them to use named already in use on the primary server. Then when the population dwindles down, the two are shared, and eventually the portal is "shut off" which means less work for everyone and no stupid "George - Haka'ar" names running around...
---
I always see these comments, yet the hardest raid content is only cleared by a miniscule portion of the player base.
---
And it's not just the "no-lifers" who attempt to.  A lot of players both try and fail.
---
Grinding dungeons is NEVER faster than efficient solo grinding, if you play well you should rarely if ever go OOM, you can heal 5 mans in any spec. This guy has no idea what he's talking about.

Southern Barens, Near where Mankirks wife died so most likely picked a fight with the Quillboar or Alliance scout NPC's.

Cue the "I would but I don't have the time" comment.

Hi, I spent the last 2 days ganking in the 20s with an orc rogue and I learned to just not fuck with dwarf rogues. This is only somewhat useful because most of this PvP is before you get cheap shot but still. Not being able to poison or bleed is pretty big. They can cripple you and you can‚Äôt cripple them so they can easily kite orcs outside of stuns. 
---
It won't take long for pug raids to open up.  Even new raiding guilds will take in a few extras just to fill the gaps.  If you show you know your class and the raid mechanics you can get on the list of decent pug invites.
---
Actually getting gear from them though may be problematic.  
---
Easy rank 14.
---
Ah, this makes even more sense now...
---
Back in early Vanilla you could change stances while dead as a warrior.
---
LFR offers a soft raiding experience to get people to familiar with mechanics, normal and heroic are more challenging, sometimes even having more mechanics than LFR to be sure there's more of a challenge, and mythics are even harder, with mythic+ being more of a difficult challenge mode with increasing difficulty the higher you get your keystone. To me, there's quite a bit to do in the game, and that's not including world quests, war fronts, island expeditions and a few other things I'm forgetting.
---
I get that for blizzard. Can go O.o.M. from channeling it. I've run a mage before, though, and unless I'm mis-remembering, frost nova + cone of cold shatter wasn't as intensive. Also didn't plan on taking Frozen Wrath suffix gear with no stam/int like a full glass cannon, but I can understand how it could read that way. No one asked me my spec and pre-BiS, though, and so I figured less was more until asked otherwise.
---
Nice, Dawnbreakers decided to focus on their PVP side of the shop for the last bit of Vanilla when we finished Battleguard Satura or whatever her name is in AQ40.
---
They had 8-9 Grand Marshalls in the guild with their efforts if I remember correctly.
---
Is is Necessary to be in a guild to raid In classic?
---
In WoW % increases often work this way. Crit, hit etc. 
---
The % increases to stun resist in warrior prot talents is clearly additive. So Hardiness should work the same way. 5%+25%
---
My brother is rolling a warlock and im going to roll either a priest or a paladin. Which class do you think synergies better with the warlock? 
---
B. Gank wife in game.
---
That's what I'm gonna do
---
Private servers aren't the same. As much as they like to be sold as "the same", they just aren't. There are way too many variables.
---
The world record of 1-60 is 5 days /played. Even if you play 12 hours a day for 10 days, you've already eaten through half of your expected "2-3 week" timeline.
---
Nope.  All of the box art pictures were taken about a year before release, IIRC.
---
I disagree with this and I think you're saying what *seems* logical to you on a personal level. We see in the population charts that LFG's introduction in WotLK and LFR's introduction in Cata [did not boost subscriptions](https://imgur.com/jmj21EG). 
---
I'm sure there were shifts in player demographics because of these changes, where people left in disgust and were replaced with people who appreciated these new systems. We can't *know* that this desire to "appeal to a new audience" was good or bad but we do know that, when the game expected the most out of its players, it drew people in like flies to shit. 
---
True, but early on, it's not a problem, especially if you are undergeared and progressing quickly. Then rage generation isn't an issue because you're taking so much damage, and a little extra dodge may save a wipe. Or several.
---
MC, Onyxia, ZG and AQ20 is very easy content and there will be plenty of pug groups going every week. 
---
BWL is a lot harder to pug but still doable, you just need to wait till most guilds have it on farm status before you see pugs going. 
---
AQ40 and Naxx are not really pug-able. Too big of a gear check and there‚Äôs real tactics involved for most boss fights.  
---
Druids are awesome
---
My wife was a big fan of Groot. So I had a GM free up the name and made her a treant healer.

The thing I loved about Vanilla was being able to grind most anything when you wanted for as long as you wanted for not much opportunity cost.
---
Dailies made it a constant daily thing, I want to play 3 days a week for a long time, I get fucked unless I log in 7 days a week... no thanks.
---
Trick her. Ask for help getting started on a character and it's just a temporary thing. Pick out a race she likes and then you're good to go.
---
I think a lot of TBC‚Äôs changes to classes, making almost all specs viable instead of a lot of meme specs like Prot Pally, Boomkin, Enhancement, or Arcane for example, is definitely needed. IDK if I want the TBC content though.
---
The best part about vanilla wow was you didn‚Äôt need real life friends to enjoy it. I made dozens of wow friends, more fun to play with than the real life guys.
---
We apparently had very different experiences 
---
There was this hunter on Frostwolf named Tony P.   Guy was a murderer
---
0 Frost resistance as a dwarf too
---
Even if they aren't exactly the same, they are not far off.
---
&gt; The world record of 1-60 is 5 days /played.
---
People have definitely done it faster than that.
---
&gt; Even if you play 12 hours a day for 10 days
---
These are rookie numbers for the most hardcore players. They're going to be playing 20+ hours a day. They'll hit 60 after about a week, and chain run level 60 dungeons and hit MC at the end of the second reset.
---
Kinda seems like you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
On ClassicDB, the data for Hardiness is: &gt; (6) Apply Aura #117: Mod Mechanic Resistance (12)
---
Value: 25
---
The data for Rank 5 Iron Will talent includes: &gt; (6) Apply Aura #117: Mod Mechanic Resistance (12)
---
Value: 15
---
On a TBC database, the data for [Hardiness](https://db.excalibur.ws/?spell=20573) is &gt; (6) Apply Aura #117: Mod Mechanic Resistance % (Stunned)
---
These "mods" are always additive.  It can't be made any clearer.  However, I'm pretty sure the base chance to resist would be 5% if there even is a base chance to resist stuns or any CC category itself, something I'm suspect of.  I don't know where 15% comes from, but it's possible that no serious PVPer would think of going without Iron Will or equivalent talent if available, so maybe that's it.
---
Yeah healing on my priest was a blast.  Some people complain it's like whack-a-mole and you're just healing bars when they go down, but you can be a better healer if you instead learn and understand the situation at hand, predict where damage is going to occur, and prepare your heals before the bars go down. Priests' flash heal spell is their least efficient, and they're best when they can throw low cost normal heals and long-cast big heals when they can be utilized. It's a lot of fun when you get the hang of it and understand all the healing and efficiency you're doing, and when shit goes down and you're good enough to throw a ton of heals left and right and save the day, it's the best feeling ever. 
---
Thanks for the reply! I guess it‚Äôs good for you that most alliance play human for aesthetic and PVE purposes instead! 
---
I actually finished Divinity Enhanced Edition with my girlfriend the other day after 3 years of sporadic playing. How does Divinity 2 stand to the first game?
---
Peon.
---
You just need two characters.  A main with her and a main for you.  I‚Äôm a nonrecovering altaholic so maybe a normal person wouldn‚Äôt go for this.
---
The random PVP fights on that island were a lot of fun (as a PVP server fellow who was tired of being dive bombed out of the blue from the sky in TBC).
---
I need to correct you. You can‚Äôt be ‚Äútoo stoned.‚Äù 
---
If you ever think you‚Äôre too high you need to take another hit. Always worked for me. Haven‚Äôt smoked in about 6 years but when I did I went hard. 
---
Leveling anything is bad...and repetitive. Priest for example you'll do the same shit over and over and over and over and over again until 60. Blast dot, wand wand wand wand wand wand wand. Warrior - charge, smash smash and hope you don't die, eat...repeat.
---
I'm exaggerating a little...and there's a little truth to it.  The question is: DO YOU think it's bad. I don't think pally leveling is THAT BAD. It's simple and not as fun as a druid, but you are nice and steady and at 60 you'll be KING SHIT PVP HEALER with the ability to cleanse EVERYTHING except curses, Bubble for 12 sec without a care in the world, oh...you're almost dead after that? Hahaha Lay on Hands. Mana running low? Blessing of Wisdom, Seal of Wisdom, Judge Wisdom, mana comes back.
---
It's a fucking great class and leveling is just leveling.
---
I'm the one who has no idea what I'm talking about and you're over here spouting numbers that are just impossible.
---
I don't think you know how reality works.
---
paladin. wisdom buffs on your brother + might or kings buff on his demons is super good. you both also get free mounts at 40 and stay on par with each other
---
Anyone from mal'ganis US remember the name of the tyrs hand gold farmer? He was pretty infamous for a time. People worked out that there was a day shift player and a night shift player. The day shift guy was an asshole, but the night guy was awesome. I think he actually liked the game despite having to farm 12 hours a day, every day. He would occasionally join in with PvP and I heard a rumour that one of the more advanced guilds took him on as a sort of mascot. Even brought him into some raids and got him geared up. 
---
Because every time they release a new patch it devalues all your effort from the previous patch. Used to be an order to endgame dungeon grind for pre raid bis and then work your way up the raid tiers. Gear doesn‚Äôt matter in bfa cause if you get behind fuck it you‚Äôll catch up next patch from lfr. This used to really only happen between expansions now it‚Äôs gear resets every patch and fucking obnoxious. 
---
Exactly what i thought. The priest increases shadow damage though, which makes me still consider this class.
---
Eh, by the time a new LFR wing drops I usually fully outgear it, so I don't do LFR. Doesn't affect me if someone wants to though. The $15 of someone who pushes for world firsts every patch is the same as the $15 of the person who just got their first max level character and has never set foot in a raid. It's a business move. But I do hope that they will keep Classic, well, classic.
---
How did I never notice that. Nice. 
---
Warlocks are mushrooms
---
 Base chance to resist stun = 5% which goes down 0% if rogue has 5% hit. Orc racial was additive along with talents to resist stuns as well. Iron Will (warrior talent) Increases chance to resist Resist Stun and Charm effects by 15%. So Orc Warriors with Iron Will had over 40% stun resist. It rly was 25-30% stun resist for Orcs... I played vanilla for over a year /played as an Orc rogue from 2004-2006.  
---
Although you can still dodge/parry certain stuns, but if the rogue has 5% hit and kidney shots you from directly in the back you will get stunned 100% no matter what (cheapshot cannot be dodged/parried/blocked). There are pro tricks to dodge/parry attacks from behind (such as backstab) even if the person is behind you... such as strafe running (ur char will be running forward but his head will be facing to the left or right as if he/she is looking behind) which will take you hundreds of hours of practice to adapt into ur play-style.  
---
You can only negate the base 5% stun resist with hit chance. Everything Else remains the same.
---
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Orc has 30% stun resist vs someone with 0% hit.
---
Orc has 25% Stun resist vs someone with 5 - infinity% hit.
---
Orc warrior with Iron Will has 45% stun resist vs someone with 0% hit.
---
Orc warrior with Iron Will has 40% Stun resist vs someone with 5 - infinity% hit.
---
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
You will never see a Cheapshot/Kidney shot miss because every1 alrdy has a base chance of 5% stun resist. You will also need atleast 5% hit to not miss your abilities in PvP. GLHF
---
I dont get the hate for LFR on live most people ignore why people like me use it*.  Myself, I use it because I can no longer commit to a regular organized raiding schedule.  I dont use it because it's easy or a loot pinata.  It's literally the only way I can raid on limited time.
---
*should be "used" past tense as BfA has finally killed my passion for live.  Also want to clarify that I dont think LFD/LFR shoukd be in Classic and I can't wait for the leveling world to be relevant again. 
---
For me it was the video trailer they released with vanilla , the scene where the dwarf hunter is on a snowy peak with his pet ! I thought it was so epic that I said I'm going to be an explorer in the game when it came out!!( I was 12 or 13 lol) .
---
also something important to know about priests it that they can heal dungeons in shadow spec until about level 52 or so. so you dont have to worry about leveling too much
---
In all fairness to LFR DS, 1 boss had more mechanics than most raids.
---
RPPvP however if we don‚Äôt get those then I‚Äôll be on a PvP server.
---
Damn. LCD monitor in 2006? Someone's family owned a new computer!
---
...holy shit your English must have been quite "interesting" if you played Horde, lol
---
Jokes aside, that's awesome!!! 
---
But you only learn "Wtf nub" "kthx" "wtb Elementium Ore" LFG" "LFM" "wipe it" "moar dps" etc...:)    none of it is proper English 
---
They do not.
---
Dwarves have the edge due to their racial. That definitely will come in handy when it comes to PvP. Bows and guns will come down to a preference essentially. I myself liked guns, but that was me being stubborn about the lore behind them. Dwarves are a pretty solid bet for any class. 
---
Mechanics don‚Äôt equal satisfaction source I found BC heroics more fun than any +10 mythic dungeon...
---
Intuitive is not the same as efficient for a high end user though. I would say the UI works pretty good for levels 1-30 or so for most classes, then it starts to spiral out of control...
---

Well basically the problem here is you want to play horde and your wife wants to play alliance. So what alliance race are you playing?
---
I agree with this but I only got to level 12. Had to stop. But it's cool because everyone else will be a Mage instead. I'm more of a melee guy.
---
Yeah, what is Mr. T up to nowadays?
---
You mean chores?
---
But all those years I was busy living. Now my life is a black pit of deep desire to kill gnomes in STV.
---
What if they make them in new graphics and shift them to old graphics instead?
---
This sounds very slightly familiar to me too, but all I could find was a 1.5 patch note that said
---
&gt; Hardiness (Orc Racial) - Fixed a bug that caused many abilities to ignore the additional resistance.
---
So I guess that's all it was?  But 1.5 was June 7, 2005, relatively early on in Classic, although everything felt so much longer back then.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs said anything that‚Äôs impossible. Your only real point has been that private servers may differ slightly from retail, but that doesn‚Äôt really change any of his points, all of which are pretty accurate. 
---
I see this mentioned a lot. But I don‚Äôt really understand it. It‚Äôs true an LFR piece can titanforge. But a person raiding heroic is always gonna be more geared than a person raising LFR because Titanforging it rare. So a LFR raider might have one titanforge piece, but a H raider is going g to have several pieces that are 30 ilvls higher. 
---
Currently an LFR piece would have to forge 30 levels just to be equal to H gear. I‚Äôm not even sure if that possible.  Most I‚Äôve seen is 25. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying LFR and/or titanforging is awesome. I just don‚Äôt that casuals rarely getting good gear is necessarily game breaking. 
---
Just googled a bit and found out that flatscreens became the more sold option in 2003, so I don't think we were that fresh

Vanillas so easy that‚Äôs why we wipe in ZG to mistakes. Wipe in dungeons because of accidental pulls. Also I don‚Äôt think mechanics on top of mechanics is as fun or as satisfying as getting 40 people to work together to kill ragnaros or ony. 
---
Hi
---
If it was mutiplicative then it would be the 18.75% figure assuming a 15% base lol. 
---
It's not an option on reddit. strawpole.com ya dolt
---
LFR gear is the same amount worse than normal gear as the diff between normal and heroic, and heroic and mythic. 
---
Awesome pic xd 
---
Now I want to play dwarf D:
---
Ma'lady...
---
No they aren't.
---
The world record /played to 60 on a fresh realm is 5 days. 
---
Everything that comes after ignoring this fact is complete horse-shit.
---
I mean, really though...how has that ruined raiding?  To get gear anywhere near the top level, the achievements, mounts, satisfaction, etc you still have to raid with a group, and especially on the hardest level youre almost certainly not pugging it.
---
How the hell did LFR ruin hardcore/progression raiding?
---
Is it boring for 'good' players?  Sure.  Is it semi pointless because you can get gear from other things (especially these days)?  Of course.
---
It just doesnt impede heroic/mythic progression in any way, shape or form, though.
---
I get peoples complaints about the dungeon finder, but LFR specifically is a pretty silly thing to complain about.
---
Which is what they introduced M+, presumably 
---
I think you meant:
---
Orc Rogue
---
Orc Hunter
---
Orc Shamam
---
Orc Warlock
---
Orc Warrior
---
Ma'lady
---
Cracking a cold on eh
---
Good god, you shamed him into deleting his comment. Savage.
---
Nah really man. You are vastly underestimating the type of nerds we are dealing with here. Typical /played time to 60 for the people who hit it first is more like 3 days now. And yes that will be pretty much 3 days straight.  Ragnaros will be killed the first lockout he is available, as will every other boss.  We arent talking about a bunch of random adventures from 2004 here, we are talking about people who have lived this fresh server classic experience  plenty of times already. Sorry to kill your buzz but content gets smashed these days. MC isn't the grand mysterious dungeon it used to be(unless you are in a trash progression guild which are still out there). MC gets ran in 45 minutes and is mostly a chore save for a few pieces of od tier loot.
---
Acksuwally....there is no rp pvp

 Lol, yes got it, ty

Meld is pretty handy for bgs especially premades as well.

Auldlangsyn does exactly that.
---
I seem to remember playing diablo 2 on a LCD before getting WoW so you are probably right.  We definitely did upgrade sometime before WoW was released.
---
I absolutely hated managing a pet. With warrior, you just charge in and fight. Use your meats to level cooking instead of keeping a pet happy.
---
I very much enjoyed being a warrior.
---
Way to miss every point.
---
And have any legitimate chance if getting fear? Yes... Yes you will.
---
Yeah, i havent run shit for LFR in a few xpacs now....and even then it was almost exclusively on alts.  I may run it on my horde priest now to finish off a quest, but thats it.
---
I say that as someone thats in a pretty crummy guild, too.  We havent completely cleared normal, and i have...one? boss down on heroic.  I still dont really need to run LFR (for gear), and if i do run it its simply to see a fight because im not going to be doing it with guild, and frankly dont have the time/ambition to try to find a pug.
---
The fun parts is my friends used to roll on everything is hunter could equip, his bag and bank were full of green blue just in case the meta shift and hunter now need mp5 or full strenght or spirit
---
I‚Äôve played on Vanilla PvP servers recently, and it solidifies my dislike of them. The rare adrenaline rush you get by a battle of equals in an unexpected place is drowned out by the multitude of people that have nothing better to do than to waste hours of your time.  
---
I‚Äôll be playing on PvE.
---
Fun trivia: According to the author of the WoW Bible in his public appearances to promote the book, the Horde-Alliance war and PvP almost didn‚Äôt happen. Everquest made PvP synonymous with grieving and it took an effort of developers to argue for it in WoW.  
---
Came for the username, stayed for the truth.
---
Dorf is better for rogue v rogue matchup but orc is better all around
---
If mechanics dont matter as long as people are having fun then I guess there's no need for this post in the first place
---
You are basically doing what 'they' are doing: pointing fingers and saying "YOU'RE NO GOOD!"
---
Just stop it already. Let people raid with 40 paladins, tanks/healers/dps if they want. Mind your own business, your own guild and get on with your life. And likewise, people into meme-specs, stop attacking the min/max'ers. Let them do their thing, and you do yours. Children.
---
You won‚Äôt ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô next patch from LFR, because LFR is always the lowest gear for the *current* patch.  You‚Äôll still be behind in the *current* content. 
---
The game has tons of issues. Tons. 
---
But if you want challenging content, it is definitely still there. 
---
All dead like little nublits you all are....love it
---
I'm Chris Hanson, have a seat. 
---
Not all games are for all people. Neutering someone's art to widen the demographic is not ok.
---
Yeah, im quite impatient, but the later the better for me.  I get 5ish months of nice weather per year, i want to be able to enjoy it....and then no life wow for the other 7.
---
Green pill, easily. All the other options are either guaranteed or easily available (just smooch the boss).
---
I don‚Äôt agree. I feel like although the communication problem is worse in dungeon finder, it‚Äôs still shitty in LFR. In LFR the only person talking is the raid leader. It doesn‚Äôt impede progression at higher levels but I feel like it completely ruins immersion and decrease fun for newer players. You can literally stand still and do nothing and as long as half the raid is not afk kill the boss. It takes no organization or skill and can be confusing for newer players, especially when no one is talking. It has little to do with how it effects higher tiered progression, because it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs not the argument. It‚Äôs such a terrible experience and contributes to how boring the game is. If it‚Äôs that easy to kill a boss and there‚Äôs no reason to try, it starts just feeling like a chore with little to no payoff after killing the boss. There is no challenge to surpass. It fucking sucks.
---
I'll give you 2 weeks pay for a rank 14. #sadbuttrue
---
Most dedicated hardcore guilds will probably clear MC before the first reset.
---
You can level a Hunter in under 4 days /played nowdays. Lvl 60 players help other players by mobtagging so even a warrior should be lvl 60 in 5 days.
---
2 groups run dungeons nonstop to equip the tanks. A couple people make the Hydraxian quests. 3-4 people only make fire resistance pots and elixirs/enchants.
---
MC is all about preparation, encounters are a cakewalk even with bad gear.
---
Just caught me at my worst, I swear
---
I use to have the time of my life doing Quel'Danas dailies for my older brother. Killing the demons and the naga, and the bombing run daily. Ahhhhhh good memories.

Ironically, your own bias.
---
Taught me directions as a kid, north, east, south, west.
---
If she wasn't a vanilla player, she might not even like classic and quit it halfway. Different faction also means you don't have to carry her all the time etc. Strongly recommend you stay true to your heart and play horde. Lok'tar ogar. For the horde.
---
No one is going to spend 350 usd on an MC run when they can spend less than 350 gold.
---
I approve of this message. 
---
I'm faction switching to Horde so I can experience more different things for the first time. Gimmie da totems.
---
Not much research required. Just duel an orc and stun them a bunch of times until you get a statistically significant resist percentage.
---
On pservers there is a way bigger culture of pugging raids than there was in vanilla. Even through bwl. It all depends on if you have someone who raid leads their own weekly pug. Which there will be because its insanely profitable to host pug raids when you keep all the boes and mats.
---
Is rogue actually slower than paladin?
---
Even the worst race/class for pve/pve is very marginal compared to the best. Worst being maybe... gnome warlock? compared to say, orc warlock?
---
Maybe troll rogue (pvp) versus orc/UD rogue
---
People say it because they have no other arguement.
---
I have a son, and he is at that age where if he sees another kid playing with one of his toys he loses his shit, even if he isn't playing with it himself. God forbid we try to give away any of his older toys to other children.

Robert's Rebellio---- Your life was built on a lie.

The guy is in Dun Morogh with Teebu's equipped attacking what appears to be the level 13(?) elite Yeti walking around in a mountain pass. This scenario has never taken place in the real game.

THATS MY FUTURE GUILD MASTER GUYS!!!! 
---
yea whats this dude on about
---
My counter point here is that an easy mode provides an accessable entry point for people who would otherwise be unable to enjoy a game because of the difficulty scale for any number of factors. Nothing is lost by adding an easy mode and in fact more is gained by adding to a larger fan base. 
---
The harder difficulties still remain to challenge and push you and that is not diminished but instead enhanced by a potential larger base of players who can enjoy it which means a better formed community. 
---
Furthermore if we applied this logic to say basketball then you can make two claims. 1) any child that can't make 10/10 free throws by age 6 will never be able to play professionally, and 2) professionals do not need to practice and are always at peak performance. The fact is those are both demonstrably not true. 
---
The fact is all gatekeeping a game like this does is breed discontent and elitism by splintering off a majority from experiencing the content first hand.

When you hear the people who made the game say:
---
 "...The intent was always get everyone to be able to play their spec in the place that they wanna play it and have it be viable and competitive..."
---
What do you think about that?
---
Do you still want no changes because its "your" vanilla experience, and the developers intentions be damned?
---
Do you still want no changes because the dev's didn't get around to fixing balance by 1.12? even though they wanted to.
---
Or something else?
---
It's clear the creators wanted a balanced game, why don't you? 
---
I know what you mean. It's a hard one to pass up. I only made rank7 on my Hunter before they patched ranks out. I just live happy in the knowledge that I will have time to do get at least rank 12 this time (I still plan on raiding more than PvP)
---
Yup. I actually like this idea.
---
Dangit, now I have no idea what to do...
---
Nice shifting goalposts 
---
The only part I do agree with is the real endgame content
---
Nax60 was for example only visited by the 1% of the playerbase.  Same with Sunwell plateau in TBC.  
---
I would like more ppl to visit the instance and get a feel for it.  Hell even make the drops blue is fine and tune it around ZG level ;)  I just want more ppl to be able to see the zone and it‚Äôs fantastic work.  
---
21/f I started playing in vanilla because of my older brother who is now 27. We can‚Äôt wait!
---
Repair that armor bud whatya doin 
---
I've heard that having a lower server pop will help reduce world buffs?
---
It's because the Hunter and Warlock get pets, isn't it
---
If you want difficulty content it‚Äôs still there. Mythic raiding is hard. A tiny fraction of the player base even attempts it. 
---
Pushing M+ keys is hard at high levels. 
---
No it's not. The world record in 2006 was 4 days 21 hours by joanna. Since then he has cut that down to 3 days 22 hours. Now I know those kind of speeds arent gonna be the same as launch with more competition for xp but you are underestimating the hardcore vanilla crowd. People will play 20 hours a day for a week straight to hit 60. They roll as a group of 30 or more players at a time and just group with the first random people eligible to clear mc as soon as possible. Every server might not clear mc in the first 3 weeks but several will. 
---
A lot of my friends felt that goblins should've been released as the new horde race, back when TBC was first released. This actually made a ton of sense - and I think blood elves being alliance would've made more sense than the Drenai, as a playable race.
---
I even had to up-vote this comment.
---
I've been playing Outward. It feels like an old school DnD game. You need food/shelter/supplies. Magic is a sacrifice of your permanent health/stamina. You have to find or buy spells. It's a punishing game and l enjoy it.
---
He of all people, as someone that raided on the very high end, should appreciate that while LFR has no functional use to those of us that actually raid we've benefited greatly from the inclusion of it. The amount of resources that they've put into raiding since adding LFR is amazing. As someone who raided in Vanilla all the way up to modern WoW I have no reason to ever set foot in LFR but I'm glad it exists so that we don't get shit tiers like rehashed Naxx, ToC, or "lol 100% reused assets on a flat platform Firelands." - And I'm not really sure that he, of all people, can say that LFR "ruined the game." because he's been playing it for most of a decade since they added it. 
---
I saw that OP was diggin the patriotic RP and i went all in
---
I'm with you. I'm planning two weeks off for it anyway, but a bonus two weeks that I don't have to earn is awesome.
---
Would you stay shadow at 60 though? 
---
I could pvp at 60 but i still didnt decide
---
Ah yes the old because it has mechanics it‚Äôs challenging argument. Personally I found mythic plus became tedious after hitting the top 25% of DK tanks and rank 12 on my realm I just couldn‚Äôt continue running same dungeons on higher difficulties for the same gear at higher numbers.  I also find affixes to be less fun than requiring strategic pulls with cc because if you don‚Äôt your going to die. I do aknowledge modern wow is mechanically harder it‚Äôs also infinitely less satisfying to me personally. Also in higher mythical it got close to feeling like heroics from BC but again I never found affixes fun or hard just tedious. 
---
fair enough but i am doubt the spellpower will do more than shave off 1 arcane explosion. Also if a few mobs aren't crit the shatter doesnt save time. I think by the time you get gear with enough SP it's going to be items like Pre-BiS etc.
---
Just want to make a friendly pointer that bow spec is really only relevant to leveling (if you happen to be using a bow) and Rhok'delar at 60, which is the bow a raider would be using from the end of MC until Chrommy. All other good ranged options at 60 are pretty much crossbows.
---
Personally I will be going Orc hunter, and that is 90% based on that I like their look much better than Tauren/Troll. The fact that their racials are pretty damn good for hunters, especially in pvp, is just a bonus.
---
Still got plenty of time to decide! I guess you will need to weigh the pros and cons and determine your playstyle :) shadow pvp is vastly different to a paladin. 
---
And how much of that was hype? How much of the lack of new players coming in as old players left was because the game was bad and how much was because the game was old? I can't imagine that anyone actually quit WoW simply because LFR exists. It's not like it replaced anything for anyone that was already doing the content. The content was still there, and the high end raid content has only gotten better since they added LFR for the casuals. 
---
Priests only buff shadow damage with shadow weaving 
---
You're right.. I must have had some kind of nightmare... Deep down, I knew the pandas weren't real. I never wanted to believe they were, I just thought I had to.
---
Based on your calculations, it sounds like a good idea is to respec to Shockadin at 50, not at 40?
---
I'm not AoE farming before 60. I'm just looking to get my Faxmonkey on and gather up a dozen melee mobs, ice block, frost nova, and flamestrike/cone-of-cold their asses like the olden days, even if it's BRD/Scholo gear.
---
PTO without a doubt 
---
Get out.
---
Ventrilo with those classic push to talk noises
---
Lol, too true
---
All of these rank14 choices are making me rethink my blue pill choice (still would love it to drop right now). But yeah, I am unlikely to hit Rank14 by myself, and maybe only if I get in a good guild with a PvP focus!
---
What do you do that affords your $600 a month and enough time to level 40 characters to 60 in 6 months?
---
I also like the "Zoom-able mini-map makes navigation simple." tidbit.
---
As an orc rogue with stun resist meta gem, facing other rogues was pretty fun
---
For these purposes you have my blessing.
---
Agree madseason and frostadamus are the best.
---
They announced reckoning will not work like before,  those builds will not be as good anymore come classic.  
---
Here we will remove your pants and underwear revealing your beautiful nude body.
---
Imagine openly admitting that you played alliance.
---
What does any of that have to do with my comment tho? 
---
Can't say honestly as I have not played the first.
---
According to some rudimentary research I did comparing the two however, I'm sure you'll have a blast! Though if you just finished the first, perhaps wait a little to not suffer RPG fatigue.
---
I was always a fan of the "ghetto hearth" - running into a dungeon with a group, leaving, then it kicking you out via hearthstone tele. I definitely remember doing this in BC, not sure if it was in vanilla, though. 
---
Pomfpomf
---
Level 1, rogues have sinister strike. When the servers are opened and starting areas flooded. The mobs you need to kill for the first few quests will have 20+ people around their corpses, rogues are the only class that can instantly tag them.
---
The hunter is shooting too.
---
We should get some famine or war or something going. Should take out mind off classic. Just gotta make sure it's all wrapped up to the release date. How do you intend I plan my famine without a release date, Blizzard, HUH?!
---
Amongst these the thing that enraged me a lot was always the XP bar showing even being 60.
---
Can't unsee that everytime I see this box art
---
I'm sorry but to me games are actually about winning/losing amd how you go from the first to the second.
---
So.. no game can be too hard. As long as it is possible then that's all I care about. Some games I just can't seem to beat .. they are billions comes to mind. But Sekiro isn't that difficult. It's just muscle memory. And if it really were impossible then screw it I would just walk away and not cry to others about it.
---
A story driven single player game*
---
If she loves lord of the rings, tempt her into it by saying ‚Äúhey how about we play lord of the rings online together‚Äù, and then when she‚Äôs invested strike with wow and tell her if she likes lotro she‚Äôll love wow 
---
You mean I could simply throw down a tremor totem not to live in constant terror while leveling in STV?!
---
The box art was extremely well done and placed. Both depictions on there gave a really deep and immersive impression about the game. I think a lot of people were positively swayed by those images. 
---
&gt; Imagine forgetting that the whole point of WoW was being an all-accessible mmo, with a loot treadmill that keeps you subscribed.
---
Read the corporate tax code. 
---
I also disagree - there is a third alternative to 1.13+ and/or TBC.  
---
Chromie...  
---
...and the Bronze Dragonflight, recognizing the perils of our world's current progression, have offered the world a chance to save Azeroth from certain doom - a path that will lead us one day into a strange, monotony of events, everyone stuck in a repeating behavior, unable to escape the drudgery of daily tasks...  
---
...but there is hope! We can stop The Burning Crusade, and together, we will begin a NEW chapter, a NEW future, one with new adventures, never before seen!  
---
We will not accept this set of events! We will change history, erasing The Burning Crusade, escaping the Wrath of the Lich King, avoiding the Cataclysm, burning the very Mists away, to... sssomething... I can't tell what it iss...  
---
QUICK HERO'S!! TO ARMS!!!! BEFORE IT'S TOO LA-

You have ruined that picture for me now.
---
Yeah that shit was awesome.. I poured over gaming mags looking for the latest screenshots and information..
---
Where are you getting this 15% stun resistance across all races from
---
You do realize that when other people do dailies, your gold/hour gains from farming crafting materials increase, right?
---
The only time farming is a bad way to make money is when the crafting materials you're farming are useless. Which they weren't in TBC.
---
&gt;  interacting with each other.
---
Because TBC dailies had *zero* interaction with other players. /s
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put that on my worst enemy 
---
For Da Horde! 
---
The bow spec applies to crossbows
---
What do you mean by this? People will take/roll Hunter because the gear drops go to waste otherwise?
---
A lot of these songs are on my playlist too! Good ol throwbacks. Some of them are more recent but still good. 
---
This is the crux of the argument circulating in games media at the moment. They want to convince/pressure developers into providing difficulties that they *don't* want to provide. It's centered around games like the soulsborne genre or cuphead that are known for presenting a challenge. They're pushing for easier modes so they can get through the games, whereas the broad fanbase of those games doesn't want an easier option available.
---
I haven't seen anybody arguing against games being created with easy difficulty modes, most are just arguing that developers should be free to set whatever difficulty level or options they want in the products they create like you said, including the choice to not provide an easy mode option. Every game doesn't have to be accessible to every person imo but it's an interesting conversation.
---
Personally I'm bad at games and find those games frustrating but I think pressuring developers to cater to everyone by changing their games is wrong.
---
Discord. Weird people dont use discord. 
---
I remember one of my teachers mentioned that ‚Äú you will gain nothing from playing video games‚Äù when I was in elementary school around 19 years ago.
---
I remember we had all these dumb softwares to help us learn to type.
---
I remember non of it helping. And the reason why I can blind type and type so fast in general for work is because of wow. 
---
I did the PvP grind... Wish I could put that same effort into it now :(. Would say yellow 
---
Not having all the actions bars set even if they are empty triggers me timbers.
---
For me, it's the McChicken. The best fast food sandwich.

‚ÄúGnomeregan [no äm…π…ôÀàg…ëÀên] was the capital city of the gnome race until a trogg invasion led to its tragic downfall. In a desperate attempt to kill the troggs, their ruler, High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, on the advice of his advisor Sicco Thermaplugg, ordered the gnomes to open the pressure valves of their giant, grinding machines and released toxic radiation throughout the city. Though the radiation killed some of the troggs, it empowered others.[3] Meanwhile, the radiation killed the gnome people just as quickly. Nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died within days,[4] while others were transformed into horrific, mindless, evil-doing leper gnomes.[5] A few loyal gnomes still left in the city fought desperately to keep the troggs at bay. ‚Äù
---
Titanforging. Mythic 0 drops increase in power sure your not at mythic raiding gear levels but there‚Äôs really no advantage to having mythic raiding gear unless you want to mythic raid which obviously most people myself included don‚Äôt have the capacity to do but I do have the capacity to get through the first few tiers of classic and enjoy actually having gear progress that impacts all aspects of the game not just mythic raiding or mythic plus. My comment was pointed at your last sentence. I don‚Äôt want challenging content I want rewarding content that‚Äôs not reset every other patch. 
---
Rock on my friend!
---
50 here.
---
basketball is not for everyone just like orange juice is not for everyone, why does everyone want to be part of everything in this modern day? This is nothing but FOMO.
---
True! but not available immediately unfortunately as it drops In dire maul.
---
I remember buying the staff for 45 golds in vanilla... it was another time!
---
One of the joys of having moved off grid, I work from home. I literally walk out he front door and I am at work (or just sit on the PC)  So i wont be taking two weeks off, but I will be getting a lot of time n those first few weeks.
---
Especially since I will be leveling two toons to 60 at the same time!
---
No news yet and my crystal ball is currently out for polishing. 
---
Muse - Psycho was released with Drones 2015 so it's not really a vanilla song. Throw in Plug in Baby and Times is running out instead!
---
Dunno about the 0.5 idea, but I was about to post the same about MC :)
---
Since players are gonna be stronger with 1.12 talents, they should scale up the difficulty of MC (and maybe some of the other early raids as well) so that the difficulty relative to player strength is closer to the same
---
One could argue that having the same raid difficulty compared to player strength, would be more vanilla than keeping the same numbers
---
If you are going for Rank 14, that is definitely the best value as it will save you way more time than you could ever generate in 2 weeks with paid time off.
---
the PTO is probably the best IRL option though, you can go whole hog and get the most enjoyment out of a limited experience.  Within a month or two things will have settled and the new server feel will start to settle into a community.  So I'd probably go with 2 weeks PTO, just to play more during that time.
---
That honestly wouldn't be enough, lol.
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs such a great story.
---
Honestly, not as bad as I imagined. Iron forge is a good and simple city to navigate in.
---
And much more simpler to go to MC and BWL.
---
AQ is a bit more painful
---
So just because someone isn't as good as others means they should be left out? You do know basketball does have recreation leagues for people of all skill levels. 
---
I‚Äôll be solely PvPing. I was thinking shadow priest/hunter/lock for the horde!
---
Yes, that is what they said
---
I can't find any evidence to support this. Source?
---
how did it ruin wow? you could still go mythic raiding if you are a hc gamer
---
Just tell her you'll do anything to get her the first ZG tiger mount if she rolls horde
---
Based 
---
You can't use it in PvP really, its on the GCD and means your Blind Bandage or Sap Bandage is weak 
---
When I see a player attack someone who's grey to them, that's not good sportsmanship.  The lowbie has no chance, and we've all been grief'd by someone much higher than us.  It's a shit thing.   The best players do not waste their time doing this; they are good because they compete.  Is the world fair? No, and there will always be griefers.  But his behavior indicates that they are weak and just prey on the weakest.  If they were in my guild, I'd throw them the fuck out.
---
 True. Now think about all those other gadgets that the gnomes are noted for. All in all, they sum up to "What will this do?" Press button. Explosion/backfire/strange event/etc happens. "Neat! Now what about..." Basically, attention span of a gerbil that wants to press buttons/pull levers/etc. without pausing to consider the consequences. Not evil, not good, and definitely not safe to near to. Although quite entertaining. 
---
Thank you for the input regarding how to level each spec!
---
I think it‚Äôs more that higher level gear only matters if you want to do higher level pve gear. The sense of progress doesn‚Äôt matter when the gear is easily obtainable by everyone. 
---
&gt; Where are you getting this 15% stun resistance across all races from
---
just repeating what was in the linked video, but I guess considering the mechanical question the exact number doesn't really matter.
---
&gt;As for the Orc racial it clearly says additional which means [+]
---
Yeah but considering the prior phrase where it says the chance was increased, usually in the realm of percentages this implies multiplicative. Plus some of the tooltips in this game are just entirely misleading lol.  Thanks for the input though
---
You won't find players resisting spells (iirc) until they have upwards of 200+ resist in a specific field. They'll take % reduced damage, but full resist requires a very high threshold.
---
That said, I have no idea about the 5% base stun resist, or if it was just 1% like all skills have a chance to "miss." 
---
Orc. +25% stun resist is too nice, especially if you're a clothie.
---
RP as a hordie
---
If you do decide on going alliance with her for now, tell her that TBC has Belfs and make her promise to play horde if/once TBC rolls out.
---
Honestly. 
---
Spending a Friday night fishing in STV while I have some music in the background ~~or not, because STV music is fucking amazing already~~, so that I can level my cooking, so that I can actually go out questing as a Rogue without having to stop every other pull.. it *is* tedious. But that's the charm in it. It's fun, it's rewarding, and I miss things like that being relevant in the leveling process. 
---
My expectations are spot on, and I can't fucking wait. 
---
&gt; Nothing is lost by adding an easy mode and in fact more is gained by adding to a larger fan base.
---
Something is lost, the psychology of not being provided an option and knowing it's the same for everyone is different. If demon's souls had of had an easy mode I'd wager rather than having a larger fanbase it would have been a forgettable game and it never would have spawned dark souls, sekiro (which the article is about) might exist as a follow up to tenchu, but it would be a largely different game etc. 
---
That's like saying if you had 10% crit and got a item that gave 2% crit you would only gain 0.2% crit.... 
---
And infinitely less rewarding loot than classic. 
---
Surprising. I‚Äôm 32. Figured my age group would be the largest as I was 18 during vanilla, which was the largest demographic at the time.
---
Give me that green one!
---
This hunter priest arms race sounds fun.  
---
That's how it was before patch 1.10 actually, the experience bar would show even at max level. Watch the last part of Joanna's vanilla speedrun, and you'll see the XP bar doesn't disappear when she dings 60. It's even mentioned in the official patch notes.
---
&gt; World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.10.0 (2006-03-28) 
---
&gt; - Your experience bar will no longer display when you are level 60.
---
Both priest and mage will have no trouble finding groups, don't worry. You'll definitely compete for a lot of gear, seeing as a lot of classes use cloth caster gear, but it's not really a big deal.
---
Crit hit parry dodge block are all calculated with percentages and are all additive, resistance (miss chance) is no exception 
---
Kara was amazing...
---
I have bets lined up on how soon MC will be cleared, don't nullify them :(
---
Druid healers and tanks are both very viable. There will always be a shortage of healers so you will be in high demand as resto.
---
Despite what 90% of people say Bear tanking is more than viable and can tank almost all content. Checkout Skarm on YouTube and googl Taladril's guide.
---
I've played a private server recently to test the rose tinted glasses theory...fuck that, I was hooked, I had to stop because I found myself being lost in the game again.
---
Vanilla is still fucking good, so much better then retail.
---
"meta gem"...?! Get out of here you heretic
---
Scarab lord no question 
---
If you're thinking in terms of percent increase then yeah that would be the implication if your head is already thinking within that context.
---
PvP. Playing a rouge, can't wait.
---
yeah that's a good point. the wording is just vague in the tooltip
---
... That is not vanilla
---
The stun resist is good, but it's not reliable for the user. Your enemies can also play around it. On my Druid, I know not to open with Pounce on an Orc because of the resist chance. I open with Ravage instead. The downgrade from a Pounce opener to Ravage is not very significant in the grand scheme of things. I think Orcs are an easier matchup than Tauren with their War Stomp.
---
Nothing is lost by adding an easy mode and in fact more is gained by adding to a larger fan base.
---
Development time is lost focusing on an easier game mode. That can be months of time down the drain to appease people who can't be bothered playing longer than a few days to try and better themselves. 
---
For sure
---
The male-nelfs will be taken as sex slaves, this is true.
---
Pretty useless to pick blue pill.
---
You can wait a little bit more I‚Äôm sure.
---
One of the core staples of an MMORPG is to have tiered content, each harder than the previous one. If everything is available to everyone then it loses its essence of mystery and wonder.
---
Actually, if your memory is on point and this is how he actually spells his name it‚Äôs probably not that difficult (although not unheard of, it‚Äôs not how you‚Äôd usually spell that name). If it‚Äôs actually ‚ÄúFredrik Eriksson‚Äù though, well, then it‚Äôs a different story... good luck!
---
I have 6 weeks pto saved up. Soooo Scarab Lord it is.
---
Yeah, I'm not debating that. Dagger dps can be great if done right.
---
In Vanilla when you paid for a name change you could change the name to one that wasn't capitalized.
---
I loathe herbing and mining aswell. I will be farming in other ways and just buy the materials instead.
---
Same here, but I'd guess it's just that since reddit as a whole skews so heavily toward 18-29, even on a sub like this, the average respondent to the poll isn't really representative of the vanilla or classic player base overall.
---
/H0xiOWZmYlo
---
Aww he dead.
---
My girlfriend was already a gamer before she tried wow so it wasn't hard. She fell in love with it. She currently raids with me on pserver as a Troll Mage in full T3, and also plays retail with a Belf Mage @ lvl 120. So proud of her. It's fun to do something together.
---
Yeah I agree. We never had more than 2 or 3 to be honest. They were often allowed to use "advanced feign death". Just dps until boss kills u, then br or soulstone.
---
For pvp, orc is pretty much the best race, as stun resistance can win you a lot of fights by RNG. There is a lot of stuns in the game, from Nearly every class. For alliance I highly rate gnome for escape artist, but dwarf is very strong too, being able to remove blind and other poison/bleeds
---
BRUH I would take the box with me to school as a 2nd grader and secretly analyse it throrougly during class. I couldn't speak english at the time so I made my own stories up, tried to figure out which picture were taken in which location and where were those locations in the kalimdor map.
---
We can't know how many were repulsed by LFR and LFG but I know that many people loathed the way LFR changed the feel of the game. Perhaps not on the day it was released, but within a year. I'd imagine something similar happened with LFG. No way to accurately guess numbers. 
---
&gt; It's not like it replaced anything for anyone that was already doing the content. The content was still there, and the high end raid content has only gotten better since they added LFR for the casuals. 
---
I'll skip the 4,018,111,012nd rendition of "LFR was good" vs. "LFR rotted out the foundations of WoW". There are so many reasons that it fundamentally destroyed the concept of raiding and I'm sure you've read - and dismissed them - all before. 
---
Why an earth are these 3 dudes making a 2 hour long video (#14 lol?) on a game the know nothing about? Baseline is 5%, orc racial and warrior talent were additive. This is not confusing or mystery mechanics, literally anyone that pvp'd in vanilla could tell you this.
---
I remember going to the gaming section at my local backwoods wal mart and staring at the WoW box every time I went for over a month. The day I finally got dial-up was like 2nd Christmas lol
---
anyone notice the dwarf‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt capitalized lol? slightly OCD triggering
---
RP, or PVE if there aren't any.
---
I honestly thought that if they ever announced Classic, I would be indifferent. I loved it, but thought ‚Äú that ship has sailed‚Äù 
---
When they announced Classic I was actually excited, which I really had not been in a new game for a while.
---
But yeah, I think I might survive another couple of months :) 
---
Haha.. at least do a fact check before just making guaranteed specific claims, you'll make much less of a fool of yourself
---
Don't watch it then dude it's that easy lol
---
&gt; literally anyone that pvp'd in vanilla could tell you this.
---
I was casual af but i got to rank 7 in vanilla and nah I couldn't because I never bothered to look it up lol.
---
yes if they are not good enough they are not eligible, if recreation leagues are there they should go there because they are eligible. They will hamper professional teams just because one is pushing inclusiveness.
---
If the not enough good person want s to watch a intense professional play and get entertained tomorrow they won't be able to, as they pushed for inclusiveness and they get shite in return after some time in future.
---
If you are not good in Basketball it doesn't mean youa re a loser in life there other fields in which prof players suck, but they don't feel they suck at life altogether.
---
That is why you have hierarchy of competency, you work hard er and try out different fields and try to become excellent at it, For sure there is a field where you every single human can shine if they work hard, commitment, sincerity, honesty, discipline and many more nobler and less nobler qualities.
---
Always find your strengths, if one cannot determine that by 12th grade they will be in serious trouble.
---
There‚Äôs something to be said for exclusivity as a motivator here as well though, especially in regards to an MMO setting. 
---
As someone who never saw the inside of Naxx during vanilla, a part of me resented experiencing it as an entry level raid in WotLK. I still enjoyed Naxx in wrath, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I still celebrated clearing it, but there was definitely a mystique lost of that floating temple of doom that ominously tainted the sky; Halls filled with such terror that only the most seasoned veterans could stomach the grind just to set foot in the place. Even though it was still a great raid second time round, the weight of the place wasn‚Äôt the same and it was recognizable at the time. Not getting into Naxx in vanilla made me appreciate progressing in TBC raids much more in a weird way. In retrospect I appreciate that I wasn‚Äôt able to access that content. Regardless if people chose to gatekeep about it, or hold it against me, it enhanced my enjoyment in the game, even if young me playing vanilla wow wasn‚Äôt capable of passing those thresholds.
---
Horde pvp:
---
Warrior-orc
---
Shaman-orc but Tauren is arguable here with a high enough skill cap
---
Hunter-orc
---
Rogue-orc
---
Warlock-orc
---
Mage-undead
---
Priest-I‚Äôve actually seem strong arguments for troll, even though I thought undead, so I don‚Äôt know. Maybe depends on whether you go shadow or not (devouring plague undead good for shadow)
---
TBC summoning stone only required 1 other person to click on the portal to complete the summon.  Literally anyone who played WoW during that xpac could tell you this
---
lol
---
Warriors and Rogues are also over represented. If you can show your competence as a Hunter I think you'll get a raid spot with about the same difficulty as a fWarr or a Rogue tbh.
---
Are you sure about that? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaUtbRuswo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyaUtbRuswo) :D
---
I thought will of the forsaken was pretty good for undead. 
---
Hi, /u/the1egend1ives
---
This is actually very romantic 
---
It's not even close lol :p
---
RP-PVP and I hope they will reconsider adding them. I remember being suprised when I found out there are no RP-PVP servers on release, so I rolled on PVP. But the day RP-PVP were introduced I rerolled.  
---
I don't get the idea of RP as a PvE only realm. I want to RP and I want to play with PVP enabled for everyone all the time, because world PvP is a lot of fun.  
---
Come on man, you have an amazing opportunity to experience the game from the other side! It never occured to me that before the cataclysm revamp, I have NOT visited the alliance zones (except for the starting ones). Doesn't that make you excited? I will be rolling alliance (night elf, while we're at it, because I have NEVER went further the lvl5 starting area there) and have a classic AND a fresh experience. This is great man, trust me you are going to have a lot of fun!
---
*Puts gnomish death ray away*

... Not evil at all :) 
---
I got my widescreen Samsung in 2006.  
---
...I still use it
---
Counter point: you can't get KILLED by gnomes, the single most frustrating thing in the game.
---
locks cant summon you into an instance. you have to zone out to summon someone or they have to zone in to be summoned to your location in the instance. 
---
I'll likely be forced by my coworkers to play on a PvP server, but I'll be getting a lot more enjoyment out of hopping into my A alt on a PvE server. World PvP has always been nothing more than a nuisance to me, and not having to deal with it would make the time spent in the game after work feel much more relaxing. If I had no PvE choice at all I would probably avoid Classic altogether.
---
That keyboard takes me back
---
LOL
---
When Dungeon Finder/Random Dungeon came about in Wrath ... I liked it at first. Without even trying it. Then the moment I experienced it, I suddenly felt as if something was missing. I didn't think about it. Over time, I realized what I was feeling: that the whole WoW experience was becoming too ... convenient. Like everything was at my interface and I didn't need to do much else for it.
---
Pirate servers for whatever reason seem to have a strong pug raid culture. But having 10k people on at once as opposed to 2.5k probably has a lot to do with it. Four times as many people means it's a *lot* easier to find forty people for something.
---
In retail vanilla very few people outside of active raiding guilds knew the raiding content well enough to lead a raid through it. On my server there was one person who organised semi-regular ZG attempts that rarely if ever cleared it, and I do not think I ever saw an MC or Ony pug.
---
TLDR: Nobody knows yet. Will vary by server.
---
PVE because I like to switch off when leveling. 
---
Darn. I‚Äôm sort of in the same boat but I started in bc with a heavy focus on pvp. I‚Äôll be going for rank 10-12 but I will be playing alliance. If you find yourself playing alliance it would be a great pleasure to group and level and even bg together. 
---
Come classic if you decide to roll alliance please message me here and I will add you! Or we could coordinate servers etc!
---
My gut feelings are:
---
- We get info on PvP closer to launch.
---
- RP PvP isn't addressed until after launch.
---
- Sharding will be addressed by the end of May.
---
- Beta announcement (or confirmation of no beta) will come out by the end of April.
---
- Launch-day server names announcement by the end of May.
---
- Launch day information by the end of June.
---
All of this is just speculation. I have no inside info or a brain.
---
&gt; when she dings 60
---
Joana is a male.
---
It was the first real hand holding move. I spent plenty of time farming in vanilla, but only felt like I was eating my time with dailies.... if that makes any sense!
---
I don't necessarily mind there being an easy mode in a completely secluded environment - like if WoW had easy mode servers where you just decided to have a shit experience when you create a character. It's the having it affect everyone else's experience when it's a problem. 
---
Beautiful.
---
Or you can just respect her decision and have fun your own ways.
---
Aw, what a cute loot pinata.
---
Thats like a drug addict saying "hey man if its 50% pure ill still take it man . . . "
---
OK so here's why your line of thinking is wrong: you're still referring to vanilla where warriors were shit in dps for most of the time. By the time they became good, most raiding warriors were tank. So obviously only one or two per guild could shift to dps. However now, warrior will be good starting molten core. You can gear them since the beginning because you know they just get even better. They are better than rogues all the way and actually taking loot priority over them most often. 
---
I hope it's the confirmation of Oceanic servers. But I have a feeling they're going to save all server and sharding talk until after a release date has been given.
---
Mega Man 2 has an easy mode.
---
It released in Japan with one difficulty. "Normal" difficulty was added to the western release and the base difficulty became "Hard."
---
It's widely considered to be the best Mega Man game on the NES.
---
The flaming sword got me wanting to play when I was in like 5th grade
---
&gt;Furthermore if we applied this logic to say basketball then you can make two claims. 1) any child that can't make 10/10 free throws by age 6 will never be able to play professionally, and 2) professionals do not need to practice and are always at peak performance. The fact is those are both demonstrably not true. 
---
This is just false. He said easy mode lessens the experience, how does this have anything to do with what you say. If you take your example, and add an easy mode for that kid, so he can easily get the free throws, without practice and at least some struggle, he will not improve from it. And if you are trying to say, having smaller scaled games for 6 yo kids is easy mode, you are missing the part where kids are physically smaller, which obviously means they need smaller scale equipment/balls etc, while these things don't matter at all in video games. But then again this is all a sidetrack, since the original talk was about enjoyment, and not how easy it is to become pro, I don't know why you brought it up.
---
According to the WoW Diary, demon hunter was a class they considered before even druid was on the board. 
---
inb4 "Let The Bodies Hit The Floor" make a comeback.
---
I hope not, really.
---
Easy yellow. That mount is just too iconic. 
---
I‚Äôm 35, I was 20 when the game came out, I still remember my girlfriend at the time getting pissed at me for basically sacrificing thanksgiving for WoW.
---
&gt; aggro a supposedly weak mob
---
Giant Yeti are actually 33-34 mobs in Hillsbrad Foothills, which just adds to the weirdness.
---
Wotf is a very good pvp racial. Undead mage&gt;troll mage for sure.
---
If we compare undead to orc though it‚Äôs a lot tougher, because orc is considered to have the best racials for pvp (25% stun resist mostly, plus blood fury can be really good for some classes, and pet dmg is something for warlocks or hunters, and I don‚Äôt know if the axe skill racial matters in pvp)
---
Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that the classes undead can be benefit less from wotf than some others might. Mages, warlocks, priests, and rogues can at least trinket out of fear, and warriors have zerker rage (compared to a class like a hunter that had no fear break). Wotf is still good so you don‚Äôt have to waste trinket on that, but you also can get glimmering Mithril insignia from blacksmithint to help with fears if you need some more anti-fear mechanics, plus because you are on the horde, warlocks are less common in the opposition and you might have tremor totems near you. 
---
Undead is a solid choice and you can always feel you chose a good pvp race with undead, as opposed to if you choose a troll warrior or night elf priest.
---
But orc is simply better for any classes that have both undead and orc as an option.
---
Easy.. dwarf is master race.
---
8% minors

There are a few types of levelers:
---
- Hardcore Kingly-Prepared Super Nerd
---
- No-life sperg basement dweller
---
- Weekend Warrior
---
- ÔΩÅÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩâÔΩÉ Leveler
---
- Cool Super Pal Social-Friend
---
- - -
---
- The Hardcore Prepared folks will take weeks off work. They'll let friends know they're busy. They'll get uber eats &amp; postmates orders bookmarked for easy access. Amazon in some crates of redbull. These folks have leveling routes pre-programmed into their mind. They could do 1-12 asleep.
---
- The no-lifes are nearly the same as the above -- but if you ask them "did you take off work" they'll be like "HAHAHA. WORK." cuz they ain't got no job, man.
---
- Weekend Warriors can't afford to take weeks off work -- but they'll get to 60 pretty quickly. These are the "okay, just three more bubbles of exp before sleep" crowd. The "I'll play NELF so I can shadowmeld if the baby cries" crowd. True legends.
---
- Ôº°Ôº•Ôº≥Ôº¥Ôº®Ôº•Ôº¥Ôº©Ôº£Ôº≥. Enjoy the leveling experience. Do a few BGs. Run WC and SFK. Try to do *all* of Gnomer. 
---
- Super Pals will hang out in discord and help their bbros out. Ya' know, run folks through stocks. Help fill out a SM group even though you already have the quests done. They just want to spend enjoyable time in game.
---
And, frankly, all of these ways of playing are awesome. Just have a good time. If you want to hit 60 asap -- dope. If you want to hit 60 by the time DM releases -- dope. If you dgaf about when you hit 60 and want to level a bunch of toons up to 30 -- dope. Just enjoy WoW, man. It's almost here.
---
Not dikish. :)
---
me too and finally got the sword many many years later last year
---
&gt; in STV
---
That area oddly enough is in Zul'Gurub, which wasn't added until far into vanilla. You can find the clearing where the first boss (bat) is located.
---
Get good or get out. You don't get freebies in this world you shoulny expect so online or in games. Your comment makes no sense. 
---
fomo?
---
Nah I'd prefer if we didn't just dismiss each other's views by saying that we're not going to discuss it and then stating our own views as facts. 
---
I'd like to know how LFR "fundamentally destroyed the concept of raiding." when all it did was add a more casual version of the raid with inferior rewards. From there other difficulties were added and raiding is accessible though I'm not really sure how that's a bad thing considering that the super hardcore raiding is still present. Not only present but balanced better than ever, more challenging than ever, and has more resources put into it than ever. 
---
If there was some natural progression where people that weren't raiders became raiders and that was destroyed because of LFR then I might see your point but raiding was always a niche activity prior to LFR and the subsequent other difficulties. Most people in WoW never raided, raid participation during the golden years of WoW was abysmal, and that's why they spent all those years from launch through Cata changing how raids work. It wasn't for their own entertainment, it was to boost raid participation. 
---
Or perhaps to you was the "concept of raiding." and the "foundation of WoW." that raiding was an activity that was out of reach of the masses? Is it really just about us having an endgame and the plebs not having any kind of endgame progression despite it being vastly inferior to our own? Does it truly matter to you or I in our shiny raid epics from the hardest content in the game if Billy the Pally is wearing dungeon blues or LFR epics a couple item levels higher? Our content is still harder, our rewards are still better, we're still the better player. What's been taken from us?
---
On the other hand, Billy the Pally has gotten gear that's a couple ilevels higher than what he got from running dungeons, and he's still terrible compared to us, his gear is still awful compared to ours, but for him his character has gotten stronger and he's felt a sense of progression. 
---
Easier content for them, inferior rewards for them, higher raid participation as a result, more resources poured into raiding, and you and I directly benefit from it.
---
For the record, I don't think "LFR was good." - As someone who has raided from the very start I think that LFR was one of the best things they ever added to the game. It's nice that bosses have a lot of mechanics, it's nice that raids are designed better and aren't just caves with mobs strewn about. 
---
&gt; Warriors and Rogues are also over represented. 
---
raids also have more slots for them cuz they are great
---
hunters are many and still maybe 3 will be brought
---
Only 50 minutes ? Better than nothing, but I expected a few hours !
---
In combat 30% of the time, that's quite low. I thought you wanted to grind most of the time and only do a few quests here and there on your grind spots.
---
Wait, what? Only one dude per guild is going to get the title?
---
Not only that, Blizzard tries to get overgeared people in that will boost the rest, which further makes heroics and even mythics retardedly easy and it's a big shame.
---
Fear of missing out
---
It is an awesome mount, no doubt. On my ally toon I will be working on the WS one as well
---
That's a real Protection Paladin ;)
---
Thanks! Very informative.
---
Berzerker racial :)
---
Played before 1.10, I'm pretty sure XP after 60 remained at zero with no additional gains. 
---
The only thing it grew on the bar was the rested bonus
---
Skull of impending doom is ur friend
---
&gt;You can literally stand still and do nothing and as long as half the raid is not afk kill the boss.
---
Hmm.. isn't that vanilla in a nutshell?
---
Everyone that have read barrens chat back then knows that the average Wow demographic was 13yo teenagers ! :D
---
You seem real mad bro
---
I did this under Stormwind
---
The jury is still out on how much stun resist you get.
---
Is it base +25% or 25% of base ?
---
You can always hop on a private server for a while to scratch that itch! 
---
It's bloody disheartening, annoying and unfair to the people putting actual time and effort in to be rewarded with nothing and see a scrub lucky bastard lfr get a titanforge that is a bis for the first guy. Nah man. It's a stupid system and you know it. There is no endgame set of items to strive towards again, there is no finishing your champion, just running that same bullshit on every difficulty hoping for: the minor chance for your item to drop, for it to then titanforge. That's a nigh impossible thing to achieve. 
---
It does prevent a lot of players from joining the raiding scene and also makes the playerbase just incredibly lazy and entitled. Compare LFR when it first came out to how it is now. Back then they were not easy. You could wipe a lot and groups would disband all the time. Now it's just a complete faceroll. Just go in there and roll your head around on they keyboard and you'll get your random loot. 
---
Tier 0.5 is garbo for a lot of classes so it won't make a huge difference.
---
you don‚Äôt seem to have a working gut either
---
Hmm, I'd like to say this pic got me to play WoW too, but it was really the half naked Night Elf chick in the original intro that made 14 year old me decide to give it a shot.
---
27 year old me would like to thank 14 year old me for introducing me to one of the greatest games of all time.
---
You got yourself a smart wife. Classic is the one game stage whereby alliance dominates the entire PvE content
---
You sneak, you peak, you sap, maybe fap?
---
You open, you backstab, you hear cries, pain, anguish and death follows because you are the dread.
---
Target is dead you re-stealth, hiding in plain sight, people fear you because you bring death.
---
This is more like r/racistopinion
---
For geddon I‚Äôll spread out in garr‚Äôs room and pull him in there so I don‚Äôt have to move for bombs, 
---
For garr I‚Äôll either bring enough locks to make it a tank and spank, or banish like 2 and have a warrior aoe tank the adds with every cool down and 10 healers spamming heals while I aoe them down with 28 mages. The adds have 60k hp so they would all die in ~12 seconds. I‚Äôm not 100% if I‚Äôll need more locks yet but I don‚Äôt think I will!
---
As for the adds, I‚Äôm really not worried. Initially I was practicing on a pserver with a raid full of locks and none of the trash gave me any trouble but now I‚Äôm pretty dead set on stacking mages which will make it even easier since I‚Äôll do much more damage and have less threat problems.
---
Haha thanks for the reply but I have no intention of selling any wow services for money. Was just asking about gold. My accounts are too precious to me to risk them and I don‚Äôt need the money.
---
I hope so. That was part of what made Classic so good. It was part of the community. And a lot of the best guilds often held players accountable, and wouldn't accept "jumpers" who used a guild to gear up and then jump out (like a tank who decides to leave so he can switch to DPS).
---
This belongs in /wow, not /classicwow
---
LFR is the worst thing that has ever happened to WoW. And before you say "but it's good for people who don't have time". Complete bullshit. I'm a working person too, like most of us, I don't play that much yet I've managed to get a curve in so many tiers, including the last one and that was with pugs, because of my work schedule. Not even talking about normal that I usually clear in the first week.
---
I stopped doing LFR, even on alts, in Legion during ToS. The amount of stupidity and laziness I saw in LFR during KJ fight was just ridiculous. Trying to explain something was pointless. LFR heroes don't want to learn, they told me to fuck off and then they happily ignored meteors and every mechanic of the fight. Doing absolutely trash DPS, tanking in DPS spec, healing in DPS spec. And before you say LFR shouldn't be taken seriously, well I guess you haven't experienced KJ on LFR release. I'll be honest with you, it was easier to kill KJ with a pug on HC than on LFR during the first week.
---
Normal is already easy these days. I just don't see the point of LFR other than LFR heroes going for their free loot meanwhile ignoring every mechanic of the fight. Sure not all LFR players all the same, but as someone who has experienced LFR since Cata it's a huge majority. 
---
Back in the day most servers just picked one person and then farmed this one guy/gal up. No one gave a flip about the title. It was all about opening up 2 new raids.
---
\-
---
As long as your server has at least somewhat dedicated raid guilds it will end up the exact same way again. Oh look a human unemployed person who is constantly online? Congratulations you are now doomed to farm 24/7 with whoever is online to get this done.
---
Someone should put you in a box floating down the river grandma!
---
I bet you hate questing in Elwynn forest too.
---
They dont make them like they used to.
---
Horde is obviously the superior choice for the two of you, since she is a cow and you are a troll.
---
*Disclaimer: If you share this with her, you may have to find a bridge to sleep under.
---
I'd play orc rogue, but they just look weird as rogues. I don't want to go with majority, but the truth is undead rogue simply looks the best imo.
---
If the dwarf opens with garrote he's better than the orc being opened. The first part of your sentence is correct, but not the second one. 
---
You never played vanilla. Don't jump on the bandwagon. Your statement isn't true. There were tons of mechanics to do back when. Wanna try bwl for instance just standing still? I dare you and your random group of players to get through killing 1 egg in there... 
---
Cannot unsee now, thanks.
---
Wow that's awful.
---
Scarab Lord is the one thing I want from Classic. If they require a no-life approach to get it, I'm going to reconsider if I bother playing.
---
I was 14 and all my friends played WoW.
---
There's some situations that actually need you to have aa bound.  
---
The title isnt in vanilla. It came after
---
I‚Äôm working on a strategy to be able to level them all simultaneously. Currently it‚Äôs looking like I should have them all at 60 within the first month if I no life it. If blizz decides to add some sort of dynamic respawning for a while like they have in retail I could probably abuse that to do it much faster too! 
---
I‚Äôm an unemployed 23 year old which explains the time but I‚Äôd rather not talk about money because it makes people get weird.
---
I think beta announcement might be possible in the coming weeks.  
---
  This week could be going back to sharding or the AV discussion.  
---
My husband and I are in a similar situation, he really wants to play a paladin for most intense nostalgia and I can't be satisfied playing anything other than undead. Gonna make a male night elf I guess. 
---
I read this in the ‚Äú50 DKP minus‚Äù guys voice...
---
please don't bring your SJW shit into classic wow, i want to relive 2006, not 2016.
---
I didn't say i don't want girls to game or that they shouldn't, i said from my expierence they just don't. If we played together and someone in chat told you to go back to kitchen, I would side with you. But if you're gonna go full sarkeesian on people because they state opinions you don't like, then maybe online interactions aren't for you.
---
the only difference is that orc rogues farm restorative potions while dwarfs farm free action potions
---
Mario Odyssey is a game about overcoming platforming and navigation challenges and Nintendo added an easy mode to it pretty well.
---
WoW's easy modes are a problem because doing the easy mode a bunch of times is something you are expected to do when trying to get into a group that does the normal and hard mode, which sucks because it makes the content less of a puzzling out of mechanics and shocking revelations of new enemies and more a bring grind as you out numbers the bosses.
---
Sekiro has an easy mode btw, it is going for vitality wins. Most of the bosses have pretty clear patterns and so you can just run away, wait for a big attack, whack them once, and repeat this for as long as it takes to kill them. It is really easy because your character runs super fast, but it is also clearly the less fun way to approach fights.
---
It appears that you're already aware of the reasons that people feel LFR was regressive. You just don't agree. That's fine. The things you brush off as "that's fine" cataclysmically cheapened the experience for many of us.   
---
The prime thing above all: we should \*never\* see a boss for the first time in easy mode. Contemporary content needs to be intimidating enough that players aspire to conquer it. To trivialize the defeat of these encounters damages both the raider's sense of self-accomplishment, as they've done it before, and also their sense of meta-accomplishment (for lack of a better term) and esteem since \*anybody and everybody\* also kill those bosses. I'm sure you disagree with this and will give me the usual retort to emphasize how pointless this  4,018,111,016th (there have been three further conversations about this tired topic just since we started!) iteration of this conversation is.  
---
  
---
One fresh solution I can offer: LFR wouldn't have done too much damage if it only pertained to the previous tier. It still cemented the concept of disposable raid tiers that started in WotLK but it appears they were going in that direction anyway. 
---
There are many other things I hate about LFR but you already know most of them. 
---
This is one of those lines that just gets parroted. It implies that people respec just as often with a 50g cap as they do with a 25g cap or anything less than 50. They really don't. 
---
I'd argue *more* people spend *more* gold on respecs when it's slightly more affordable. At 50, most of a server's population will camp their main/farm spec and I'd argue less gold on a server overall is ever removed via respec for the sake of regulating the economy. 
---
So, does your boss know that you are browsing gaming websites instead of putting that boatload of price-tags on the produce on your shelves  ? :D 
---
Hmmmm, I suppose we'll have to see. I still thought fury wasn't viable in vanilla until Naxx gear provided enough +hit to avoid missing white damage.
---
I leveled with soul link and succubus to 60 and loved it. Could take on multiple players at once. 
---
Well, I was almost thirty when I started playing WoW.
---
So I'm going to be 43 years old when Classic comes out. AND I CAN'T WAIT!!!!
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs directly halved.
---
There is a reason why the flavor text on lashlayer's head states
---
&gt;Only **ONE** may rise...
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20383/head-of-the-broodlord-lashlayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20383/head-of-the-broodlord-lashlayer)
---
and why veterans bring it up when they talk about the scarab lord grind
---
 
---
Wait! Did you really think you would get Scarab Lord without no-life? LMAO
---
You will need support, but not as much as people think. Yes, farming as prot or healer is slower,  but i think you make it up with instant spots in dungeons. 
---
People who tank or heal low lvl instances are the prime targets for ginvites and forming social circles super early on, and that is super importanton new realms. As soon as you get added as a 'compitent tank' on peoples friend lists, you will log on to the game and get whispers instantly for dungeon runs. Its nice, but can also be anoying :)
---
Within guilds, people usualy help the tanks and healers with quests and gearing up in general. This is where guild policies can help alot. Some havedonations, some have mandatory dungeon rus etc.
---
As aprot tank you need to be thinking ahead alot. Prebis gear and farmable items should be planned ahead. As in im lvl 20 warr and my proffessions are set so i can farm the mats for my crafting gear all the way to 60. 
---
I wpuld sugest dubble gathering, like mining and herb, as a tank you will need herb for consumables and mining if u want a 'steady' income from farming arcane crystals in burning steps and herbing for black lotuses (all in the same zone! Burmimg steps is the place to be if ur herb+miner).
---
A lvl 5 alt with enchanting is mandatory for all classes, so you can de all dem 45+ greens u get for enchanting mats. A 35 alchemist is also agood idea, so you can transmute arcanite bars for yourself or sell the cd to others. A lvl 20* tailor for mooncloth never hurts. (In vanilla you could have a lvl 20 alt with 300 tailoring)
---
Another thing that is also good to do while u lvl, is to farm mats ull need at 60. Essences of all kind can be farmed from lvl 51+. Reputation for hyfraxian waterlords is best to farm from 56+ (essence of earth and air). This is where its good to have friends (dps) who can help out and are fine with 50:50 split of the drops. 
---
I lveled as prot on 3 pservers, and with good planning i had half my prebis gear before i hit 60, bank full of herbs, arcanite bars on stock, bunch of essences, enchanting mats etc... Its not for people who rush to 60 tho ;)
---
Yes, 50% and down to 28% if you're 5.
---
Tanking without sunder armour on his toolbar. Tut tut
---
Unfortunately i share your feeling, everything that could affect subscriptions, or decrease their income, that will be talked about few days before the release
---
Isn't that a popular opinion? 
---
I mean nobody wants to farm mats but still do to not be left behind by others guilds. But if nobody can farm then nobody is left behind and everyone is happy.
---
Or is it a way for the 1,5% of hardcore gamer to distinct themselfs from the plebe? Because they aren't more skilled so they want to add/keep some some grinds as they have more time to spend on the game? 
---
As for addon they should just be cosmetic.
---
 https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP the formula for group exp on there is accurate for vanilla. 
---
Happy days! Thank You very much 
---
Basically no one want raid with guy who can't do good dps or can't tank good, if you can do it with meme spec anyone will ok with your meme spec, silly meme speced guy. Otherwise no one want you in raids, but you can still have fun in brd, or while ganking or whatever. 
---
So realistically if I was to use a solo grinding location, it would take me double the time to grind a level. Hmmm...
---
It came with one of the pre-patches to TBC afaik, so technically it's still vanilla. 
---
Late to the party here but I never pushed it on my girlfriend but she saw how much I enjoyed it and once she started to understand it from watching me, she started to play. She didn't play super often but she managed to level a druid to 60 in about 8 months. She had a blast while doing it. I would get her gear from the AH but other than that I let her kind of figure it out on her own. She really had a lot of fun working with groups and made a lot of friends.   She enjoyed playing the economy and farming herbs while leaving. Basically I just planted the seed of what the game was all about to her and when she would ask for help I would tell her to look for others and make a group and once she got into that she loved the game and would get lost in it just like me. 
---
Seems right on pserver or memories from vanilla ?
---
I had an alt orc rogue in Vanilla that I seldomly played, I don't remember so much stun resist.
---
Nobody did test this on the classic demo ? 
---
Dude those "content creators" produce 50 minutes videos about bags but can't be bothered to test orc stun resist ?
---
So there is one book you like and one you don't? :D
---
&gt;I've been playing Horde in WoW since 2004. 
---
I've always been playing Horde as well and that's precisely the reason I'm going Alliance this time.
---
Don't underestimate these people. People who ask shit like this are the max level ones who get pounded by two lvl 35 lowbies in stv.
---
While i didn't play vanilla i'd like to ask something :
---
Did those of you who did really consider it hard content ?
---
From my perspective vanilla raiding is more or less a list of requierements, and should you fill all the options then it's a win since the strats aren't that hard. There's challenge when you lack a few of them or discover the encounter but it shouldn't count as hard content if that's the case.
---
And i'm not talking about the social part or farming part here, just the content itself. My point is that making any random mob a 40 man raid boss with a few skills doesn't make it hard, it's just a 40 Man content.
---
Just so you realise how that 18.75 is bullshit, it comes from the rest of the race having 15% (which is stupid). It would make the orc racial almost unnoticeable, which it isn't (and wasn't). 
---
Have you seen what it takes to get the title? 
---
Closest capital city to Un'goro/Silithus? Centrally located in Kalimdor? Best AH/bank/crafting concentration of any capital?
---
TB is a lot better than people give it credit for.
---
If you consider radiation is the same as biological weapons, your science teacher has failed you utterly.
---
I have a hard time believing how broken an orc warrior with iron Will would be. That would make 40% + whatever the base is stun resist.
---
Blizzard is not know to let imba things last long, they would have patched it.
---
PVP NO DOUBT. THIS IS HORDE V ALLIANCE BABY!
---
&gt; The druid rogue on the other hand has my mouth watering with the prospects of camping STVietnam.
---
I think it's more about that sentence. Smells extremely sweaty.
---
Ruined is a strong word, but when there is a difficulty slider I find it very annoying to battle this inner instinct of considering turning difficulty down "just to kill that one annoying boss".
---
Either you turn difficulty down or not, experience and reward gets slightly diminished simply by having that option.
---
Like who thought it would be a good idea to allow players to change difficulty while playing the game..
---
So if we get a Orc/Troll hybrid we get Wolverine?
---
You use it after healing, duh :o
---
If you consider radiation to be the same as biological weapons, your science teacher has failed you utterly. Go back to school.
---
A GM has the ability to make your name not start with a capital letter. I had a guildy once that had a GM mistakenly not capitalize his name when he was forced a name change on him once.
---
And there goes my illusion of having been a great pvp beast warlock ;-)
---
I used fear on everything...
---
Guess I have some homework to do until release. Thx ^^
---
I dont know if you played vanilla but lets just translate this to vanilla.
---
You do a rather easier raid like Zul'Gurub which does not pose a serious challenge as long as people heed the tactics.
---
So you come to Hakkar, you slay him and you get Ashkandi... 
---
Yes, you can get Dark Edge of Insanity from C'thun or Might of Menethil from Kel'Thuzad. It still feels like bullshit to get a slightly worse item from a much easier boss that does not even need consumables to defeat.
---
A progression raid doing C'thun needs easily 500g+ a night in flasks, prot pots etc.
---
Mr. pugger warrior just got Ashkandi in a 4-5:30pm afternoon raid. 
---
This would not fly well in the community.
---
I thought garrote was only for PVE (not a rogue here) and was quite bad for PVP.
---
Easy Scarab Lord. Can't wait to actually attempt it ! 
---
Yeah, that's like wanting to win a Stanley Cup when all you do is play beer league once every couple years.
---
Yes he is, but the ball in front of his gun is the mage‚Äôs fireball not the hunter‚Äôs shot. Check it out again.
---
I'd go with Scarab Lord, I'll likely not be able to obtain that ever and getting that mount would be sweet.
---
Haha sorry... I felt the same when I found out
---
The truth is you already have quite a lot of +hit in the prebis gear. The thing is back then we didn't really know how to gear, I'm quite sure truestrike shoulders weren't the prio for warrior for example. Now, it's true that things like hit and armor might be different from private servers, but to an extent only. If rogues are competitive, fury will be too, probably even more so. 
---
It seems like zoomers aren't excited for Classic üòï
---
wait til classic comes out before making any assumptions I guess, but it is my understanding that bows = crossbows since there are no inherent crossbow modifiers.
---
So would you say it's worth going to higher level mobs as a duo? 
---
The biggest one, pvp.  
---
  Might sound batshit crazy to most but I want those massive congregations, I want to play a mmo again, all the possible server drama, not this retail garbage.  
---
  The problem with this is that overall, I want a somewhat balanced population server and this is something I will not be able to know for a while.  
---
   
---
   My biggest fear is ending up on a completely one sided server.   
---
I play Diablo 3 or Path of Exile when I want to play an actionRPG. I want a cohesive game world in which everybody is on the same footing. 
---
20 different (whats the highest difficulty currently achieved in mythics) difficulties does not bode well for the community.
---
A scrub seeing how 4HM is still undefeated weeks later has a much better grasp on how difficult the content currently is. A scrub today has no idea what the different difficulties even mean challenge wise. The fractures the community more and more.
---
In vanilla pleb over9000 could help his faction defeat the alliance before pitching in to defeat a world boss.
---
No, if it‚Äôs from 2.0 its tbc, not vanilla. Was it in 1.12?
---
I really feel like you're overestimating your skill in PVE if you've never even used keybinds. I don't know if you're just doing dungeons or something but there is an entire world to explore behind how to be a better PVE damage dealer. 
---
Wronchi is that you?
---
Had a minor stroke reading that mate
---
Yeah I‚Äôm most likely rolling pvp and server balance is a huge concern of mine
---
Well, it's bad in pvp because you usually cheapshot. But against an orc, it is worth it, especially since the 18s bleed will prevent any restealth. And it's more damage than ambush I think. 
---
Or when your just starting out as 60s, and tranq shot misses and the healers go into panic mode.
---
You can easily host your own with all GM powers.
---
See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAvx590obg&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAvx590obg&amp;t) for a very simple guide :)
---
Try standing still and do nothing on Mandokir, Geddon, C'thun, Twin Emps, Kazzak, Vael etc. etc.
---
There is a metric shit ton of bosses that will instagib the whole raid by AoE abilities cast on one that just blows up everybody or chain cleaves like Vael.
---
Everytime I intercept an orc, they resist, so 100%
---
It does not impede on the heroic/mythic raiding itself.
---
However it lessens the sense of community.  
---
Even pugs in vanilla pservers are highly organized with spreadsheets to be studied on the internet to see if you are a banisher for this week as warlock, if you are on OT duty as tank, what your duty is on healing (raid or tank healing, what tank you are assigned to etc). 
---
Everybody is required to be in discord for call outs like strats or asspulls like the zerkers in ZG who get asspulled a 50% by totems. 
---
Even the least of pugs (AQ20 I'd say) have a whole lot communication throughout the raid.
---
Great stuff man! Could use some Mindless Self Indulgence songs, too.
---
I've been told by guild mates and strangers I've met in raids or dungeons that I'm a great DPS, and I'm always in the top 3 on the DPS meter addon. DPS is not a hard role to play at all so I dont think its overestimating my abilities to say that I'm pretty damn good at it.
---
Green, then I don‚Äôt have anything else tp do appart from enjoying the game once I hit 60. The grind from 0 to 60 is much quicker than the grind for level 14 and the latter is not even guaranteed...
---
Gosh there better be Oceanic/Aus servers. It‚Äôs strange though because On the Aus servers you can Phase to US. Going to assume that‚Äôll not be the case in Classic if no sharding / phasing etc. however, that‚Äôll mean for the first time ever US and Aus will not play together. üò∂
---
Awful? It's prestige and one of a kind legendary status on a server. Why would you think you could get that playing casually?
---
You‚Äôd want to focus on killing mobs around your same level still. The total xp a mob yields is reduced by some percentage for every level it is higher than you. High level mobs might still yield more xp than one your own level but it‚Äôs not as efficient due to how little the gain is when compared to how much more difficult they are to kill.
---
:DDD
---
6'2 dwarf reporting in, dwarf hunters are the best. They wouldn't have featured a dwarf hunter in the original WoW opening cinematic if they weren't top tier.
---
lol why would you choose it as your one goal if you did t even realize what it took to get it. 
---
When you get the weap/gear from rank 12 onwards do u need to maintain ur rank to equip them?
---
It‚Äôs worth it depending on a few factors.m, mainly what class combo you run and how crowded the location is. 
---
For grinding, it‚Äôs most likely always going to be faster up until you run out of mobs to tag. Many leveling combos can outright eliminate downtime all together (warrior + healer for instance), and be able to clear most of the elite quests worth doing.
---
The real issue is mob density and running out of quests, so some sort of plan should would be good if you want to get the most out of it.
---
But even if you‚Äôre not that kind of player, or leveling fast isn‚Äôt an option or important for you, leveling in a group will almost always be more enjoyable (you have someone to talk to, no downtime, can clear most group quests with ease, etc)
---
Divorce and gank, loktar ogar.
---
This post is shit. Delete it bro. Keep this garbage outside in a bin where is belongs
---
There's an excitement nothing but Launch Day can offer, despite issues arising.
---
To be safe, maybe chain 2 days with a weekend 1 week after launch or so.
---
I dont have any PTO yet, I started working at my current job 3 months ago. Still, I will be taking a day off when it gets released. I've timed it on a private server, and it takes 4 hours to get to level 10 with most races. I'm gonna get my main and one alt up to level 10, then get as far as I can with my main until I have to go back to work. Im hoping to get to level 60 in 3 months.
---
I got rank 11 and I fucking played a lot. Rank 14 is insane indeed.
---
They jumped version 4 for whatever bs reason 
---
How about Teebus in the character screen being a light sabre and the weapon he holds is a longsword with the fiery enchant. 
---
That's easy... Dwarf &gt; Troll &gt; rest
---
OCE, Horde, PvP.
---
I am **looking for a guild**, but I haven't totally decided if I want to go down the path I have been thinking about. At one point in the past not long after I graduated high school, I joined a guild called Onslaught on Akama intending to reach Rank14 - and due to various things (mostly alcohol if I'm honest, I woke up to play WoW one morning with a hangover and just kinda couldn't muster the energy and then that was it), ended up burning out just before max level. I've always kind of regretted that, and I want to give it another proper go. 
---
Let's get this out of the way; I don't have any especially noteworthy achievements from my time in WoW. I played a lot of vanilla, had three 60's, but only cleared MC and only reached rank 6 or 7 at best. I had two 70s in TBC, but played very casually at that point and ended up quitting only having done some of Karazhan. I've only played on and off since then. Point is any guild willing to take me on would be taking a bit of a gamble based on that history, but I'd like to think I've grown since my late teens/early twenties. Though I'm kind of rambling a bit now.
---
The classes I'm currently leaning towards playing are Rogue/Warlock/Hunter and maybe Warrior (being the class I quit at level 58 with in the past)... This may change between now and classic launch, but I can say I'm not keen on playing Priest/Mage/Druid at all. I don't think I'll be the best at anything I play, but I am always solid. If I sound worth your time at all, feel free to send me a PM here on Reddit and we can talk some more.
---
No you don't need to maintain the rank.
---
The problem comes with the huuuge emphasis on mythics+ and raids. 
---
The game is pretty much empty and cobbled together everywhere but mythic+ and raids.
---
By making casuals do LFRs Blizzard did not have to make a great game outside these two activities and it shows. Leveling even in new content is brainless, no challenge, no community, no partying up. It's just shallow. If want to play a 100% dungeon crawler actionRPG, I play Diablo3, because it does it better than WoW. 
---
At this point Blizzard might as well think about letting people queue for LFR and raids directly from Battlenet and use the LFG tool from the same battlenet interface as well.
---
The game is no massive anymore, it's not an RPG anymore. It's a dungeon crawler in which people do not need to see the light of day outside their instance shard.
---
WoW was so highly praised in comparison to GW2, because it had a breathing, living world, not everything tucked away behind dungeon portals.
---
I personally feel like playing Skyrim or Gothic2 when I play vanilla WoW on a pserver. A real immersive roleplay game.
---
TL;DR Catering to casuals made Blizzard give up on quality out in the world content which could be played by casuals. They instanced everything. Raids and mythic+ is the only thing worth playing nowadays.
---
Yep thats a lot of money. Plus Im already doing 2 weeks PTO for launch anyway. 4 weeks straight off might be a bit much though I would go stir crazy sitting in the house doing nothing but gaming that long. Id save those two weeks and use them later.
---
Is this some Kotaku garbage again? Why even visit that site? Why even visit any game """""""""""JOURNALISM""""""""""""" site at all? They are all top-tier garbage, including Rock, Paper, Shotgun, which I used to enjoy reading but is now filled with garbage MOBA, battle royale and SJW nonsense to generate those precious click.
---
But don't you eliminate the difficulty to kill while in a group of 2? 
---
If you are level 40 and grinding to 42 in Dustwallow Marsh Raptors, they yield say 200 exp divided by 2 = 100 exp
---
But If you kill greater elementals in badlands at 40 then they might give you 260 exp which gives your 30 exp a kill more and will be more effecient of you are I'm a 2 as you will kill the mob as fast, if not faster than you would normally at its same level
---
I made a (thread)[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ac8mav/a_brand_new_suboptimal_meta_spec/] on this topic a few months ago, although it is semi-serious :)
---
People set their own standards in the guild, if they are fine raiding with meme specs, then it is their own business. They have a freedom of choice, but not freedom of consequences. If you want to contribute towards raid optimization then present information more objectively and neutrally and let people draw their own conclusions whether they want to play this class/spec and what they should expect realistically. A lot of suboptimal spec folks are just fine with 5-10mans and being occasional last slot MC pug fill.
---
They can top DPS meters in BWL yet you're concerned about the time it takes to kill a Gnomer boss? lol
---
Why is it so important to you that it wasn‚Äôt additive? It definately was back in the day btw. Which is why they nerfed it with 2.0.
---
The tooltip could be clearer. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact though.
---
Because in BFA you have to do them or you don‚Äôt get to experience core content?
---
As someone else already pointed out. Additional in this case means addative, not multiplicative. Meaning 5% base stun with 25% added on top of that = 30% stun resist.
---
Three nice resources:
---
	XP needed per level [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding\_xp\_grid\_amount\_of\_mobs\_you\_need\_to\_kill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/)

---
	Vanilla Mobs levels by zone [https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI](https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI)
---
	
---
I've been using this to figure out routes in case of start areas being congested.
---
If we have sharding at launch there won't be excuse to "wait until the crowd disperses" so launch day is indeed #1
---
Classic is the recreation of a historic game, which is not available now. That's its purpose.
---
If you balance it, it's not Vanilla. It's something else. (Like TBC. Blizzard did manage to balance the classes much better by that time according to many.) And then Vanilla is still not available.
---
Just like you can play any number of other iconic games, like Mario, Zelda or if we are talking Blizzard, Warcraft, Starcraft, etc., Vanilla WoW should be available to play. To be able to experience it's unique style and charm, "flaws" included.
---
Also, a game's strengths and success in never just the result of the creators intentions. Chance also plays a part. Whatever Blizzard wanted and intended, they managed to create Vanilla and it turned out to be a great success. It can be argued that part of that success comes from unintended and unwanted features and "shortcomings".
---
To continue this, Blizzard did try and "improve" and "balance" the game and have been doing so since then. This gave us TBC, Wrath, Cata, etc. They always thought they are "improving" the game and in the end we got BfA. Do you want to give the task of "improving" Vanilla to current Blizzard? Or for that matter anyone at all? Many of the people who originally created Vanilla have left Blizzard, all of them changed, it was a long time ago. You'd never get anything resembling Vanilla. However this is just an interesting thought experiment. The main point is that Classic should be Vanilla so we can play it as it were.
---
Honestly. When I was an 11year old scrub it worked as follows:  
---
my guild was progressing in BWL, so they had people burnt out who just couldnt bring themselves to do MC and Onyxia. The raidlead instead of forcing them to bring their alts to further gear other members just brought the scrublords (like me).
---
I got some freebees from Onyxia (the crappy book) and did Zul'Gurub with them.
---
I never saw BWL or anything, but the guild as humans invited me and carried me along. You don't need a computer program funneling you into parts of the game if the humans playing the game can do this as a community. 
---
Humans &gt; bots any day of the week.
---
Why are you trying to split hairs? Crowd control is a game mechanic just because its not an inherent part of whatever fight you're doing at the moment doesn't mean its not a mechanic. I've enjoyed my time playing vanilla servers and will definitely play classic religiously, but this notion many hardcore classic fans have that somehow classic was just this gem of game design is just deluded. Is it fun? Absolutely. Is there issues? You bet your ass. Hell, some of those issues are being brought back as features in classic to appease the fanbase. 
---
But before I bloviate more I'll just end with this: 
---
Just because they've changed things in the game doesn't mean it's worse. 
---
I will spend more time farming than in raid, so yes I care about kill speed.
---
Read the rest of the comments, we came to the conclusion that on average you will need to farm Gnomeragan for 10 hours (not full hours, but close) to get your 20 pummelers to go raiding.
---
I enjoy everything about the game. Leveling up to 60 is just as much fun to me as being level 60 and completing raids. I never got to do the classic raids, so its gonna be a blast. 
---
&gt;Classic is the recreation of a historic game, which is not available now. That's its purpose.
---
That is it's purpose __to you__
---
If you check out this astronomical news [http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/kronos](http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/kronos) you may be hinted at one that has a PTR realm with commands. Intended to prepare for raid tiers and stuff but people like to make deck down toons and go to Tyrs Hand for some payback (yet still getting shoved up in the graveyard).
---
On mine they all started as hunters, then transitioned to rogue.
---
Maybe here is an actual unpopular opinion. The main thing I‚Äôd like to see changed in vanilla is implementing dual spec for everyone. I remember hating having to pay 50g a respec to pvp/raid. I was a young teenager at the time so I didn‚Äôt mind grinding for the gold. But now that I‚Äôm older, I know I won‚Äôt have the time to farm gold with what little playing time I have. I‚Äôm going to have to choose either pvp or pve because I know I won‚Äôt have time to farm the gold for constant respeccing. 
---
by your own logic ventrillo also harvests and sells your personal information, as does world of warcraft
---
&gt;Did those of you who did really consider it hard content ?
---
It's not technically complex, but that doesn't make it easy.  Unlike today, a large part of the work of killing a boss, happens outside the raid, with pre-kill gearing.  A lot of the fights were simple DPS checks, especially Vaelstrasz.  But a DPS check for an MC boss meant getting a lot of DPS gear \*before\* you entered the raid.
---
You didn't kill the boss on 4 different difficulties to learn the mechanics or gear up inside the lower tiers of the raid.  You either passed the boss as it was, or you didn't pass.  
---
Additionally, raiding wasn't the "be all and end all" of Classic, as even raiders had plenty of other side activities and exploration to do.
---
J. Allen Brack: "This is an important game in videogame history and there‚Äôs not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important." (Here: https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
The logic is that nostalgia is a memory and when you replay the game you won't have the same feelings and sense of wonder because you did it already. That is totally valid and happens all the time.
---
To get this kind of time, you'd better have a very efficient way of finding dungeons group !
---
Scrap bossfights. 
---
Even the trash becomes really quite difficult in AQ40 and Naxx and can easily wipe raids.
---
Base + 25% = 30% stun resist. Yes, it's OP af.
---
No, just as with the hundreds of other times it's been asked. It's based on the 7.3.5 api but we have no idea of the restrictions and such until blizzard either tells us or we get a beta/release. 
---
Im 21 and wish I was 17 again :(
---
I dont see how you could over hype something that people are already currently playing on pservers out of desperation. What are you on about? This post is fuckin trash dood. Delete this wet hot garbage
---
I actually want to switch to horde but i dont know the town and how to get places but the more important thing i feel like gear looks pretty bad on any horde other than male tauren.
---
undead have great caster animations but the way gear does not show on joints sort of ruins them a bit for me. troll is not too bad but orc's have to be the worst looking race with armour on 
---
Ooo...what if Blizz allowed us to log on and create our character but not actually play the game. Then we could spend hours a day looking at our character instead of reddit :)
---
Yellow
---
Tfw you get ganked by a rogue but then you use unstuck and you can now kill him from afar.
---
Thing is the meta changed heavily nowaday.
---
*Everybody* and their mom uses engieering nowadays, so you will get grenaded atleast once in a balance fight against an equal PvPer. Even thought nades work like incapacitates as they break on damage and have the gouge look, they are indeed stun effects.
---
Add to that Tidal Charm, the stun that pretty much each class has and the lack of warlocks on alliance side, Hardiness (25% stun resist) is just soooo much better
---
Perplexity vs Monkeynews

[https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0](https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0)
---
I'm waiting for you buddy. Try it.
---
Yeah, go run a character through LFR until you're the equivalent of heroic geared from only from titanforging - i'll wait.
---
People who only raid LFR are not suddenly hopping into mythic raiding - and mythic raiders aren't hopping into LFR to fill in extra slots (but  this was actually a thing when set bonuses were shared across all difficulties - which was shit and was good they fixed).
---
Link me a character that has enough titanforging to even take their ilevel up enough to normal raid level (385) - the whole "equal gear for doing less work" happens so fucking rarely that it isn't an issue to any normal person-
---
I doubt the client will be freezed to 7.3.5. The demo was but Classic will be "current" client used by both WoW versions - one client version to maintain and no problems with client-server compatibility in the long run.
---
You look so engaged. Ready to sacrifice all your real life responsibilities to become something real in Azeroth.
---
The brain-icon for talent points lol
---
It‚Äôs better than half the crap that shows up here.
---
The best thing about wow classic launch will be how all the posts about *can‚Äôt wait/release date?/share your memories/me a decade ago playing wow* will be gone.
---
stfu I can only handle so much hype QQ :D
---
Yeah like I said it was based on that, and that's all we know until they tell us differently. Wouldn't be surprised if it's updated to whatever patch we're in on live. 
---
Vent you host on your own servers, it does not need a connection to any vent servers. World of warcraft is a paid service, Blizzard doesn't need to farm your ass to sustain their business. I mean, they could but there's little reason incentive for them to do so.
---
The demographic of this sub is 25-40year old people who grew up playing super difficult games. 
---
Do you really expect them to ditch it all, because it's not LFR?
---
tbh i think it depends , id lean towards maybe taking the time off around 50 and trying to get as much done as you can or at 60.
---
its really not all that huge race to 60 unless you have a group that will be going hard trying to get into mc as fast as possible.
---
For most of the first couple hundred of players to 60 they will be stuck waiting for other players to hit 60 so they can do content.
---
there could also be server and load issues making the first 1-3 days unplayable.
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt normally play during the day, because kids. But on launch day I will be there regardless of time.
---
As for 60 I am honestly not that concerned. I will be leveling two at the same time, so hopefully about 1.5 months for 1 and three months for the other.
---
Barrens.Chat - Unofficial classic WoW forum that has some guilds advertising on it.
---
https://discord.gg/classicwow - This subreddit's Discord server, which has a guild recruitment channel.

[LFG Mondays](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) - Every week on Monday the mods sticky a guild recruitment thread in which guilds and individuals advertise.
---
Those are perhaps your top three resources for hunting down a good guild.
---
That's relative. If you're playing in a top world guild, or doing cutting edge progression in gear that isn't great at the time then yes, DPS is absolutely difficult, well maybe not in some of the vanilla raids but raids in later expansions. But more to the point doing damage as a damage dealer is perhaps 40% of what is important for them to be doing in a progression environment. 
---
DPS meters can be very ineffective because while doing great damage to priority targets is really important that's not necessarily what a DPS meter is measuring, unless you drill down into the specifics but generally people just look at the overall damage and make assumptions from that. 
---
That article is a whole eap of shit. But what should I expecr from Kotaku...
---
From a gane design standpoint tere are plently of examples of how 'easy modes' ruin immersion and flow and undermine the achievement factor of what the game couldve been.
---
LFR is a perfect example, but just one of them.
---
I find it funny !  
---
For me, Classic WoW prevent me to fully enjoy others games :) 
---
This screenshot is supposed to present various aspects of the game to the viewer in times when the very concept of MMORPGs seemed weird. You look at it and conclude:
---
- there are various races in the game, like humans and dwarves 
---
- you can use many abilities 
---
- there are interesting and special items ("hurls a fireball" &gt;&gt; suggestion that other equipped items are similar, even though they are not)
---
- you can play a warrior, but there are also spellcasters in the game &gt;&gt; as evidenced by the warlock
---
- varied terrain, with snow, forest, and even mountain in the background 
---
I think you're right, though it would be nice to finally have proof of that. 
---
Also going to be a mess if future client changes affect classic in negative ways. 
---
the vanilla quest tracker questie sucks pretty a really good modern quest tracker will be really nice
---
This might be the most naive comment I've ever seen. 
---
What do you mean? Didn't you also start farming Yeti's when you hit level 60?
---
Being an enchanter is a gold sink.
---
If you PVP the hunter needs engineering.
---
I would go mining engineering on the hunter and herbs + alchemy on the druid.
---
I don't get what's so good about the  Smoking Heart of the Mountain frankly.
---
Do it on launch day and the day after. I‚Äôm pretty sure you will have 0% productivity if you go to work during launch day, and you will wish you were playing anyway. Launch is half the fun!
---
+1 for dwarf priest. YOU will get to choose your guild, for the most part. I think it wins the most 'sought out' award.
---
Really though all the tank and healers will have a easy time finding groups for pve.
---
100% true. 
---
My plan was to get 60 within a month or so, and epic mount in another. Depends on how my money makers work out tho 
---
This always bugged me. UI is the basic way of interacting with the game. Who the hell starts and keeps playing the game despite not liking UI? Nobody assumed from the start that he will be able to eventually replace it with addon. 
---
Also, I always liked the default UI the most. 
---
I guess my reasoning is less around getting there as quickly as possible and more survival later on. I‚Äôm planning on rolling PvP server and after this initial hardcore stint I‚Äôll be dropping to 2-3h p/w so thinking was to try and get a head start to make life a little easier later on. Not that a 48h lead would stand for very long I suppose. 
---
tbh, did not expect 2/3rds to be younger than I at 33 :O
---
Maybe PvP isnt hard for you, but for me I can never get the hang of it. It seems like I get killed 9 times out of 10 when I get into a battle during a battleground or arena, and I tend to get killed pretty fast. In PvE raids and dungeons, a lot of times during a wipe I'll be the last one alive. I've actually killed Toravon the Ice Watcher by myself after the entire raid was wiped, and Toravon had about 5% health left. 
---
I don't 100% agree with this. I think if you laid down some ground rules and then brought some of those guys back as advisors then it could be done. You wouldn't want any of their current devs working on it, unless they were classic fans.
---
I do agree, it would be risky.
---
One could question the "efficiency" claim, with Kungen never using anything but default UI. 
---
Client changes should not really affect the games (aside of usual hardware regressions after every major patch).
---
I hate people who complain about getting teased for playing video games on Easy, like Wolfenstein did. You'll always get less respect for somethint if you haven't worked as hard for it. That goes for everything in life. Fucking live with it and play however you want.
---
Fun fact. Im not a native speaker, but I got a lot from WoW and in fact, studying English at University rn, and going to be a school teacher. Can speak pretty fluent in English speaking environment, but if someone like relatives or friends asks me to "say something in English", my language.exe often stops working
---
Lcd monitor.
---
Rich piece of shit
---
I know about the binary/partial thing about elemental resistance, but I thought for binary things, such as Fear, the chance went up as you got more resistance?  That said, I have no idea about how it scales.  It's possible it's not linear scaling, or if it is, it only increases at specific amounts and not per point.
---
I'm actually worried how I might skip making my char because I just wanna land in elwynn forest but I also don't want a dumb fuck char.
---
Aren't they going to be sharding the first few weeks? Shouldnt be any serious competition for mobs. As for server issues, I'm sure blizzard will be prepared. There's no reason they shouldnt expect a shit load of people to be playing at release. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if 50% of the current daily WoW players switch over to classic for a few days. 
---
If I were you, I'd take 2 days off on Wednesday, so you'll have off until the following Monday. You could probably get a couple characters to level 20 by then, with a third on the way.
---
i think its better to try and keep them pretty close level to you.
---
like you want to keep downtime to a minimum.  
---
leveling can be a pain solo because its so easy to pull multiple mobs, even if you live you need to drink and stuff. in a group you want to blow whatever you pull with less actions so you have less down time and not care if you pull a few extra.
---
also there is a lot of collection quests so if you each need 10 of some pickup you could need to kill quite a lot of the mob so you dont want them to be higher level.
---
if you are talking about jist grinding not questing yeah you prob want the mobs to be higher than you when you go to the area so you can stay in each spot as long as possible.
---
Implying you need a reason to corpse camp
---
Hmm, if there's no base resist chance or only 5% base, then 40% or 45% actually does line up with what I remember in Classic.  I know it sounds insane, but Classic was pretty wild.  The game wasn't very refined, in my opinion, until TBC, which is why I generally prefer TBC over Classic, though I understand Classic has its own charm.
---
Call work and say I got hit my a car. 
---
okey?

That guy better hide that poopsock before mom finds it and grounds him from playing WoW
---
Minor beastslayer baby. The equivalent of kids wearing superhero costumes for no apparent reason

There will never be enough warriors ( willing to tank )
---
Mages on the other hand..
---
I used to scam people all the time in runescape, but I'd never do it in WoW. Getting gold in WoW is a lot harder and to me it's actually worth something. A lot of blood sweat and tears go into your WoW character and all the things he owns, and stealing that is like stealing in real life. 
---
Runescape on the other hand, if you were dumb enough to fall for a scam then in my mind you deserved to be scammed.
---
Ugh, my joints... Did you never tell your mother that you can't become a professional gamer with those ergonomics?
---
i think you would get the most progress out of that 48 hours if you put it closer to or at 60.
---
like if you are playing minimal hours per week at 1-40 you should have rested and be able to skip a hell of a lot of quests.  maybe even at 60 so you could just do a bunch of dungeons , make some gold and profession leveling. 
---
i know the common thinking would be to put the time off on day 1 but for all we know servers could have huge issues, and if you do get stuck behind the pack a fair bit of that time gets wasted waiting for mobs to spawn and stuff
---
Murloc game &gt; wow
---
&gt; making the game easier completely changes the experience the devs want the players to have.
---
This. Finding the perfect balance between difficulty, frustration, and rate of player-success is the true artform of game design and the mix is incredibly difficult to get right. The right balance lives on a razor's edge. Let's assume the devs get it *just* right, and everything is exactly as they want it to be and what they believe to be the best mix for the player...you now expect them to add an easy mode for you? Fuck that. 
---
I disliked most of TBC zones, but I'd totally take Vanilla with TBC mechanics.
---
I'm aware of that, I just said that the hunnter is shooting as well.
---
Listen to the wisdom of your wife. Roll a dwarf, the most beautiful of races. 
---
And that is the purpose for the devs. You fail to understand what I'm trying to say. Purpose is subjective. Companies start to create a product, then see people using it differently, then they will change the product to their needs and wants if that part is the majority. Nothing is set in stone here.
---
wow u sound so cool
---
mininging?
---
Will I still have to do it if I choose it? 
---
They do
---
For onyxia. 250g for a spot, 250g for the tier2 helmet when it drops. Just pulling numbers out if my ass.
---
It's says mode
---
True enough. Fury and tanks are very different roles so they create some balance among the class's overpopulation.
---
i found amusement in it. unlike your post.
---
The Kaiser disapproves Druids.
---
No one is left out in video games, they just have to be more patient. Anyone can beat Dark Souls, it's just a matter of time. An average player might take 50 hours their first play through, a bad player might take 100. The worst player in the world might take 2,000 hours to beat the game...but no one is stopping them from sinking 2,000 hours into the game to finish it. 
---
What your proposing is lowering the height of a basketball hoop just to be more 'accessible'. Fuck that. Keep it the same height. Some people will have a harder time than others, but everyone is welcome to try. That's just the nature of the universe. 
---
You also get slight bonus for the size of your group, best value is a trio. 
---
Is this some unwritten rule for druids? Or both sides know that the other can just run away if he doesn't feel like fighting? 
---
I never did endgame raids in vanilla wow or in the early days of Everquest. But you'd hear rumors, you'd read about it, and it made those games that much more exciting, it added a massive psychological element of mystique, and I think it was vital to making the world feel like an adventure rather than a game. 
---
I think in mmo's especially it's almost mandatory that you have content only 1% of the population will ever access.
---
I think you now realise you're wrong and just trying to back out of the conversation.. this isn't a vague political discussion, he's just mentioning wow facts you can easily look up yourself. 
---
Do you really doubt there are poopsockers out there who will play this game 20+ hours/day at launch? The rough time for grinding the last few weeks of vanilla r14 was 16hrs/day+ ... those people are now 15 years older and have jobs and all the time in the world.
---
Funny because Megaman 2 did get a de facto easy mode relative to the JP version and people hold that game in ridiculously high regard. It pretty decisively shows that your views on game design are not at all universal.
---
Rp-PvP
---
( not really but these guys deserve there realm, and I know blizz is reading )
---
I felt that way with warriors. Leveling is hard enough for us as is. 
---
That's awesome thanks
---
Start off with gathering professions. If you want a crafting profession make sure to get a crafting prof that's eligible with that. When you're closing in on 60, drop the gathering prof you don't need and swap it for the crafting prof you want. Even if you sold all of your mats for gold, you still have enough skill points to immediately go farm all the stuff you need.
---
No, the point of it is not and never will be universal and singular. People define it on a personal level - in the case of Mt Everest, there are plenty who do it just for the attention, with the challenge being significantly lower on their list 
---
I was 16 to 18 and I'm 30 now (Jan birthday). I thought this too.
---
Gonna check this out ty :)
---
Very much agree with you. Had my try of PVP servers and they just seem to waste my time more than give that "epic world pvp". Also since I'm low on free time I can better use my time on a pve server (playing with co-workers).
---
Looks at night elf tattoo covering the right arm... sigh...
---
Basically. They tend to be less aggressive people playing the least played hippy healer class combined with the fact they have almost no way of killing another druid that's close to your level anyway.
---
The Fel Reaver is my best memory from BC leveling haha. This fucking Horn sound and groundshake when he suddenly appears and passes by scared me shitless back in the day.
---
use pfQuest, questie is trash
---
Definitely was added in the pre patch to tbc
---
It's centered around games like that precisely because their high difficulty being their defining point is a design flaw. It, to a lesser or greater degree, blocks a lot of people from experiencing everything else that those games have to offer, like the look, feel and style, or something like the overarching world and lore in the Soulsborne games.
---
Dont forget priest and warlock will use the same type of gear while leveling meanwhile paladin will use mail/plate
---
BoL doesn't scales, just flat number on top of your fol or hl, so no matter what rank of fol/hl do you use, you will get same bol bonus. 
---
Ok so I am currently checking where I can buy those books at a good price. Thx a lot !
---
took them long enough tbh, 9-ish years later...
---
If you‚Äôre raiding you‚Äôll probably never use a gun. I believe BIS progression is LBRS Xbow, class quest bow, BWL xbow the nothing till naxx. All the guns are fairly poor for hunters 
---
How hard would be to gear up shaman for all 3 specs in classic , pvp atleast?
---
If your first thought when thinking about sports is the professional aspect then you have already failed.
---
‚ÄúWe like to work our way up to things...‚Äù 
---
I'm not sure if you realized it or not but Scarab Lord is typically a 'one per server' type of deal.
---
The only way multiple people can get the title is if the gong is rang by another person within a relatively short window of the first person ringing it.
---
That and it requires numerous raid quests that require full groups to complete. Oh, and did I mention that the quest items don't drop for everyone on the quest? Only one drops per kill, so you literally need to decide who gets it in you guild. 
---
They actually did not do that at first. Cata's early dungeons are infamous for their initial difficulty, requiring far more communication than what people had eventually gotten used to in late Wrath, hence the colossal backlash and Blizzard overreacting to make up for it (which has set the tone for dungeons ever since).
---
&gt;Rank 14 is atleast possible without a guild carrying you for it
---
Maybe on a dead server
---
I'd be OK with just downloading and installing the client and patching it once a week.
---
You forgot that he's weilding Teebu's Blazing Longsword, arguably the most rare epic BOE in Vanilla 
---
It is a good compromise. Assuming you've been playing since that expansions started, you will easily get the pathfinder achievement and therefore flying as soon as the x.2 patch hits, as that part usually doesn't take long. When patch 7.2 hit, my former guildmaster never bothered to do certain achievements despite everyone in the guild doing them as groups. He never got flying in Legion zones.
---
Something I also forgot is, that usually the zones released after the x.2 patches are non-flying, thus giving the zone where the majority of the capped characters no flying advantage in world PvP.
---
Yet there are still people that twist the pathfinder compromise for their own agenda or to misinform other people. 
---
&gt; he's been playing it for most of a decade
---
so... he might have a pretty good idea of whether or not it ruined the game? 
---
There are some in winterspring too right? Level 55-58ish from memory
---
Second argument is the biggest one. You have to become pacifist when you can‚Äôt kill anyone (resto druid...)
---
I will be ok with undead palas and elf/dorfs shamans, human hunters, troll warlocks, but it will be completely other game.
---
I just don't understand why do they made such small amount classrace combo, it's even not about lore, because you always notice npc dwarf shamans, troll warloks etc. 
---
You can't say that something being difficult is a design flaw. It's a design decision. If it's too difficult for some, then they need to consider that it's not the sort of game for them. Or get better. Don't cry that it's too hard.
---
I was a Pug lead on Haomarush EU, id have couple of 100 ppl screaming at me every thursday and sunday, all the way from wrath Naxx to the end of firelands. The community I'd built died overnight when dragonsoul released.
---
I was GM of the Bloodstriders from day 2 of TBC and very few of those people wanted to join our successful guild. They were apprehensive or already in small guilds wth irl friends, some didn't want to commit to scheduling or let others down and many other reasons. I led those nutters through the Likes of Thaddius, Yog in Uld, The LK, Al'akir, and even Ragnaros in FL.
---
I had regulars who helped me out as I was also running a 2-3 night a week raiding guild (bit further ahead than the pugs haha) and we had a good community going. When DS dropped I asked in chat once and was met with "but there's LFR now". It was a far cry from the atomsphere and community that raids used to have, but at the time no one thought too heavily about it as it was convenient.
---
The worst part was it killed my guild too. No1 talks about this but the inclusion of LFR stripped guilds of old and young players who now had a more convenient way of raiding. I lost 30-40% of my guild that night. Players who realised they no longer had to deal with scheduals or loot tables and didnt have to wait for others, they could be free to just raid when they fealt like it. These weren't players who were the core community of any guild, they were the casual guys who were known but not always around. Good folk who always filled out the end of the raids. If you've ever ran a guild you would know they're the type who turned into core plaers after a while. Then the core community itself started to die off too but in a different way. They wanted to be all they could be and progress as best they could As they always had. With vendors from wrath gone, the way to try and fill in the slots they were missing was to spam lfr. This is where loot for me fundamentally changed and I found out my guild members were running 6-7 raids a week. 2-3 with the guild and the others on alts. They burnt out in less than a month and we changed the guild to pvp just to survive the last tier of the expansion. 
---
In the end a few of those people came back in MoP but it was never the same. Like me, they realised the only way they were going to enjoy playing was to relegate lfr to alt catch-up and just deal with having crap gear in some slots. That didn't work tho and people still did lef on thier mains. In the end they just stopped playing alts.
---
At first glance LFR seemed a good addition, but at every level there was fundamentally someting wrong. Even the players I knew who couldn't really raid before, realised the convenience changed the feeling and took away the sense of achievement. One told me he missed my pugs as now he couldn't raid. He talked about how lfr didn't feel right and he was the first person I ever heard talk about the weekly slot machine.
---
LFR wasn't the first or last convenience change in wow but it was one of the biggest shifts in how the game was played and type of players who would keep playing. For myself and many others it's was one of many bad changes, but it was the one above all else that really crossed that line. You know the one, where gameplay, community and depth are sacrificed in the name of convenience. The game never felt quite the same after LFR, I know my guild didnt.
---
RIP 'Sketrix Pugs' - It's a statement to the wind these days but anyone who raided with me - Thanks for the memories. As for anyone who was ever a Bloodstrider, Thankyou for the enjoyment we had. 
---
I learned how to speak English off Blue‚Äôs clues and Clifford the big red dog. 
---
You mostly stay in cat only for stealth and to get the opener, sometimes if its a clothie you can stay in cat to burst but you are gonna spend most of your pvp time kiting doting hoting and tanking in bear.
---
Was funny, I don't even play video games anymore. I'm just waiting classic.
---
Spending time to watch video about classic and this thread.
---
Please give us a date 
---
If you want to seriously tank as feral Druid, the heart of the mountain is almost essential. 
---
Ain't nobody got time for ergonomics when you were allowed to play an hour every day
---
Hey, I was on my phone and Reddit on a phone is not so good... I can't reply, it sends it as comments. I looked at Pantheon a bit. It does look epic, but I have some concerns about it. The classes are insane and I already know that I would play an enchanter because that class has been in my mind as the only missing class in wow actually. Haha! It's like a better version of a priest, but without the heals... 
---
My concerns, I'm pretty sure they will end up putting in expansions that will end up like wow retail to gather a bigger crowd at some point. Everybody wants money, nobody works for free. Their concept is Epic. The first two years will be epic too, and then the expansions will start... The MMO will suffer the same fate as every other MMO... I might be wrong, but I already see this happening. They have Investor Options up to 10 000$ since their kickstarter fundraising didn't meet expectations, that's insane.
---
It's actually pretty nice. If someone pays 10 000$, that person can be part of dungeon and raid design. I like the concept. I'd rather have a say on classes though. I prefer the brainstorming of skills and class balancing to the creation of content such as raids and dungeons. I have so many ideas for skills an classes, but not so many for bosses and etc. 
---
Anyway, I'm off track. The game looks epic, but they tried to make it look too realistic for me somehow. I like the cartoonish look of wow and Borderlands for example. I like the graphics of ESO and Elder Scrolls Games in general, but looking at Pantheon, it didn't look anything spectacular so far. We'll have to see closer to release since they're still in Pre-Alphas.
---
The suggestion was good, I'll follow the MMO. The classes are epic and the gameplay seems to push toward group content. It's interesting.
---
Actually, 11 3/4 years later if counting from Vanilla release in November 2004. DHs officially launched with Legion at the end of August 2016, although you could play them a bit earlier if you had the expac preordered. It's even longer :D
---
As usual, the answer will be a resounding no. If you change one tiny thing, why not change a thousand other tiny things?
---
If you are an offtank then yes
---
I disagree.  Games like the Wizardry series have difficulty as a key gameplay component because the entire experience is defined by how the player chooses to overcome the difficulty.  There was some thread on rpgcodex where a guy really nailed it when he said that Wizardry is a game about "running out"; the player is always running out of health, spells, and items.  The player has to make choices, "Do I go a little further and maybe find something wonderful in the next room, but risk annihilation?  Or do I head back to town to save my progress but maybe go slower?"
---
For games like Sekiro, well, I haven't played that one so I don't really have an opinion about that specific title.  But I'm a pretty hardcore gamer, and I like games that encourage and reward the development of mastery.  I've never been into MegaMan type games, but I've always thought it was cool when there might be a hard part that most players can't get past.  It becomes a badge of honor and a bragging right to overcome it.  A lot of games now are so easy I lose interest very fast.  Retail vs Classic WoW is a great example.
---
But I recognize I'm probably in the top 10% of players in terms of dedication and that many players probably do desire less challenge than myself.  Which is why I'm all salty about it, so many great games get made that just kill me in the undertuning of them.  Far Cry 5 could have been amazing if it wasn't so fucking easy.
---
At the end of the day, you're just going to do what she tells you to, so get used to playing Alliance ;P
---
so vague I would suggest survival melee spec with obsidian edged blade.
---
Rank 14 for sure. No way I‚Äôll ever get close to that.  Don‚Äôt care about the bug mount/title and I can wait for release!
---
Hmmm... Now I just need to find the *other* old geezer, and we can make a guild.
---
Did you guys ever /who "big bad raiding zone" and whisper random people asking them about what it was like?  LOL  I might have....
---
Let's be honest videogames are a man's world and the pet classes are pretty faceroll. xD
---
It's always funny the rare times you come across world PvP between someone who can just heal themselves forever but can't DPS for shit and someone else who doesn't have enough CC or good enough gear to out-DPS the healing.
---
btw u clear the 5x dungeons in like &lt; 15min so ur not spending a whole hour. 
---
but yeah takes a lot of effort to be a feral. the rotation is more fun than any other dps class though
---
Get your dad back online too.
---
There were already ppl quoting data and tests to you. The TPS of a feral is just higher than a prot warrior. With pummeler it isn't even close and even blows dual wielding fury/prot warriors out of the water, who by the way are eating much more damage than a feral druid, *except* the DW warrior is using the sit/enrage mechanic that will not be available in classic.
---
Note that you don't need to continously spam them at all and no druid I know does this, it is just another consumable at your disposal. Druids have the disadvantage of not being able to use most alchemy/engineering consumables while tanking w/o a pretty huge risk (shifting) so the pummeler thing can give them an edge when they want/need to push their TPS to untouchable values.
---
You can check out players like Skarm, who plays and has played all viable main tanks in all content and raids like prot, fury dw, feral and hotw druid. The druids weakness compared to warriors is snap threat (gaining threat in the first few seconds) and the lack of "oh shit" moves.
---
There are also plenty of people even in this thread who are off- and main tanking high end content *right now*. For the majority of bosses it is optimal to have a warrior, yes, but the flexibility of having a feral outweighs this easily. This is great news because it diversifies the possibilities for both hardcore and casual guilds alike.
---
Yep.. as a bear, when you hit for 130 ...
---
This is my levelling spec for shadow - [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMGsZZE0GzctRt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMGsZZE0GzctRt)
---
Blackout and silence are great for wPVP while levelling.
---
The fact that I don't / won't feel obligated to do world quests and shit on the offchance I get a titanforged item is nice.
---
If I'm a feral tank, I get bone ring helm and I know that's bis until after MC so it makes the payoff of having to kill rattlegore a few times worth it.
---
Probably lacked clarity on that comment, so fair call. More accurately. It is probably easier to get rank 14 solo for most people than to get Scarab Lord (for those who aren't close ;P friends with a guild master or actually a guild master)
---
Dwarf, my dude. The only acceptable alliance race. You guys all know which face and facial hair combo I'm talking about.
---
Tibia taught me english :D
---
Same goes for Parkway Drive - Wild eyes. Don't get me wrong, the playlist is nice, but theres quite a few songs that are clearly not from the old vanilla days. 
---
If Leonardo da Vinci was still alive somehow, and proclaims that he wishes he had painted the Mona Lisa differently in retrospect, should he be allowed to go and paint over the original painting, so that he can try to improve it? Or would people consider the original painting sacrosanct and forbid anyone from tampering with it? 
---
Many people consider video games to be an art form and worthy of preservation, just like paintings. If you change Classic, then Vanilla WoW will once again be unavailable to play in it's original design, lost to history forever.
---
Blue, I won't even consider other pill.
---
If you only stay in bear form then yes you mainly spam 3 buttons.
---
If you use your versatility, its a blast to play. In dungeon that mean finding way to innervate the healer, brez someone, decurse something nasty by kiting a little to be able to get out of bear to cast this.
---
In raid, that mean carrying 1 gear set for each role and adapt depending on the boss and who is online (actually with fire and nature resist set, that mean 5 set so bags are always full...) you will tank on some boss, dps on other (Powershifting is fun too) and decurse/dispell heal on a few. If you really play hybrid i find it to be one of the most fun class to play in pve.
---
We weren't born, we were made, and then we were cursed. Curse that wretched Yogg'Saron! I hope one day to be able to dig my way into his prison and drain his soul myself as he draws his last breaths through his thousand mouths. I will keep that soul shard forever.
---
Me watching my brother who usually only sticks to pve type content on all games. He was doing WSG on his mage and was just destroying people left and right.
---
Sadly pvp was never any good after wrath.
---
Oh man Parkway Drive. Almost forgot them!
---
Wow has an ez mode... it‚Äôs called PVE servers 
---
What a great statue btw. Where is that located?
---
I understand your point that not everyone gets to experience the content but I don't believe that's a design flaw. In fact, I think it's a brilliant design decision which has made those games stand out in a sea of mediocrity and propelled the Souls series in particular to such heights. If their defining element is a design flaw then why are they so popular? Why do they fly off shelves and develop cult followings?
---
They aren't unfairly or prohibitively difficult. They're initially too difficult for everybody and therein lies the experience. Anyone can play and beat them, it just takes perseverence. By preventing you from taking the easy road they force you to challenge yourself and experiment. That's the magic of these games. They're uniquely rewarding because you have to face adversity and overcome it to progress forward, develop your skillset and see all of the content.
---
Introducing shortcuts or simplified gameplay for those who choose not to persevere will destroy the gameplay experience for those who will. Veteran players would still play the harder modes but it takes away the experience of new, unskilled players experiencing something great by being forced to do it the hard way.
---
The videogame industry is overflowing with easy games. There are literally millions of options for easy, stress-free experiences. Why do we have to pressure developers to dumb down the few games that are intended to *not* be easy?
---
Nobody is entitled to experience the full content of something just because they paid for it. Take this example - People buy puzzles with extreme difficulty levels because they like to be challenged. If every puzzle was designed so that everybody who bought it could complete it without any perseverence or difficulty then those puzzles wouldn't be rewarding to complete anymore. It would ruin the experience for those people searching for a difficult puzzle or those who picked it up, couldn't solve it but decided to stick with it and eventually solve it.
---
Like I said initially, I'm abnormally bad at videogames across the board. Everyone I've ever played with is better than me at every game I've ever played. I would love to have an easy mode in these games but that's exactly why there shouldn't be one. It's a shortcut in a genre that's designed to be rewarding by denying you shortcuts. Not only would it be bad for the hardcores but it would be bad for me. So far I've never made it past the 1st or 2nd boss in any Souls game. Eventually I'd like to work hard and get through them. If there was an easy mode I would've completed them all but missed out on the experience they are designed to provide.

Don't think you can take a pot while charmed or sleeping unless you're somnambulist 
---
Truth is out of 40 people, anywhere between 10-15 could be absolute passengers. 
---
Sure you can cherry pick examples where that wasn't the case, but you can do that now as well.
---
With enough patience, you can get decently geared. There are a lot of random odd pieces of gear that are pretty much best in slot or viable for a long time.
---
It kinda depends on gear and purpose though. It would be easier if we knew the class you were playing. 
---
One thing worth mentioning is that melee classes  are much more gear dependent. You luckily get two very good weapons for ‚Äòfree‚Äô with AV rep, 
---
There is a bunch of items that when used deal damage to yourself over time, those item are generally used by pvper to counter sheep, charm, sleep,...
---
Hahaha this is so good. I wonder if this feather method would be a viable gold making option very very early on?
---
Also somewhat unrelated, I'm from Australia too if you needed horde pals to play. I plan on going pretty hard on release!
---
The difference here is that as any other class than warrior and rogue, you can run around with green melee weapons and still do considerably well. Might be more accurate to say they are weapon dependent
---
Lmao
---
&gt;You dont have to worry about saving for your epic mount because you'll never get it.
---
Made me lol. Why does everyone say the warrior is the slowest leveler? What's wrong with them? I thought they were the kings of classic.
---
I will play a Tauren in Classic but I must say Dwarfs are pretty noice.
---
Indeed. Gotta work on the first one to move on to the rest :D I always meet my deadlines 
---
Strangely enough, the underwater zone was one of the few things I enjoyed in Cataclysm. I found it very relaxing and had fun swimming around the ocean. I wish there was single player adventure game like this that takes place under the ocean.
---
How does a lvl60 warrior only have 2800 health lul
---
This is all very heteronormative!
---
Ah that, alright. Fair enough logic. Hard to say how big a factor it is, have you ever checked the rates of warlocks per faction? Wonder just what the difference was back in the day
---
Man... this is some serious shit. 
---
Inception is not something possible right now, but at least you can try hypnose to change her mind. 
---
This is a little extreme ? Not at all, she wants to play alliance holly shit ! 
---
Yeah same here i was expecting to be the old fart at 29.
---
Omg, I miss that picture.. That's literally every picture I envision when I hear "classic wow." That's the one that got me into wow.
---
Alright i see. What about mana issues?
---
There is zero, absolute zero chance you get it without no-lifeing
---
Exactly this. I personally watch 'movies' of story-driven games I know I'll never have the money or time to buy/beat. If the story is a crucial aspect of the game, easier difficulties are important. 
---
However, that doesn't mean every game with character dialogue needs it. As you implied (to me), a game that is 90% gameplay and 10% story shouldn't have it; this means Sekiro and Darksouls, etc...
---
what data? there is one link comparing fury/feral "tests" and it is with 100% pummeler uptime and another feral guide which says basically that druids do good threat.
---
cant anyone simply think a bit and calculate possible TPS?
---
for druid its easy ((MaulAvgHit * 1.75 * 1.3 * 1.15)/2.5)+((SwipeAvgHit * 1.75 * 1.3 * 1.15)/1.5) = TPS
---
for warrior i have no idea
---
Just going by what I remember there were very few priests at all. I was on EU PVE Alliance and I‚Äôd say most were human then night elf and last Dwarf.
---
Blizzard fixed everything wrong with wrath when they released Cata. I absolutely loved it. The wrath babies cried so hard though, and unfortunately Blizzard caved, nerfed that shit so hard and it was all downhill from there.
---
That definitely is a cool part of vanilla. How about boomkin?
---
You mention in your OP that boomkins are subpar, so right off that bat you already introduce some level of knowledge of the game.
---
Not to be a negative nancy, but.. doomed to fail?
---
Ron popped up in some gay porn I was watching the other day. I was like WTF!?!
---
After AQ boomkin can nearly 1 shot with starfire.
---
Obviously I have some level of knowledge but I genuinely have absolutely no idea of any of the Actual ‚Äúcontent‚Äù of the game. It will be expected that players in the guild understand their class to the best of their ability 
---
Paladins have taunt in BfA. Enjoy.
---
So even the famed Vaelastraz the Guild Breaker can be pugged on pservers? That's a bit sad to hear to be honest. Back in Vanilla Vael was the gatekeeper to being regarded as a competent raiding guild.
---
The 20 mans and MC could be muddled through with a mediocre raid group but Vael couldn't.
---
And with that requirement, everyone will google "best spec/gear for x class" etc.
---
What you are proposing is near impossible except if you somehow manage to force people to have zero contact with the outside world about how to play the game. 
---
pf is not much better tbh
---
As someone who loved Dungeon Siege 1(and WC3 of course,) this picture was absolutely astounding to me; being able to see a similar fantasy world in a full 3d environment? Aw yiss. 
---
WoW was EverQuest in easy mode
---
From what I heard only the /sit abuse will be fixed... which was pretty dumb if you ask me. 
---
A reckoning ret paladin will still be mad good in pvp even without the /sit abuse mechanic. 
---
VS hunters, warriors, rogues and ferals,reckoning stacks so quickly that the ret paladin becomes a hand of god.
---
VS spellcasters that crit with their spells, 30% of that damage is reflected on the caster with E4E... and it can crit... I've seen so much mages with low hp try to finish me with scorch only for it to crit and E4E reflect 30% of that dmg for the kill it's so funny and i've lost count how many times this happened... you also get a charge of reckoning, which no caster really wants in pvp... a big whack from a big sexy 2hander
---
build will be entirely viable don't worry
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the idea. Obviously people will be playing the best talent spec and pre raid bis just like any competent player of any game however the idea is since most of the guild members haven‚Äôt experienced classic we won‚Äôt know how to do raids like the back of our hand. We will have to read up on fights and determine methods to defeat encounters on our own. This way it won‚Äôt be a bore fest with a guild of people who have killed the boss 500 times on private servers 
---
In vanilla's day it was almost certainly a requirement. You might've got pugs *trying* 20 mans or MC but they were usually chaotic and didn't do well. 
---
Your best bet to seeing that sort of content done was to either be in a guild doing it or have good connections to one doing it and maybe landing invites to their alt runs through content they already had on farm.
---
I hear pugging everything up to BWL is more common on pservers, but I've never really played pservers. 
---
The difference might be population levels. Pservers had far larger populations (10k+ as I understand it) than vanilla servers did (and probably therefore will have?). That means fewer people available to fill out pugs and a higher proportion of the good raiders already locked into guilds that will probably be doing their own thing.
---
Depends how much of the pserver culture ends up coming into vanilla: you'll have smaller server populations and, increasingly as time wears on, a larger share of the Classic population either coming in from Retail or from a non-WoW background, meaning less pserver veterans as a proportion of the populace.
---
Full resto is pretty weak PvP-wise. Mana tide and +10% base healing isn't that much. Gearing won't be too hard, though.
---
Enh has poor gear options, mostly going with PvP gear or AQ40 sets (hard to get). Even then quite unreliable.  
---
Ele is an absolute beast, but gearing... AQ40 is great for gear(T2.5 is an ele's dream set, and AQ drops a good bunch of offpieces to burst hard those allies). Early on, not so much, though. Hard to gear, but quite effective and desired in premades.
---
Purple and green wouldn't mean much....may as well play on a private server where everyone knows you didn't earn it.
---
I'd pick blue, since I'm unemployed....but would pick yellow if I were. 
---
Holy shock is an amazing healing spell, it gives you flexibility to throw out heals on the move and react to unpredictable events during a pull.
---
What the hell?
---
That is because in Vanilla Ironforge is the main capital due to it being closer to Menethil Harbor and other places. The only downside i see with duelling outside IF is that its a pretty small area compared to outside Orgrimmar. I preffer to go down further below IF entrance where there is a big snow field.
---
Front of darnassus pls!
---
But what is the value? Scarab lord is a title, rank 14 (server first?) Gives you the best gear on the server untill late AQ/Naxx. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sbZVGt0s0xZxcbtrco
---
What will be my ret build at classic. 
---
Ironforge's gate feels more homely and cozy than SW's entrance though. For me, at least
---
Those have different names though.
---
It will move back to IF. The duels happened outside the main hub. In vanilla that was IF for the Alliance due to it being closest to Blackrock Mountain: Stormwind wasn't close to anything.
---
It's Stormwind in Retail now because Blizz made the decision to *make* Stormwind the hub. It's the best connected city to all the various types of content.
---
1. Get her to play a pretty female troll; there is 1 nice option I think.
---
2. Play an old male gnome to embarrass her for all of Classic. Make her wish she could punt gnomes, and maybe she'll re-roll with you. 
---
Yeah SW duelling came later in retail after we got portals everywhere and stormwind harbor. Ironforge is where it will be at in Classic.
---
The equivalent to what you're proposing is "Let's roleplay as stone age people. We will figure out on our own how to build, farm and rule a society."
---
Theoretically possible, but practically improbable as everyone has some degree of ancillary knowledge merely due to the amount of time the information has been available. 
---
no
---
Ret pally at the end of BC was stupid, like it could literally solo dungeons at the same level you would do them 5 man. 
---
Here one fella will clear out content with oddly formed group multiboxing. Other topics saying hybrids wont get into raids,spriest,enh,feral and so on:d
---
I think that Moonglade played a big part in this.

For real, rank 14 is my unicorn, I don't care about the weapons so much as just being able to say I did it. I managed to get gladiator and emperor in eso, however I know I won't have time to get rank 14.
---
21-25 represent. We're the second largest bracket, and were 6-10 years old when wow came out &gt;.&gt;
---
D:
---
I‚Äôm 30 years old and have been playing online games for the majority of my life, safe to say I‚Äôve had enough of being called every possible racial, homophobic, transphobic and derogatory slur you can think of. I am totally fine with the shit heels being canned so the ones who don‚Äôt have a need to constantly spurt out shit or berate people for no reason can enjoy themselves 
---
Sure, send me a dm!
---
Doesn't crossbow line have its own skill? Even there's items with +Xbow stat. And well, the racial states just +5 bow.
---
Rank 14 sounds nice and all but if I didn't earn it it'll ruin my enjoyment. Yellow all the way!
---
I love leveling. Love LOve LOVe LOVEeeeeeeEeEee. It is hands down the most enjoyable prcoess in MMOs for me.
---
It‚Äòs not classic if you adjust things to make some speccs raid viable. Also an aspect of classic, specc something for the greater good of your guild aside from your selfish choice. 
---
You miss out on some huge talents in fury if you go that route for pvp, 25% more damage from enrage is no joke.
---
They have to translate the original game to current one. Some discrepancys will apear.
---
Sneaky orc is appealing because it is contradictory. Kind of like how undead paladins or holy priests should be a thing
---
As a previous orc shaman, I'd say 30% seems right as well. :D
---
[https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/) :)
---
Better than vanilla wow.
---
I find that leveling my priest I usually go for mobs 1 level lower than my current clvl. That means less resists, so I tend to put two talent point in imp swp
---
Gets to 60, gets rare as fuck lightsaber sword... doesn't do defensive or berserking stance quests.
---
Hardcore!
---
It really depends on what your goal is.
---
If you want to reach 60 ASAP you should take the time on launch day, you'll want to get ahead of the curve (and solidify that lead) to avoid competition for mobs as much as possible.
---
Try searching on youtube
---
MOAR DOTS!
---
Doesn't really make sense to develop Classic on 7.3.5 and then port to 8.x. That would be a massive waste of developing time. They also would need to update Classic every time a new patch drops in retail aka nonsense.
---
Right after taking this picture she posted it on a mumsnet forum... 
---
"he sits there playing this silly game for up to 11 hours a day, please give advice. I'm worried"
---
Im turning 14 next month, i have only played bfa and legion but im still gonna play classic, it looks way more RPG then current wow
---
I don't think so, Orc vanishes immediately being careful to time it so that the bleed tick doesn't break stealth, gets free CS for 4 secs, KS slightly overlaps for 10 secs, throw in a thistle tea for hue burst during this to,e, Gouge for another 5.5 seconds totals 15.5 secs, Here you have the option of either popping premed and doing it all over again resulting in a win, or casting blind and throwing a grenade about half a second after you do to catch stoneform, bleed has wore off by now in either case and you are free to restealth or play more aggressively with cooldowns. Luffa is also basically a free stoneform trinket that you can use to completely negate this.
---
For duels the argument for best 1v1 rogue usually comes down to human or orc
---
I always felt it made more sense to be honest.
---
A: Stormwind was in disarray and the king was missing while Ironforge was still under the rule of Magni.
---
B: Stormwind had been burnt to the ground once before while Ironforge was a fortress that had never been breached by siege. Even in retail Deathwing couldn't touch it and we all know how Darnassus ended up. Dark Irons are the only ones to ever breach it but that was Moira's betrayal. 
---
C: It is really the most impressive of the three cities.
---
You have to look a bit more closely. The warrior in comparison is a DW fury warrior rocking a Greater Stoneshield Potion to make up for his lack of mitigation/avoidance compared to the druid and will obviously have *much* less health.
---
Skarm made a bunch of videos on this too, comparing the values/stats and the playstile of a DW fury tank vs a Druid. And the majority of reports from people will tell you the same.
---
They (dw fury and feral druid) are pretty similar in TPS yes. A prot warrior doesn't even come close to these values though. Vs a prot warrior you can skip MCP usage entierely and still come out ahead in TPS, and if you use them in this comparison then we're talking about 2x the TPS possibly.
---
Regarding to MCP specifically: One MCP is about a 5-10min farm time and has three uses for 30s each. My conservative estimate (out of experience) to calculate gold/time is about 25g/h. So a single MCP costs you about 6g max. That is in line or less than most high-end consumables. For example the potion used by the warrior in the test you mentioned will cost you up to double that amount.
---
If we're talking an optimized progression raid setup then ferals have a good place there as off-tanks and occasional main-tanks for certain bosses. There are more and more ppl doing this rn. And for casual/farm raiding it doesn't matter which one you choose/get anyways.
---
I remember back in the day there were a few people who would grind the NE mount  instead. I dont know how they did it but I do remember specifically at least 1 human riding around on a NE tiger at level 40. So it is doable, but how you do it, I dont know.
---
It is worth noting that you WILL have to go out of your way to grind it and it will probably set you back on your journey to 60 etc if you take time out to do this.
---
I personally think the horses, especially the Epic ones, are the best looking mounts for alliance ;)
---
are you even able to solo them as a 'relative' fresh 60 rogue? or lets say in pre bis gear? asked myself that a few days ago.
---
If a game journo says anything, believe the opposite, they rarely say something that's true.
---
My mistake, I think there were a couple of pserver videos that had snuck into the playlist. I‚Äôll update accordingly!
---
Orc has axe mastery which helps with threat, but there are only a couple viable 1H axes making this somewhat moot. Hardiness is pvp and Blood Fury reduces healing received, making it unusable for tanking. Best for DPS
---
Tauren has +health, nature resist (good for AQ), and AoE stun which helps with dungeons and aoe trash. Best for tanking.
---
Troll has berserking and beastslaying which can be used for dps and threat. Viable for dps and tanking. 
---
I would get mining + skinning / herbalism while leveling, have other blacksmiths make you gear, and then switch to engineering or alchemy at 60.
---
People duelled outside of Stormwind all the time when I played vanilla. So I guess its now my anecdote vs your anecdote. 
---
Do all the quests in darnassus island, darkshore, ashenvale, stonetalon desolace and feralas. This should be up to lvl 50 and you will have exalted
---
But Stormwind is only a short train journey away from IF and Stormwind is a much better city in general.
---
You can sell a scarab lord acc for a fair amount of money tho.
---
&gt; a supposedly weak mob
---
That weak mob is of skull level. That's at least... 70, then?
---
People are spoiled by modern wow class standards and believe that blizzard made some kind of mistake when they designed classes and it needs to be fixed.
---
If they wanted paladin to be a raid tank then they would have done so during pally revamp (patch 1.9 iirc). 
---
I will be honest, surprised by how few people over 35.  I have found on private realms the demographic to be much more evenly spread.  I would have guessed that there would be as many over 35 as under, maybe due to the polling sample on reddit being aimed to a younger audience.
---
How could I forget to plug the Guild!?
---
Yes, shameless &lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; are recruiting
---
Trying to decide between warrior, rogue, mage or ele shaman.
---
I played a warrior back in TBC and liked it, but I could just never get gold while levelling.
---
No chance in hell that you will get it by lvl.40... Not likely you will get it even if you try long past lvl. 60...  Back in vanilla doing every single quest that gave Darnassus rep as a human put you right below exalted (witch is what you need), hence to fulfill it relied on you doing a unrewarding/extremely grindy repeatable quest in Winterspring. First, several patches later (don't remember witch one, but I think it was as a response of people complaining about it for over a year) doing a repeatable runecloth turn-in quest that gives a lot of Darnassus rap and made it obtainable for most mortals.
---
On private serves rep gains are sped up, so don't believe experience based on those. In real vanilla it was EXTREMELY uncommon to see someone with a mount that was not from your faction... and usually that would be the AV exhalted Ram or the rare black steed that dropped from Baron in Sratholme.
---
Well, *obviously* nothing is set in stone. Blizzard might cancel Classic completely. A meteorite might wipe all life from earth before release.
---
I find this argument disingenuous. Preserving Vanilla is a very worthwhile goal, it is one of the stated goals of Blizzard and it's what the majority of player will be happy with (if not outright desire).
---
I'm sure a lot of people would be fine with *some* changes. But I'm equally sure there won't be a consensus. Everyone would want different things. Blizzard is not stupid. They'll cater to the "I want this and that and that too in WoW" crowd with current. (As best as they can and want.) Classic is a nice little project (emphasis on little) which is a very small investment with a guaranteed big payoff. That payoff is only guaranteed, however, while the game is Vanilla. If they start to change it to please one part of the playerbase the other part (which is almost assuredly will be larger) will be pissed off. It's a risk they'll not take, there is not enough money in it.
---
What I predict they'll do is release Classic TBC eventually and the other expansions too. It's the same logic. Small investment, large payoff. They'll not tinker with them. That will be reserved for current.
---
If we are to entertain unlikely scenarios, if Classic is so huge a success that it completely eclipses current, Blizzard will certainly take notice and might try to ride the wave, pivoting WoW in a new direction, etc. Still, they should be very careful. *Why* did Classic succeed so much? Not because it was "balanced" or changed to fit some people's desires. (Classic will be Vanilla at this point, you liking that or not. They'll not start and "rebalance" it now, so close to release.) Even if they decide to extend it, to work from it towards a new WoW, repeating what they did originally, tring to "balance" it, adding new content (expansions) it's super risky. What guarantees it'll turn out better this time around? And even if we are to be cynical and think that if Classic is super successful Blizzard (or Activision, if you prefer) will want all the money and throws wisdom to the wind and starts to change and add to Classic to try and keep the players playing (and paying) longer and more, I think a few original Classic servers will be left up. It takes basically no effort or money.
---
If you want to be a Scarab Lord my best advice - become a MT of a very successful raiding guild.
---
when i quest as human i will probably not go to darnassus island or darkshore. and as far as i know you dont get rep from grey quests. what can i do when i miss rep and the quests are grey?
---
As much is i want to dissagree just due to my memorie of it being in vanilla... Patch 2.0.3 " The title "Scarab Lord" can now be chosen in game for select players. "...........
---
Forking then pulling from upstream is the common way to do things, so I don't see why it wouldn't be in this case.
---
Rank11 or questing plus turning in rune cloth as mentioned above, no other ways of obtaining a saber as human
---
Hey buddy, 
---
Saw the wow guild post and just wanted to see what kind of stuff you were looking for in guildies. I have a full time night job, an infant, wife, and life outside of wow (compared to me in the past). I was curious if the guild you were making was going to be a guild where you had to be super active or if I could come chill, joke, drink mountain Dew, raid on occasion if the wife let's me, and try to enjoy classic wow. I also would have about 7 others with me from my guild, which is a 10 year old guild where we all raided in progression raids as either main tanks or main heals, served as raid leaders, as well as guild masters of the guild whenever the others got tired of doing it (well 4 of us have, the others aren't connected to the guild we were in) . Just wanted to touch base, as I've been looking at potential guilds lately. 
---
Also we are strict horde haha
---
Cheers, 
---
Caleb
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look into these
---
It literally won‚Äôt be possible for the first period of release before 40, there‚Äôs not enough ways to gain rep even on paper. 
---
There‚Äôs basically two viable options: wait for battlegrounds and turn in tokens only at the faction representative you want rep with, or wait for the AQ war effort and do cloth turn ins.
---
Other than that, I‚Äôm not even sure humans could get to exalted before any of the repeatable objectives started popping up. I might be wrong on that, but I‚Äôm any case it won‚Äôt be possible to get exalted before level 40 on release. That much I‚Äôm certain of. 
---
Bro dont ever make analogies between WoW and playoff hockey.
---
This penis cant handle that.
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about getting ahead of gankers who‚Äôll make my life hell later on. I‚Äôll only be playing a few hours a day max after this extended period
---
cool. grinding is no problem for me. as long as there is a way, i am fine ;) will probably grinding for runecloth or buying it at lvl 60. depends on what is cheaper.
---
Move yourself over to Night Elf questing zones (take your gear off and run/die/res your way there) and do your levelling as if you were a Night Elf. Make sure to stick to all the NE quest hubs: Teld, Darkshore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains, Desolace, Ferelas, some in the Hinterlands I think.
---
There's guides available if you google them ([here's a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9kjcgk/exalted_with_darnassus_by_level_40_saber_mount/)) that will get you a saber mount on or around level 40.
---
Ok then after the first 2 human zones move over to kalimdor and do quests there. 
---
Dude, Hellfire Peninsula was one big horror movie with this big monster SOMEHOW manages to sneak up on me countless times! The amount of times I was snacking and had to drop everything in my hands just to gtfo.. I know it's too soon, but I wish eventually we'll have an option to transfer to a TBC server to experience the leveling there aswell.
---
I forgot what level but you can actually swap to holy priest to level.  There are some talents that make smite hit pretty hard as well as holy fire.  Just a matter of do you want to spam smite to level or have a couple other buttons in your rotation.
---
&gt;	In that patch they also changed blood fury so it changed based on what class you were, e.g. orc warlocks got increased spell damage.
---
Ah man, I sometimes wish for #minorchanges.
---
I know the slippery slope is real, but in my ideal world, stuff like this would be fixed.
---
Anything from kotaku should instantly be disregarded, that site is littered with sjw bloggers who play mario kart for 2 hours a week and complain about how everything is apparently bigoted, sexist, racist, transphobic, toxic, etc.
---
As for raid finder, that wasn't making the game easier, it was a convenience, i'm not saying it didn't have its negatives, but spamming in chat  and walking towards a dungeon or raid portal only really took time, it wasn't challenge, infact i may argue that for higher difficulty content, non lfr/lfg was actually **easier** due to the fact that your group was actually much more dedicated and people were less prone to leaving because they know that they'd have to wait again to get into a new dungeon, and due to the fact that you couldn't switch specs nearly as easily, most of the community had a generally good idea of how to play their role, there weren't that many people who mained dps that occasionally played heals or tank for example, and players in general would be much more tolerant to wiping alot more times comparatively than the average retail player who has rarely died during leveling, meaning the group often stuck together much more in pre-wotlk.
---
Not true.

https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3785
---
Big dick, deal with it.
---
Each to their own, but Ironforge will be where people congregate. Why add a Deeprun Tram trip to everything you need to do?
---
Ironforge is ideally sited for both Menethil Harbour (for access to high level zones in northern and southern Kalimdor), Blackrock Mountain (BRD, LBRS, UBRS, MC, BWL), and is closer to Lordaeron (farming in EPL, Strath, Scholo, Naxx eventually).
---
Ironforge is just simply the most conveniently located city for the Alliance.
---
Did something just squeak really silently, or am I imagining things?
---
it's no changes
---
That sound coupled with the ground shaking and you just knew you were dead.
---
Authenticity is their primary concern. Expect no balance changes of any kind.
---
The game client doesn't have any knowledge about the game as the game is in the data part. It only job is to construct a game based on data that fits a specific format. Common pattern in programming to have strict responsibilities. What they are doing is adding support for missing features to the client so that it can construct Classic based on data constructs not present in retail. Demo used 7.3.5 client and that was a snapshot of what they had ready for the demo. Using 7.3.5 "forever" means that if they do any change to server-client communication in upcoming patches (or already likely did during BfA) it will have to be separated from Classic meaning supporting two versions of servers and two versions of clients. That is something you want to avoid in software development and devops as it increases costs and developers time needed significantly. Plus customers loose on new features like support for "normal" DX11, DX11 multithreaded and DX12 in the current client. They said they want it to work now and in 15 years. Making a fixed versions would work but would degrade with time just like Vanilla 1.12.1 client did. Handling two games on current client is slightly more work than one, doing jump upgrades like it is done with vanilla to classic is way more work and the service isn't provided untill the process is done.

And there is a reason why for retail instal all files were moved to "\_retail\_" subfolder ;)

Next couple of weeks we will get news of beta/stress test : I suspect there will only be a weekend long stress test much like the blizz demo with a level lock of 50.  I personally think almost all testing has been done during the dev period, closed friends and family style.  The stress test will be for hype generation and not much more, as all encounter and mechanics testing can be done via automation and simulations.  There have been hints that there may be no beta at all, but that neither confirmed or denied anything, but the fact a clue posted suggested no beta at all has to make that a possibility.  
---
The release date will likely also be announced at the same time as the stress test/beta which I personally think will be mid-end july.  
---
Call me an optimist, but the increase in the rate of information since the beginning of Feb leads me to believe they have started drip feeding information to keep the community engaged, but they are actually a lot closer to release than most people think and that the next month we will see much more information.  
---
Next 10 days:- details of pvp schedule
---
Within 28 days details of beta/stress test/launch
---
My launch prediction first week of July (but I think it could be as little as a month earlier than this)
---
yeah thats why youve been ridiculed and downvoted to hell...because of all that hot truth you're spitting
---
You don't remember the release of Diablo III. Or most MMO game releases in history.
---
That 11-15 bracket super underrepresented. Interesting, as 16-20 is somewhat more up there, and this is still players who probably didn't play in 2004. Fortnite effect on the younger bracket maybe?
---
No Changes

Jesus Christ, you're commenting a lot for someone who doesn't understand what the OP is talking about. He's not talking about going into this completely blind. He's talking about making a guild for those who haven't played Vanilla and haven't spent time on private servers and who would thus treat this as you would a new expansion on retail. Research and whatnot will still be helpful if not required, but the very obvious and very correct implication is that a lot of people who will be playing Classic will have a metric boatload of hands-on experience, some from actual Vanilla but predominantly from private servers, and so there's gonna be a ton of pressure on those who haven't experienced it to perform on the same level as those who have. The guild aims to alleviate that by offering a serious, yet not nearly as unfairly judging of an option for these people.
---
It's a solid idea for players who don't feel like being constantly yelled at by those who expect perfect knowledge and especially perfect execution instantly (and frankly, on this sub the latter make up the majority).
---
I wonder why you think SW is better than IF in general? IF being smaller and having a circular layout means you are generally always closer to most things. In general, it's less travel time within the city when you need to go for different places.
---
And then there is the location - in general you are at the center of the continent which obviously means you never have a really long flight. You are also close to a boat the goes to either center of Kalimdor or the north of Kalimdor, SW only have one boat that goes to the center of Kalimdor.
---
Lastly, IF is closer to more end game relevant zones.
---
I mean, it's fine if you just like SW, but I'd say IF is objectively a better city from a practical standpoint.
---
I've never, literally never, played any game on release. So it's not that I dont remember, I just plain dont know. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, maybe a cow‚Äôs brain can‚Äôt understand some frequencies.
---
In classic people dueled in front of iron forge bank since behind the pillar to the right of the bank entrance was technically zoned dunmorgh until wrath or so.... would be nice if that stayed :(
---
You can do it by going to level on NE zones ASAP because if you outlevel quests, reputation gains are greatly reduced (they changed it in WotLK I think to give full rep also on grey quests/mobs).
---
If you're alone you go on a suicide mission to change continent early on, if you have high level friends they can escort you.
---
No, no and no.
---
&gt; The guild aims to alleviate that by offering a serious, yet not nearly as unfairly judging of an option for these people.
---
Nowhere in the OP was this alluded to.
---
&gt; the interest in a guild predominantly full of players who have never played classic, this will allow for an environment where everything is fresh and not regurgitated 
---
This is what it was about. Stop reading things into my criticism that you maybe *infer.* Swing a miss, buddy boy.
---
People will gather in Ironforge because that's where the AH is in vanilla. Duels will in this case also be outside of Ironforge mostly.
---
AH is in IF in vanilla as well.
---
I see. Well, there's never been a release of a popular online game to my knowledge where major outages didn't occur. This is true for games where you expect such income of players, like the release of Diablo III.
---
Part of the reason for this is that the publisher wants to limit server count as much as possible to cut costs and avoid dead servers. I know sharding helps here, but does not solve the issue because cloud and microservice based architecture brings different issues to the table.
---
Classic WoW is a bit of an exception to this, because 1. I don't thing many people will try it out at release 2. It is based on an already working and stable MMO client and backend, which is Wow Legion or BfA. But I still think issues will arise, as did before.
---
Holy fuck your reading comprehension is garbage if you think that's not what the OP very clearly means from his comments and his submission.
---
&gt;b-b-but why cant palidyns get taunt lol??? why cmon its just taunt lol
---
What the fuck are you talking about, people used to duel outside of Stormwind aswell.
---
- Make a "not bad" face
---
- Inform my friends
---
- Take my 2 weeks off work

---
- Not enough

- Realize it will never be enoguh
---
- Get food and drinks for days

---
I bring you quotes, you bring me ad hominem. You lose the arguement by default.
---
&gt; at least 1 human riding around on a NE tiger at level 40
---
Are you sure it was vanilla? Because in WotLK they changed it so you could get full reputation also from low level quests and mobs, so it was easy enough to get exalted by lvl 40 (I did it on new chars), before that it wasn't.
---
You're not worth arguments when you literally bring none that are relevant to the thread to begin with. Your complete and utter misunderstanding of the OP's goal makes your comments absolutely meaningless. For people like you, only the report button is worth using.
---
They did it in front of both on my server.

I‚Äôm playing Tauren shaman in honor of my friend who tragically passed away a year ago. Never played vanilla, but watched him play a lot. Healing in raids and what not with his Tauren. What are good professions for the class/race and what is to be expected? Anything I should know?
---
I don't think there is anything wrong with "easy mode" raids in wow. Raid finder is different than just adding an easy mode because it removes the social aspect of raiding.
---
Yeah sure, whine and cry all you like that I stomped out your ridiculous attacks. I engaged with OP in a serious manner and had a back and forth. Sorry you were offended by that.
---
I always find it both hilarious and cringeworthy when people engaging in personal attacks in a childish temper tantrum threaten with reports. Get real, son.
---
No helm chest or trinks at 60 lol
---
The final boss is mid to high 20's so as long as you have some melee dps you should be fine
---
Okay but which is better:
---
1. a system that encourages you to step outside of your comfort zone and make real connections with fellow players in order to overcome obstacles and maybe gain some confidence.
---
2. a system that requires zero effort on your part to actually grow as a person, instead just throwing you into a situation so trivial that communication and teamwork are borderline irrelevant.
---
I don't want to sound like a huge nerd, but fuck it, I'm a huge nerd. MMOs like WoW actually helped me develop my communication and interpersonal skills. Everything that facilitated that went out the window with LFG/LFR and the casualized leveling/questing process. Adversity breeds competence, making everything easy feels "good" but is ultimately shallow and detrimental.
---
Having an unbalanced game is what makes it special.
---
Blizzard will not try to balance classes in classic. 
---
Ignore the village idiot. There are bound to be plenty of people in your position who want to figure things out beyond mere research at their own pace. I'm not sure this is the best place to advertise this though, as the majority of people on this sub have heavy private server experience. You may want to post this on r/wow or another similar place.
---
Just grind the cloth, but i‚Äòd recommend in a state of the game where you have some hear at hand, also questing in the early stages and doing nightelf rep quests is helping alot, being revered already is half the way üòú
---
I do think there were several other reason for SW to be picked. First of all, IF was the main hub in vanilla, TBC and WotLK had their own new hubs - this means SW had never really been the main hub and would be fresh to players when Cata came around. It also opened up the way for the cool "Deathwing destroys your hub" thing, which would be way harder to fit for IF. So in Cata it was logical to take SW. MoP had kind of a new hub, but also relied on the old capital - here I think they could have pushed for a different hub than SW. Then came WoD and Legion, both with new kinds of hub and same for BfA. Also, SW is way easier to launch new story from. They have a harbor and we keep going to new islands for expansions. We also have the king living in SW and both the old and new king are front figures for the story and have been for several years.
---
So I believe it makes sense to pick SW. It just fits better with the story and location. I do wish IF would be the main hub because I personally prefer it, and I think there is something to be said about having a main hub different from the city where the story progress from. SW being both the main hub, the place for the story and the main launching place for new expansions makes the world too small. Having IF as the main hub and SW being important in terms of the story would be cool, and with the train it is not even inconvenient for the players (besides, they tried to remove portals to make the world bigger, so clearly their philosophy *is* to allow a bit more traveling).
---
But the attention still comes from the challenge, if it wasn't challenging, they wouldn't get any attention from it.
---
Yeah he's lying. I saw more people with atiesh than a different races mount
---
Note that Kotaku is kind of full of writers who aren't hardcore gamers. They often don't appreciate challenging games/content and wave it off as being unnecessairily hard, while not understanding core game mechanic balancing, especailly when it comes to mechanically demanding games.
---
Use search
---
Endboss is lvl24 if I remember correctly.  If you and the mage are both 18 with everyone else being higher you should be fine.  If the whole group is 18 then you guys should be alright for most of it but towards the end you'll begin to struggle especially if you aren't well geared.  *Should* still be possible however.
---
And the AH was only in IF at first. Which is probably the main reason player picked it as the main hub.
---
&gt; C: It is really the most impressive of the three cities.
---
[It could have been so much more impressive!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOTtEpXf4b0)
---
And it doesn't have an auction house
---
if you prefer the small guild feel and casualness.. you could always form some guild alliances of other small guilds and raid together without forming a master guild.. though that comes with its own set of challenges. 
---
&gt; People will gather in Ironforge because that's where the AH is in vanilla.
---
1.12 has linked AHs in SW and Darnassus too.
---
OP did you play For Honor? Haha 
---
The typical orc warrior
---
The conversation was about basketball and taking it to highest and lowest points just like raiding. Those who want to push they can and become top dog at raiding and those who want to play dungeons can still get loot and get satisfaction of slaying monsters in smaller groups with less mechanics and information overload.
---
It doesn't mean start catering to dungeon crowd by removing entry barriers and difficulty, when they unwilling to learn or improve themselves.
---
You have failed to understand the conversation and just calling it a failure is just another failure altogether, as you are also experiencing FOMO. You just want to be part of the conversation but just does want to put any point and rates replies as failure.
---
When I first saw this I was like, yeah I wanna play and join the legions of valor! They sound so cool! 
---
You don't need a guild for it. Most pvp-premades back in the day (TM) were mixed guilds. Also you don't really "get carried" as much in the sense, because you still have to do most of the stuff yourself.
---
I only played until Burning Crusade and most of it was in vanilla so yeah pretty sure  
---
vanilla succeeded because it was easy.
---
No, your anecdote is not correct because it does not agree with my anecdote!!!
---
I just assumed that was what op was referring to, seems like an easy leap for someone to misremember it as a biological weapon
---
Ah okey! =(
---
Harsh as fuuuuuck
---
I'm pretty sure the guy you're supposed to kill, to gain his head, is in fact lvl 27.
---
Yellow pill for sure!
---
It was [1.9.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0), but it's slightly moved back in SW from where it is now.
---
Yeah Chromaggus is the true Pug/guild Breaker these days. Vael is just a dps check. When you bring 7 or 8 mages he gets pretty shmelted,  the only reason most people die on vael fight these days is getting buffer with burning adrenaline/bomb. Of course vael agro can still be a bit sketchy when everyones nuking their dicks off

Hey!
---
I was browsing some old threads &amp; sites from vanilla times. And among all the different pictures, I saw a name I recognized from this sub.
---
Would this be you? https://i.imgur.com/o2MYIgM.jpg
---
You guys seriously think they won't change ANYTHING? I have my doubts. I think they will last 1 or 2 days before things start getting patched and tweaked.
---
Fact is, humans are shitty people, and if exploits and bugs are there, they will get abused to shit, devaluing gold etc etc and resulting in Blizzard having to step in
---
Just my thoughts. Not saying that this will definitely happen, but in my opinion, thinking Blizzard will not change ANYTHING is simply unrealistic, *even if they have said this is the case*. If its hurting their profits expect it to get changed
---
While I do agree about class balance, I definitely do see them patching things like exploits and cheese strategies. 
---
Roll a Dwarf female and make her healbot you
---
My anecdote has a bigger dick than your anecdote!
---
&gt; A: Stormwind was in disarray and the king was missing while Ironforge was still under the rule of Magni.
---
The manual describes Stormwind literally as "the last bastion of human power" in Azeroth. It has gone a long way since vanilla but back then, it was much less prominent than Ironforge.
---
My dads anecdote would beat up your dads anecdote!
---
BLUEEEEEEEE EVERYONE PLAYS !!!!
---
Ah shut the fuck up. Everything is subjective, even your comment. Everyone is allowed an opinion you cunt. 
---
I think it'll be split between SW and IF now actually. SW for casual players and IF for raiders.
---
You know, a few people have brought up a good point that I didn't even realize and I've never seen discussed around here.
---
The actual player title 'Scarab Lord' wasn't added to the game until the 2.0 BC pre-patch. So, unless Blizzard makes an exception, nobody will actually have this title.
---
Obviously the mount will still be rewarded for ringing the gong first but no actual title to display. 
---
You can do what the fuck you want. It‚Äôs the same as saying ‚Äúhorde is better than alliance!‚Äù You completely blew this out of proportion. 
---
Nah, whatever XP gain brought you over from 59 was stuck in your face.
---
If you were 1 xp short of level 60 and then turned in a quest worth 1000xp, the bar would show 999/xxx Xp.
---
The rested part would also grow as well.
---
Dude, my left nut and pinky toe would be gone. 
---
The leveling will shock you if those two expansions are your comparison
---
You think IF doesn't have an AH?
---
ReAlLy?!?!??
---
I'am almost 100% sure that it isn't worth doing this with a low level group in terms of /played. It is a long dungeon. Especially if you bring 2x casters who will miss a fuckton of spells on high level elites. You might even wipe a couple of times.
---
Just do it with the appropriate level. I'd say about 22+. You'll clear it fast and efficiently.
---
There already was cosmos and loads of other add-on collections when WoW was released.. So much so that even the game magazines had articles about the add-ons and being able to change your UI.
---
Anybody recognize the badge on the yeti's nameplate? Doesn't look like the skull we're used to seeing, does it?
---
&gt; Starts to slow down after that in which I'd recommend 1h+shield for both ele or enhance.
---
If you are willing to put in some effort, staying with 2h staves and doing the Earthbind kite routine results in the most DPS with essentially zero downtime. 1h+shield is great if you want to level in a more relaxed manner, though.
---
Yeah, bro, I like totally find it not funny, dude!
---
That's fair to say.  As much as I liked the TBC zones, I can see how they felt somewhat too structured compared to Classic's and like they were practically made to just be "additional" and very purposefully made instead of natural.  I mean, I know that's all pretty obvious, and TBC was "just" an expansion.  Even though I treat each expansion of WoW like a different game, even a WoW expansion is not quite entirely a whole new game.
---
Additionally, when game devs keep going on and on with the same game, one could say they keep getting so much better that they get "too good" at making the game.  This is actually great for removing roughness in gameplay design, in my opinion, but in terms of zone design, I can definitely see how removing the roughness makes things less immersive because nature in real life is basically just one grand coincidence.
---
Oh, one last thing about Hardiness: Even though it sounds insane, it IS only for stuns, to be fair.  That means that in PVP it's only countering Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, and Hammer of Justice most of the time, although Pounce and Charge/Intercept would count too.  So it does nothing for roots, snares, fears, incapictates, and charms.  Yeah, I know there's Berserker Rage, but that has a cooldown and requires Berserker Stance, which is +10% damage taken.
---
eh, with the exception of needing a threat meter addon, as long as you're not healing in raids, the default UI is perfectly efficient. 
---
I agree. I would imagine they will monitor the Classic forums and hotfix if need be. 
---
That is a very good point. I guess we will know they are, but only by them strutting around IF or ORG on their mounts. But you are 100% right I had forgotten that!
---
I never heard if ventrilo outside of this subreddit and discord is just super bad in my opinion. 
---
We in Germany here almost exclusively use teamspeak 3 and since I can remember and we are keeping it that way I guess.

It's a rough one. I'd recommend bringing a mid 20s group just to smash it out so you're not wallowing in gy runs.
---
Jesus Christ, I didn't see the "l"

And the warrior will want to have *your* head for not killing the hydra for the mavelous twohand sword. &gt;:(
---
You can get the mount by L40 if you relocate to Teldrassil by L5 and do ALL of the NE quests. It's possible but don't expect to level quickly on top of that!
---
I think you're right, in the case of a planned duel with the right specs and all your CDs, and if both players play optimally. But if we take the same example in world pvp during leveling it might be way less in favor of the orc. I agree though on your combat scenario. 
---
Nah, you sometimes got the Argent Dawn Commission first if you had trouble finding someone with the mallet.
---
Yea I know. A bit off, but I'm too lazy to change. This is actually supposed to be a question from melderon
---
Haha, That‚Äôs true that‚Äôs true.
---
We can‚Äôt forget the warrior!
---
If your commitment was this easy to shake, you never even had a chance to get SL
---
In that case you pretty much won't manage until like L60.
---
The way people think these days is unfortunately a lot different to how it was back then.  Personally, I hope they don't change anything at all. I want it to feel as authentic as possible. 
---
I'm also hoping for the majority of the playerbase to be more mature, returning players from back in the day.  I'm pretty sure a lot of the younger generation that started playing the game a few expansions in, will quit shortly after they realise they aren't getting spoon fed...nay, FORCE fed epic loot every 5 minutes. 
---
But who knows. 
---
Modern MMOs or any online game for that matter always strive to 'balance' everything... And I don't understand why because if everything is at the same power level, it detracts from the flavour. 
---
If a class doesn't perform number wise, just make sure they're useful in other ways. 
---
Not to mention his name is "hammerfall" not "Hammerfall". 
---
Nobody ever meant bugs/exploits/cheats when talking about #nochanges.
---
Obviously if you can dupe infinite amount of gold by exploiting/hacking, Blizzard will step in to prevent this.
---
If you can make 100g as mage or hunter, then this is blizzlike. Both these classes were topnotch back then. Level one yourself or suck it up grinding 60g/hour.
---
Straight up bugs, yes maybe.
---
But they will not touch the balance obviously. Also balance wasn't nearly as much of an issue as people make it out to be. The classes in vanilla were so different from eachother (unlike the streamlined versions retail players have now), that balancing was actually very good. If you just use one metric to determine balance, then one class might come out on top for that metric sure, but the game is so versataile and complex that these comparisons don't make much sense.
---
To elaborate on your example.
---
&gt; Or we all know that Arms warrior was extremely strong for PvP back in vanilla. I'm sure a lot of people will be rolling warrior due to this. But do you think that Blizzard will maybe do some small tweaks and tuning to these classes to maybe bring their balance a bit more inline with other classes?
---
Arms Warriors were not overpowered even in the slightest. First off all they were the weakest 1on1 class. A fresh 60 Hunter can win vs. an epic geared Warrior in a duel. No joke.
---
They were extremely powerful in group PvP when backed up by heals, offensive and defensive dispell. This is where they shined. Not because they did the most damage however, but because they applied MS debuff and AoE fears to break a backline, while providing burst damage to focus down targets. That is a very distinct role. The bulk of the group PvP damage comes from Hunters, Mages, Warlocks and the like.
---
If Warriors were OP in PvP then premades would just stack them for AB/WSG which is not the case at all. All the classes have unique/distinct utility and roles in PvP. Warriors are the best at what they do, but so is each other classes as well. I would say vanilla PvP was one of the most balanced in terms of classes, even moreso than TBC which is often praised for its class balance.
---
I kid you not, I was so addicted to WoW as a Kid that I played this game when my big brother wouldn't let me play WoW just to have something WoW related to play. (he had the password for the account)
---
Yeah once you get into world pvp all bets are off
---
Let the Wrath babies believe IF is unimportant. They‚Äôll see the truth after launch, one way or another.
---
You sure you're not working on private server rep? In actual vanilla WoW rep was a lot less than private servers.
---
Human rogue is best pve rogue by a country mile. Gnome/Dwarf are good pve in different circumstances (dwarf good vs rogues, gnome good vs mages). NE rogue has good stat gain but doesn't really shine sans NR bonus I guess.
---
Problem with the sub being linked to the Retail version, is that the jerks on both sides are going to constantly jump to the other side and troll and harass players.
---
I‚Äôm really hoping to convince Blizzard to keep name changes and race changes out of Classic. Make people forced with their original character choice and any crap they stir up being stuck upon that character.
---
While over time we will most likely see Classic turn into what you experienced we will always get those trolls who come and stir the pot.
---
My one caveat is go Horde if you want more tank healing experience.  On alliance you would be competing against holy I-never-run-out-of-mana paladins for tank healing which means you will probably get relegated to spot/group healing which I personally didn't like as much.  Horde priests get to be the MVP of tank healing and it is fun and definitely not boring (except on farm content which is pretty bad because nobody takes dmg and you can basically afk).
---
Better off being a casual member of a raiding guild tbh, but learn which are the top raiding guilds and ask to pug with them and you'll likely get a chance to raid!
---
Okay folks, can we bring this to 1% upvoted?
---
Hmm probably release right now - would allow me to play and level before becoming a dad this summer. 
---
But Rank 14 is just so unobtainable for me that it would be pretty damn cool to have that stuff - it would make a lot of the experience kinda boring though, as there isn't really as much of an incentive to play if you already have that great gear. 
---
definitely IF still. It is the most convenient city for travel. Also, on every private server it has been the main hub as well. 
---
Now who's a good girl?! \*pets Onyxia\*

---
I mean there were some tuning that blizzard wanted to add to vanilla but the developers were forced to push it to the burning crusade. This included a variant of taunt for paladins.
---
Not really you want the boss to hit the tank so he gets rage for more threat &amp; dps, tank survivability is not really a factor in any competent guild.
---
Good response, thanks! 
---
From my experience on Pservers IF was the main duel spot for Alliance. 
---
If I was going in solo I would do PVP, but I‚Äôm no lifeing with my GF and Best Friend and they both want PVE.
---
I'm starting to think you might like the Barrens.
---
If you stay at work during launch days, there are 2 situations that may occur.
---
1: you wont be able to focus on work at all.
---
2: you'll be able to focus, but it will be an extremely long day, which will mean that the moment you sit down to play will feel ultra good.
---
Personally, since I wanna take my time with leveling, I'd just combine a weekend and those 2 days for extra gametime.
---
People seem to forget this tiny but very significant detail :p
---
I think this is good advice, you never know that person might like the break for levelling and say yes!
---
lol. Definitely option 1. 
---
What about if the boss enrages?
---
&gt;You guys seriously think they won't change ANYTHING?
---
Blizzard have been very clear about this:
---
&gt;"authenticity is our primary concern"

Who would actually blow 2 whole weeks of PTO for launch? That's fucking hardcore.
---
Just the "journalists".
---
There's some post 2008 in flames as well.
---
Well, it already is, since Classic WoW is only emulation of original Vanilla WoW (running on a modern engine, trying to replicate the vanilla functionality).
---
It already isn't the original just restored to functionality. It already has differences and changes. WoW never ever existed in the state that it will be released now in summer (1.12 with gated content, battle.net integration etc.) - so it's already clear that the intent is to replicate the original Vanilla feeling and gameplay and it's not recovering an art piece from dirt.
---
So changes towards the original purpose and towards how it was played back then should be fair game.

Ohh I had so many rivalries in Vanilla. I was an 11-13 year old in vanilla and I was incredibly stubborn. I leveled a rogue first to 60 and an elemental shaman right before TBC hit. Anyone in my vicinity would be a target for my rogue whilst leveling, farming or w/e. I'd kill them once and see what they would do next. If they tried to fight me when we met again (usually farmed an area or leveled in an area you would meet the same people some minutes later) I made it my business to make them go afk. This was a part reason my leveling to 60 took so long,  but jesus it was fun having people create alliance characters to flame me. That was such an ego boost to my e-penis at that age
---
It‚Äôs not splitting hairs I hate current wow doesnt adequately reward effort and gear resets every patch are obnoxious. 
---
I'm not being funny, but if you think that translates to "we will not make any bug, balance or exploit fixes" then you are downright stuoid
---
Authentic is not the same as identical. 
---
That flaming long sword and the wow website page 
---
If the boss enrages the small chance to miss isn't going to help if it one shots you the next hit. It shouldn't enrage though tbf, dps should be far higher in classic than it was in vanilla. 
---
Thank you very much for the help! Also your comments above towards the other guy were completely correct, thank you for your reply :)
---
Will this work properly with shards? 
---
I wonder if someone willl make a raider.io style thing for classic to see your exp in dungoens and raids and to not invite unexperienced people. 
---
Well i have felt that leveling is so easy its just plain boring, hope classic will be delivering more challange
---
Spent most of my time outside of Ironforge gates at level 60 
---
I see. So if I roll Moonkin just stick with Moonfire and Starfire? And Hurricane on AoE packs?
---
If you want to do this, you should absolutely do your best Night Elf impression, run straight to Teldrassil at level 1 and start questing there. Skipping *just* the 1-10 Night Elf area will lose you ~8k repuation and even more than that in Darkshore. Capital city reputation also cascades to other capitals of your faction, meaning a quest that gives 100 Stormwind rep will also give 25 rep with Darnassus, IF and Gnomeregan, even though that isn't displayed in the combat log under regular settings.
---
The decay for rep starts as soon as the quest turns grey (more than 5 levels lower than your character) and is 20% less rep per level, bottoming out at 20% of the original value. So for example, a level 10 quest that is worth 100 rep will give the full 100 for all characters up to level 15, 80 rep at level 16, etc., and only 20 rep at character levels 19 to 60. You will be missing out on massive amounts of rep by not doing everything at the appropriate level range.  
---
If you mess up and undershoot, there are two ways to still reach exalted, but they are both massive pains in the butt:  
---
1) The repeatable Morrowgrain hand-ins in Feathermoon Stronghold or Darnassus. Long story short, this will work out to gaining ~30 rep per hour, more if you have 150+ herbalism, and more if you're human, of course. Most importantly, it can be supplemented by buying the ingredients or the Morrowgrain itself from others, because neither are BoP, but it will probably be pretty expensive if everyone and their mom is going for Darnassus mounts. It's not a lot of work, you only click a single button once every ten minutes, but it's sloooooooooooooooooow.  
---
2) There are repeatable quests for every capital city called "A Donation of Wool/Silk/Mageweave/Runecloth" that give rep for handing in stacks of cloth. This is much faster than option 1, but also extremely expensive if your plan is to just buy all the cloth outright.
---
There is also a whole bunch of caveats:  
---
- We don't know if rep values on private servers and classic databases are accurate. These values have changed individually throughout Vanilla's patches, there seems to have been a blanket increase to all quest rep values during the transition to TBC, and our most "reliable" info comes from old thottbot comments, which could always prove to be simply inaccurate. This includes all the numbers I'm throwing around here, lol. When in doubt, the numbers will probably be even lower in reality than what they are on private servers and Classic databases, and the ordeal will take even longer.  
---
- The repeatable Morrowgrain quest in Feathermoon had its rep rewards practically doubled by adjusting it to be on par with the Darnassus quest in patch 1.3. We will *probably* get the buffed version because Blizzard has said that everything that was in the game from launch will be in its final 1.12 state from the beginning, but again, we don't know.  
---
- 1.3 also buffed the Morrowgrain drop rates from the Evergreen Herb Casing, but only if created by a Herbalist with 150+ skill. Nobody knows for certain if that will also apply in Classic until a decent sample size in the thousands is collected, but again, no way to tell right now.  
---
- 1.8 increased the level of the repeatable Morrowgrain quests from 50 to 55, so that characters level 56+ would not experience rep penalties from handing in a grey quest over and over. Again, we can make the educated guess that we're getting the buffed 1.8 version, but we don't know for certain yet.  
---
- The repeatable cloth turn-ins were introduced in patch 1.5. This is the trickiest one - handing in mountains of Runecloth is both the simplest and fastest way to reach exalted if you fail to get it from quests. There is probably even an argument to be made for completely ignoring the hassle and just level normally, which will be much quicker, and then simply farm for gold and Runecloth much more efficiently once you've hit 60. *But* we have absolutely no clue if these quests will be there at launch - it depends entirely on whether or not Blizzard considers them essential parts of the content phase they should belong to (and therefore go through the process of individually removing them) or not, in which case they will simply be there in the 1.12 base they're using. We have no info at all on what their stance is on this.
---
TL;DR:  
---
- Start questing in Teldrassil at level 1, not doing so will probably end up costing you multiple days of /played time in grinding out gold/rep later  
---
- Do every single Darnassus rep quest in the game at the appropriate level  
---
- When no Darnassus rep quests are available in your level range, try to do other capitals' quests instead for cascaded rep  
---
- Start the Morrowgrain quest chain ASAP in Feathermoon Stronghold at level 47 to supplement quest rep  
---
- Hope the cloth turn-ins are in the game from launch (this is the one trick that makes it extremely simple)  
---
Soft enrages which happen throughout the fight get tranqed by hunters.
---
The hard enrages which happen when some bosses dip below a certain amount of health normally happen at the last 1/3 or even 1/5 of their health.
---
At 20% warrior threat goes through the roof, because they may be able to execute on GCD.   
---
In the enrage phase it's even more important than before that the tank gets as much rage as possible, to dump it into fending off the DPS from overtaking him.
---
Better gear allows you to have an advantage in PvP and as a requirement for harder content. This is true for any expansion and classic is not an exception. I'm not sure, therefore, what your point here is.
---
its great, that classic wow will play alot of older player! Sometimes when I play CS Go (or even fortnite with my younger cousin) I play with 12-18 year olds and I feel really old -.-\^\^
---
This will be running patch 1.12 bro. Every major city has an auction house and they are linked
---
FF is often requested, never insect swarm.
---
I don't know the numbers, I doubt a Moonkin will be able to use debuff slots if I'm honest, last I checked they go OOM stupidly quick and are a waste of a slot if not healing. 
---
I think there's one called Subnautica, that might... float your boat.
---
I've only ever played as Alliance and never played Vanilla, but my fondest memories are of WotLK shaman - so I'll try playing Horde for Shaman. 
---
2 questions...
---
Seems on this sub classes get tunnelled into one spec a lot, min/maxing I guess. Is elemental viable in raid content? Or will I struggle for invites?
---
And does my race matter that much? I like the class fantasy of Trolls the most, but Tauren have the better racials from what I gather. 
---
No doubt about this whatsoever, do it OP
---
Can confirm stone form is one of the best rogue v rogue abilities in the game, better than perception by far
---
They do go out of mana fast. I was thinking if my gear was good enough I can low rank my spells and I will level Alchemy so I can make 100 mana pots.
---
Bro, go warrior/hpaladin, trust me, this is a unstoppable combo and you don't even need much gear to make it work.
---
People in bgs will also love to have a duo like that, for 5mans you can tank and for raids you can go fury.
---
But that's not Teldrassil at all!
---
Haven't heard about this ever. Not sure how I would've reacted as a kid, but now in my mid 20s I'm conflicted on how to feel about this vid. Something inside of me thought midway through "No no no, they're not gonna kill everyone, right?" and when I realized they were gonna go for it, I got kinda excited tbh. I felt like shit for thinking like that, too. Many people commented that this event actually made her immortal, and I can agree with that. Some people like to guilt trip about it, but in the end it's still a video game. They did the event in a contested zone with no guards whatsoever, so it's kinda their own fault. And the fact that people who knew her said she liked pvp too makes it not so bad after all, to me. So many people who didn't know her think about her, just because of this video, which is amazing.
---
So yeah, really hard to finally judge this situation. It triggers emotion and thoughts, that's for certain.
---
I think you forgot a "2" in the stun resist. Tauren stun is indeed aoe, up to 5 people. 
---
If you grab the quests, this place is worth it from an EXP standpoint, as well as the quest rewards, which are probably decent for the level you can pick them up. Look in one of the vanilla databases under Zones-&gt;Dungeons for BFD, and see what quests are available &amp; what level you need to be able to pick them up. This will give a ballpark estimate of what level you should be.
---
You won't be authorized to use moonfire as it uses a debuff slot where better debuff could be used.
---
Most of the debuff used in raid are for increasing damage of caster / melee instead of pure damage debuff.
---
fakce, character name starts with lowercase
---
In all seriousness, to answer your question, the Horde has always been the underdog in WoW, and I like playing the underdog role.  It is a documented fact that Blizz developed the Alliance races/zones first, and had to rush out the Horde.  This is why the Ally capital cities and zones are much prettier than Horde.  However, I believe that the Horde side has more character, even if they don't get cobblestone streets.  Also, in my experience on servers, the Horde tend to be more PvP focused.  
---
I think certain bosses like patchwerk insect swarm would be a great use of debuff slot
---
He‚Äôs human, so with the rep bonus it should be easy to get by 41-42
---
Mate don‚Äôt worry about these morons. You are completely in the right. If they want a memorial they can go fuck off to retail. 
---
Do you know what the other 8 debuff slots will be? Or do we not know yet?
---
Well done.
---
I received a message like this out off nowhere on my priest (P-Server). The dungeon was appropriate level for me so I went like sure. Did not plan on doing it. But ended up doing it and making a few friends along the way.
---
I used to do this when my group needed a tank for strat/scholo. I distinctly remember more than one occasion where I messaged literally every single available warrior on the server and none of them were interested or even answered. These memories are why I'm rolling tank this time!!
---
It's a good tip though, there were definitely other times where we did find good players this way. We were on a RP server and it seemed to be really low on tanks, other servers probably had it easier.
---
Anyone who thinks this is a good idea is retarded and should stick to retail
---
Oh ok it‚Äôs AoE, and wow I misremembered that stun resist chance lol
---
You‚Äôre the one who needs to grow up. 
---
You'll have to fight my wife for the chance to do this.  And trust me, you don't want to be on the opposite side of a fight with her:  she is of Italian descent, and when she gets mad, watch out, or she'll whack you over the head with a frying pan.  
---
What do you think are the chances of them removing the debuff limit?
---
As the saying goes in real estate, it‚Äôs ‚Äúlocation, location location‚Äù
---
9th of august, it just came to me, from a greater being or feeling.
---
Can confirm, roll face on keyboard as rogue and get 50 kills
---
(Behold! Wall of text incoming)
---
My go-to role in most games is either tank or dedicated support (i.e. buff allies, debuff enemies and/or cc/pull them, little to no healing, which I dislike). PvP focus (wPvP, BG premading or not, all included), but interested in (semi)hardcorish raiding. Consider alliance side, but not set in stone yet. This are my class considerations from least considered to more: 
---
Classes I'm not interested:
---
* Mage. Good all-rounder, nice cc. But not appealing to me, quite squishy and spambolt focused PvE. Ranged and squishy for someone used to mostly be melee and bulky is quite a difference.
---
Classes I consider but don't feel like it:
---
* Priest. Poor cc but quite good buffing. Healer in most group stuff, quite a bummer even if it's the healer that feels better in my experience (I've played them all tbc-wotlk -I'm just a BC baby...- even if some only briefly). Shadow is only considered for wPvP or any solo stuff, and quite tough to gear.
---
* Shaman. Ele is a blast, know it firsthand (it's the class I've played the most along druid). But gearing is tricky, survivability isn't great either (just raw ehp aside from interrupts(shock)/groundings and maybe kiting if possible) and worst of all, PvE is full healing only on a healer I know it bores me to death. 
---
* Rogue. I'm used to be a group enhancing menace. Rogue lacks team utility. Even then class fantasy and playstyle are nice. It's just they feel bad in the group PvP situations I enjoy so much.  
---
* Pally. Deep ret, deep prot feel so damn close to my style. Good class fantasy and quests (even if the charger's quest isn't available at launch). Sad is, most will want you as pure holy, quite boring IMO. Gearing is annoying on either of the 3 for itemization (green healing bracers until AQ+? and well, prot and ret feel even worse...). Played it as an alt during tbc, shocka was quite enjoyable. Changes in wotlk drew me away from it. Don't feel like doing the uphill route again (as I did on shaman and druid), though. It's not good for my mood. 
---
Classes I seriously consider:
---
* Lock. Again, class fantasy is great. PvP feels nice if geared enough, despite being ranged. PvE is just like mages but with less AoE and more threat issues with no threat reducing option while also taking longer to ramp up. 
---
* Druid. My all-time main. Class fantasy is great. As with both pally and shaman healing is the issue, and actually the one I'm more unwilling to since it's been enforced by guilds on me too many times in the past. On the other side, I'm a feral diehard. It's the only reason I do consider the class at all. But even then the obscure clouds of healing and the not-so-clear PvP (which feels like a poor choice, unlike tbc feral which, even being an underdog compared to the resto-god, felt quite fine) make me think about it. 
---
* Warrior. Tank. That's the keyword. PvE is great, having the option to tank and the option to be a DD as well. PvP feels a bit off, though. While strong, its survivability and group utility are far from good. You're there to execute. And well,  they are known to struggle on their own a lot unless overgeared. And this becomes an issue when you consider it's the class with most competition for gear and maybe spot if we consider raid tanking.  
---
* Hunter.  Fantasy is nice, but scaling issues are a concern, gear being token-based for AQ+ content, barely no weapon post-Chrommagus' xbow (no weapon upgrade for pretty much 2 raids on a weapon user? Just one on the actual last boss in-game?). PvP feels a good enough challenge, but unsure gear stuff and scaling can end up affecting it. PvE I feel it is arguably the closest to what I seek: pulls, tranq, kiting certain adds/bosses... even if damage isn't great and the competition for the few spots feels like it may be fierce. 
---
Problem with that is, why would anyone take a boomkin that is having to downrank or go OOM instead of a Mage it something else that doesn't take a debuff slot, does a lot more damage even before down ranking. 
---
I had my 17 inch LCD until 2013 lol.
---
Now i rock 2x 24 inch screens.
---
Glad to hear that you have enjoyed it, jonesy289!  BTTF is a classic series, and thus pairs well with classic WoW.
---
It's not as unpopular as you think! 
---
The issue is not that Dual Spec is bad, the issue is dual spec is opening a door.
---
This was me all the time, to the point that the priests would end up replying: ‚Äùyou asked me this 10 minutes ago - the answer is still no...‚Äù
---
I'll take just about any kind of post over armchair dev bitching. 
---
The chosen one!
---
I did it with Runecloth all the way as a Gnome back in the day. Wasn‚Äôt too expensive.
---
Pserver world chat is a nightmare. It really makes me question being a part of the classic wow community of so many people are *that* racist, and proud of it. 
---
inside ironforge using the spot next to the bank is the best.  hope its there in classic
---
I have a spreadsheet with all of my characters planned out. 
---
race/class/gender/name/professions/horde or alliance/server type
---
Play alliance with her on server X, then play your main horde on server Y
---
this, i think it was gone in wrath ;( 
---
It hasn't aged well because Vael was easy as shit back in the day too, it's just a DPS race tuned for the shit players we were back then and ofc the whole 1.12 talents debacle. You shouldn't expect Vael to be the guildbreaker again.
---
You need a good amount of rep to clear MC. I doubt a full guild will be able to level to 60 and farm that much rep
---
It all depends on how serious you are in raiding and what you want to get accomplished.  For example if you want to be on the cutting edge of raiding where you race to 60, min/max items, want a guild that going to be pushing content multiple times a week... then else shaman will be hard to find a guild.
---
If you want to be in a guild that‚Äôs more layed back and more friendly than hardcore then ele shaman will work just fine.  Ele shamans have decentish dps for a hybrid and they do bring a lot of buffs with your totems, plus another Rez or off heals in tough times never hurt.  
---
Honestly play what you will find the most fun.
---
If you are just playing to be hardcore and go a class that don‚Äôt prefer I can‚Äôt see you having the most fun you could because unlike later expansions, you are stuck with your main character unless you feel like dropping a SERIOUS amount of time rerolling 
---
Well, I will try my best and hopefully they will see that. I will get the best gear I can and use my elixirs and such. I have a feeling I will at least be in the middle of the pack when it comes to DPS. Because there will be new players who have no idea what they are doing I imagine.
---
I used to wear a tabard in dungeons, but I have no idea if this is possible in vanilla.
---
Just saying. Classic wow isn‚Äôt going to fix this and you‚Äôre gonna be more depressed afterwards. Most of you people need more sunlight and social interactions to stave the depression back. 
---
&gt;I used to do this when my group needed a tank for strat/scholo. I distinctly remember more than one occasion where I messaged literally every single available warrior
---
You can now whisper every single paladin and druid as well (especially druids)
---
It is still limited to how many people are on in the role you need with time who are interested and haven't done it and want it. It's a small group. Then, the ones with fps and who know what they are doing.
---
pros:
---
plays wow
---
plays alliance
---
is serious about alliance
---
keeps you from playing horde
---
cons:
---
plays nightelf -  can be negated by playing druid
---
result:
---
the only problem is you!
---
0% but it comes from 8 debuffs to 16 debuffs when ZG patch is out if I remember correctly so at that point your guild could let you use swarm and moonfire just for the lulz but only on farm content
---
Thanks for the info! If I remember right (and I could be very wrong), they reworked the holidays at some point in BC or Wrath. I have very vague memories of there being holidays in vanilla that nobody participated in because you didn't get anything for them. 
---
Is this true or am I remembering wrong?
---
Curse this English language, which is obviously biased towards the Alliance!
---
My best gear largely comes from my weekly m+ chest. A +10 is certainly easier than heroic raiding, yet much of the gear I get from the chest is better than mythic raiding.
---
Really? What would you suggest they are better than?
---
There will be no sharding on the majority of Classic's lifecycle.
---
People don't give a shit that you've never done a dungeon before, because it doesn't matter. As long as you know basic dungeon stuff (what your class should do, how to pull, manage threat) you are fine, because:
---
 - There is no gear check in any of the dungeons 
---
 - There are no complex mechanics in dungeons, only ones that give flavour
---
Ignoring somebody doesn't stop the only discussion topics every being politics. 
---
No you've got it right. Some of them were pretty small and not much to do but it's nice that they're there even if it's just some decorations around the world.
---
Yea, I still raid...it‚Äôs why I‚Äô m still playing retail. My point is that itemization feels much worse now than it did in Vanilla ‚Äî not that there is nothing in the game that is difficult.
---
Dailies in BC, Easy/Hard mode select in Wrath, everyone saw it coming but we were still hooked.
---
no. 
---
interesting! How come so many?
---
Care to share what you've got planned? üòä
---
Depents, are you already in a hardcore guild wanting you to be 60 asap and ready to raid?
---
If not, just chill and take your time.
---
SW for lyfe
---
&gt; But having 10k people on at once as opposed to 2.5k probably has a lot to do with it. Four times as many people means it's a lot easier to find forty people for something.
---
There's been one private server operating at a time with those kind of numbers. I don't think it's possible for you to generalize all private servers as if they have 10k players as the rule and not the exception.
---
Even on servers with 2-3k players there's a stronger pug culture than vanilla had, I think it has to do with the tightness of the raid schedule. Back in vanilla I think most players spent significantly more time raiding because clears took so long. A MC/BWL/ONY raid day was probably only possible for very hardcore guilds, whereas it's managable in a PuG these days. Seeing as people are spending much fewer evenings raiding they have more free time, which leads to more people having alts. I believe the pugs are formed because a number of people want to raid with their alts as well, and some people can maybe not raid at the time of their guild or whatever, so 10-20 form the core and pug the rest.
---
It does seem to me that PuGs going for BWL require a much higher degree of coordination. Those pugs usually involve sign ups and so on so it's not like they're as spontaneous as 20mans.
---
Haha, I always wondered why TB was deserted, yet their bank always seems to have foot traffic!
---
About 0.
---
You should not be using anything besides starfire as your damage ability anyways, unless your target would die within 2 seconds (which is not long enough for starfire cast) and you might be able to squeeze in wrath or moonfire. 
---
at long last you learned from your mistakes
---
Haha, it happened to me too. But kost of the time I was that priest. 
---
I think the current plan is 16 from launch
---
I had the same dilemma. 
---
To avoid getting burnt out before launch I rolled a class that I will not main and also on the opposite faction. So the classic experience should be fresh come launch. 
---
Zoomers BTFO.
---
Only bloomers are allowed in my guild.
---
Not necessarily. If you have competent developers (trust me I do this for a living) you won't lose much time by doing this. 
---
Also those players "who can't be bothered playing longer than a few days to try and better themselves" might have unrelated reasons for wanting an easy mode. For example I don't have the free time to truly dedicate to a game to master it. I'm not incapable of it, but I also play hockey, spend time with my SO, work full time, and lift 7 days a week. So to me I would like to be able to enjoy a game on my terms and still feel I made some sort of progress in it. There is nothing wrong with that either. 
---
I want to make all my characters right away so I can lock in the names, but I don't want to spend too long because I want to jump into the game.
---
Casters and healers for days!
---
Oh the horror....the horror...
---
Savor the experience IMO, the real experience not some pretend server one. 
---
Remember, Classic isn't going to be like the PServers out there. Some have different ability numbers, gear stats, etc. The biggest difference will be Classic having spell batching, which is something no PServer has been able to successfully replicate. No reason to get yourself used to a fake server.
---
Most of the time I just pretended to have forgotten their name so that I could try and convince them!
---
If anyone interested, I've created something very similar: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7zzng/looking_for_group_monday_april_01_2019/ejxlx8l/
---
We are close to full but a few more people are welcome.
---
I still remember buying the game. Reading the box over and over while Installing it. Starting my first character. 
---
Me pre kids for sure.  I was over the top then, Played a minimum of 8 hours, up to 16 hours some days, mainly 10 to 12 though.
---
Now, six kids and wifey, I couldn't even if I wanted to, but its a nice dream!
---
You will likely burn out, because:
---
- You have to farm consums for every raid, burning through hundreds of gold for each raid night
---
- You will be the lowest spot in gear priority (rightfully so)
---
- Any random lock, mage will just come to the raid with zero consums, shit gear, stand in one place spamming a single button and do more dps than you
---
- You will still go out of mana
---
- You won't be in the middle of the pack unless half the raid is semi-afk (I'm not joking)
---
It is nice than you can keep the guild to a more manageable size, imo a 20man guild is the perfect community size whereas 40 is a bit too many. In my current pserver guild we tried an alliance as we were gear-ready for MC but not raidsize ready, but the fucking drama man. We had like three officer meetings a week discussing how to deal with the shit from the other guild etc. It was so much extra work it really didn't seem worth it.
---
I would strongly advise anyone to only use alliances as temporary means untill your guilds are strong enough solo, but this usually means one of the guilds has to die.
---
That‚Äôs good to know, thanks for your response. At this stage I‚Äôm mostly just hoping to not be completely ignored when trying to get into end game content - I‚Äôll be playing pretty causally. :) 
---
I was actually the same way about this game one time during a long maintenance that lasted a day or two.
---
Thats a bad anaoloy.  What I'm proposing is lowering the skill level of the other players (NPCs) so it makes it competitive. Some people don't have the time to dedicate to a game like that but would still like to play it, and that's okay, nothing is lost by letting them. What do you get as a negative aspect to that? How does it hinder you?
---
So play or dont play? hahah
---
as a long time dwarf pally player this made me sad lmao
---
My plan is to just keep reading up on things that will help when I do start playing again. 
---
When it is released I will play the opposite faction I played originally, and on a pvp instead of pve server so it will be even more fresh. 
---
This statue is actually on the campus of my hometown in germany lol
---
Yeah, my wife enjoys demonstrating the flipping skillz of her night elf to me.  And showing off her nightsaber mount.  Blatant favoritism on the part of Blizzard devs, I say!  \*seething with jealous rage\*
---
Good idea
---
53 here. Can't wait to play again. That pink dress will be mine.
---
It can go either way. Sometimes people like to punish comments that say "I know this will get downvoted" for exactly that reason.
---
Well I "joined" a guild like 4 months ago already. But I already planned everything I needed to know. 
---
I did played from 1 to 15isch a few times. Knowing the quest route I'll be taking and work on what proffeccions when. So I' ready.
---
I always get "attached" quite fast to my char and I dont want that yet.
---
So from now on I'm waiting.
---
It will! One thing to note is that nothing is voice acted in Vanilla. So it will be easy to miss the text for cool story quests as they're simply woven in with the kill/collect quests. Keep an eye on those quest descriptions!
---
I think you still needed to define what your were looking for. If you /who warrior it will only show people who have warrior in their name.
---
For class specific searches you need to use /who c-"classname" and then the level range. You could even look by zone with adding z-"zonename"
---
Ah thats a good idea, will you be spreading out over different servers? Also dumb question, how do we even know what will be a good server? What's the best way to judge these things?
---
Considering there will be a lot of retail players who will just check it out because it comes with the sub, and considering plenty of those never played vanilla and are pampered by the conveniences and hand helding of retail, I suspect there will indeed be a massive amount of "quitters". 
---
&gt;Typical /played time to 60 for the people who hit it first is more like 3 days now.
---
this is wrong, more like ~4-5days on private servers and that might differ slightly from classics leveling time
---
23/m, also played WoW with my dad as a kid. He's not going to play classic though...
---
Man I hope not, otherwise, WE WANT FRESH! Every month. In game, WoW I think to date is the least toxic playerbase Ive ever experienced in a game...except the last time I tried modern again which was at the end of Legion and holy mother of fuck, I thought people were just being sensitive, but my first BG in years and the people in it could've easily competed with LoL levels of cancer.
---
I think people forget there are 40 raid spots now....
---
Its really jarring seeing that post in the new forum design. 
---
Clearly shows that I didn't play Vanilla... I had no idea that Ironforge was popular because of Blackrock Mountain, I just thought it was popular because of how cool Ironforge was....
---
That depends on your goal and how much time you have. If you are looking to hit 60 ASAP and take advantage of all the benefits that come with it then I would say you could play on a P server to maximize efficiency. But if you want to really soak up that experience and take your time then I would say hold off. 
---
What I did a few months ago was play a class on retail to lvl 20, then played the same class to lvl 20 on a P server just to compare and contrast and see if I really am interested in Classic. And no surprise my experience on a 1.12 server was far more engaging and fun than on retail. Though I suggest this only for people who are on the fence about classic. However a P server is by no means a perfect recreation as it does have flaws but from 1-20 the experience shouldn't be that different. 
---
In the end it's your choice, but I want to experience Classic with as fresh a set of eyes as I can and make plenty of mistakes, just as intended.
---
Bingo, as a war this is my same experience. Normally when I get those PMs I'm like "Awe, man, I'm way over here leveling and I don't feel like dealing with others right now". But something in me just says *do your responsibility* and I hesitate but will just about always say "Okay".
---
It seems like every time I've done this I make new friends and have a blast. I haven't regretted it once.
---
Well my anectodes uncle works at Blizzard so i think we can agree that my anectode is the right one here.
---
Sadly this logic has one huge flaw:  Raiding in a casual environment means much longer kill times. 5 minutes instead of 2 and so on. And long kill times are disasterous for boomkins. 
---
Um no, just the basic elemental resistance buff from paladins/shamans was something like 20% chance to resist a binary spell iirc.
---
This comment gets 10/10 YIKERS for cringe.
---
&gt; Perhaps the biggest issue is that Bears just flat out do more damage than warrior tanks, leading to quicker/easier runs.
---
This is 100% it for me. I've tanked on classic on both warrior and druid and druid is totally effortless compared to warrior. You pump out so much threat by default that you can just blast through dungeons hardly thinking.
---
So here's my take on this. You can build exclusivity while still opening up content to others. Confused? Well the idea here is that the more challenging progression based versions of this content can still have hard to get and exclusive stuff. For example legendaries, mounts, pets, etc. Basically the fact is by sitting down and saying "hey, you don't have the free time that this other person does so we're going to punish that" all your doing is turning people away, which doesn't build a community (ever wonder why FFXIV is so much more tight knit than WoW, this is why). On top of that you never really know where talent will come from either. You may find a best friend or a really great player in a casual who just never thought to put more time into the game for any reason. 
---
Basically allowing access does not deny others top tier experience. I'm not a bodybuilder (yet) but I can still go to the gym and workout. All gake keeping does is breed resentment between the haves and havenots. 
---
And.... That's the reason horde got blood elves. No cute race otherwise.
---
Using a warlock to show why you need to group up when leveling, then using a warrior to show solo play... I miss the days when no one knew anything about this game.
---
They are by far the nerdiest.
---
Very capable? In strat UD and scholo perhaps. Everywhere else it's "do-able"
---
&gt; of people I see post here 
---
The same damn people say retail babies are going to fall off
---
The same damn people say the population is going to have tourists who drop off
---
The same damn people who freaked out over loot trading because of how toxic it would apparently be
---
Which is it guys? Does the game have some grindy un-fun elements that make the fun stuff more rewarding or do you like 3 ungoro corpse walks in a row?
---
Yeah ive been playing lord of the rings online where you have to read quest text so im prepared!
---
Last vanilla patch was 1.12
---
Scarab lord was pre tbc patch 
---
So no , no scarab lord for you in classic 
---
It‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs more popular because the city is better laid out with shorter to the usual services. 
---
yeah. sure...
---
So you‚Äôre saying yes since you‚Äôre saying no to the no?
---
There‚Äôs sunlight and social interaction in WoW 
---
&gt;I if you think that translates to "we will not make any bug, balance or exploit fixes" then you are deliberately misinterpreting what they are trying to say.  
---
&gt;Authentic is not the same as identical.
---
That is exactly what I wrote...
---
They will recreate the vanilla feeling, they will fix game breaking bugs and exploits that was not part of the Vanilla experience.
---
But
---
They will NOT "balance" classic. They will make it as authentic as possible.
---
It‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre very gear dependent. So while leveling you‚Äôre usually wearing a rag tag collection of greens, with the occasional blue quest reward that you outlevel soon thereafter. 
---
So sure decked out in purples they can wreak havoc but the journey there is a slow one. 
---
You link a source where the only mention of Battle Shout is that the talent Improved Battle Shout has been renamed. I'd like a source on that 2500 threat battle shout at level 60 in 1.12 please.
---
I started playing wow when I was 11. But I had played DAoC and Everquest since I was 6, so I was a pretty experienced MMO player by then.
---
A lot of people my age (16-20) started playing Wow in tbc and wotlk, so we heard about the vanilla experience but never got to play it.  Honestly I only really started playing wow properly in cata since I wasn't old enough to raid/do anything end game related until then so its a chance to go back to old wow that I missed out on by being so young. Also the demographic of Reddit users in general and people hyped for release to be on an unreleased game's subreddit tend to be young adults and teens. 
---
that's kinda why I mentioned it... back in vanilla I actually was in a non-guild affiliated raid group... we were just people from like 5-6 small guilds but not everyone in the guilds raided.. I was the only person in my guild who raided at all until bwl.. but we cleared to twin emos in aq40 and like 2 wings in naxx..  we did a dkp system and since we were sorta a meta guild, there was no real "guild" drama..
---
funny enough we started as an mc pug and everyone made fun of us for pugging mc but we got 40 or so people and started an official raid out of it but we weren't guild tied..  sounds like a lot of effort to manage.. I was just a mere warlock at the time.. but it worked and it was a lot of fun! and I had my guild and my raid friends.. so I kinda had the best of both worlds since we had like 20 people in the guild.. so we stuck to 10 man's and just small fun together.. 
---
Absolutely do not go to work on Launch day. Even if you sit at home and eat hot pockets and try and log into WoW Classic. It will be better than going to work.

Hi, /u/JHoneyBadgerS

I remember that there was the game about it, but surprised how well made it actually is. Just finished arena and Hakkar.

Also a fan of that adrenaline. From my recent experiment, I had fun wpvp until lvl 30 ish and after that I found myself helping the opposing faction with their chicken quests, waving and getting ganked.

My heart says green, but my mind says blue.  I already have the PTO ready otherwise it would be yellow.  Scarab Lord would be cool, and the mount is sick, but I would rather earn it, otherwise I might as well play retail with the rest of the fashionistas.  As for rank 14, it‚Äôs no fun to put cheat codes into a game and invalidate so much gameplay working towards it.  I would have fun but classic would burn out decently fast if I didn‚Äôt work for my stuff.
---
Never had to convince anyone Ive been in a relationship with because Ive gone out of my way to refuse anyone whos not a gamer. Actually, I think after my most recent ex I realized just how much I really need to be damn clear about how important it is we share the same passion for it. I enjoy other things outside of gaming, but I don't get anywhere near the bonding with someone as I do from gaming with em thus I find it pointless to even bother with someone if the only things we share in common are my hobbies so to speak. 
---
Heres the problem, you cant force another person to become interested in things you are, its a personality thing, we all inherently enjoy different things usually depending on how we grew up. If its not her thing, its not her thing. Gaming for most people is a hobby, but for some of us its a lifestyle and all too often the fact stands that only gamers understand gamers. Seen way too many stories horror stories of gamers dating non gamers who end up constantly giving em shit for it.

---
A wall of text right back at you
---
Based off your description of what you normally play, priest is probably the best one to fit your definition. 
---
Healing priest:
---
If you are a person that enjoys playing both roles frequently then priest fits this criteria as well.  But to start off, priest does NOT have poor cc.  I would argue that priest has some of the best cc in the game alongside mages/locks/rogues.  In pvp as a healing priest you have the single best peel cc a healer can have, an aoe instant fear.  This will turn fights around quickly.  They are the best support you have have in terms of defensives/offensive support.  They can cleanse magic (which if you go horde you‚Äôre the only class that can), they can dispel magic (which is MASSIVE especially when fighting mages), they have mindcontrol to throw people off of cliffs in AB and world pvp, they have every form of heal you can think of (hots, shields, instants, big casts), they can also hold their own solo in world pvp (they eat mages and other casters alive with dots/dispels/mana burn).  
---
In terms of pve they have an amazing cc for most 5 mans which is shackle.  Having a healer that can cc is clutch.  Not to mention your fear can be used in really clutch moments.  Plus you have help on aoe pulls while healing with nova.  Also getting into raids as a priest.... you‚Äôll have people ask you for your number.   You also have amazing buffs! 
---
Shadow priest:
---
In pve you will be needed.  Yes, you may be the only one in your raid but a shadow priest will be needed.  You won‚Äôt pull the best dps, you might go oom a lot, but you‚Äôre just as part of the raid as anyone else.  In 5 mans your dps is actually comparable to others.  You have a Rez, backup heals/shields,  shackle undead, and now you can use the funnest ability in 5 mans when the situation comes,  MIND CONTROL!  Mind controlling mobs in 5 mans to act as a ccer/tank/dps is honestly a blast.  
---
In pvp you are a raid boss.  Shadow priests feel like a BfA inspired class design where you have EVERYTHING for any situation and throw it into vanilla and slap on a small mana bar.  You may have to go disc if you want to join a serious pvp guild but honestly shadow works just as well with their silences and cc.
---
With engineering you can literally 1v4 people and possibly more if you outgear them.  
---
Obviously if this isn‚Äôt the type of play style you prefer then go with something else, I‚Äôm just going off of what you said in the first paragraph. 
---

---
I like your idea of being a secret agent, DigitoCrepitus.  BTW, with a name like that, you must be maining a warlock.
---
But you still failed to make a valid point here. By lowering the barriers to entry for something like a raid but keeping the higher level raids what is lost? The normal modes are still there, the mechanics are still there, but the numbers are tuned down, that's all WoW does. LFR just makes these things open for people who may otherwise not have time to access it because of their busy lives (say they have kids but want to experience it, or they don't have a dedicated guild to raid with). 
---
To go to the Basketball example no one is saying everyone needs to perform at the top and reap the rewards. But the experience of playing basketball in a community court and MSG is at it's core the same, just a difference in atmosphere. But the point here is to say that everyone is allowed to play regardless of skill, not that only people who are this skilled are allowed to play. 
---
In the case of a soulsborn game adding an easy mode can be as simple as removing the stamina meter, a small change that would make the game much less difficult for people who can't dedicate the time or may have any other reason for difficulty in their attempts to play. For example I know someone who has a severe mental disability and they lack the ability of spatial reasoning: meaning if I place a chair in a hallway at a certain spot they will remember the chair and the hallway, but not necessarily together or where each of them are. A game like Dark Souls is literally impossible for them unless they play in a reactionary sense, which is almost impossible to do. But they enjoy the setting, they enjoy the atmosphere, they enjoy the story. So what is lost by letting someone like this play who so desperately wants to but because of something beyond their control they cannot?
---
If you‚Äôre playing casually as in not finding a guild and you‚Äôre on at kinda random times you may be stuck in T1-2 content no matter what your class is.  Which is fine!  I will be too.  As for 5 man groups ele shamans are freakin awesome IMO.  It never hurts to have another Rez especially one with an ahnk.  Also your dps on pulls with 2‚Äì5 mobs will out dps mages even.  The only issue that ele shamans really have is that for some reason a lot of bosses in raids have an odd amount of nature resist, and when you go oom... well that‚Äôs it. 
---
Can confirm as a priest with an A name. So many psts
---
Yeah but the line between exploit and bug is very thin. Remember when they banned wizards on Diablo 3's release for using a totally legitimate strategy?
---
There's a case to be made that some things should be patched out. Thing is, Vanilla exists because Blizz can't be trusted to design WoW anymore without a concrete blueprint so they can't screw it up. Although the current vanilla WoW team is the best team I've ever seen at Blizz, I know that upper management will come in and force it to build a cash shop if it's successful and we allow these kinds of small changes early on. Thus, no changes. 
---
I think it will be like that, as I‚Äôve had the same experience on a private server. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are just as many mean people and chat trolls as on retail (All kinds of ‚Äúbuild a wall!! Dtrump420 lullzzz‚Äù messages all day on /world), but people are kind of forced to be more helpful and social with all the group content/elites/no dungeon finder and I think that leads to people being friendlier outside of chat. 
---
The problem is most of the raid drops were designed around anything BUT those specs.  There is not a lot of leather armor with spell power (that I know of) and most of the cloth is gobbled up by cloth spellcasters. Same thing goes for prot and ret paladins with plate.  Yeah some pieces exist out there, but your set pieces are designed for healing for the most part.  There are a few times where a paladin can tank in MC(majordomo), and even BWL(that room where the whelps keep respawning comes to mind), but its usually reserved for trash and situations where you have an eternity to hold agro.  You have to have a LOT of consumes and the perfect mix of gear to pull this off.  The ONE time I attempted tanking (whelp room) in BWL as a paladin I had to farm for months to get the necessary gear, which included a very pricey darkmoon fair deck (maelstrom I believe), just to do a little bit of trash mobs.  Every guide you read about  Prot Paladin or effective Boomkin will tell you, if you don't use this exact spec and this exact gear don't bother.  Thats not to say you can't choose a spec that will allow you the ability to farm, PVP, and protect yourself out in the world.  These guides are just trying to explain the limitations of gear and spec.  I suggest playing whatever spec you want until you get to the higher tier raids!  As long as you have the healing gear keep the tank gear or damage gear close by.  Just switch out whatever someone says "really wish we had some more damage" or "we could use a paladin tank here".  I was surprised when my guild actually started planning for me to tank specific fights, but its ONLY specific fights, the other 98% of the time I healed.  I kept my constant spec until AQ 40, where it started to get noticeable.  After that i was making enough gold to respec every week or so to really smash PVP.  Remember though, AQ40 and Naxx might not get released for a year if they follow the original content release calendar, so have some fun trying out different things!
---
That low pop might have had something to do with it...
---
Huh,  
---
I always thought Menethil Harbor, the connection to Theramore AND Darkshore being super close to IF made the honest difference. I always found this to be more important than BRM being closer, because it's only slightly closer really. That is an interesting take on why Ironforge is the main hub, I just always thought the proximity to Menethil Harbor was much more important than proximity to BRM considering you can just go SW-&gt;Morgans Vigil-&gt;BRM in very comparable time to IF-&gt;Thorium Point-&gt;BRM
---
If you don't mind my asking, how did you resolve the situation, StuffedThings?
---
SW has a better, more logical layout, more populated starting zones, is closer or at equal distance to all low tier raids (BRS MC BWL ZG)
---
SW has no harbor in vanilla and no ships going there. Instead you can go to BB and then to ratchet.
---
You have more trainers in SW (no druid trainer in IF for example)
---
Oh I see, that's pretty cool. I haven't actually encountered anyone who didn't just end up recruiting more people because they'd rather be a raiding guild than a guild of comfortable size. Impressive to make it to naxx and manage a DKP system in a "meta guild".
---
That's what I did on my warrior on Nostalrius. Collected the quests, found a healer first (usually someone I befriended in an earlier dungeon run) and picked DPS that did not share possible loot with me. Usually takes like 10 minutes to complete a group if you've got a tank, heal and quests ready to share.
---
in my experience playing a lot on private servers since nost, IF is definitely more populated, but SW is also decently populated, especially by low lvls
---
Man, I am so hyped to play Paladin! Gonna be amazing!

If you do do this, you should make sure to keep track of who you're whispering and at least remember their name so you'll cut them out of it next time. This is what makes the difference between the top commentors pleasant experience and someone raging at you in whispers for asking 6 times a day if they want to heal a dungeon. You're basically telemarketing, you should do it responsibly.
---
it was a lot of work for the officers for sure. I think with a guild you kinda get that recognition.. the top guilds knew who our RL was and the officers and all that but no one really knew the raiders.. so it's Def not a recognition thing.. but it was a lot of fun :)  but it takes a certain mentality of wanting to be with your small guild and still pay attention to them and also your raid friends.
---
we didn't really farm consumables back I  the day. potions / flasks and jujus and all that.. some people did some didn't.. we Def had our drama and people who joined / left over the years and went to more hard-core guilds.  I don't think I would necessarily do it again but I'm also with different friends now who want to raid so I don't really have to be in a weird place with it :) 
---
&gt; That's what I did on my warrior on Nostalrius.
---
not really relevant to mention the time it took or the ease then
---
This exact thing happened to me yesterday on my Warrior, and I thought the same thing... Do I really wanna do this? Not really, but I've been called so I'll help out my fellow players...

Even if someone wants something else, why are people seem so eager to replace, to *destroy* Classic in the process? Let Classic exist and ask Blizzard for a new game, whether it's completely new or just a modified Classic.
---
I do completely agree though that a new "Classic like" game won't happen. The Blizzard of old is dead. The best we can hope is having Vanilla (and perhaps TBC &amp; Wrath) back. Let's enjoy it for what it is.

Yeah they were still stupid imo. Sure, they actually had a benefit that time, but they were still just a chore. Why did it lead to an active hotspot in the world? Because EVERYONE had the same immediate thought when they logged in "well, it's a new day, better head to IQD so I don't waste my time" because they were so rewarding you would be retarded to not do IQD immediately every day.

---
The article seems to read well (translated with DeepL). I wonder if you could add tooltips for the items somehow? I think classic WoWHead offers JS integration like that. The screenshots work fine here, but in an article where you mention 4 or 5 items (maybe as alternatives) it would become unwieldy.
---
Vanilla was designed that way. You are supposed to have only one spec per char. If you want to both pve and pvp, level two chars. Respeccing is only there to change your char "permanently".
---
So either two chars or farm gold for respec. You say that's a horrendous time commitment? Welcome to Vanilla. :)
---
Leather is probably the hardest, since like 5 classes want it for dpsing. Next I'd probably say healing cloth, because all the healing classes need it. Then spell dmg cloth.
---
It really isn't that difficult to get armor, apart from melee DPS and Hunter since they all want the same gear. The hard part is getting the rings/trinkets/weps.

Oh Seeker\_of\_Arcane, why did you have to say this?  Now I can't get that horrible image out of my mind!  Need brain detergent, stat!

How can you post something like this as encouraging for playing wow? It was tremendously controversial at the time and sparkled a lot of negativity for the people who committed this. Definitely one of the low moments in the vanilla experience, yet somehow it was inspiring to you, I don't know what to think.
---
Guess I should note i've never raided in a guild, i've always wanted to but can never find a guild with good times. During wrath I tried to find a guild for it, found a guild but they lost too many people before I got my dungeon gear up. After dragon soul I tried out pugging, and have since done a lot. I found a new guild in MoP but we only did one week of raiding before we lost the main tank, and we took too long to get a new one and died off. Tried again in Legion, but due to being unable to recruit anybody after months of trying for a middle-of-the-day group, guild gave up and went with normal times. To this day I still want a guild, I play WoW a ton, but there's really not many guilds that raid around the middle of the day EST. It's too bad sharing my story gets me downvotes, but most people have had a better experience with guild raiding

Well, mages are great, but they are also a common class for casual players so you'll see them a lot in dungeons for the first 30-40 levels. I don't think you'll see them *as much* in raids outside of the pservers where people are much more concerned about having the better raiding class/specs. I mained a mage from Vanilla to Cataclysm, and I am going to main a mage in Classic; largely because of Portals/free food because I just don't have a ton of free time and I want to just enjoy the leveling experience again.
---
Serious exploits and bugs will obviously be patched. That's still "no changes". :)
---
I'd like to hear your reasoning to why Stormwind is better. Design wise Ironforge is one of the best cities for a main hub imo due to how it is structured. When I think of Stormwind I think of that town without a fire you can cook on next to bank or AH. What makes Stormwind so special for you?
---
It's a number of reasons.
---
1. Closest to BRM
---
2. Closest to Plaguelands
---
3. Closest to Kalimdor
---
4. Best Layout
---
5. Extremely cool looking
---
From this page showing the skills required as they were before the Professions revamp: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Tailoring_recipes/Expert.
---
A lot of the crafted vanilla items got buffed in TBC, but as far as I know their skill requirement was never changed. Pservers seem to use these numbers as well.
---
Only stuns is quite good given how the new PVP meta revolves around the use of grenades !
---
If there is a beta and we can confirm that it is additive, I will probably roll an orc just for that.
---
everything is not meant for everyone and this same argument is why we today have a classic sub and every two minutes people are saying they can't wait for Classic to release.
---
There is no middle ground once you provide an inch they take a mile, everything is good and nice on paper but once you give they ask for more.
---
Classic may be not be for you and you may be in the wrong sub as WOW was successful because it was the most ultra casual MMO among all MMOS and it removed major barriers of entry.
---
If people complain still about barriers then this game might not be for them just like basketball. Also watching basketball, playing it for leisure is completely different from demanding inclusiveness to top level play.
---
participation certificates have no place either you in or lose and comeback later to win again in the same field or somewhere else.
---
Sekro, souls games are made with mechanic and removing stamina bar is not a solution then it becomes a different game and not souls borne. Why not then try some other product with no stamina bar in the first place, why do you want to change things according to you just because you suck but many players are enjoying it?
---
So better play hello kitty online but change the name and cover to WOW, and tyou can claim you beat WOW just like removing the core of the game and have a souls borne brand attached to it,
---
Your logic is everything should revolve around you, just because you can't achieve something, you are asking things to be pulled down to your level so you can access it and have instant gratification, but there are already people in the higher tiers. Why are you pulling them also down?
---
You have to get to their level and not the opposite. Else try products and systems meant for you, stop forcing existing people to come and join your systems.
---
A fair point, Lucaslouch.  As fond as I am of Orgrimmar, it can be a bit of a PITA to take care of business in, as it's districts are very spread out.  Ironforge's circular design makes it easier to go where you need to go quickly.
---
Ventrillo had a better low bitrate codec in the GSM standard.  Teamspeak (nicknamed Teamsqeak at the time) had a much lower quality codec in terms of voice quality per bandwidth.
---
Okay, so I get to enjoy the summer months when it isn't infernally hot outside; and then it's air conditioned poop-socking for August.
---
I think it's pretty good and google translate indeed produces something that you can understand lol.
---
Well, it did work though. Mages were not deleted. But I guess it prompted shields to be set up, frost novas to be used etc.
---
I think they said they won't be linked...
---
&gt;SW has a better, more logical layout
---
That's subjective. I find IF perfectly logical. But that is beside the point, as any non brain dead person can easily learn both cities. So what matters is once you know the city, which is faster to get around - to which the answer is IF. It's not subjective, IF is simply smaller and have a circular layout that lends it self to generally having faster routes to other places.
---
&gt;more populated starting zones
---
How is this even remotely relevant? This has absolutely nothing to do with SW vs IF as a main hub.
---
&gt;is closer or at equal distance to all low tier raids (BRS MC BWL ZG)
---
BRS / MC / BWL are equally close. ZG is closer to SW. AQ20 and AQ40 is closer to IF (boat is closer to IF and it docks closer on Kalimdor). Naxx is closer to IF. So overall, IF has more raids closer to it.
---
And then there is dungeons. IF got Scholomance and Stratholme closer. Maraudon, Dire Mail and UBS / LBS are both equal distance.
---
&gt;SW has no harbor in vanilla and no ships going there.
---
Neither does IF - I figured it was clear that with SW I am talking about the BB boat and with IF the MH boat.
---
&gt;You have more trainers in SW (no druid trainer in IF for example)
---
You say "for example" as if there is more. Druid is literally the only class trainer not in IF. Honestly, most people don't respec enough where this matter. And it is only druids, a small percentage of the total playerbase, doesn't make sense any other class should choose main hub based on that.
---
Honestly, half of your arguments are either not relevant at all or directly wrong. It's fine if you enjoy SW, but from a practical standpoint IF is better.
---
He is wrong about the IQD faction though, their rewards was by no means cosmetic. The gear included pre-raid BiS pieces, IIRC there was a fuckton of profession recipes and the rep was actually mandatory to complete the attunement for the new dungeon.
---
Not to mention the fact that there was no farming in the game that was as effecient as just doing dailies up there because they gave so. much. gold.
---
True true.  No way in hell I want to grind that "Wife" faction again.  It's even more painful than gaining rep with the Bloodsail Buccaneers!
---
  Imagine the horrors those millennials have to go through... having to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to somebody...
---
Let's not lower ourselves to r/dankmemes
---
Horde get stuck around level 15. Alliance can probably get to 30ish. I can't think of where the next boars are after durator and redridge.
---
Discord. Nothing to do with age, it's just straight up better. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they have released the API 
---
On one hand I feel sad about all the controversie. The relatives must have heart something about the event.
---
BUT
---
I've been told that the person of intrest was a big fan of RP-wPvP events. Not sure if that was true but if it was. I feel less sad.
---
If I had something like this happing because of me? I would feel honored instead of disrespected.
---
Interesting. I've never heard of anyone using vent back then. It was mostly TS2 and at some point mumble, if you needed lower delays.
---
Kek
---
CC pulls were only needed if the tank was bad at pulling.
---
A good tank pulling and cc on the fly was superior to the cc pull for reasons related to Warrior Rage.  CC pulls require the DPS to hold dps for a while as the warrior does the AoE shout (and burns a rage CD iirc?) and then establishes thunderclap/sunder threat.
---
Haha, jumping on the bandwagon where version numbers are made up and don't matter any more.
---
Very viable. It‚Äôs also a good idea on a fresh server to take skinning and skip buying every skill every level so you can afford your mount easier. 
---
It made me to level a human female caster all the way up to 60. Then she died. Among the woods of Elwynn. Alone. The Lich King called her. But she was stronger than that. 
---
You are right that you should be cautious of spamming people.
---
If you are lucky enough you will make some friends along the way and make more dungeon groups in the future.
---
the isle of queldanas was limited in dailies? there were like 15+ per day when the full thing was unlocked, and that's just one hub. Netherwing, skettis, ogri'la, consortium had a few as well, daily heroics and later daily PvP. Not to be a dick but when you say TBC did it in a more limited and well-handled way I really think it was just the novelty and more of their rewards were cosmetic.
---
It really got bad with IQD because you HAD to do it to get attuned to MGT, if you had professions you probably needed a pattern from exalted too, or else you might still need one of their pre-raid BiS pieces. IQD was totally ToC alpha version 1, they sucked equally.
---
You can get the same effect by  tank bow pulling, the hen CC. All mobs are aggressive to tank from the start without much setup.
---
It's better to let the tank pull so they get aggro on every mob. Use sheep after the pull
---
Why cant you just know that I have these quests, just like you, and that we both should just run this instance, and that we need a tank.
---
And I gotta pee so brb, but I wont let anyone know
---
44, nice to feel like the youngling for a change.
---
I'm a huge nerd too, WoW helped me in the same way and i'll always be thankful of it. I grew up reading quest text, because i've always been invested in the story, and that put me ahead in school in spelling and grammar.
---
And I agree with you, but I had to share my side of the story. I needed that push from DS LFR to get into raiding. I didn't say that I liked the game being easier, I despise leveling now. DS LFR had a TON of wiping in it, you had to get off your high horse and talk to people, newer LFRs don't do that, minus a few various bosses here and there. What I saw back then was an epic 25 person series of encounters with challenging(to me at the time) mechanics and AWESOME events like spine of deathwing. Cata Heroics at launch will always be my favorite dungeons, as they were actually difficult and tons of fun, until they got nerfed.
---
I really really really wish LFR provided blue gear, epics mean nothing now and thats the biggest downside in my opinion.
---
&gt; We can't know that this desire to "appeal to a new audience" was good or bad but we do know that, when the game expected the most out of its players, it drew people in like flies to shit.
---
As /u/AWolfNamedCat already hinted at: it's not that you're wrong about that, but more that it's just an observation. And correlation =! causation. The problem with saying something super meta like "*the simplification of WoW is was caused its decline*" is that you immediately undersell *so* many aspects that played into this. For all we know, had Blizzard not simplified the game, it might have died on Cata's launch, and the changes they made actually kept the game afloat. It's hard to say because there are so many different people, environments and concepts involved.  
---
And so I simply try to apply occam's razor. What seems most likely to me is that WoW, being *the MMO* simply lured in a lot of people who never played MMO's before. And the more people that play a game, the less hardcore the playerbase automatically becomes. *We* may be used to doing raids, grinding money, watching video's and reading guides, but the average player doesn't have the time nor will to do all of that just to 'play a game'. And as a result, you see Blizzard trying to accommodate for that by finding ways to allow all players access to all content, even if there are 'hard modes' for those who really want to 'be someone' in the game. These, to me, are fundamental truths of the universe, true for basically any phenomenon, not just games. Hype is a thing, as is 'moderation of fanbase' and companies simplifying products to appeal to broader markets.  
---
At this point, it really becomes a 'chicken and egg' game: did Blizzard introduce LFG and see it work for casual players, causing them to decide to do more like that, or did Blizzard see casual players leave the game and therefore introduced LFG? And even that is a simplistic way of putting it, as the original idea for LFG was probably convenience for both casual and hardcore players alike - not to "allow everyone access to raids". That idea didn't come into the game until LFR.
---
I don't know, with the drop rate on that mount, you're talking about a LOT of ZG runs...
---
I would say it definitely helped, even if BRM was the main reason. IF is situated more centrally on the Eastern Kingdoms, so makes getting around a lot easier.
---
I used to do this but people  would get annoyed with me
---
Im a milennials and have no problem to make or find a group.
---
Well actually to be fair i play tank too 
---
Run away -&gt; Get stunned -&gt; Die.
---
Story of my life.
---
I feel like Healing Shaman and Healing Paladins could have arguably the easiest time gearing out given how they pretty much get any healing Mail/Plate with the only competition being other Shaman/Paladins respectively. Though they will be fighting for leather and cloth BIS with other healers the added bonus of some exclusive armor types means you can hopefully expect something decent early on. 
---
But the main tank always gets first dibs so if you want to be geared quick then roll a Warrior and tank on.
---
I‚Äôm gonna disagree with you that not a lot of people will try it at launch. I think the game is going to have a pretty large launch with a quick fallout then the population will settle for a while. 
---

---
We know. Doesn't mean it's not awesome 
---
Ur name checks the fuck out
---
lmao
---
Viable if your tank is brain dead, sure
---
Wow also has the highest average age. I think that has something to do with the toxicity levels. 
---
Not only are mature people less likely to be toxic, they are also less likely to be offended by something a random guy online sais.
---
I think all the classes are fairly equal to gear because gear drops are limited and are split between party members. I think early level 60 warriors may have the easiest time gearing just from the simple fact they will have easier time forming groups if they are a competent tank. 
---
I honestly think you're overthinking it way too much and giving humans too much credit as super independant beings. Remember the once-in-a-lifetime event now so interesting it's actually studied corrupted blood incident? WHINE. WHINE, EVERYWHERE. Remember the super fun, once-in-a-lifetime zombie invasion? WHINE EVERYWHERE. Nowadays people are even claiming the whiners got the event cut short.
---
Every time these interesting things happen, 99% of people whine that their gameplay isn't available on-demand and they just wanna run around questing. We, the collective players, are responsible for companies thinking we just want to live and play in our own little bubble.
---
Everyone forget that while you are busy afking in stormwind, you might get the ony world buff if a guild plan to raid which will make anything you might want to kill in the next hour easier and faster. You cant get that in if.
---
Also you can only buy pvp gear there.
---
Like it or not we are still talking about it years later. This was one of the most iconic events in vanilla maybe only second to leeroy 
---
Below 20 you are getting "carried". You will need some 22isch people atleast for a smooth run.
---
Not sure a group of 5x a 19 can kill a lv24 boss.
---
But you're so short.  Don't you get tired of staring at people's legs all the time?
---
And you get 0/10 pussy for having the word ‚Äúyikers‚Äù in your vocabulary. 
---
It can vary depending on boss or raid comp.
---
Mainly because a lot of people don‚Äôt want to tank or aren‚Äôt able to  that limits the population of tanks allowing you easier access to groups because there‚Äôs going to be tons of lf1m tank xxxx dungeon. 
---
You realize you're replying in a comment thread where a guy says he did IQD solely for the 10k for a 280% mount?
---
It blew all methods of gold farming out of the water. Do dailies or live like a poor scrub became a core staple of the game for the next few expansions.
---
You've actually got me curious. Like when?
---
5/4 release date confirmed 
---
I usually get the "Leaving combat"notification and die at the same time as I get that last tap from the mob!
---
5/4 confirmed hold onto your butts
---
I know but managed to control myself from investing another hour instead of studying.
---
Haha! Good luck my friend
---
the MAGIC JUICE
---
Again Ita not that it‚Äôs not a viable strategy it‚Äôs just makes a tanks job harder in vanilla because a lvl 60 warriors going to be a bit rage starved especially as their gear improves. Source my biggest problem in 5 mans was being short on rage. 
---
Does discord itself support recording the voice chat and saving it to a file?  As the guy who made all the videos for the guild back in the day, his was one of my favorite features of Ventrilo.
---
I will play Orc and I want NE mount too  :(
---
Where you acctually only going to play classic to farm mounts?
---
Yeah, Zerofox1, that does seem to be the general consensus, that I should appreciate my good fortune, suck it up, and play Alliance.
---
I just don't want to disappoint Thrall.  From the time I was wee orc entering Ragefirm Chasm, he has been good to me, even treating me with epic quest reward items.  The shame I feel, even contemplating rolling Alliance...
---
Going to remember this when I finally decide on a name for my priest.
---
This how I found my guild in Vanilla.  (Shout out to Knights Templar from old Lothar, it's Nikholas!)  I haven't had the same kind of experience since PF went in.
---
Oh man, yes! These games are my childhood! So many fond memories of Murk, in all three games. This one is the best one though, I've played through the enitre thing tons of times trying out all the classes. Mage is the best one due to an infinte combo if pulled of correctly, however the Rogue with Backstab is the best for farming levels as you pretty much one-shot everything with Cold Blood activated.
---
Anyways, this game is the reason I love murlocs, and this game is the reason both Elwynn Forest and Stranglethorn Vale is a lot more special to me than most other zones. Murk &lt;3
---
If you have a pocket healer a warrior is god mode.  Otherwise I would suggest a warlock or spriest.
---
Same here. I was a paladin and the guy was like "you're the only healer over 18, come DM". And I went.
---
This and those initial hits can be crucial in building rage to help maintain threat allowing your dps to kill faster with less chance of pulling Aggro. 
---
Ah ok, well I would look at the price to buy gold at any given time and use that as a judge for real world currency. 
---
as horde you can get the best mount ingame. av frostwolf. &lt;3 sadly i have to play alliance cause of no belf ;)
---
They are stocky muthatruckas man more muscles than orcs in a smaller package. Dwarf is master race
---
I love the RP, ElPujagaunte!  People like you are the reason why I continue to play WoW, 15 years after its release.
---
I remember you used to be able to duel in Ironforge itself because there were glitched areas like one behind the pillar next to the bank. Would be nice if they let you still duel there in classic although I'm not too optimistic.
---
I'm waiting, I wont have the time to go hard with the game anyway so I'm just gonna save the experience for the official server launch and enjoy the world.
---
If you can look past your own situation do you not realize that adding a daily gold farm that puts all others to shame is bad design? If you were logged in to TBC and you hadn't done IQD, that was what you went off to do.
---
Imo dailies are terrible for games in the first place because they remove player agency, but extremely lucrative dailies are the worst.
---
Log in at noon hoping to do a dungeon? Too bad, it's way too early, everyone is still on IQD. Arenas or BGs? Nah, farming IQD is a lot more fun to gank when it's crowded, and that's where everyone is farming money.
---
It just seemed way too rewarding to me. It made so many other things in the game seem pointless and unrewarding by comparison which, and this is pure speculation, I think led to less player participation in practically all other aspects of the game.
---
best advice is to make friends/join guilds.  if yu play something like a warrior/druid/pala/priest you end up getting quite a few of these messages so its not ideal to send out a lot of random whispers
---
i'm playing a pala and my friend a priest so we'll be sorted for tank/dps+heals pretty much all the way \^\^
---
We're going to run around as a group of 5 with 1 or even maybe 2 healers. For sure a priest and then either a Shaman or a Paladin depending on which faction we go
---
Hahaha, she would go for the ninja look, but not the pirate
---
Yes, that is true to the dungeon finder
---
But the picture is about raid finder, which is pretty much the exact same thing as easy mode.
---
That's gonna be hard...at least from Retail to Classic.  Unless the trolls take the time to level and gear the worst they can do is verbal and that easily documented and against ToS.  If the come in to troll low level then they get swarmed by two 40person groups in raid gear/warlord.  There won't be much way for anyone not playing classic at least semi-dedicated would have the time invested to troll effectively.
---
yhea, most people don't understand how much you must play. I hade to wake up at night just to get into my premade grp. It sucks, you get no free time ;(

I dont even have a computer anymore!!! Gimme that date!!!!
---
This makes me wonder if at some point they were considering allowing numbers special characters in names. 
---
Omg seriously thank you! I did this all the time and don't know how people don't know about this. Just wisper roles/classes in appropriate level ranges and in close zones, bonus points for having a lock and summoning them to instance. 
---
You speak the truth, sudoGaron.  I can talk a big game, but in the end, she holds all the cards.
---
You can also make a macro. Its easy to open and quickly edit or copy and paste into chat. It's not that tough to find a group because after a while you get to know the reliable cool people and avoid the flakes. 
---
In the long run the community is always better off without raid finder. Trolls and flakes will eventually be naturally filtered out because no one will send them an invite. 
---
There is really no upside of mages pulling with CC, only downside, with any tanks.
---
If I pull as bear, the one I've pulled already receives a substantial aggro, but the rest only comes to me because I pulled. The only way I can force them to hit me is if I hit myself or heal (which is doable as druid, but you shouldn't HoT before each pull)
---
Much easier and simpler to mark the mobs in advance as the tank (while killing previous pack or waiting for healer to drink). The moment you pull the mage can start casting poly (or precast and cancel if really matters, which it doesnt)
---
Thanks, I wasn't sure.
---
Rank 14 takes alot more time than people think. The fastest way is to be rank 1(bracket 1) for 11 weeks. Do you really have time for that when 30 other people are also trying to get it?
---
I would suggest Warrior-Arms / Shaman-Enha / Mage-Fire (Instant Pyroblast).
---
In my opinion, these are the three most fun classes for PvP.
---
All I remember from the actual G4 review of WoW was them hyping up the fact you could kill critters.
---
There are so many ways to exploit human nature for profit, I unfortunately doubt a victory against the loot boxes will be the end of it. It does set a great precendence though, which is appreciated.
---
I actually switched to Horde because of this video. Thanks Serenity Now.
---
The main issue with Ele is their mana issues. You‚Äôll need every mana pot and demon rune under the sun and it still won‚Äôt be enough 
---
How about the wintersprinf mount?  Its a great but mega sexy time
---
Meh, in terms of pure voice chat, discord has nothing on mumble/ts... all the other shit you can do with it are nice though.
---
Roll on a PvP server.  My wife and I had played other MMOs such as GW2, Wildstar and ESO.  When she first saw classic WoW, she was less than thrilled about trying it.  It was only when she encountered open world PvP that she fell in love with WoW.  Also, the whole social environment was vastly better than other MMOs (as in WoW actually has one).  Talk to other players, join a guild.  She'll most likely come around.
---
I'd run like that from sugar bear too
---
Looks like we connected on Discord. See you soon.
---
I'm explaining why SW has around the same popularity. Starting zone and trainers matters because you spend more time in one city you won't migrate to the other. This is why IF stayed hub after the AH change. People don't change unless forced.
---
Btw I missed the biggest one: Onyxia buff. You don't get it from IF. In Pservers it is huge, you can idle around in prime time and receive a buff, perfect while questing. Now we don't know how world buffs are going to be implemented in classic, but this can be a game changes.
---
Speaking facts
---
Yes!! I used to harass so many people this way. I think the /who function only works in the zone you are in? Or you have to specify the zone? I remember doing this in major cities for the most part at end game to get groups together. 
---
Troll &gt; Undead PvE.
---
PvP depends; The troll shield has a chance for blackout procs which is awesome against meele units. Undeads go oom faster thanks to plague,but we all know how awesome plague can be. Also wotf.
---
Tbh, its a clear case of play what you want. Absolute min max is prolly troll, but it doesnt matter too much.
---
Lol I'm sorry :( I've tried a few translating WordPress plugins, but most of them are crap. I'll keep working on it.
---
Where is that
---
No, discord doesn't do that. However, you can easily use Audacity to record discord's audio.
---
\+1 on disclosing faction preferences prior to starting a relationship.  Unfortunately, we married before she started playing WoW.  
---
So is there not going to be native support for that in game? I had just assumed it would since the client is a fork off 7.x

That's great feedbacl! I've written it down and I'll try to find out if I can make that work. Thank you.
---

Why? Any how does it affect anyone else?

Thanks! :) I'm trying various translate plugins so I'm hoping I can share more (English) content on Reddit in the near future.

Clutch of Foresight seems pretty useless:
---
It is consumed upon use, does not drop 100% and is unique. So you go there, kill mob, loot one (or none and you have to wait for respawn), then you get to have one cast of counterspell in PvP. Yay. Now you have to go back to the mob, kill it again.
---
If it wasn't unique, it would be useful.
---
I use both, HAHA!
---
Was going to point this out, I think the "/who warrior" thing was a QoL thing added later (wotlk maybe?) 
---
Oh I'm technically a millennial too yo. I was just making a joke about it cause why not lean into it before someone who actually cares about it throws a fit hehe
---
it first came up when tanks (including kungen in his interview post their kt world first) that it would be impossible to tank against more than 1,3k dps on thaddius. Back when KTM was the threat meter of its time.
---
He was proven wrong by 2 main sources. The (obvious) alliance raids (thanks to salvation) But more importantly by people showcasing how broken battleshout spam was back in the days.
---
You have to keep in mind that the 2.0 patch arrived mere 2 months after this exploit became so popular thanks to this topic
---
Up to this day you can still watch old raid videos of tanks showing this exploit. Most obvious for twin emperor clips (for tanking the caster)
---
We all know the jokes and oh it's funny to say who's the boss in whatever relationship. The bottom line is make each other happy and understand that it is a cold hard fact that a happy wife is a happy life.
---
Sounds like shaman is what you want. Brings utility to the table for his team, healer that is not easily killable, and the 30/0/21 ele spec is a semi glass cannon 
---
Personally, I would not want a game supported voice chat. 
---
1. It makes it that much more special, having it outside of the platform. 
---
2. Let the voice chat experts do voice chat. Thats their bread and butter....WoW and Blizz would not be able to put a better product together. 
---

Yeah, it kinda is.  You can't have an authentic McDonald's hamburger without your burger being identical to a McDonald's hamburger.  Or can you?

I don‚Äôt see anyone doing anything morally wrong. To each there own on how they wish to remember or celebrate someone. Literally no one was hurt but the regular sour faces that get ganked in wpvp.

I think it was absolutely ridiculous to think they wouldn‚Äôt have anyone at all interfere on a pvp server.  On a server where open world conflict is encouraged ‚ÄúHmm perfect place to hold a sensitive-to-me event where I might get ganked standing afk in a line‚Äù
---
Hi, yeah, been playing since 2005, LFR DS in its totality was not difficult, but I promise you that my bwl team would also never be able to complete it were it in vanilla at its same difficulty. 
---
Fights were much simpler in vanilla, objectively, and you trying to rewrite history by claiming that they were complex is disingenuous at best.
---
Is that Sess talking?
---
Yep, this is how to do it. Only takes 2 seconds for them to say "no thx" or "ye sure". I've found that a lot of the time people are quite happy to receive a message that says "wanna heal DM, last spot ready to go?"
---
Sure the picture looks aesthetically pleasing, but I'm sure that could've been achieved without portraying an unrealistic/non-existent gameplay setting.
---
How many breathtaking locations/encounters/etc. are there in WoW again? Exactly.
---
Druid isn't that bad:
---
Beartank gear is mostly a few q items and a lot of BOE's. Exceptions are pants and shoulders where you need to get exalted with WSG and AB. You have no competition in raids. Tier 1 and 2 are okayish for tanking as well. (And have fire resistance)
---
Resto: Pre-raid stuff is easy to get if you only tank with the ability to roll on healer items in dungeons (perfectly doable). Tier sets are crap, but you are a healer, you have priority over DPS usually when it comes to the good stuff.
---
This was mostly 2000-2005 era.
---
What people don't understand is that compared to EverQuest, it's immediate predecessor, Vanilla *was* easy mode.
---
So would I need some kind of audio splitter to separate the audio from Discord from the audio from other sources? I've tried recording audio with OBS and a bunch of other programs but it basically only gives me the option to record all audio from one interface (or to mute it), not separate audio from separate programs. 
---
&gt; It really screws over Rogues though.
---
Yeah, that's really what I was trying (and failed) to imply. 
---
I still have STV WPVP PTSD from getting stunlocked out of nowhere. I'd love to avoid that as much as possible, but can't bring myself to play an Orc.  
---
&gt; The only thing dailies do differently is restrict you from endlessly grinding in the hopes to save you from yourself. 
---
I think you're missing something here. Yes, the once-a-day stops you from wasting your life sitting at the computer 18 hours in a row. But why don't they stack up? Surely an obvious player service to this would be that if you go on a business trip for a few days, you come back to a few days of stacked up dailies you can knock out. You still can't farm out more dailies than someone who's done one-per-day since the release, but you catch up.
---
The element you're overlooking is the pressure to log in everyday or miss out. It adds a daily FOMO component to not logging in daily which in classic only came from raid lockouts, pvp resets and other players and weren't exactly daily. I also believe this is the reason the IQD, and later ToC and similar hubs, were so mindblowingly lucrative. They wanted everyone and their mother to go to IQD when it released and start building that habit of at least logging in to knock out a few dailies. 
---
I also now realize another reply made essentially the same point, fml
---
They said that Horde and Alliance AHs won't be linked. Since they're basing Classic on 1.12, SW/IF/Darn AHs will in all likelihood be linked.
---
Mandokir and Vael you stand absolutely still unless you're a tank or get the bomb. Usually it's a few people who have to move and the rest stay put worrying about the threat meter instead. The only encounters with lots of movement happen in AQ and Naxx, and even there some bosses are basically target dummies like Patchwerk and Ouro. 
---
For sure!
---
That's exactly what i did here btw.
---
Rogue tier 3 followed by Mage tier 2 (even though it's subpar wearing full set)
---
This. I had a same guy whisper me 5x in span of an hour. Like wtf. 
---
Honestly, I'd be happy if the blue pill was "classic released in 2 weeks".
---
&gt; 2 WQs per week
---
That's funny, it's almost as if they designed it this way to make me feel like I have to play now to earn it easily, rather than have to knock it out all at once later if I return later. Hmm.
---
Addons from private servers won't work.
---
This is a really cool statue! I love the way it captures a moment that would only exist in motion if it were real/happening. Like freezing a basketball mid bounce.
---
Is there a story/message/idea behind it? it'd be easy to draw a lot of conclusions on what it might mean but who knows if they'd be right.
---
In my opinion, make a list of drops and price them individually. Have a basic fee for coming so if things don‚Äôt drop you don‚Äôt lose out. Say 200g for the spot, 200-1k per item depending on rarity and demand. Get a database set up and work out some figures :)
---
It doesnt impact rep gain in vanilla.
---
And just to think, that form with your wrists and no elbow support has spiraled thousands of people into the Carpal Tunnel that they struggle with today lol (myself included).
---
The thing is, druid tanks have much higher armor than warriors if they gear right so even though they take crits and crushes the damage of those will be less than a warrior hit-for-hit. Warriors do still take less physical damage overall of course, in general, but crits and crushes arent the one-shot delete they were in Black Temple.
---
On fights requiring Fire Resistance, druids are superior to warriors in there due to the gear available. A druid will be flat out better on Ragnaros and Geddon than a Warrior as they're pure fire damage hits (and bears can feral charge back at Ragnaros mid-air of their knockback). 
---
On other fights in MC the warrior will take less damage, the druid will do more threat. They're about equal. 
---
I druid tanked in MC in Vanilla and was my server first druid to tank Ragnaros. I wasnt the guild's MT, i was second or third in line tank-wise, but in the fire res gear available I was just a better choice than the warriors for Raggy.
---
Druids are DIFFERENT to warriors and have different tools and stats. Yes, they'll take overall more physical damage than a warrior on most fights but not by as much as you think if they're sensible and armor-stack properly. Then it's a matter of identifying whether your raid is more at risk of wiping due to tank taking too much damage, or due to other reasons such as threat/lack of dps.
---
As an ex vanilla career bear I will never say druids are BETTER than warriors in most cases, but they have advantages, on a few select fights they ARE flat out better, and the crits/crushing does not make them unable to tank.
---
i dont know actually, i guess i will do some research,
---
I always wanted that sword, never got it ._.
---
I saw my brother play BfA yesterday.
---
I was like "Hey, what's up with the tanks mana? It's constantly at 200k and never moves. Isn't he using any abilities when tanking??"
---
And my brother said "Yeah he is, but they cost almost no mana, it's no big deal."
---
They completely removed the mana aspect from many classes and specs while STILL keeping the damn thing! It's such an in-your-face bastardization of the whole resource system and it made me want to throw up.
---
Classic.. senpai..
---
For sure yellow. The no life dream is not possible for me since I chose work etc but dayum that would be a dirty 2 weeks
---
I remember when I first got whispered to in this manner; I didnt realize you could search like that. I was like spinning In circles trying to physically locate this character that was contacting me, LoL. " How do you know my name and class!? Where are you?   Orgrimar?? That's impossible, show yourself! "
---
Friends were a farmable resource in WoW.
---
Same here. I've got an hour or 2 a night max and I'm don't need to spend 2/3 of that running back to my corpse.
---
You should see the rest of Reddit then.
---
This is how I did it in vanilla and how I will do it in classic, unless we can make a full guild group üòé
---
That thing, the Son of Arugal, and Mor'ladim are the three most dangerous rogues in the game. They've likely ganked more than any one player ever will (even Angwe) and  I don't know how they manage to sneak up on you.
---
The giants in northrend, for instance, never got me, not once.
---
I think stormwind will be the main city. 
---
IF was the main because of the AH, it had nothing to do with flight paths.
---
1.12 should have the stormwind AH, so i think people will be staying over there. 
---
Zzyreaus
---
What I dislike about it is that it is clearly made for you to be pressured into playing since the expansion starts. I think the fact that some people, despite being active players, never actually get the achievement is a testament to the fact that the design of the compromise is flawed. I have never for a second believed that it was coincidental that many of the requirements for the legion and bfa flying has been time-gated or daily content. They are leveraging flying to increase the effeciency of the systems they already had in place to incentivize figuring in their DAU stats.
---
I don't see a particularly good reason why flying is locked behind more than playing through the story, such as 100 arbitrary world quests or the boatload of missions you have to complete with the stupid table. It's already time-gated plain hard by the game, even if you earn all the achievements you can't fly until a patch flips the switch.
---
PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
It's their own faults.  If you wanna do stuff like this on a PVP server, do it in the city...idiots...I'm glad they all got ganked.
---
I imagine a lot of group finding will be done externally now, on things such as discord.
---
If you are going to play Alliance I recommend only playing on a majority Alliance server. This way the population of available players that actually know what they are doing is large enough to make functional raid groups. 
---
It's not that deep.
---
wpvp, working as intended
---
Nope, i will use classic as an escape from everyday grind of life. It doesn't mean i need serious help, it just means i dont enjoy social life all the time and i think thats okay.
---
It's better than heroine. 
---
Shit like this made people hate gnomer, but I love anything that adds some complexity to the dungeons. I always remember they had juuust enough hitpoints where a single player couldn't just kill them in 2 seconds, you had to hit them a few times and they might get a warning in.
---
and why is that the best mount?
---
\*You should see the rest of Internet then.
---
I agree so much! I would love an official version of this with a plot and such in a way like that too final fantasy set in the wow universe!
---
With how long it takes to get, wouldn't it be closer to several months pay?
---
As a kid I would often not be able to play, due to school or whatever. But you bet I got my wow fix from this game during lunches!
---
&gt; Much easier and simpler to mark the mobs in advance as the tank 
---
Aha!
---
This is the simple answer I did not see. Sheep pulling was common because for the majority of vanilla, we did not have markers!
---
You can replace WoW with almost anything, who cares? 
---
Discord can be a repository for information, too. It has also replaced the guild website for many guilds. So instead of finding out a guild's web address where they communicate, they can just maintain a free Discord server with channels &amp; links to spreadsheets, online forms, strategies, schedules &amp; other information.
---
Only thing I have to say about Bear tanks (I was a Bear Tank Main in vanilla, tanked all the way up to Naxx for my guild where possible) is if you want to play one for GODS SAKE make sure you a.) take enchanting for Smoking Heart of the Mountain and b.) take the Mark of Tyranny armor trinket from the 60 quest. 
---
Without the above two items you completely nerf your viability in most early content as they're the only worthwhile trinkets for bear tanking. You can jsut about get by without but it's an uphill struggle as far as damage taken goes.
---
With those two equipped though, as long as you accept that there's a period around the time BWL is current content where you get almost zero upgrades and feel far inferior to the warriors until AQ arrives, it's certainly viable to be a bear tank.
---
Just accept you wont be THE main tank, you'll be the second or third tank for a guild, bar a few select fights, and on some fights needing less tanks you may have to heal a bit. Or feral kitty if your guild lets you.
---
I recently tried out FFXI on a private server which does that, except it's 0 quests off the bat. You know what happened? I asked in chat and made a friend. What horror it was.
---
The problem as of late is, with classic looming, the pserver (the one i'm playing on at least) seems to have just let it become the wild west and most of the player base I run into while leveling is just bot grinding.  
---
Stunned, slowed, entangled, etc
---

Nice! I was just thinking about this today! I always see this argument in the general gaming subreddits that it an hour or more to find enough people for the group and that's why dungeon finders are better. The /who thing adds a small layer of skill to the process in my opinion. Plus forming your own group is infinitely more interesting than sitting in a queue with zero control. The queue has turned me off of playing dps in the past in some games with how tedious the wait is
---
Not that I could disagree with that in any way, but I can understand why some people get emotional about it. But I'll definitely say again that it was their own fault for doing it there on a PvP server, especially coupled with a public announcement.
---
Dude that‚Äôs not millennials. Millennials are the now 30-35 year olds who were playing vanilla and are leading the charge asking for classic. Millennials are WoW Classic. 
---
Good point.
---
You have to remember bear tanks WERE incredibly bad at the start of  Vanilla. I'm not sure which patch it was but it took a while for them to get enough buffs to be the powerhouses they were in late vanilla.
---
1.12 bear though? Very strong and useful as long as you understand the differences between them and warriors on each fight.
---
I'm surprised one of the choices isn't Atiesh or something similar to replace blue
---
Rank 14

I‚Äôm not sure you know who the millennials are. You probably are one yourself.

This fucking bothers me. It's so obvious it's not content, and yet it is rewarding. I expect these shitty hardly veiled DAU mechanics from Clash of Clans, not a B2P sub based triple A game.
---
Show up at zul farrak like a super hero. Fear not, Random Citizen, the Tank has arrived.
---
I think you might be taking some jokes too seriously.
---
Mystery solved, /u/kiskoller pointed me in the right direction: Sheep pulls were done because vanilla didn't have target markers until 1.11 without add-ons!
---
The disadvantages of having the mage pull is easily offset by avoiding confusion over which target is to become a sheep.
---
Always used this in retail aswell if I looted a good BOE leveling item.
---
100% Agree! Especially for Rogue, stone form is the best! I made a video about it if you are interested: [Link/ Who needs weaponskill?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOn5UV9Wfbk)
---
Hi, /u/Deepspace_wumbo
---
just personal preference ;)
---
I mean, it took almost no effort to get it even if you only subbed for a couple months at the beginning of the xpac.  Even if it took you 2 weeks to get to 120 (which would be slow as fuck) and only subbed for 2 months, thats 6 weeks to do 100 WQs.  Thats just over 2 per day, which honestly isnt much at all.  Most of them take a couple minutes.
---
If you were just doing the daily emissary to get some rep (same thing dalies did in the past, though you dont have to do nearly as many) you would be doing 4 per day, probably.  Maybe a bit less if you lined up the tortollan emissary with another zone, but its not like you had to stay subbed for a year to do 100 different WQs.
---
Also, keep in mind that not only warriors can tank and not only priests can heal. In 5-mans you don't have to min-max. In fact I'd rather take a feral druid/paladin tank than a warrior in most cases. 
---
I don't care much for my P-server anymore as well. What's the point? I know what class to play, and I know my route with Sharding and I know my route without sharding for the first 20 levels. For the rest, why would I spend days of my life leveling a Char to 60 if i'll just end up deleting him in the end because I switch to Official classic.
---
Blue for me easily. Assuming the game magically being in a finished steady.
---
I was literally just thinking about this last night. Say what you will about what happened, but the music they used was fantastic. It was how I discovered the gem that is Scatman John 
---
To be honest that all sounds great to me, but that could be my classic hype in general speaking. 
---
That being said I'm surprised about the Enchanting bit of advice, I'd assumed LW or Alchy would be most beneficial to be honest... Though I'd planned to do more research once we get a release date. 
---
Thank you so much for the advice!
---
Ok healers and not huge income damage. 
---
Listen here fool and I will tell you what you need to know. The Alliance and Horde both are deeply flawed mortal beings that both take turns sucking at being competent and redeemable. Worry not about factions. Instead, i offer another perspective.....
---
I too am married to a woman who plays WoW with me (and is excited for classic). We've played both alliance and horde over the years and I've noticed something very advantageous about the alliance (specifically the Humans and Night Elves)...... 
---
See, when I play with my wife, I don't want a god damn troll or cow lady waddling around after me. Undead females aren't thicc enough and Orc females lack hair. 
---
As someone who's had it both ways, i promise that its really weird having this ugly ass thing be your wife's avatar and follow you around.
---
That being said, i'll be rolling horde in classic, for the main reason why you should roll alliance: variety. 
---
I haven't leveled through horde questing zones since pre-wrath. You say that you have been playing horde since day 1?! Switch it up, friend. Classic is THE best way to experience the other side!
---
The most underappreciated thing about Classic was that sometimes the game itself was just something to mindlessly fiddle with like a fidget spinner while your focus was on the TS conversation or whatever. Sometimes the game was more like Habbo Hotel than anything else, and that was somehow part of what made it great to some.
---
T2 8/8 for priest is godly...like I think you want at least one  priest with 8/8 T2 way past BWL/AQ40 in your raid 
---
If I see a warrior in my raid with this build without being told to,  he i s getting kicked.
---
Just conveniently break your leg when it releases.
---
Yeah healers negligence has killed more players than any PvP encounter. This man speaks the truth.
---
More threat generation, which means more damage from dps, which means shorter fights.
---
I can't wait to see how Hallows End is in Tarren Mill and South Shore.
---
I'm excited for Noblegarden too, even though ittl be a long time before we see it.
---
If we're lucky Midsummer Fire Festival will be a huge source of EXP to those who grind/explore.
---
There‚Äôs always quit....priorities first life will be there after. 
---
Classic launch however is a once in a lifetime event. But hey as long as your playing alliance just take your time no rush buddy ;)
---
thwiss cheethe
---
That wouldn‚Äôt get me anywhere in my line of work. But personal leave though...
---
Shield is not necessary after a point, when your raid is dealing so much damage, having another weapon allows you to hold more aggro. 
---
Watch the channel "Skarm Tank" for more details.
---
This is probably the most correct answer, it's the amalgamation of multiple reasons.
---
I fully get it.  Wasn't really shitting on anyone doing it.  I was basically referring to why that probably wouldn't work on my pserver atm.  
---
As for my main, I've always been sort of an altaholic, so I might be a lost cause.  Still don't know what I want to play.  :P
---
Playing a video game can't solve my real life issues?  
---
WHY HAS NO ONE TOLD ME THIS BEFORE?
---
Most certainly yellow
---
Do you have a family? I have a full time job and I could easily do it but I also live alone and have no other commitments lol
---
I was 15 when it came out and had a large group of friends who started playing it so I‚Äôd bet if you changed one group to 28-36 you‚Äôd get the vast majority of the player base. 
---
Pretty sure it was because it had the AH.
---
Lifetap + Drain Life = Warlocks FTW
---
Bosses dont enrage in good guilds because good guilds have high dps, and high dps requires high tps from the tank.
---
It's true.  Having a robust friends list (and keeping notes!) is a great way to get stuff done.  Guildies are also an option of course but not everyone wants to put the effort in to get in tight with a larger group like that. 
---
Do I get rank 14 at server launch?! I will enslave you all!
---
You can't use Viking helm on pala, because dwarves is friendly for alliance. 
---
Especially during leveling, a warrior tank might be at 0 rage and with Bloodrage on cooldown at some point. If a mage sheep-pulls at that time, things may get really annoying for the warrior.  If the mage only pulls after the tank marked the mob for sheeping, it's usually fine. 
---
Also, if there are patrols in the area, it might be best to pull the whole pack back into safe territory before sheeping, so that a sheep running out can't possible add the patrol.
---
Apart from that, and especially in UBRS/ZG, I like to do sheep pulls. It ensures the mages are actually there (not drinking, not afk, not too far away), so the mobs get sheeped right away, and not when they're already in the melee/AoE zone. Keeps them nice and separate.
---
My advice is get partners. Having 5 people killing 20 said mobs is hella easier than one at a time and then dying because you pulled 2-3 
---
I just want to play the quests and zones that I've barely ever played before :-)
---
One day in Hellfire Pen while leveling with my friend he yelled "It's coming right for us". I panicked and looked around but didn't see anything. Turns out there was a Fel Reaver on the other side of the zone, barely visible with draw distance and fog. An ant on the horizon. (He was joking,)
---
We still joke about that moment to this day though. Good times.
---
Should have asked druids/paladins too =P
---
Let the spam *FLOWWWWWW* through you
---
There's the morrowgrain research in ungoro to max you out. 
---
In places like Deadmines, in the goblin room, where the mob ‚Äúsummons‚Äù a second add there is a distinct advantage to pulling via a sheep. It eliminates an additional add and the tank can still grab aggro very quickly. That‚Äôs the only example that comes to mind right now, but there certainly are some upsides. 
---
Some back story please. 
---
Zaius would be good for a priest... *damn dirty apes*
---
My dad I played wow together when I was growing up. He just reached level 60 IRL. I am a young level 23. 
---
My wild guess is that the server stores the player name in all lower case. This has the advantage that you never need to worry about duplicates. No matter if you enter `hammerfall`, `HaMMerfall`, `Hammerfall` or `HammerFall`, it will always be `hammerfall` to the server and it's easy to match.
---
Not allowing duplicate names is much more important than to add the capitalization in the client (or in the last step before data gets sent out from the server).
---
Or this is just a mock-up from a designer rather than an actual screenshot. Who knows.
---
Prot warriors are only rare for dungeons, raids have all the prot warriors they want.
---
I've added a dropdown menu for a translation in English. It's rubbish, but I hope it helps you understand the content
---
How would sharding stop you from whispering people? And the cases where sharding is used, are when there are already too many players, so wouldn't that imply that finding people to do dungeons shouldn't be that hard anyway?
---
Some of the hate sharding gets is totally fair, but it doesn't magically ruin everything.
---
It's true. All the best CEOs I've worked with disappear to play video games for months at a time.
---
Damn, didn't know that. Thanks!
---
wth you people didn't play classic.  duels were in ironforge right by the bank.  there was a bug where you could start a duel behind the left pillar right outside the bank by the mailbox.
---
I really don't miss my wrists being so far above my elbows but I really *do* miss my monitor being centered around looking straight ahead.
---
I healed in raids without any healing addons.
---
I don't know why though.
---
Kotaku is a joke. Most "gaming journalists" are. 
---
I mean just look at this shit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FD-uwu847Q
---
Absolutely top tier skills there guys, I'd totally trust your opinions on a game.
---
Yeah I felt that was kind of a stretch. It didn't feel right to exclude it though and I thought it could be something for the real tryhards. 
---
dude weed lmao
---
Now I'm 32.. and all I want to do.  Is Boooogaloo
---
unexpected Ringo?!
---
How are ‚Äòpeople putting actual time in getting nothing‚Äô tho? 
---
There is no such thing as a player who only plays LFR outgearing a Mythic raider, even if they get extremely lucky and get one piece of high titanforge gear. 
---
If you raid mythic, you get mythic gear (with a chance of titanforge).
---
If you raid LFR you get LFR gear (with a chance to titanforge).
---
Similar to your point, a player could step into their first mythic raid and get a high titanforge on their first boss kill, while their guild mates may have not seen a single titanforge this xpac. That‚Äôs just RNG, which is at time super frustrating, but which will never not be a part of wow. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a good system. I would rather there be no forging at all. It‚Äôs annoying to know that outside of titanforge I have very little chance of getting any upgrades this raid tier (I only raid heroic, I don‚Äôt have the time to commit to mythic raiding). 
---
I‚Äôm just saying the claims of it being Game Destroying are over blown. There are way bigger issues with modern WoW
---
Evidence of "gaming journalists" at work
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FD-uwu847Q
---
Plus the fact that being in ahead of the crowd by playing 2 days straight can be a precious QoL advantage in the following week, by having less waiting time for each quests.
---
Some bosses enrage at a certain percentage of life.
---
To be totally honest, the D3 expac launch was my smoothest launchday ever. 
---
Its by Fredrik Radum. The statue seems to be in Oslo. You can find its story here: https://mymodernmet.com/bronze-sculptures-fredrik-raddum/
---
Even fireworks on NYE. Or so a friend told me.
---
Uh, I'd say a "true classic newbie" never even played Vanilla.
---
Just equip the shield at that point if needed then, dual wield tank until then.
---
I hope not!
---
What?....
---
Lol I think you're maybe taking it a bit too seriously. This video is iconic.
---
&gt; 4-5h in like 3-5\\7 days 
---
I didn't know the new Kingdom Hearts game was out
---
Here's it's story: https://mymodernmet.com/bronze-sculptures-fredrik-raddum/
---
I never new about the specific level part but yeh I‚Äôd fill my groups using /who if no one bit after 10 minutes. 
---
I, too, am a milennials. 
---
Quest Helper was great back in WotLK, hopefuly some one makes one like that for Classic
---
It's explained really well in other comments, it's closer to the majority of end game content, as well as menethil harbor, making it closer to kalimdor. It's also laid out really conveniently, the AH and bank/mailbox are closer together, and you can run through the middle to get anywhere in the city. Not to mention the aesthetics.
---
MY MAN
---
that scene stands out in my mind as incredible.
---
Even 15 years later, that original wow trailer STILL holds up as beautiful
---
sooo many good scenes
---
the mage fighting the infernal, the dwarf on the snowy peak, druid sprinkling fairy dust
---
fuck nostalgia hitting me hard
---
You don't belong in the horde. 
---
I feel like the people that take the time to actively reach out for tanks by whispers are also going to have pretty smooth runs. 
---
I fkn hate ppl doing this, therefore I hate you. This will ruin chat and the game.
---
The rename tool the GM used probably bypasses the name checks that are in the game itself (save for uniqueness). Typical quick&amp;dirty dev tooling :-)
---
So you're going to pay $600 per month to multibox 40 accounts...would make more gold if you bought $600 worth of gold per month from gold sellers.
---
So many vanilla pvp songs but you didn't include Warriors - Freedom Call

---
oops, i didn't see your post until i already posted.  this guy is correct.  this was how duels were done.
---
Yeah, tabards are only a vanity reward and serve no function aside from looking good.
---
... so?  
---
DUDE YES. I remember looking at this picture with such a sense of wonder. I couldn't pay the sub when I was young but when BC came out I started played and I only gave it up this expansion
---
Was there a must have Bonus if you wear full leather as a druid per example in Classic? or was i common to wear leather as a hunter or cloth as a druid heal in early end game back then.
---
Healing in retail is a snooze fest compared to vanilla? Are you only doing normal dungeons or something?
---
No
---

‚ÄúUnpopular opinion‚Äù

*posts very obvious popular opinion*

please use a website other than reddit for once
---
Kudos to the informative wall of text and the TLDR at the end. 
---
*slow clap*
---
Was there some function in the game with a decent UI that allowed you to navigate player names that joined a list for a certain dungeon.  Not sure if Im losing my mind but I remember something like this.
---
Like click find a group button, then the dungeon name, then it would show a list of names for whoever wants to run that dungeon, and you could message those folks and get a group going.  Did this ever exist and is my mind fracturing?
---
Also, /LFG &amp; /zone chat worked, but the spam sometimes was nuts.
---
I think this is one thing folks forget about vanilla, just how tedious it was to find a group to run dungeons.  I was originally on a low pop server.  It was soul crushing.  
---
And now it's on there :)  
---
More suggestions/additions are always welcome.
---
Hey guys, I am struggling on deciding what to play. I started the game late into vanilla as a rogue, only made it to 40 or so by the time TBC was released. Some of my fondest memories were playing rogue with my friend and ambushing people outside of Gadgetzan. In wrath, I decided to try a warrior and I have mained warrior as fury and prot for tanking ever since. I have a good amount of experience with enhancement shaman and feral/guardian (once they split the spec) Druid Alts from cata onto BFA. 
---
I had planned on doing warrior first, as I really enjoy the class in later expansions. From what I have read I really can‚Äôt tell if I would enjoy them in the classic version, and I don‚Äôt think I should be relying on others to make leveling enjoyable. 
---
At the moment, I only have one friend that might take up playing classic with me, but it could be hit or miss. I might mostly be playing alone at this point. I am a casual player, but I would like to engage in some raiding and PVP. 
---
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
---
You're absolutely right, and I agree with you. I was just reminiscing fondly of having such an exciting carrot to chase that equalised me with others so easily. Having access to such easy gold definitely prevented me from having a much longer and more satisfying experience which I didn't realise at the time I would miss out on. Entirely a short term payoff, but hey, Wrath was coming.
---
It IS shitty for the long term health of the game to have content that is incentivised to a ridiculous degree. Isle of QD had some weird effects on the economy at the time. Longer term it wasn't the first time that things had come in to destabilise long term balance (like ZA, that definitely made things easier). It was however the beginning of shit like Wrath's raid tiers upon release immediately making redundant all prior raid content, something which would have seemed absurd in BC. After that it was just more and more "quality of life" and "catchup mechanics" - to the point that retail now has ridiculous levels of RNG in an attempt to provide an artificial sense of progression.
---
people think you need to be on voice chat and running add ons to clear 5 mans
---
nihilium, one of the leading horde guilds back during BC was getting world firsts without voice chat...they only started using voice comms during fucking sunwell....blitzing through t4-t6 and you can watch videos of their MT doing his thing and typing out commands at the same time
---
now a days you cant pug wailing caverns without everyone being like OK GUYS LETS GET IN DISCORD
---
It was low, but it showcased the game brilliantly (maybe not the 1fps part when combat started). It was nothing like what I'd played online before (Counter Strike, Mechwarrior4 and X-wing vs TIE Fighter) as it appeared to be a game that offered a certain degree of freedom of expression - a game where I could be myself in a community rather than a good guy/bad guy. It also inspired me to play a rogue on a PVP server, though I've never actually ganked anyone.
---
The sooner you CC, the more space you have between your group fighting and the CC mobs. A CC pull makes it a lot easier to AoE safely on the remaining mobs, for instance if you have one caster mob and the rest melee. It does carry the obvious disadvantage of the CC'er having initial aggro on all the mobs though.
---
It's funny we're both druids, the advantage I mentioned became clear to me because I sometimes have trouble using swipe in tight spaces if the CC was too slow. Seeing as I mostly have some rage to start with from the previous pack, having someone CC then picking up the rest with demo/swipe isn't much trouble and I usually prefer this with certain groups.
---
Scarab lord.
---
Exploits like walljumping to prematurely cap a base in AB or hide outside of the map with the flag in WSG is a exploid and is already fixed. If people find new ways of doing this they will fix it.
---
The fact that certain classes are good at goldfarming, fast leveling, stong in PvP or suck in raiding thats called balance. That will not be changed and I dont see why it should be.
---
Everyone is free to level a mage or hunter purely for goldfarming. Its not an exploid.
---
Everyone is free to roll warrior if they think that class is strong in pvp.
---
If you really think the Alliance wouldn't just murder the shit out of every forsaken your crazy. 
---
And you could argue that they won't be Forsaken in the first place so it's okay, but if you have to imagine a world where I wasn't raise to take the moral high ground them you've already lost it.
---
This is a really good answer.... 
---
I remember this being a thing back in vanilla. Since i was a warrior id get asked to tank a lot. After awhile id start messaging random people and ask if they were interested in running a dungeon. Id almost always get a response, a lot of times this sped things up.
---
It‚Äôs not optimal but you can do it. 
---
I think that can be generalized to any mobs with troublesome instant-cast abilities, good one.
---
Nah, IF is closer to BRD, Menethil Harbor (so closer to Kalimdor), closer to plaguelands, and is a direct shot from AH, bank, mailbox. IF will 100% be the main city like it was back in Vanilla. 
---
Yes and to clarify your answer-
---
If the mage sheeps to start, ALL mobs will aggro to the mage.  It's easy enough to maybe frost nova or something, but it requires extra coordination and risk to the mage that they get 1 shot by the angry derps. 
---
The best way is to have the mage on their toes and ready- once the warrior initiates sheep should be landing as soon after that as possible, that way all mobs are already running to the warrior but the sheep stays as far back as possible safe from random AOE
---
Sometimes people start from the bottom of the list, so should be something between H and Q.
---
I have a Samsung from that time too. 1680x1050 or something like that. It just died. Outstanding monitor, hated to see it go. Still sitting in the garage.
---
Yeah, dueling as SP felt like cheating VS most of classes. 
---
NA, PVP, Horde, Raiding &gt; PVP priority.
---
As for times. I work 9-6 CST Mon-Fri so basically as soon as I get home until probably midnight or so, can go later Fri/Sat.
---
Also, I plan to take 3 days off from work when the game launches so I'll have time to really go for it level wise for the first few days. 
---
I played all through Vanilla, raided everything, didn't finish AQ40 and only downed one boss in Naxx. My guild was doing MC/Ony/ZG/BWL in one run in one night.
---
PM me. 
---
&gt;I literally walk out he front door and I am at work
---
If you walk out of your home then does that not mean you are technically leaving work as well?
---
It remained the hub city even after other cities got them and even after they were linked.
---
Ok, and I don't disagree with any of those. But the OP called out "dueling" specifically, so if's effectively a PvP question. Searing Gorge/BRM is a big WPvP spot, but Stormwind is closer to STV/Grom'Gol. The convenient layout and access to mailboxes, etc are not going to convince many people to stop dueling outside of Stormwind.
---
SAME! Legit remember this being one of the most awe inspiring pictures from WoW before I started playing.. nostalgia man.. right in the feels.
---
Thanks for the tip BTW.  What would also be cool is if you could narrow down that list by zone to see whos close to the dungeon entrance, as folks arent going to switch continents to run a dungeon.
---
For example, does something liek **/who warrior 17-20 /1** exist?
---
The best and most iconic WoW video of all time, even more so than Leeroy Jenkins. 
---
This is so horde. Way more horde than OP.
---
Agreed! I'm kind if looking forward to seeing the older holidays too even if they are really simple. 
---
Yeah I gave a short answer and expanded on it later elsewhere in the thread:
---
&gt;Ironforge is ideally sited for both Menethil Harbour (for access to high level zones in northern and southern Kalimdor), Blackrock Mountain (BRD, LBRS, UBRS, MC, BWL), and is closer to Lordaeron (farming in EPL, Strath, Scholo, Naxx eventually). 
---
&gt; Ironforge is just simply the most conveniently located city for the Alliance. The only thing Stormwind is closer to is ZG and the only thing Darnassus is closer to is Winterspring, neither of which outweight Ironforge's benefits.
---
Discord 100%.  
---
That charge is basically a blink in beta.
---
The combination of all these factors made IF the natural hub.
---
you and about 99.9% of the rest of the population
---
its arguably the single most expensive item in all of vanilla wow
---
This is correct.  People doing the battlegrounds would queue in ironforge then run to bank to duel people.  Very common.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat and I‚Äôm looking forward to it! I played a lot during tbc, so I figure that is good enough haha. 
---
I Was going to roll a different main so I wouldn‚Äôt notice the difference as much, but I can‚Äôt resist re rolling a priest. 
---
I spent 5+ hours daily back in vanilla+tbc.
---
Now perhaps 1-2. A wife and kids will do that. 
---
I think the crowd today are more mature and can handle WoW much better.
---
2.0.3 WAS the TBC prepatch.
---
Hi, /u/magifek
---
Its the pserver meta now.  Whether it will be the same in Classic, remains to be seen.  There are arguments both ways, but the fact remains, no one knows 100% what the Classic meta will be.  We just have to wait and see.
---
I wish I could ruin something and then almost a decade later millions of people are still paying to play it. 
---
Why did you think it was so rare?
---
I tought this was common knowledge
---
I did however go into AQ as a level 50ish though! Our guild went to the opening of the gates, and decided to just enter for fun, It was a right laugh (no we did not get very far) 
---
I always pull another mob when I try to run. Then it‚Äôs over
---
 /who warrior 17-20 westfall
---
I should have! But I think I was stupid back then and didn't know they even could tank. This time around nobody will be safe from my spam! Muhaha!
---
The only thing like that in vanilla were rare elites that appear to be the same as regular mobs, it's usually after people attack them tha tthey start to realize "oh shit, I can't kill this thing"
---
Eh, not an entirely Classic newbie. You still experienced the game before the difficulty level and time investment needed to level was ramped down substantially.
---
You'll be a true Classic newbie to *endgame*, I suppose.
---
Put the zone name in the who
---
Final boss is lv28, so I would recommend a tank lv24+, and DPS average lv22+. Healer can get away with lv20. I am sure you could do it earlier (say, 2-4 levels each), especially with a premade group of presumably good players, but things will start to slow down a lot, mana breaks after every pack,...
---
I remember that feature, and sometimes you‚Äôd still get a long wait.
---
But you also just inspired a fond memory of vanilla. I was following this very advice, trying to get a group for Scholo. A mage DPS responded with ‚ÄúEh‚Ä¶why not.‚Äù
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure I understood his lack of excitement, but I was happy to fill the spot.
---
During the dungeon, I realized why: He was decked out in epics, and was doing tons of damage. He didn‚Äôt need to be there; but said yes anyway. Cool person üòä
---
Real men re-roll for their families!!
---
Those first few secs of the the clip, is that some old song? Feels like i've heard it somewhere else.
---
I remember playing this at school on one of the few game websites they didn‚Äôt block.
---
The bad thing is that rank 14 means you just skipped a bucketload of content. No anxiety when killing lvl 60 dungeons and MC/BWL raids etc for if loot upgrades drop, since you already have better stuff.
---
In vanilla, I would have been so flattered to be asked to druid tank, that I would have done it no matter how unsocial I was feeling. Anyone seeing you as something other than a backup healer and innervate bot was refreshing.
---
Jesus Christ...
---
Thank you SO much for posting this as an article rather than a 20min video (god I hate what Youtube has done to the internet). Chrome translated it into English almost perfectly.
---
That's exactly what you try to do as a paladin tank. You also put blessing of salvation on the rest of the party members. Problem is that judging SoR doesn't really hit hard enough. Holy Shock is more effective but requires deep holy.
---
Best way to tank as paladin is to not lose threat in the first place. Judge SoR on first kill target and drop consecrate to pick up the rest of the pack. Use HoJ on first kill target and then ignore it while moving on to the second kill target, etc. This is all to help you get ahead. Holy Shield, Blessing of Sanctuary on yourself and a shield spike are really helpful too.
---
If you do lose aggro, you can use BoP on the player that pulled aggro to at least "taunt" the mob off of them. Doesn't mean you will get the aggro next. You still have to work at that.
---
Improved BoP and HoJ talents help give you more control over the fight. Shorter cooldowns.
---
Also stack spell damage once you can to help increase holy damage output for more threat.
---
Vivid flashback of my shaman friend dropping totems, but one spawned on the lower level. A sea of mobs running up the ramp ensued. 
---
What is PTO exactly? 2 weeks paid headstart in front of everyone else?
---
Parents gifted me WoW on my 12th birthday. It was English-only at the time, and I was so into this world... I remember knowing what English words meant exactly (in context of WoW) but not knowing the translations in my class. It was like a superpower on tests, it came so naturally. 
---
Eventually I won my country's English Olympiad which earned me a free pass to any university I want as long as English was required for it. Which was great as my marks were not good at all. I chose computational linguistics and now am a head of R&amp;D department in mid-sized company.
---
It worked out great. Can't wait to give my dues to the game when it comes back. I quit retail when they forced all Russian speakers on Russian-spoken servers and clients in WoTLK.
---
We didn't really, I just rolled a night elf and he reluctantly followed me. I think at that point he was just happy that I had agreed to try WoW so he was willing to cave pretty easily. He wanted to go horde again this time but all of the friends that we're playing with are going alliance so he's losing again. Poor husband.
---
I am thinking about making a horde alt with him later in classic though so we can experience their stories and lore.
---
Elemental Shaman
---
Here's a crazy thought.
---
What if they kept it in to enable backwards compatibility for Classic systems :o
---
Lol I need to know. Would be pretty cool if you found em after that long and a simple reddit post
---
I was successfully running away from 2 mobs then this asshole spider from a fair but not far enough distance decided to join the murder party and cast a web on me. Had to Rez in the starting zone graveyard and run a million miles around a mountain to get back to the other side where my corpse was. That was 15 years ago!
---
...did I say 15 years, I meant 15 minutes 
---
Pretty much this.  Hookers, blow, gambling.  Take your pick.  
---
Yeah I think I either didn't know their could tank or decided not to bother because so many of them were healers. Either way this time will be different!
---
Wow I really wish people like you don‚Äôt end up staying on Classic. You‚Äôve been wrong the whole time and doubled down on just being  asshole. As the above commenter stated, learn some reading comprehension. Buddy boy. 
---
Werld uf werdcroft lernt me alco who tho reet.
---
I agree with this. At 60 you will definitely be exalted if you started out in the NE quest zones, but not before 40. Maybe somewhere in the 50s you will hit exalted. On a pserver, I'm NE and just hit exalted at 55.
---
Huh, I hadn't thought about it that way. Gonna keep that in mind if I ever do need a tank once this thing finally launches!
---
I hope that you are right!
---
 Clutch of Foresight is worth adding to your bar if you get one, so thanks for including it. I'm levelling a priest at the moment and my favourite item so far is the 5xdust you get for a low level quest reward that incapacitates for 20 seconds. I've macro'd it with /logout and have already dodged one gank attempt from a higher level mage.
---
There's also [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2091](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2091). 
---
Yea that graveyard spawn in the starting area sucks. It always seems like I die in jasperlode mine and the run back to it is around that mountain.
---
On pservers I think some people got very desperate for tanks, where they start messaging druids(me) and I am resto, and a lot of druids are resto.
---
Clarifying: I don't have anything to do with the pictures 
---
Well in my I just plain never got to raid or even try out for raiding so..... yeah, some quests just went undone.
---
Every class will go for 8/8 T3 for the most part, but only Hunters go for 8/8 tier 1/2/3 because the set bonuses are all good.
---
Shaman 8/8 tier 1 is good. Priest 8/8 tier 2 is good. Mage &amp; Rogue 8/8 tier 2 is viable but you have to drop a lot of hit &amp; crit rating. 
---
&gt;westfall
---
So for real, this works?  You've saved my life hahahaha.  **NICE!**
---
Nostalgia overload 
---
Does it open up a UI window or something what character names in white?  Maybe this is what Im remembering.  
---
Goldshire inn every time.
---
There are definitely different kinds of ‚Äúcasual‚Äù guilds. I play in a casual guild on a private server ATM and while it‚Äôs casual in that meme specs are welcome and you‚Äôre required to keep a positive attitude, there‚Äôs no mandatory attendance etc., the people who run them are very knowledgeable and have an understanding of things like DKP and bring in additional players from outside the guild if not enough people want to raid for a scheduled event so something is always going to happen if planned. 
---
But there are also the do dungeons only raid for fun once a month guilds too, you just have to really ask the GM/members. 
---
PvE
---
I leveled on a PvP server in Vanilla (only actually made it to 50ish before BC launched, I was a late-comer to the game).  I genuinely suck at PvP.  It may have been that I rolled a Shaman, but I was awful at WPvP especially.  I would play the occasional BG, but WPvP was the worst.
---
This time around, I actually want to enjoy my leveling and questing experience without the constant fear of the gank.
---
Soon or soon TM?
---
Yes. You might not be able to join the hardcore guilds because besides raiding they expect you to come with all consumables possible wich recuire hours and hours to farm for.
---
But there are plenty of casual guilds doing all kinds of raids even up to aq40. You will be fine if you find a guild with a raiding scedue that fits you.
---
&gt;soon
---
SOON
---
Depending on the dungeon, the group, and other factors, I could very well consider switching continents to heal a dungeon. I burn out on questing quickly and only feel truly at home when I'm in a group healing a tank. 
---
If I understood your irony correctly, I probably made a misstake. What I meant was 4-5h per day, playing 3-5 days per week
---
Shazam points to this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEd1xN0KkgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEd1xN0KkgM) but I'm guessing it's a sample in there as well.
---
Just sell anti Ganking services. In exchange for money you will kill people of the opposing faction that are ganking. And will gank them till they delete there Character.
---
Another thing to keep in mind are the festival elders. I recall each of them yields 75 *alliance* rep. I assume this means 75 rep for each alliance factions. So that's also 1500 xp or so? Not sure how many elders you can reach/find.
---
If you're a 5 man group then almost any class combo will be entirely fine because a coordinated 5-man group will probably outfight any other random 5-man group they come across.
---
If you want glass cannon the answer is Mage, if you want a CC-heavy class the answer is probably Rogue, if you want a utility class that's a World PvP toolkit the answer is Hunter with Engineering as a profession, if you want a good hybrid healer to back your Priest friend up then any of Druid, Paladin, or Shaman (depending on whether you're Horde or Alliance you lose one or the other) bring their own unique utilities to the match.
---
I don't get how people can have such a vision of retail Vanilla. I mean in pservers with all that asshole mentality that has grown up over the years get it, but in Vanilla 99% of players had no f\*cking clue what was viable or not. I tanked as a paladin all the time, and had a druid tanking several times as well. Never a single word about that from my groupmates. Very disturbing.
---
Also maybe the reason is I didn't play in an anglo-saxon server, so maybe we non english players are different, but still.
---
More dmg is more treat. More treat is more raid dmg. More raid damage is boss dies faster. If boss dies faster healers have more mana to spend. More mana to spend on the tank without a shield.
---
I wouldn't play Alliance in Vanilla for any man, woman, child or animal.
---
Get in line or get out.

Speak for yourself.
---
Yeah the idea that the 5man dungeons released alongside the new raid tier provided higher level gear than the previous raids blew my mind. I rather liked the catch up mechanics in vanilla, like ZG, AQ20 and the T0.5 sets, but having a catch up to each single raid tier seems  a mindblowingly stupid way of making content only last a few months. 
---
It's funny you mentioned ZA because I think TBC was in an odd middleground between vanilla and wotlk that somehow worked out really well, but ZA broke that mold and fucked it up through the sheer usefulness of it's gear. Everything in ZA was so well itemized for their particular specs that, like IQD was in terms of money, it was just way too effective as a gear catch up.
---
I think it also happened to be muddled with the addition of badges dropping from Karazhan which IMO was a mistake. Patch 2.3 added badges to karazhan, Zul'aman with badges, as well as the daily heroic quests that rewarded badges. At the same time they added T5 level loot to the vendor but I think they underestimated the increased rate of badge-gain with the new additions and the cost of the items was poorly balanced.

Happened to me a couple of times recently on a pserver, meant I could add a couple of names to my fwiends list as the runs went really well.
---
Because it's a private server that isn't tuned properly, oh and they likely out gear the encounter too.
---
Doesn't really deserve it's own post but since we are talking names I need a lot of help with a good undead priest pun.

Stormwind is the capital for lowbies and IF is the capital for 60's. On Private servers with the Onyxia Buffs popping every 3 minutes in SW people have gradually migrated there. Another big bummer of private servers is that Ironforge dueling area is always dead. People don't just hang out and duel anymore. There's always honor or consumable farming to be done instead of just standing around smelling the roses and dueling for fun. If they are all farmed up and geared people just raidlog. I hope that will change a bit in classic.

Gather all quests and tell them you have the quests and will share
---
Tell them you have a warlock if you do. Or maybe roll one, everyone loves getting summoned.
---
Seriously finding a group is very easy if you try, you don't even need to be a tank. Very underrated advice tbh.
---
Hahahahaha, Love it!
---
Also, who gives a damn about IF not having Druid trainers? Druids sure don't, since we just port to Moonglade when we need one 99% of the time. As someone who played various different Druid toons, I don't think I ever visited any Druid trainers outside of Teldrassil and Moonglade. Actually, on my last toon I remember "discovering" the Felwood one and actually buying skills from him ONCE. Moonglade is life.
---
3 piece bonus on shaman tier 2 is good
---
Ventrilo had an awsome Text to Speech function. I miss that. 
---
ooc or setup crowd control ought to go in first. then a tank pull and then reactive crowd control (sheep, seduce, wyvern stings, shakle)
---
Though keep in mind that LoS pulls with reactive crowd control can still screw things up. Mana regen was still causing threat prior to BC and I dunno how well this is factored in on plague servers

&gt;priest does NOT have poor cc
---
Well, it's mainly the feeling I got as ally and relying on scream vs UD-centric PvP (WotF+PvP trink, even when they started sharing cd). But I have to say it was as a tbc disc (so no silence, just MC along scream) and I was still quite a noob at that time ;).

What about for double barrelled zone names, like Redridge Mountains?  Do you type "redridge", or "Redridge Mountains"
---
Hillsbrad Foothills. Stone Talon Mountains, 1K Needles I'd say.
---
Oh wow they have starfire? I don‚Äôt recall that in vanilla. That‚Äôs neat. What‚Äôs it like gearing these classes? I know shadow priest mostly gets the none tier set items, but ele sham and boom kin isn‚Äôt brought to raids, so would you just heal till you are geared and use the healing gear?
---
Nope, just making a bad joke.
---
You'll be fine in a casual raiding guild.
---
Scarab Lord. 
---
There's always the ZG tiger if you fancy your luck, other than that it's tough luck.
---
Fail college
---
One of the greatest things about the game in my opinion - hate being constantly taken out of my character's view to watch cut scenes and on-rail story quests. 
---
Bottom of the elevator in 1k Needles.
---
Or roll a Night Elf priest, shadowmeld at the top and mind control people off. I can't *wait*
---
I can hear this
---
Literal /r/gatekeeping
---
Stormwind on some servers I played had higher rates of duels outside than IF. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter - just go where the people are.
---
As a rogue in vanilla I totally used this to find tanks/healers :D, it worked great!
---
Awesome! Now tell me how to find a duo partner to level with lol
---
Have you made a ticket with Blizzard about this? This seems to be a question they can answer anyway. Since I don't see why this would be different from Classic then how it's now with Retail.
---
Trying to figure out how to make it feel fresh. I've unfortunately kinda fried myself on the 1-30 experience on pservers.
---
I think you need to subscribe to an EU license aswell to access the EU Classic, dont need to buy BFA just sub to the standard edition.
---
Well, there's also no staves, dagger and spears modifiers, it doesn't mean they apply to one of the other existing ones.
---
I had a friend many years ago, in Europe for work also, and started on a EU server. Soon after he just made a toon in a US server so he could be in our guild. So as far as I understand from that you can pick which ever region you want so long as you pay for the sub.
---
Also I am also quite sure that there is no Classic sub and Retail sub... it is all one sub and my uneducated guess is that Classic may be a sever selection much like EU and US and Oceanic currently are. 
---
No one needs to strut. Just afk on top of the mailbox, put your feet up, brew some coffee and watch the crowd build around you.
---
So he said nothing new.
---
use PvP gear and what gear you can pick up from GDKP runs, unless you work 5 times as hard no one is going to take a moonkin to a raid.
---
Axe spec won't do much for a hunter tho.
---
Outrageous. Ironforge is clearly the coolest.
---
I dont get it.
---
Like with most wow patches/expansion we we're able to download it beforehand. So we are all able to start at the same time. Not sure if we will again this time but I guess we will.
---
Orc for sure. Best PvP racial in the game.
---
I love Taurens, but I always disliked tauren hunters, they seem so slow when kiting (I know it's ony visually. not mechanically).
---
I think Tauren lore supports hunters, but not how wow hunters work mechanically (lot's of rapid movement, kiting, jumping etc)
---
I mean sometimes you gotta pull a mob off someone you have zero threat on that they have been wacking for 2 minutes.  In this case no ability in the game other than taunt will help you.
---
Cool thanks.  
---
I'm going to be pvping a bunch with my buddy, probably try for r12. If you wanted to like up let me know. I'm keen
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure /who warrior will return any players that have warrior in their name AND are the warrior class...if you want to get into specifics or filters then use the commands. In my experience I‚Äôve never used the commands to narrow my results and this is how it has always worked for me (since vanilla)
---
For once, it wasn't the huntards fault.
---
I didn't understand it either. But it was the case for many, from about the time that I hit 50 or so, I was always told I was a healer. It wasn't until BC released that I went feral and became a pretty good tank. 
---
When classic launches, I'm definitely sticking with feral. 
---
Wondering. What was the main hub for horde? Orgrimmar or underCity? 
---
&gt; All other good ranged options at 60 are pretty much crossbows.
---
Well, but we can assume that after clearing MC the hunter would also be closer to hit cap from gear so the racial helps while it needs to be helping.
---
Way better than gun spec for sure.
---
Depending on what level you are, gank Stromgarde or the top of Jintha'Alor.  You crush hopes and dreams and make it difficult for them to ever create new ones.
---
Kite and kill. No one can touch me! 
---
Expect maybe hunters, locks, spriests and other mages.
---
I'll be a serious PvE raider so I'll walk around without iceblock, coldsnap and ice barrier. I'll be a freekill for most people. 
---
Untill my PvE work pays off and I walk around in tier2. Than it does not mather if I dont have the best spec. A frostbolt+POM frostbolt will oneshot you.
---
When you are leveling as Shadow and got some spare time. "Of course I will!"
---
One of the reasons raids were reduce to 25-man is because filling out a 40-man group isn't easy, so it's doubtful you'll be turned away altogether. Someone will need you to fill a raid spot somewhere.
---
holy shit, I didn't know we were missing this amazing version of IF all this time.
---
I'm miserable now, thanks
---
Good for you! Enjoy your journey! will be amazing
---
Oh yeah...grenades.  Ugh.  Btw, it's always very weird to me they really do count as Stuns, despite breaking on damage, and not Incapacitates.
---
&gt; Orc has 5% stun resist, which is why I‚Äôm leaning toward them as well.
---
25%
---
I remember this picture. As a Warlock main, I always thought it was hilarious that the best spell effect they could muster up for this was a freaking BUFF. 
---
Just be careful you're not facing the edge - I sent a priest called Elevator plummeting to their death by hitting WotF as soon as they started running me towards the edge.
---
Paladins have no issues tanking undead mobs. Any other requires reflect damage, thorns, ret aura, fireshield, shield spike, trinket that procs aoe damage, weapon that leeches life from the target generating lots of threat. Judge seal of righteousness and your gonna do fine. Issue is you just a 5-10 man tank but even then...good geared warriors can stack those things too but have taunt and defensives.
---
Do you
---
Druid reporting!
---
Please remember hybrids can often be anything (or even multiple things) while leveling.  You can often whisper a druid / pally and ask if they can tank or heal and see how it goes.  :)
---
Blessing of protection
---
Honestly I agree. Been playing some BFA and I am going through the story thinking "Why am I not just playing Jaina?"
---
It's been 10 years since I've gone through Gnomer and I can hear it like it was yesterday.
---
Paid Time Off.  Basically paid vacation time from work.
---
That is Polygon but yeah, I put them in the same category as Kotaku.
---
It is unfortate that most gaming journalists are not hardcore gamers anymore. You have to really dig deep to find people who write articles or make youtube videos that are interesting to read/watch.
---
Well, since you want to heal, then you'll have a raid spot easily.
---
Looks like 48 is the breakpoint, so I'll likely do it then.
---
The sword the dwarf is actually holding is not Teebu‚Äôs, its a different sword with fiery enchant. However, the sword shown in the character pane is the real Teebu‚Äôs.
---
I haven't created a ticket, yet. 
---
From my point-of-view, the difference is in software licensing.  Retail WoW is a product you pay for, wow classic will essentially be freeware you can use if you pay for the other product.  Whether they will restrict the 'freeware' product to the same region as the product you pay for, will be the question. 
---
That seems like a pretty low lvl range to be running DIRE MAUL!!!!
---
/s
---
Look up PvP video's and pick what looks and feels the coolest. That how I always decide what to play.
---
God damn it.
---
I tried Reddit. I really did.
---
If a Druid has the Starfire talent, will it take a debuff slot when the stun procs? In this case, a raiding moonkin should NOT put points on improved Starfire for this reason?
---
I did this a lot in Vanilla.  Feels good to get a tell join a group.  Makes you feel wanted.
---
Retail API with certain (specifics unknown) calls restricted if it goes against the vanilla experience.
---
Always pick a dwarf.
---
Necrofella   I had a 39 undead mage with that name as a twink. 
---
I tried raiding for a few months in WoD, and it was terrible. Was burnt out by Heroic, and had no desire to get any further than what I had done in Mythic.
---
Last time I enjoyed Raiding was Cata launch when my guild was progressing through Firelands. Then they nerfed everything and ever since raiding has been a practice of farming mind numbingly easy stuff, and your 'progression' is just repeating the things you've already done on a difficulty slider. And time spent wiping/practicing on that is actually better spent farming an easier mode for slight upgrades, which is extremely frustrating.
---
It does not click with me at all. As a casual I have no desire to ever raid again in WoW until classic comes out, I might only ever 2 1 or 2 bosses, but that's fine with me, and those bosses will feel all that more special because of it.
---
"sjw" oh give me a break. It has nothing to do with being a SJW and everything to do with being a female gamer for over 30 years and tired of this ignorance from the male gamer community. I want to relive 2006 WoW, but there's definitely elements of it I do NOT want to relive, like all the gross shit on chat. I am sick to death of hearing garbage about female gamers. It's time to kill that crap and there's only one way to stop it, and that's to call out someone when they continue to regurgitate it.
---
This technique is 170% more effective if you are a warlock with summon, or if you have one in party.
---
&gt; well taurens are op becouse you can warstomp + trap, and save your scatter shot plus the extra hp
---
This is true in TBC when you can opt to put traps in combat but then they take a while to go off.
---
In vanilla you have to feign deth so you don't need to warstomp or scatter to trap.
---
Best race for PvP is Orc, best race for PvE is Troll
---
8/8 t2.5 is insane for shaman. the individual pieces aren't even that good for healing, but the full set bonus is insane.
---
Should name his ally that.
---
Yep, for sure I can start a new toon in any region if i purchase a game license there.  My problem is, i don't want to pay for subs in two regions, and I don't want to give up 15 years of current character progress. 
---
About your second point, yes, it's known there will be no dedicated "classic sub."  I am hoping EU server will be a dropdown option with US retail sub ;) 
---
Haha yes I know what you're talking about
---
That is a nice plan :). But keep in mind that it is an easy thing for Mages to respec for a week of good PvP and it can be quite a blast (no pun intended).
---
So  if a Druid has the Starfire talent, will it take a debuff slot when the stun procs? In this case, a raiding moonkin should NOT put points on improved Starfire for this reason? 
---
depends on how they plan on implementing sharding. You'd be correct if they plan on having shards of 8 players. If its 100 players per shard, it's likely still going to be crowded as fuck.
---
 One bubble of rested XP (5% of a level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting. A maximum of 30 bubbles (150% of a level) may be earned. In other words, you can leave your character resting in an inn or capital city for up to 10 days (without gaining experience) before you earn the maximum amount of rest state, and a resting character stores up one full level of rest in 160 hours (6 days, 16 hours).    
---
Via:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rest](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rest) 
---
So then make it LFR and Mythic only. And LFR drops gear worse than heroics, but better than normal dungeons.
---
To add on to layout, I think a big plus for IF is that the area between the AH and bank is big and open, allowing a lot of people to stand around without it feeling cramped. Compare this to the first intersection when you enter SW, which is too small for the same amount of people to fit. It's a bonus if you have some extra space so you can actually see people with dope gear and spend some time people watching. 
---
It went both ways from my memory. So many people in original vanilla thought a warrior couldn't tank unless they were protection spec.
---
&gt;when she dings 60
---
&gt;Joana is a male.
---
This has always bugged me. I mean I'm a guy and I play female characters from time to time, but having a guide you made be referencing a female name which is then used to refer to you is soooo weird. It also took me awhile to learn that it's a guy who made the guide but simply had this troll character called Joana.
---
Thanks man! Yeah that's what I'd imagine. I'm just going to play a little once in a while, and if I eventually reach 60 to get some "honourable member" pity epics from my friends that are starting a guild (and don't have kids).
---
I had been hoping for a spring launch too get leveling done pre-kid ;) 
---
Our raiding days will be sunday, monday, wednesday.
---
So from thursday till saterday I can play in PvP spec. I will have plenty of gold anyway since Im planning on farming alot.
---
and you still need exalted with Darnassus
---
Cucking to alliance. Disgusting
---
What's the point of implementing sharding if servers are still gonna be overcrowded? They should do it properly or not do it at all.
---
Quite good Robert! But number 6 cannot be counted. 1 unique... too difficult to obtain!
---
Yeah, ToC dailies were a bit too much (especially when they all stacked up). What makes it somewhat tolerable is that it was more like a side activity for mounts/pets/achievements, you could buy the items but at the point where you could buy an item from the daily grind of the ToC tokens you would be outgearing these items.
---
Same here. WoW was so bad for a while (at least the server I was on), that I pretended to be a man and did the same as you - claimed I was unable to use a microphone because something on my PC was broken. It worked for a while.
---
I used to jump servers to look for a safer one. I tried about 30 servers. Would make a newb character, run it into SW or Org and listen to chat. Only took about 10 minutes until I heard some gross sexist shit. 
---
People forget about that part while reminiscing about the good old days. I haven't. However, it's nearly 15 years later and I am more aggressive than I used to be, so I plan on calling it out every time I see it.
---
That is retail wow. In classic, /who warrior 11-15 would give you a list of every warrior on the server (of your faction) between those levels.
---
Thank you!
---
Google is your friend.
---
Loved doing this and receiving these PMs. Some Party Leaders wouldnt do this and it drove me crazy. I always made the grps. Now im rolling as a druid and want to be able to be the final cog in a grp regardless if its tank/feraldps/heals. 
---
Even easier as a Warlock once you can summon. Finding 2 DPS is easy, get them to the instance, and offer an immediate summon to the instance for a tank and healer. 
---
i dunno but they sure do like using that word "soon."
---
Yup, it works even in retail right know if I'm not mistaken
---
Go Horde and assert your dominance. Reach High Warlord, destroy her runs to instances, ransack her favorite capital, the works. Show her the one, TRUE faction!
---
If you stood on top of the mailbox in ironforge near the bank, you could duel inside the city. I dunno if that bug was later fixed...
---
 Qu'est-ce que √ß'est? Ally? In MY Barrens? I don't think so pal
---
IMO this is kinda like people who say PTSD is not a real thing, like the psychological element to games are what makes some of them appealing.
---
I beat dark souls!! oh nice man, i hear its hard. / On easy mode!!
---
oh so you just did what other did but without challenge? 
---
First of all leveling a Warrior is not as "hard" as people make it out to be. It's just a bit slower. But really skilled Warriors can be just as fast as anyone.
---
Secondly it is super easy to make friends as a Warrior. Guess who gets the most messages from random people in search of dungeon group members? Warriors and Druids.
---
If you do the leveling Dungeons you will find players that synergize well with you. Put people on your friends list regularly and check on them if you are questing etc.
---
Org
---
just let her create a toon, play for a while
---
and she probably gets fixed.
---
Realized my tone came out as hostile based on the replies but I actually tried to ride on the curiosity side, I have failed apparently :D
---
100 is better than 1,000.
---
And "server stability" doesn't necessarily mean keeping the hardware from catching fire. IMO it's more to artificially inflate the server cap so the server pop is stable months after launch and it settles to a more normal pop.
---
Overcrowded is fine. Stupidly overcrowded will lead to abandonment.
---
if you have zero threat it just goes to the next guy not necessarily you.
---
Pro Tip
---
I always imagined the cold crisp air of Dun Morogh as you step outside the entrance, and a warm cozy heat emanating from the city gate behind you. Seems inviting just by virtue of being a warm dwarf city nestled in a cold ass mountain.  
---
Can't wait to experience that again.
---
Stuff in Vanilla makes you think about what you're doing, it rewards you for being efficient.
---
Simple as pulling a second mob on a quest means a potion, cooldown, or dying. Getting a buff from another player means I go longer without resting, or a new skill/talent, new piece of gear, etc... all of these things have **significant** impacts on how I go about playing the game.
---
In modern WoW none of that stuff matters, you have self heals or out of combat regen, and whether you do a complex rotation, get your entire guild to buff you, use a white or epic piece of gear, the result is basically the same, you AoE a bunch of mobs and are at full hp ready for the next pack.
---
Same thing in dungeons, in Vanilla there was a process - you had to pull the small pack, CC the 2nd or 3rd add, focus on the same target. You were smart at this and rewarded in clearing and less mana regen for healer. Healers also would actually run out of mana, where following the process mattered, a new build/piece of gear or buff helped them.
---
In modern WoW it's just pull a pack and AoE everything, there is nothing to think about, no choices to be made. It doesn't matter that the mechanics might be harder or more complex...it's not about that at all.
---
Levitate baby! 
---
a new game will come out and be fresh for all again, for now we enjoy classic wow don't worry :-)
---
Warrior or Rogue will be a perfect option for you.  Both synergize well with healers, but warriors are really strong with a healer. 
---
It's really tit for tat when it comes down to solo stuff. A rogue will technically be easier to level and play solo pve/pvp.  A warrior will be more difficult to level at first (don't listen to the people on youtube talking about /sit macros for enrage, it won't work in classic) but it will get much easier later on.  Warrior damage scales better in raids later on compared to rogues from what I've read. Warriors also do really well in group pvp with a healer. 
---
Sorry for butting in, you seem pretty knowledgeable so imma take my chances. Will Lupos do shadow dmg and will Brokentooth have higher attack speed in 1.12? Any word from Blizzard on that
---
‚ÄúDrums. Drums in the deep. We cannot get out, they are coming.‚Äù
---
at least we can expect more updates to come
---
Oh, dude, I'm sorry.
---
WOW was ruined by no longer forcing interactions between players to accomplish goals as a group.
---
Or she could suck it up and play Horde with him.
---
I *very much* recommend this video on duo leveling. I think the firstor second duo discussed (*and* tested) is Paladin + Warlock. The synergy between the two seems amazing, especially if you spec and play around eachother for increased AoE power. You absolutely *must* watch the section with Paladin and Warlock! :)
---
You can skip to around 6ish minutes:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_rHqqYnh18
---
Priest + Warlock was also tested and while it seems good in theory, it didn't quite work out well in practice.
---
Depends how badly you want that mount.  Ill be doing it.  
---
Org generally speaking. More zepplin connections. A lot of people spent a lot of time in UC though. As far as dueling goes, outside Org was the place to be. 
---
really good post for people who are not sure what class to play as
---
pve is simple
---
your a tank dps or healer
---
pvp mage or warlock? seems to be mage for moblity warlock for tankiness 
---
Hillsbrad Foothills is the first contested zone after Silverpine Forest, while Stonetalon Mountains, Thousand Needles, and Ashenvale will be the first contested zones after the Barrens.
---
Hell, I remember having a shaman tank a few times in RFC and WC...
---
I have never ever heard of this feature before. I didnt really find finding a Group that hard back in vanilla though either. 
---
Whatever works bro, I guess it depends on who's more stubborn
---
I healed all dungeons as Shadow Priest w/o a problem. Trick is to just drink right after every pull or two and have a couple of mana pots ready for longer bossfights.

I can remember walking out of OG after the first quest in vanilla and seeing all of the amazing gear and enchants on people as they were dueling. I‚Äôd run up to everybody and inspect (accidentally open a trade some times #awkward) haha. But that was so cool to see and then is what pushed me to grind through to 60 and immediately get destroyed by them. 
---
Holy shit this is truly the only answer. this comment needs up.
---
Linked auction houses did not happen for over a year after launch. Ironforge was ingrained into people by that time.
---
Frost nova is so dangerous and I don't think many mages are going to know this. Any mob that's frost nova'd will turn on the highest threat within reach and attack that target, which means if you nova  priest just so happens to be by one of the mobs, you now don't have a priest =P.

Stop asking the fucking question. YOU WILL KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. Nobody is going to miss the fucking release.
---
Another good tip I learned from my early adventures was to add all tanks and healers I found to my friends list. 
---
We all stayed relevant level wise, and I'd whisper them "want to tank SFK?" few minutes later "sure!" :D
---
Cast sheep 2 seconds after you hear the tank's bowstring tighten. 
---
Sheep pulls can be effective with a Paladin tank, as Consecration will pull whatever mobs the mage aggros (and also because Paladins can't actually pull). For a Warrior though, they lack true AoE without stance dancing, so they'd prefer to have the initial hate.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I started playing during either patch 1.8 or 1.9, I believe. Never hit level cap during vanilla, though I later did in BC and WotLK. Didn't necessarily bother me -- I always enjoyed leveling more than end-game content, anyway. Although I don't want to take full responsibility for never having hit level 60 during vanilla -- I remember flat out running out of quests on more than one occasion. Oh, the olden days. Ha!
---
That said, I'm excited to try end-game for the first time this summer with Classic!
---
Playing an orc rogue in PvP and resisting an alliance kidney punch / cheap shot is unfair and OP.
---
\#Change my mind.
---
If you want to do professions while leveling, which I personally recommend because it is fun and effective, then I suggest the following for Warrior:
---
Primary:
---
Engineering + Mining. This will get you very useful consumables and really fun gear for both PvP and PvE. As a tank the biggest advantage is that you can pull dungeon packs with grenades/bombs, instantly asserting threat on multiple mobs.
---
Alchemy + Herbalism. This is the combo that will net you the most gold and also provides a great advantage during leveling.
---
Secondary:
---
Do all of them.
---
SW is not equally close to the BRM content, in vanilla when flying from SW to thorium point the connected flight path is IF so you have to fly from SW-past thorium point to IF- then back down to thorium point. 
---
And for the boats he was obviously talking about the boat from BB to ratchet. He‚Äôs saying that‚Äôs the only closest boat to SW, the rest are closer to IF. He didn‚Äôt mean SW literally has a boat going straight to ratchet.
---
some people do seem to be a bit crazy about classic like quit their full time job and shun their family for that swwwweeeeet sweet classic
---
It was full of 13yo kids telling everyonr they were 18.
---
I know it because I was 9 and I did tell everyone I was 14.
---
Yeah i was thinking the same thing, what better way to celebrate my death with an all out world pvp fight at my wake.
---
I would love it :)
---
I love seeing this pop up.  Warrior Nation was the first guild that I was in and remained a member for the majority of Vanilla.  I love seeing Alhazred's posts (our GM) and how he jumped on Serenity Now for their actions.  I don't hate that this happened.  This video has immortalized not only the individual, but our guild as a whole.  I love vanilla &lt;=)
---
If I could i would roll as a Tauren rogue in a heartbeat, just for the concept of being a sneaky refrigerator.
---
The closest thing is being a gnome rogue with an orb of deception for that sexy tauren stealth animation... but that means I would need to play as a gnome; a punishment worse than death.
---
3 piece Tier 2 priest is like the baseline you want for healing due to increased mana regen.  
---
R14 and scarab lord are things you couldn't achieve even with 2 weeks PTO.  Getting them without the time investment cheapens the achievement, but I would never be able to get them the authentic way.
---
Am I the only one that has become less and less trusting of journalists across the board? That isn't to take a dump on the ones who truly are good at their craft, because I know those types are out there.
---
But I find myself more and more often adding the "reddit" keyword at the end of a Google search and I end up finding far more information on a topic than a single writer can give me. Thousands of users chiming in to give the answer to a question rather than ONE person giving the answer in a 500-word article.
---
SW looks nicer. The end.
---
Bonus: If you're a warlock you can farm shards in Duskwood which is a short trip south from SW
---
As Reinhardt in overwatch said... ‚Äú I have been called, I **must** answer, always..‚Äù
---
Feels like he hinted towards the TM considering he at first said "as I said earlier, classic will release this summer" a.k.a release in just a few months.
---
I think the key to achieving exalted with Darnassus (or any of the city factions) by level 40 will be maximizing the amount of spillover rep you get from quests. Not all private servers use spillover rep, but that capability was verified to be active on the Classic Demo released last year.
---
So with that in mind, I‚Äôve started developing an Alliance quest completionist guide that enables you to complete ALL faction rep quests at the appropriate level (before they turn gray), so you get maximum spillover rep to achieve exalted with Darnassus, as well as the other city factions. The guide is currently complete through level 27, and is Rogue-specific, but the general route would still work for any Alliance class (minus class-specific quests).
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
At least he reiterated that it's coming on summer. I don't think I'd be able to handle a delay at this point. 
---
That's fine and all, but do you have any idea when they will release Classic?!
---
Yes it opens a small UI window showing the name/class/level/current zone
---
Good point, i used this alot in the days but forgot all about it in the last years.
---
Druid Cats or Druid Bears don't exist in PvP. You constantly switch forms wether you are feral or HotW/NS or Swiftmend/Charge. If it helps: While fighting you are mostly in either humanoid or bear form and you use cat for opener/bleeds and to chase down fleeing opponents, and this is regardless of your spec.

I‚Äôm one of these warriors. I love tanking dungeons, and so long as I have the time I‚Äôll drop anything to tank for you.
---
Alternately, when healing on my Druid I often /who‚Äôd to find a tank or dps to complete a group.
---
Great post, OP.
---
I started playing on a private server with no prior experience and I was able to join a semi-hardcore guild raiding 2-3 hours per day, two days per week. I just have to get consumables, enchants, and other stuff from outside the raid, which I can usually do in a couple of extra hours each week.
---
Fellow guild members, and the internet, have been an invaluable resource of knowledge.
---
You should just start asking guilds if you would be able to join. Each guild is different, different schedule, different requirements, etc.
---
I love all the dungeons in Classic, they are all unique and challenging with awesome design and cool layouts (WC confusing af at first though tbh)
---
Spear isn't a weapon type. Stave and Dagger modifiers exist as bonuses on gear.
---
Still, when it comes to raids i don't think this applies to most classes.
---
There's no gameplay or rewards for spamming the same spell as a caster or specs like arms warrior being blacklisted because they take a debuff slot.
---
Also there should be more gameplay decisions with mythic + now than there used to be back in vanilla, if that's the kind of thing you enjoy you should give it a try with a few friends.
---
Overall your point is that vanilla content was harder but it feels like it's more about stats than actual gameplay. I do think harder content is a good thing, but that's another topic. 
---
Was there interrupt spells back or vanilla or were they added in LK btw ? It's one of the mecanic which makes gameplay more engaging &amp; dynamic and it would be great to have it on classic. (I'm not asking to add content to vanilla, but it would be great if it was already there)
---
Had a CRT until I got my first job in 2007.
---
All through high school I wanted an LCD display.
---
Then I finally got one.
---
1024x768 VGA
---
it was beautiful.
---
Aren't they the same zepplin connections in vanilla though?
---
That's how I did it back in TBC. Depending on server size it can still take you a considerable amount of time to get your group filled.
---
I'll be curious to see how things like this evolve differently than they did the first time around.

---
I believe everything will have to be remade, 1.12 mods you can find now won‚Äôt work on the legion API which classic is based off of 
---
GTFO. Everyone on this sub should be a friend, we are all fans of Classic WoW, and you're not adding anything (you add LITERALLY NOTHING) to the conversation.
---
YES! I WANT UNDEAD PALADINS TOO!
---
Vanilla is the solution to everything. 
---
What could possibly go wrong when the hive mind becomes your main source for news?  Oh right...
---
Seriously though, we all need to curate our media diet these days with all the bullshit out there.  Whether it's video games or politics, learn which organizations are ethical and reputable, and read them regularly.  Don'y just google shit or click links.
---
Thanks, good to know!
---
Hunters have better CC, threat control and can provide group auras for movement speed and nature resistance. Warlocks can summon and deal more damage overall.
---
did you play horde pre cata? the zones, especially old orgrimmar is much mure appelaing than the new one. so keep that in mind.
---
It won't matter for WoW but for games with competitive play, players always use TS over Discord.
---
Yes ofc. There is always a lack of dedicated tanks for all types of content and playstiles.
---
Right, so 90% of the the people who're presumably gonna be playing Classic are above 21, which is expected to be a mature age nowadays.
---
That means, if you see someone who's acting like a child, being an asshole or just making problems; it's probably someone who's just too insecure and hasn't 'grown up'.
---
Anyway, I don't remember having many bad moments with others in Vanilla especially so I'm sure most of us will get along just fine.
---
Can't wait to have my friends list full to the top with always online buddies &gt;:D!
---
Both Warriors and Rogues make their money off of dungeon runs mostly.
---
This is big for me and my friends anyway
---
Pink one for me!!!
---
True on paper, but given the over abundance of warriors, you are rolling against like 8 other people in raids. 
---
\&gt;  increased by an additional 25%. 
---
It seems clear enough that what ever the baseline percentage is, you add 25 to that value. So if the baseline is 15%, you end up with 40%.
---
The word "additional" clarifies it further.
---
I forgot the exact quote but I thought of the same thing! :D
---
Us tanks have a duty to get these people through dungeon quests smoothly... when I can help I do. :)
---
No problem at all for those classes.
---
"highest rank w/o actually playing or even gearing/speccing well"
---
I honestly think this is just an outright lie tbh.
---
I added the answer. To find said answer I googled the question. The person would have gotten their answer faster that way.
---
Rank 14 as it's an aids grind the most will never complete and I'd take it on a warrior even though I domt play warrior as the warrior banana suit is so iconic.
---
Berserking, Blood Fury, Hardiness, and Regeneration?
---
That would give alliance plenty of an excuse to cry OP.
---
&gt;What could possibly go wrong when the hive mind becomes your main source for news?  Oh right...
---
Agreed. However in this context is Reddit or the media at large the "hive mind" in question?
---
for sure but be aware if you play warlock you're going to have to travel everywhere yourself
---
judging by the looks of the dwarf models they are basically horde
---
My real life problem is that I want to play a good game, but there aren't any.
---
I thought it was Silithus?
---
Nope. It was both. Getting to Onyxia or Azuregos or Felwood or Winterspring quickly is important.
---
I used to abuse this feature. People probably hated me XD
---
Yes wotf does suck.  But in most fight you can easily get off more than one.  And in small fights/ 1v1s you can really abuse undeads if you think they have wotf up.  Fear&gt;instantly go into casting mind control and just hold it as your scream comes off cd.  That and in group fights with your scream even if you get 5 people to use wotf that means they are all open to fears from your locks/other priests/warriors.
---
But yeah choose whatever you are really wanting to play.  
---
I fucking hate that sub, it just reenforces the depression. You people are depressed because your not getting the vital needs every person needs. Such as exercise, sunlight, social interaction, feeling of belonging, self actualization, sexual intimacy, feelings of achievement, safety, etc. 
---
You didn‚Äôt get depressed overnight so it can‚Äôt be fixed overnight, but working in the right direction will do wonders for your mental state. If you wanna just sit and be a miserable fuck and post ‚Äú r/wowthanksimcured‚Äù to everyone pointing at your issues be my guest, you‚Äôre just gonna get worse. 
---
Most have moved to Discord, it's free as well :)

\*hairy tall gnomes
---
You're right - there are many reasons IF is the nuts.
---
The AQ gate opening event begins when any player completes the scarab lord quest chain.  The quest chain only remains active for 10 hours after the first person completes it.  So there is only a short window to do it, and the quest chain requires weeks of grinding and raiding per person.  So everyone gets access to the raids, but only a handful of people can complete the scarab lord quest chain.
---
Yep, this was always my last resort very effective method if I can't fill via pub channels. As long as you're respectful, /who is BiS!
---
To add to this. You start messaging people, be polite.  Once you find people and run a dungeon with them, use that friends list. It's there for a reason.
---
Build up a network with other players, with tanks, DPS, healers. Not the best of the best. Don't only keep the tanks that make no mistakes, the ones that are perfect as can be.
---
Find the ones that don't freak out when there's a fuckup.  Unlike the last several expansions, there will be wipes.  There will be breaks in the longer dungeons for people to smoke, grab snacks, ect.
---
Find the ones that are patient and stay in the group. Those are the best ones while leveling and gearing up at the start of 60.  Those are the ones that won't bail when you wipe for the 4th time and are so close to the boss with your drop.
---
Because it may not sound like much now, oh the tank bailed let's find a new one.
---
In classic that usually means someone hearths back to ironforge, asks in chat for a tank, find a tank, wait for them to walk across the fucking world and then walking through the dungeon.
---
It's much quicker to deal with wipe after wipe after wipe and then nail that fucker to the floor, than losing members.
---
Make friends with those people and build up that friend network.
---
Mmmm gimmie that scarab lord. Black qiraji battle tank is one of my favorite mounts, even compared to BfA. 
---
Ive done that for years, but that got me muted for "spamming" on a Private server. Their rules only mentioned spam in public channels, but appearently asking people if they want to play together in an MMO is spam. 
---
Questgasm
---
Do you guys think darnassus could get all class trainers?  I'm looking to do this aswell but I plan on playing paladin.  
---
I do this exactly whenever I'm leading the group. It requires you to be proactive and takes more work than just spamming chat, but you're also more likely to get responses and from the classes that you want for your group.
---
It has nothing to do with keeping up with druids. Because of gear issues, warriors will still have similar TPS to druids going into AQ anyways. They can go fury for more TPS before that in BWL. And they will because they need to keep up with their DPS, not some other tank.   
---
It has nothing to do with keeping up with bear tanks. It has to do with generating the threat your DPS needs to do damage freely.
---
That's not how raiding works at all. You raid Heroic until Mythic releases and then you do the real raid. You can run Heroic after that if you want to, but you don't have to. You have zero reason to run anything under that if you're capable of running Mythic, and you have zero reason to run anything under Heroic if you're capable of running Heroic. If you were running every difficulty you burned yourself out. 
---
Oh shut up with your self-righteous bullshit. Atleast if you‚Äôre going to troll, do it right.
---
What do you expect, coming to the sub of the Classic WoW, full of warcraft veterans and newcomers alike, and telling them shit like this. Get lost
---
Still undecided about rogue or mage. Do you guys think there will be more mages or more rogues? Which will be harder to gear? I will be leveling with a priest as duo so which class would have more synergy? Are there any guilds that give thunderfury to rogue if it drops? And can geared rogue solo farm anything good other than pickpocket runs?
---
Also thinking ahead, is rogue or mage better in 2v2 in tbc if classic ever goes there?
---
Full set hunter T2 is very strong
---
Darnassus was always a ghost town in my experience. I can't see many people naturally congregating there.
---
They just don't have their glasses on to see the post.
---
I got asked if i could tank DM on my Warlock one time. I mean, i guess i could've. But also, maybe not, lol. 
---
Nah you can‚Äôt stun 99% of raid bosses so it‚Äôll dmg but will say immune 
---
The elementium bars are incredible. 100 arcanite bars. So another \~2500gol ontop of the bindings dropping.
---
Yep! Was pointed out below that my memory was incorrect ;)
---
No it's not. Every serious PvPer can tell you stories from both retail vanilla and pserver vanilla of people who achieved rank 14, that weren't particularly good at the game, but just grinded it out. They are obviously exceptions to the rule but I feel like it has to be called out regardless.
---
Hi, if you are interested you can  join our discord [https://discord.gg/92V5CCD](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) Guild name is Glamorama. We already have a good mix of Vanilla-veterans, retail-wowers with some pservers xp and curious newbies. Most of us are 30+, kids and jobs are pretty much are expected. We will raid twice a week, tues+thurs 20-23 CET. We strongly believe we can do relevent contant with that raid-schedule, ie not going for hardcore server firsts but clear raids before the next tier comes out. We have some rules regarding specs and classes but we dont consider us hardcore min/maxers, more like professional casuals if that makes sense
---
the best is a tricky term here.
---
For instance wrath's 8 was completely broken on patchwork until it was nerfed/fixed
---
netherwinds' 8 is a nice proc but in the end it only is a solo proc
---
in terms of raid dps the vote has to go for dragonstalker's 8. the more full sets are in the raid, the more insane they snowball
---
Its beautiful C':
---
Same here, region, server type, faction, class, gaming schedule and such, would be great!
---
That statue is how players will feel after being reminded of classic grinding 
---
I'll level with you. What's your plan for launch? Have you picked a class and race and are you playing pvp server?
---
As of the time of this post, 82% of the responses are between 21 and 35. Those people were born between 1984 and 1998. The youngest were 20 when the game launched in 2004, so either a few years out of high school or in the middle of college. The youngest were 10 when Wrath launched, which historically was the peak and the start of the longest sustained high population period in the game's history. I'm not sure how many of the youngest played vanilla when they were between six and nine years old, but it seems possible that some did.
---
Yeah SL Warlock is really tanky and Destro Warlock is super bursty. Mage is both an engage and escape artist and has more CC to their disposal.
---
If you will consider your name in regards to the /who list, you really should call yourself Cares.
---
It was a tragic joke we hade going in especially vanilla.
---
/who cares
---
0 players found.
---
Fits as a priest name, too.
---
I guess when your right mouse button doesn't work.
---
faather?!
---
Hell yeah, I‚Äôm going horde, troll hunter for my power leveling and gold grind, then warrior/priest for my main. Pvp is a must
---
Oh damn ya. I felt like there was something about coordination that played a factor in it. Without markers or voice chat, it was easier to just wait for the Tank to pull it's primary target, and sheep/cc whatever he didn't hit. 
---
which giants in northrend
---
I wonder why Orgrimmar was the horde hub. I guess it was just that much better than TB and UC because Org was furthest from pretty much everything. UC was closest to blackrock mountain and even that was like a 15 min flight or something lol.
---
Omg my life as a priest.
---
Every 30-45 minutes "WANNA HEAL X"
---
Chill bro =)
---
It‚Äôs not a design flaw, it‚Äôs an intentional design element. Miyazaki has explicitly stated that the reason that the games are difficult is to provide players with the joy of overcoming that which initially seemed impossible through self improvement. That all goes away if you can flip a switch to make the game worse rather than make yourself better. Oh, and anyone can learn, it just takes different people different amounts of time. If these people spent as much time playing games as whining about them, they could learn too.
---
Good one! You could (next time at work if bored) make it abit easier to read, and ofcourse fill in more stuff. :)
---
I'm more confused that people DIDN'T do this tbh? That's how I got all my groups 
---
Mage will give you more versatility with your leveling buddy. Can more aggressively AoE farm as a mage+healer combo. Gearing either will be pretty easy and both will be played a lot as two of the 3 most popular DPS classes imo (Hunter being the 3rd). 
---
Some guilds might give TF to a rogue is the rogue is high-ranking and it's their third-ish binding set to drop, is my guess.
---
Mage and priest probably have more synergy tbh, but here's the thing: play what you want. I am on a pserver right now and I really think everybody's fears of being redundant or out of demand are really overblown based on what I observe on said pserver. There will always be a need for mages and rogues. Yes it's true that some guilds might fill up on them, but for every guild that does, there's another guild that desperately needs them.  Just do what you want.
---
For moneymaking for rogues, you can always go herbalism, which is usually decent cash. Rogues excel at herbing in high level zones where there are dangerous mobs and other players.
---
F
---
Holyblight.
---
That was painful and upsetting to watch.... Is this who they are making games for now?...
---
What headphones are those? They look like Steelseries Siberia, but that would mean this picture was actually around 2009?
---
If it's not your GF or your jobless roommate I wouldn't consider duo leveling. It's great until one of you two goes to sleep while the other wants to continue playing 
---
Ironforge is the true Capital , Stormwind is Garbage 
---
Horde 4 Life 
---
Yes, you will absolutely be able to join a raiding guild. 12-25 hours /played in a week is more than enough play time to join casual raiding guilds.
---
Happy to hear that ! The more people ignore those hardcore "principles", the better.
---
thats pretty much how I formed groups, need healer and dps for deadmines run? /who in westfall and whisper people around that level.
---
This is one of the social aspects I kinda forgot about even though probably 75% of the groups I put together using it and it was always fun getting whispers every now and then asking to run something
---
Thanks for the invitation. I didn't mention but definately going with a rogue as my all time main 
---
This place is a tomb
---
No thanks, I'm sticking to Orgrimmar
---
Also, he's not going to break the news during some random interview. I feel for the guys that do these interviews and understand it's their job...but NO you are not going to break this story. It will be an official announcement. 
---
As a note, I also think people talking about uber-long dungeon queues ignore the value of making/adding friends.
---
If you play as a mage or warlock who shows up, gives the healer arcane int/soulstone and an int elixir and a couple mana potions, gives the tank food/healthstone and a health potion, reliably CC's stuff, does the little "Frost nova someone aggro'd to you and let them stand there angrily" trick as well, you'll probably make the tank/healer willing to add you on their friends list and vise versa for when it's time to find another group in the future.
---
My time on Pservers was largely spent trying to make friends with tanks, healers, or just really reliable/knowhow dps. Next thing you know, that priest healer sends you a PM asking you to help him farm demonic runes in Felwood and you've gotten a friend for lyfe.
---
Sweden. 
---
The guys do it every day. But as soon as you're a girl and you tell people you play video games you loose friends. My sister has a boyfriend, and she once told him she had played world of warcraft before (she played with me). He threatened her with a breakup if she kept playing because, "it's not a thing girls should do, you should focus on the relationship we have.". He literally told her that. So she doesn't play video games anymore. 
---
To that i say fuck that. I don't date people anymore. I've become completely isolated with my video games, with no close friends. I'd rather have no friends than friends who are going to abandon you as soon as they find out you have a hobby "not fit for girls". So much for Sweden being the face of equality in the world. It's all a fake facade.
---
the scarab lord title wasn't added in vanilla
---
Good idea, but this annoys me when leveling healers.  
---
I don't do all the dungeons and doing dungeons a second time is often a waste of time.  "BUT BUT BUT dungeons were fun and getting to 60 isn't a race in classic."  Sitting there wiping for 3 hours to get a half a bar of XP isn't fun for me.  I'd rather be out int he world leveling up, questing with others, and making significant progress.  
---
I only do dungeons where I can get a bunch of quests done.  RFC is a great dungeon with 5 quests that takes an hour.  WC is a horrible dungeon with 5 quests that takes literally 3 hours to do.  SFK is a great dungeon.  BFD I only do on priests.  RFK and RFD are shite.  SM is ah-ma-zing for Hordies.  Uldaman might be the only long a$$ dungeon that I enjoy.  ZF is great.  Mara is total trash tier.  Sunken Temple is long, but pretty necessary.  Then we have BRD which is awesome of course, but that's when you're really getting into the longer dungeons grind at the end of leveling.
---
I skip a lot of dungeons on the way up though.  They're ok to break up leveling, but dealing with a group can be a headache
---
Yellow for sure. I dunno who these people are taking other colors but, shit you need to work harder. If vacation I want your life.
---
 I still remember killing this guy he first time for a key
---
&gt; And then you could go on to "Priest 19-22" 
---
As a priest, I hated this. All the way up to 60. And the higher level I got, I realized that if they didn't have a few healers on their friends list at that stage, then it was a waste of time to group with them.
---
Tbf lots of times the whispers are going to people in the instance‚Äôs zone so the list isn‚Äôt that big until people start digging the search into org/if. Even then the level range sorts things out pretty good until there are a million 60s
---
&gt;(especially druids)
---
haaaaaah
---
I expect miserable fucks like yourself. These stupid depression posts always make it too the top
---
Interrupts were definitely in Vanilla, but they became kind of pointless in WotLK because that's what started the AOE fest. They were useful in Cata when it first launched, not interrupting an ability on a heroic meant your PUG group wiped, but that stuff was too complex so it was nerfed.
---
I have tried Mythics, in BFA I did a couple of M0s on a Disc Priest, it was my first time ever doing them and I made it through 3 or 4 without wiping and had no desire to keep going, nor do I have a desire to keep cranking up the difficulty slider with every upgrade I get.
---
Lore. 
---
People seem to really like their lore
---
People want to be special. 
---
Eye of Naxx in Stratholme too. 
---
They are sick in pvp with good gear. You pretty much just run at people with your big stick knowing that if shit hits the fan you can simply bubbleheart.
---
Oh look its this thread again.
---
Upon hearing the news, I like you, thought there would be an opportunity to fix the many sins that vanilla had. The issue is, where do you stop making tweaks? Where is the line? 
---
The line is history, raw source code and technical limitations / opportunities. It's the only fair way to do it at this time and who knows, Blizzard may choose to run more servers that are classic+ or move into the expansions, who knows..but for right now, the fans on Vanilla and the efforts of the  Nostalrius team demands a faithful recreation and not a classic+.  
---
Speaking a retribution paladin, (deal with it) I too crave re-balancing but not at the cost of allowing changes to the vanilla experience. When do you stop making changes?
---
Yes, exactly. I‚Äôve all but stopped playing Western games because they all feel samey and bland with tons of microtransactions, no complex mechanics, and stupid shoehorned political messages. The sense of agency is largely gone because of the amount of handholding and scripted BS. Screw it, I‚Äôll just play Japanese games until Classic launches.
---
Oh, and Sekiro is a masterpiece. Thank C‚Äôthun the Japanese don‚Äôt give two shits about the Western gaming media.
---
I played Horde from 2004 - 2009. I have leveled alliance to lvl 20 or so and I will never make another Ally again. Trolls with small tusks look just fine. I'll see you in barrens chat friend.
---
Mages and Rogues are sort of equal in many ways. You just mostly have to decide if you want to be ranged or melee.
---
PvP.  Love starting shit in random places and seeing how many people will get drawn into the battle.
---
well its made on planetcoasters , its a game where you can build your own park with rollercasters and stuff. you can make your own shows , with fireworks and stuff. So I decided I would make a show with this cinematic.
---
Took me some time to place every firework/special effect and to sync it with sounds
---
Get off your phone. It reads just fine.
---
OP  Awesome job man! This is going in my bookmarks for sure!
---
Interview Ion reads like a meme
---
I think a lot of it might be that Ret Paladin has a very striking class fantasy. People want to be that plate armpr wearing person smiting people down with righteous fury and radiant energy. This is a concept of paladin which has been around in high fantasy and pen &amp; paper for a long time. And there's no real way to get at it aside from a ret paladin.
---
Compare it with your other examples. The shadow priest class fantasy is in a lot of ways something which you can approximate with a warlock. As for boomkins, I think there just isn't the same appeal for this class fantasy of hitting people with the power of nature (and if there is, it might be somewhat filled in by elemental shaman?)
---
No need to spec holy until you heal at 60.
---
Dungeons without quests are bad exp.
---
Every person I've seen say this has never tried tanking as a paladin OR was terrible at it. I hit a hard wall around 40 but I watched a video and noticed they were keeping aggro while maintaining mana. Once I applied the same method, I began speed running dungeons. 
---
Thanks! I was just trying to put a bunch of stuff together for easy access when classic launches, it started with things I was going to do on my alliance rogue, but I added other proffs for when I do alts and whatnot, and it's just been snowballing.
---
I estimated at the time between Rank 11-13 I had about 5-6 pay periods.  12-13 was 3 pay periods alone.
---
If the Forsaken didn't need the Horde, they'd have already destroyed it. They're not allies, they're refugees.
---
I won't spend too much time defending a human. Us elves have seen what mistakes they can make. However, they have the best for Azeroth in mind, and while they are foolish and short sighted, they have been on the front lines defending this planet every time.
---
If a coveted title for low effort is the reason you want to play classic, dont play classic.
---
whoooosh
---
As a tank, you never ever have to wait more than a few minutes to make any dungeon. And it's actually really annoying to be spammed. It's like "hey do you want to come waste your time and help a bunch of randos?" But you get this message every 5 minutes.
---
I know some of you will probably get defensive hearing that you are actually being annoying. Even if you only do each dungeon 1 time, and whisper me once, I still get like 10 whispers throughout my day. I often on pservers get more whispers to come tank for people than I do from gold sellers. And to me that's a problem...
---
I got a message from someone who did a /who warlock 60 during vanilla. He wanted me to do UBRS. I joined the guild, then later invited a few of my friends to the guild.
---
I'm in a discord server with many of the people I met in that guild today.
---
I always found them fun because of the rng factor. If you got lucky with your procs they were extremely fun to play. 
---
What the fuck is your problem, actually?
---
1) nowhere did I mention I was miserable, I‚Äôm just saying people are so hyped for the game they used to play back when they stopped sucking their thumbs (and now they might have kids of their own)
---
2) ‚Äúthese stupid depression post are ruining my perfect day oh no‚Äù. You‚Äôre a pathetic attempt at a troll, honestly. Make a better post regarding the situation you‚Äôre in related to this game.
---
3) it‚Äôs a nice meme really; this is how internet culture evolved. Depressed or not, I‚Äôm not sure people would give a fuck about Mr Goody Two Shoes‚Äô advice regarding mental disease
---
Well that and I suppose we‚Äôve probably lost a lot of our brothers to the game of irl. Many 30 year olds on their 2nd or 3rd kid and getting crushed by bills right now.
---
That is the JOY of sitting down with a spreadsheet.

"Oh bollocks"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say minutes buts it‚Äôs not as bad as J ‚Äúyou think you do but you don‚Äôt‚Äù Brack made it seem.
---
Yeah I just made a comment, as a tank I get 5-10 whispers a day. And I only play like 3-4 hours. It's frustratingly annoying that I get more "come tank" spam than I do gold selling spam....
---
It reads fine, yes. However making the headline fonts bold etc. would make it more appealing to the eyes. I was just giving tips on stuff to improve if he (or she) finds himself bored another time at work.
---
Get off your attitude.
---
Farming grave moss in duskwood is very lucrative at low levels. If you have herbalism there are also grave moss spawns in southern barrens where you kill pig people for the weapons.
---
We're clearly coming at it from different angles seeing as I was thinking scholo and strat and you were thinking level 40. Yes, they are very capable in SM and maybe even BRD. 
---
Yes. There is also a good chance that all the servers will be listed during this time, but you will not be able to connect to them until the official launch date.
---
Is that how real life works too
---
You have to understand why you could not find a tank for Scholomance. It's not that the server is bleeding dry on tanks, but because there is little to no value for tanks to run Scholo. 
---
We have little/no tanking gear in there and it can be an absolutely nightmare to tank due to the nature of the trash pulls. I tanked it nearly 100 times to get the flask recipe as a completionist and I can tell you the horror stories of wiping even on perfect pulls. Personally, I love scholo and enjoyed the scenery every time but a perfect no wipe run is not easy to accomplish and takes a lot of work and dps that can listen.
---
Some just cant, like me, i work irregular hours. 
---
I'm thoroughly confused by all these people saying Ironforge is closer to Blackrock Mountain than Stormwind is. They're pretty similar in their distance, but clearly Stormwind is closer. Maybe it's a flightpath issue that makes Ironforge 'closer'?
---
Yeah Gravemoss is rare to find, but demand skyrockets once naxx comes out.
---
The same as what?
---
Leveling with just grinding dungeons is not a good method. Questing is more worth than doing dungeons without a quest, but if you find yourself in shortage of quests and need to grind mobs for a level, doing a run or two of some dungeon might be more appealing to you than mindlessly grinding mobs if thats not your thing.
---
Nothing has the sex appeal of a boomkin though. 
---
Yep, I did it last weekend on my freshly made Kul Tiran warrior.  Two MC runs to try and finish the warrior T1 transmog, got bindings from Geddon in week 1 and Garr in week 2 :)
---
I kinda felt obligated to go through with it after that, even though I have completed Thunderfury before on my pally back in Cata/MoP.
---
No shortcuts there either, I levelled mining to 300 and ground out the arcane crystals myself.  Couple of BWL alt runs for the ingots.  If you know anyone who wants a couple of thousand Thorium Ore..... :p
---
Probably not the best to find someone to try and make a time commitment pact - however joining a leveling guild shouldn't be too difficult to find. 
---
No, it's bad XP. Maybe worth it to do once if them if you can quickly get a group together and do lots of dungeon quests in one go. 
---
Generally if you're rushing to 60, don't bother with dungeons. 
---
Also you don't need to spec holy while leveling to heal 'em.
---
I dont get it
---
This is getting out of hand.
---
This probably has the most in-game benefit. All that gear would make you unstoppable in the early weeks of release. 
---
Leveling up LW is a huge investment, and it's definitely not worth it just to get a BoE cloak. Most of the ingredients don't require leatherworking at all (Essences, larval acid, etc.) and you can farm them up while you're leveling to 60, then have a dedicated LW craft it.
---
Theres a lfg thread every monday 
---
Okay, I ran WC on a 20 Warrior on Pserver last night. I had a full bar of rested XP, and gained just short of a full level in 1h15m. I completed 4 quests, which got me 7-8 bars through the next level (almost half). If you aren‚Äôt rested, and have no quests, 1/2 level an hour 15minutes with a good group. Not great, but not bad. 
---
I‚Äôve been considering running dungeons while leveling to get pre-raid BiS. Things you can do at Power level like Mara and ST (for Black stone ring and the tank rings from drakes in ST). It‚Äôll probably be a lot more fun than constant questing, but I‚Äôm not sure I can deal with the slow down when I‚Äôm nearly 60. 
---
Literally the first thing as you opened this sub

---
No, I mean levelling and doing dungeons as prot. There is always a need for tanks and healers and I was capable of both. I did all dungeons while leveling and tanked all to do quests/get loot. Once I got seal/judgment of light, I AoE leveled instead of quested for the most part. 
---
The Un'goro effect.
---
Hah that's great. I bet you weren't the only one. Just brings back memories of being totally new to the whole MMO thing. 
---
O man remember farming all the mats for this as a holy paladin lol
---
‚ÄúYou brush up against Keonare and fart loudly.‚Äù
---
I feel like the whole group needs to really know what they're doing to pull that off though. 
---
Excellent tip, one which I used in pservers.
---
Also, whenever you find a competent tank/healer/dps, befriend them and ask them over time to tank/heal etc
---
By the time I hit 60, I had a dozen people I knew were reliable in dungeons.
---
The same week I got my bindings for my first thunderfury I also obtained the eye of sulfuras. I spent many many many hours doing laps around winterspring mining thorium. Ended up with so much thorium I controlled the market for weeks afterwards.
---
&gt; Classic wow isn‚Äôt going to fix this
---
Deep down I think I realize this, especially based on the fact that I've had other "I just need ____ and I'll be happy" moments fall through *hard* on me in the past few months...but it still doesn't change the reality that most everything else other than Classic WOW feels like a fuckin' slog. Getting outside and interacting socially *especially* feel like a slog I want nothing to do with.         
---
        
---
Maybe Classic will be different though... ;)
---
The fact that you think only priests can heal and warriors can tank bothers me. 
---
&gt;...in pservers with all that asshole mentality
---
This is what worries me about classic.  These jaded pserver players.  The community before was far from perfect, but it wasnt hard to find nice people, now there are players saying things like "I want to group with people who know what they're doing"  instead of being willing to help someone who is unaware of a mechanic by explaining it.
---
I suppose the good thing is that those players will fly to the endgame, so it wont be a common occurrence for me to run into them while leveling.
---
If you're an affliction lock (and use only corruption, coa and drain life to dps), a shadow priest or arcane mage, you can do ok against bosses 4 levels higher.  A boss only 3 levels higher is considerably better but still your dps will be gimped somewhat due to (possibly) missing higher level versions of spells, fewer talent points and the extra 15 resistance the boss will have vs your level.  Healers if they're geared and specced can be much lower than any mobs in the instance and do very well, tanks if they're specced and geared can do ok if they're 3-4 levels below the final boss but dps at more than 2 levels lower than the final boss are going to slow things down and cause mana issues for everyone.
---
I didnt start until Wrath, but i still primarily used IF when i had to go back to a home city.
---
Lack of flying made it especially easy to navigate compared to SW, and that annoying fucking portal room in SW (walk forward, down the windy steps, outside, mount, fall off a spiral walkway, run this way and that to get through the wall, across the canal, then back to through the wall, etc....vs 'walk forward, mount, turn right, run') always pissed me off.
---
A lot of people still used IF at that time, really.  I was on a lower to medium pop server and IF always had people in it.
---
One of the things im looking forward to with Classic is seeing it be a big hub again.  I actually tend to like open spaces more in game, but theres just something so cozy and comfortable about IF.
---
‚ÄúThrow yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity‚Äù. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you got downvoted for asking a question. Ouch. 
---
Farting on people? :P
---
Yeah that's exactly what I mean, I'm talking about doing level 60 5mans quickly so we're on different pages.
---
Yeah in my free time I'm playing through a pserver dualboxing pally rogue and it's tons of fun, just trying to think of what else I could possibly need, in terms of my spreadsheets.
---
Soon^^TM
---
Yeah, it's BoE, no good reason to level leatherworking. Tailoring gives you a BiS BoP robe.
---
As for enchanting you can just send the gear you craft to a level 5 alt to disenchant.
---
That's a fair criticism, I honestly wasn't thinking of sharing this, but thought I'd ask for feedback.
---
I would do this furiously in vanilla. It helped a lot. I always managed to formulate a group or get a fill-in. ctrl c + ctrl v is also your friend :).
---
As a mage I had no problem with sheep pulling. At times it is very useful. Hell, there has been times where I have ice block pulled. 
---
Yeah I remember this working fine.
---
The sneakest of the fel bois
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
Its better to hear 'soon' than 'when we fucking have it done', and frankly it gives some people hope.  Its a pretty obvious word to use.
---
Mainly the aspect of being able to bail people out of an otherwise failed endeavors. Bubbles for myself and others, blessings to help both big help in Pvp and benefits in some pve. Lay on hands and Divine Intervention brought me great joy.
---
I really like what You've done though. Keeping it in my bookmarks for Classic. :)
---
Early Cata dungeons were great. The Stonecore bosses recked noobs. 
---
Fair enough, hah. I‚Äôll just need to find a LW then.
---
Yeah it's the same in classic, not worth it at all. The only time it's worth doing dungeons (if your goal is time efficiency) is to do them when you have all the dungeon quests for the specific instance.
---
Also, you should never level up as healer specced. You can easily heal instances as dps specced no matter the healing class.
---
&gt;I suppose the good thing is that those players will fly to the endgame, so it wont be a common occurrence for me to run into them while leveling. 
---
I think the same. I'm not too worried tbh, even when talking about endgame. It's only a matter of who you make friends with / what kind of guild you join. There will always be casual and more tolerant people to play with. You just have to look for them.
---
Not at all. True a paladin can do tremendous AoE pulls, there the party need to know what's up. Not for a normal 5-man though. 
---
Yea, both pieces are best in slot though, that‚Äôs my point. Priests level Tailoring for the robe, but don‚Äôt level LW for the cloak. It being BoE is clearly the reason though.
---
Typically time the sheep or w/e with the tank pull, you dont really need to cc in vanilla that much though.
---
What the fuck is your issue?
---
1.You came in here angry as fuck ‚Äúoh shit up with your self-righteous bullshit‚Äù. It‚Äôs very clear from your post history you are a bitter individual. Not sure why my first comment struck you so deep, but it‚Äôs an issue you may want to get checked out.
---
2. These depression posts and meme culture go hand and hand because sitting on your computer making memes and shit is a recipe for depression. This website is a epidemic.
---
3. You‚Äôre seriously mad at me for suggesting this community needs to get more sunlight and take care of their lives better in order to help fight depression? Big fuck you.
---
I like grinding dungeons at a slow pace vs questing etc.
---
As a healer id just sit outside an appropriate instance and hit up lfg chat.
---
But thats just me, i had no timetable, no desire for endgame raiding, etc.  I ways had a few hours to kill, but never at the same time of day.
---
Theres a lot of us that werent able to start playing until later due to finances, school, not having a good enough PC, finally not having parents dictating how we spend our time (not complaining about that, just stating that once we were on our own we could ruin our lives however we wanted to).
---
Im 29 and didnt start playing until just shy of 10 years ago in early to mid Wrath.  Im really looking forward to seeing the game in its earlier stages, tbh.
---
Wrath still had a fair amount of the community, specs still meant something, professions were a bit of a grind, etc...but it'll be fun to see it in its 'full force' so to speak.
---
Yeah exactly, you just farm the mats and buy a little leather. You need to buy a lot of leather to max tailoring anyways. 
---
We had two rp weddings on our server in SW cathedral that were heavily attended and got pvp bombed.  good times.
---
Maybe! Classic can provide some good friendships into the future, but it‚Äôs not a good long term solution. Going outside for a run or a walk is a great way to break up any day. No one said you gotta stay out there all day lol 
---
Being a contractor who doesn't get the P in PTO, I'll take that one please. Hell I'll take that without Classic. But yeah, I'll be quite envious of you folks that get to take PTO to play. What's worse is my wife is a teacher so she'll be WAY ahead of me by the time September rolls around.
---
There are some for sure in Blasted Lands, but you'll need to find some boars between 30-50.
---
I agree, if I see an article on something from one news site, usually it‚Äôs biased to one side of the political spectrum, so I always check what the other side of the spectrum says and then I‚Äôll usually check reddit as well. Try and see the news from all perspectives and then make my judgements on it
---
A little early, if you ask around classic‚Äôs release you‚Äôll probably find more people interested. Though wouldn‚Äôt it kind of slow you down to level with someone in a group?
---
this one.
---
Most people don't care, I  pay to change one point sometimes. 
---
 Did you skip past the fact that I've done all dungeons? It seems like no matter what I say to you, you're going to dismiss anything that doesn't fit your agenda.
---
don't work that well on lvl 60
---
My attitude is fine.
---
Your criticism just came across .. sort of.. assholish. It's just the internet and delivery sadly.
---
Lets call it truths. Cause I dont think ill of you.
---
Well fuck me then
---
I‚Äôd like to apologise if I hurt you in any way but I‚Äôm not really sure whether you‚Äôre trolling, hate the WoW community, or simply can‚Äôt use the correct words.
---
Also how did you come to the conclusiom that I am a bitter fuck just from my post history? I don‚Äôt really like to use mean words unless it‚Äôs situations like these.
---
Your comment really struck me deep because 1) just woke up from a 6h nap and 2) it kinda resonates
---
Cya
---
You ain‚Äôt gonna touch em in classic either tho 
---
That would be my speculation, but I am not going to pretend to understand women. It could be some crazy girl reason I don't understand.
---
Loved it then, love it now. Still funny and it has a great soundtrack.
---
Just wish the boot was on the other foot, bloody Alliance scum. Lol!
---
Like...5-6 hours?
---
Doesn't this cloak recipe drop from Dire Maul so it wont be in until Phase 2?
---
Conversely, is running low-level dungeons once you're 60 a good method of making some cash?
---
For example I recall that most blue items  level 25-35 from Gnomeregan and SM vendor for 50s to 1 full gold coin. As a level 60 it should be fairly easy and fast to run those solo. Just not sure how much net gold it would give you compared to just grinding a particular commodity item.
---
Exactly.
---
My guild stopped using Discord after maybe three dozen raid wipes were caused by their shitty servers crashing or lagging mid-raid. Now we self-host a Mumble server on a $3/month VPS and it's more stable than Discord ever was.
---

---
They actually did something in classic. It was a basic LFG tool.
---
Honest question, are people just fuckin around when they post stuff like this or are they just making jokes about their depression?  I just always see posts that have a /meirl feel talking about how they don‚Äôt have a will to live and it‚Äôs kinda weird seeing it as a joke. 
---
You linked to the results after writing "Vote here", indicated by thr /r
---
I swear.. this is sorcery! In all my vanilla life I never used this method... I claim it to be illegal!
---
Both
---
I'd actually advice...... chunking. Take two fridays off in a row (or two thursdays and make your work from home a break from the game), that way you've got 4 days off in a row. That, or break it up, take off two wednesdays in a row that way you can play a bunch semi consistently. If you lump everything together then you're returning to work for a longer period of time, too.
---
Alternatively, take off the tuesday and thursday after launch, that way the first week is pretty flexible. Remember, this is an MMO, you're going to be playing regularly. It isn't about playing 24/7 (because you wouldn't do that for longer than a few days anyway).
---
Think of your time off like a single can of coke. You can chug it, sure, but then you run out faster and that is no fun. Savor that shit, at least a little.
---
You'll never make a monkey, no you'll never make a monkey out of me!

I haven't decided what to pick for a solo leveller. I was going to pick warlock for all the convenient tools you get, but Dire Maul being in batch 2 is a little bit of a turn-off for me because the "free" mount did sound really nice to me. Potential other classes would be shaman, of which I don't really know anything other than having a feeling it's going to be a fun class, and mage, which seems kind of boring to me but is very good.
---
Fatherdead (like Father Ted)?
---
Raiding requires a lot of time investment not just for the raid itself but for raid prep like farming materials for potions, etc. Perhaps you can go on the raids after your guild has the raids on farm and can carry you through but I doubt many guilds will have room on their bench for people who can only invest 4-5 hours a week.
---
Yikes
---
Won‚Äôt stop fucking narcissistic YouTubers and twitch streamers from making hour long videos about it though. 
---
WoW, freaky stuff going on here. Truth and mystery are so often stranger than fiction. Thanks for sharing this!
---
If IF doesn't lag my computer to the point that it crashes then I'm refunding my game.
---
What was he, close to the edge? Finally, Shamans join the ranks of hunters and warlocks, and know their pain.
---
It's class fantasy bro. If you live in the west. You live in a civilization submerged in christian belief and iconography. While wow paladins aren't "christian" obviously. They do still fit the popular motif in our society. Of a loan righteous man standing against evil with little more then faith and a prayer. You would be surprised how many people gravitate to that. Especially for people from down trodden communities where faith and brave men is all you got.
---
36, dog
---
I played retail during the free weekend and I really like the new spells/skills and combat.  What I don't like is things dying in 2 seconds and no resource management (free mana).  Game was just too easy and didn't keep my attention for more than a couple hours.  I'd love to see classic make way for a second chance for future expansions.
---
The storm giants, in howling fjord, there are others but these came to mind.
---
IF-&gt;Thorium Point and walking north to south in Searing Gorge is a much quicker route than SW-&gt;Morgan's Vigil and walking northwest across Burning Steppes.

\*accepts summon\*
---
Your attitude seems fine. Same as my comment, yours looked sort of assholish aswell. It's internet. With english not my main language, it's sometimes hard delivering critisism without sounding like a dick.  
---
We're cool! :)
---
PvE and PvP are very different beasts. PvE you know *exactly* what‚Äôs going to happen and it‚Äôs a pretty basic game of call &amp; response. 
---
PvP is about constantly adapting on the fly to new circumstances. You have to make plans, scrap them, make new plans, and then execute in seconds. ‚ÄúRotations‚Äù are different and are more about burst windows and CC chains than max extended damage over a boss fight or dungeon. 
---
Due to the speed of the game mode, decision making and reaction time are **much** more important than they are in PvE. Some of that is physical - simply speaking it will take you longer to press 8 than it will for me to press the 8 button on my MMO mouse. The difference gets even bigger for combos - if you had to press 8, 2, 7 compared to someone with better keybinds or a mouse. Some of it is mental though - god knows how much I panic during PvP and therefore get my ass whooped since **panic dump abilities** isn‚Äôt actually good burst. 
---
owned
---
Yeah, you wish.
---
LOL and that's what I call epic!!!
---
Yep. Your friend make a new character you want to invite but you wanna secretly invite him and have an idea of a name he might go with? /who elwynn, or any starter zone works.
---
I just like Paladins
---
Awesome!! 
---
Yea. I know I can come off as an asshole sometimes too. hehe
---
That's what horde get for running my pure alliance dungeons.
---
Redridge should work, just like elwynn for elwynn forest works.
---
Oh, I have no idea.
---
Plus IF has the tram to SW.
---
Ironically if you spec prot pally, it is RIDICULOUS to get aggro at lower levels. You have no aoe, only 1 skill that does any damage instantly, most of your abilities work off of auto-attacks........ i mean it's just terrible. In exchange for being slightly harder to kill you can't do anything. I've tanked deadmines as a paladin before, its not even about the difficulty....... it just functionally doesn't make sense.
---
Damn, that looks so close to what i want, but the wrong region :(
---
The whole "non-healing support class" role is something that vanilla WoW doesn't do very well unfortunately. I like those classes in other MMOs too, but WoW doesn't really have it.
---
So you may want to just go with your 2nd role choice: tank. Which would be Warrior.
---
Otherwise, you have to suck it up and play a main healer, but maybe one who takes a bit more of a support role like Paladin or Shaman. Maybe you could even become one of the totem twisting Shamans whose main priority is keeping buffs up on a melee group with healing on a lower priority.
---
Or you could take a risk on Shadow Priest. I just don't want to make a suggestion that sets you up for a situation where you can't find a place to fit into. Trying to convince a guild to be their sole Shadow Priest can be difficult. And that's even if a guild wants a Shadow Priest. A lot of people are starting to claim that they're not worth it and you're better off just filling the slot with an extra warrior.
---
:)  
---
/u/Nenharm \- Nice update on the outlines and font, hehe! :) Another tip if you want to make it even more easily used, link those items to a database. Either way it's very useful and I thank you for that. Good job! :)
---
Unless you're playing a meme spec, raiding in later raids (AQ, Naxx), or are a tank, you don't really need to farm consumes to perform decently.

Yes, paladin is the best class for this since the pvp and pve spec is pretty much identical
---
Close to Menethil as well so you can get to Kalimdor.
---
&gt;Lol why am I getting downvoted?
---
People are generally petty. I'm probably willing to overlook the self-aggrandizing claim of "smartass with a quick wit", but due to these attributes being subjective and less than quantifiable, I feel like most people don't like people assigning these values to *themselves*. If a person wrote "is hot and great in bed" on their Tinder as reasons you should hook up with them, they'd /eyeroll themselves to death. People believe everyone is 100% biased toward themselves, so there are sorts of recommendations that really only carry weight when spoken *of* another person *by* another person, even though it's *also* understood that part of any positional interview is that "You have to learn how to sell yourself!" Where is the fine line?
---
As much as I analyzed this, however, "ganking lowbies and world PvP" was really the only con I saw in a list of pros on top of the great idea that "pre-game matchmaking" is something I'm interested in. The reason I say that about ganking/world PvP is because getting caught up in a fuckin' war isn't conducive to speed-leveling to 60 on our server-first mains. Every time I die, potential food/potion/class/etc. buffs go down the drain, so I'm looking to do *defensive* PvP **only** until I have my first 60.
---
there was another spot underneath a small staircase going from the Military Ward to the Great Forge
---
Awesome to hear
---
What point are you switching?
---
&gt;SW is not equally close to the BRM content, in vanilla when flying from SW to thorium point the connected flight path is IF so you have to fly from SW-past thorium point to IF- then back down to thorium point.
---
I fly to the Burning Steppes directly from SW
---
I'd say it's not bad during the fresh launch hype assuming you got friends to spam dungs with. Maybe it's even better on some lvls considering 1-30 zones will be hell to lvl if you're not ahead of the pack.
---
Haha thats a project to do, but i was planning to. I think my next project is class skills with level and cost
---
My favorite has always been LFM instead of LFG, since 1 asks for a group the people reading your message it arnt in, and the later asks everyone reading if they want to join. The difference is amazing.
---
The Troll Priest trainer in Org was actually named Zayus. Definitely not a coincidence
---
Because they couldn't tank initially. Later on they could, but lot people were already done with Strat and Scholo, plus it was already ingrained into peoples mind that bears can't tank.
---
Hence the different situation now, where you will gear up for raiding with 1.12 talents, thus with beartanks. I've seen this on pservers.
---
I'm not joking.
---
I don't remember for Holy, rarely got asked to go heals again. it was repentance. 
---
Haha Thunder Bluff would be a hoot. 
---
They had a cast time at least. 
---
This was the reason I started to love healer. I loved the idea of being needed for a dungeon and being in high demand, so satisfying
---
At some point, he managed to remove shadowbolt off of his bar there, too. 
---
Yeah the same was pretty much true in vanilla, without quests unless you really want a specific piece of gear dungeons are worth the time.
---
Dying pathetically is part of the classic experience.  Accidentally ass pull too many mobs, or a runner gets away from you and chain aggros the whole camp... Get suddenly ambushed by the Alliance outrider elites, or my personal favorite when suddenly a Devilsaur jumps you in Un'goro crater...
---
Just go the usual 11 into holy for consecrate and then the rest into ret. If you're not a complete retard it's easy as fuck to tank 5-mans.
---
Terrific.
---
You shouldn't AOE. You should focus target. You take less damage, can hold aggro more easily and conserve healer's mana.
---
You always have rage as bear tank before pull due to Furor. You shouldn't stay in bear form constantly, whenever you are out of rage and not getting hit (mob is stunned or attacking somebody else) you should change back and forth. 
---
If you have a longer window for changing, spend a GCD on putting up barkskin, or if playing with 0/30/21, instant cast regrowth on you or somebody else.
---
The sense of immediately review-able progression when you have a clump to turn in just makes the hours soooo worth it and makes it soooo much more enticing to continue grinding.
---
Nothing like the feeling of logging off after an evening session and taking a moment to relish in your character being a couple levels higher maybe with some new gear and resting in a new zones inn. Simply awesome 
---
Yes it is. \^\^
---
I don't think I ever once saw a duel outside Stormwind in vanilla.
---
Outside IF was the training grounds though
---
Paladins are almost like a hero class, before hero classes existed. Like a warrior who's so awesome that he was able to multi-class and be a priest too.
---
USURPER! GNOMEREGAN IS MINE!
---
&gt;now a days you cant pug wailing caverns on a private server without everyone being like OK GUYS LETS GET IN DISCORD
---
I've never had PUGs for dungeons ask for discord, but yeah you are correct, you don't need it and people are asking it more often. Which is not a bad thing because i like talking instead of typing. But you don't need it, thats for sure. 5mans aren't that difficult or different than retail.

Thunder Bluff isn‚Äôt big enough and too many people would accidentally fall of the cliff 
---
Sounds great! I would love a spreadsheet with classes, level reqs, skills, costs and priority/importance (like green/yellow/red). If you make that, please release it! 
---
Yeah as you said they did nothing 
---
It does.
---
There is no honor in that. lok'tar ogar

youll still get your free mount as a lock the epic quest chain for the mount can cost 600-800g and thd regular epic if you have the discounts only costs around 800 
---
This is too accurate LoL

Gank. You mean Gank. 
---
"...and are the stats compeletely Random..."
---
Well, that depends on who you as-
---
Wait...what's the question?
---
Depends on what kind of druid you are. As a healer you often grabbed some cloth and some leather. Druid's class quest from 1.10 for example gave you a really strong healing leather chest piece. But you used whatever you could. 
---
Only bonus i would say is tier 2 (or tier 2.5) 3piece gives you mana regen, that is pretty strong.
---
As bear tank or cat dps you never used cloth.
---
Nice troll.
---
Maybe be a good way to weed out the weak
---
Yes this is how vanilla worked
---
People tell me sheeping only works in psever for countering adds. And even then, you can precast it and only release when tank pulled.
---
Yup, we used Detect lesser Magic and Hunter's mark :)
---
Hi, /u/N00bTaco
---
For the horde!
---
I have a set of +arcane dmg plate greens in my locks bank
---
That would make a great shaman tank item. Spirit to regen mana. Those totems are expensive. 
---
If you ever want to know what being a hero feels like just kill one of these fuckers.
---
This is what I play the game to do
---
I much prefer the layout of TB to Org and the Undercity. But Undercity is. Closer to all the raids so that's where I'll be hanging out.
---
True victory is stun-locking your enemies into taking durability damage from a mob.

Uh, yes there is, you even get message on your screens that shows exactly how much honor you got from it!

Thinking like Dwight Schrute, love it!

In early vanilla there was no interface option to disable your helm/cloak. This is probably why he's not wearing those.

If they give honor they give honor.

Do you know what ‚ÄúFor example‚Äù means? 
---
we're starting on 1.12.1 base arent we? or is it only 1.12 talents? i forget
---
Thank you!  I really only became aware of the /who function when playing on pservers in the last few years, but I'd still not known about the class and level filters!  Very handy :)
---
Soon^TM
---
I think your story is my favorite anecdote here.
---
That's a good pvp item actually...
---
Or it would be a hoof. 
---
Well yeah, that list was a complete joke, maybe I should of put a /s for people to realize it. But I thought comparing it to tinder would of gotten the point across.
---
&gt; I don't see a particularly good reason why flying is locked behind more than playing through the story, such as 100 arbitrary world quests or the boatload of missions you have to complete with the stupid table. It's already time-gated plain hard by the game, even if you earn all the achievements you can't fly until a patch flips the switch.
---
That's where the "flying is bad" crowd comes in. Don't know if you've played MoP but it allowed for flying only when you've capped and bought it. You could also buy a tome for your alts but I am not sure if it got released in a later patch or was there from the beginning. The people who did not want flying no matter what did mostly did not accept any real approach like the TBC/Wrath or even the MoP version.
---
In the end it's the community itself that caused this bullshit. I personally couldn't care less if further expansions have flying or not. I remember the MMO-C threads, hundreds of pages long and it was always a back and forth of pros vs. cons with no agreements whatsoever.
---
Ironically, as we've seen with Legion flying was not the problem - at least as big as one as the "no flying" crowd made it out to be. It's ironic because the very same world quests, the modern form of dailies, were the reason why you could still see people in the world even post pathfinder and outside of the no flying zone of Argus. Heck, I don't like PvP - especially world pvp as it usually just boggles down to ganking and camping -  but even with flying enabled later on in Legion I still saw some skirmishes in the outside world in world quest areas. The last time I saw something like that were the x.2 patches of MoP(isle of thunder) and Cata(Molten Front).
---
The problems world quests have that people will lose interest in them as soon as the carrot falls off. The carrot being AP or the pathfinder achievement. The same applied to dailies centered around faction quest hubs. As soon as you reached exalted or got enough of their currencies you just stopped.
---
It's good to know one can actually have decent discussions here without people going on the downvote trend. Looking at a certain subreddit ^^^^wowservers
---
I read that thread, but I haven't seen any dev confirmation that the legion API will be used. 
---
I remember the corrupted blood, and wished I had been on that server.  I also remember hunters and mages learning how to kite dragons across zones and into cities, wherein folks would FLY IN to actually partake in the merriment of killing a boss in their city.  Remember when it was fun to kill each of the opposing faction's leaders?  Yeah, me too.  And I was there, all day / all night when AQ opened, PVP'ing, PVE'ing, and PVP'ing some more.  Those times can NEVER be repeated -- but DAILIES can and are.
---
You need some pretty good gear for holy shock to do work for you in pvp as a burst damage tool. If you are fine with being purely healing and support and relying on your team to do all of the damage, then it's great and you don't need to respec.
---
But some variation of 25/26/0 is also pretty effective. Trades 5% spell crit (which hurts long-term mana efficiency) and holy shock for blessing of sanctuary and reckoning. Reckoning totally changes the offensive playstyle in pvp, and sanctuary is good for 5-man tanking and for buffing the tank in raids.
---
These arguments are generally with regards to single player games. I dont know why somebody would argue against making a game more accessible. WoW classic arguably had an easy mode as well with all the world buff they implemented in the game. Additionally you guys think its a coincidence that one of the first adds in UBRS (that instance thats right between two 40 man raids MC and BRD) provides a massive FR buff when mind controlled? In the coming early days of MC i guarantee all of your GMs (perhaps even you) will question whether or not your raid needs the FR buff to down Rag....In other words....they will be asking themselves, "should we continue on hard mode without the buff? or should we turn on easy mode and grab the buff"
---
I guess I'm in the minority who thought this was rude. I leveled a healer (then a tank) in Vanilla and every time someone whispered me to run a dungeon (Which happened fairly frequently) I thought to myself "Yea I saw your spam in the public channel and I didn't want to join your group then, why would I want to join it now?
---
All DPS'es in seconds
---
Healer in minnutes
---
Tank in hours
---
Haha, yeah that's me. That's a very old damage meter from my 1st guild, Drama. Where is that from?  
---
And why is Vehn, the MT, crushing every1 else? Maybe it's early on in the fight so he was dps'ing alone for a min to get aggro? Execute spam on Vael maybe? Roster looks pre-BWL though.
---
My dream of a boomer free guild is dead
---
**&lt;CREW&gt; - EU ‚Äì Horde - PvP Server ‚Äì Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English**
---
**Introduction**
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. We are at this point in time 20 people. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere. The guild is built around a core of friends with varying experience with WoW and vanilla.
---
**Goals**
---
* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace. 
---
* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months). 
---
* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server. 
---
* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
We are also recruiting socials if raiding is not your cup of tea! 
---
**Core values**
---
* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
* Common sense and patience. 
---
* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.  
---
**Raid Schedule** (*Preliminary*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message or join our discord: https://discord.gg/NUP8W9M
---
Red = dead.
---
Just go 31 20 and dont be a lil bitch
---
So you could effectively heal and 5man tank with that hybrid?
---
he said that
---
Zeppelins to EK and you don't risk dying when you try to get in the city unlike the other two.
---
Undercity is a big circle, not too hard to navigate.
---
And 2/3's of your pre-bis is leather or mail
---
I'm sure WoW Classic will just be WoW in their eyes. It'll be a "server option" you select. But you pay for (the one and only) WoW and you play (the one and only) WoW.
---
k
---
Un'goro is one of my favorite zones because of this. Pick up all the quests, do one lap around the zone and turn them all in. Best feeling!
---
I disagree with almost everyone in the comments. The real reason that so many people stayed at ironforge was because it was the only place with an auction house at first, and people just stayed there because they had gotten used to it, that and it's geographic location 
---
I personally don't kill people in that scenario, but sometimes I like to poke them a bit with a rank 1 debuff/DoT, or just go melee them if I'm a Priest.
---
This.
---
You don‚Äôt roll on a PvP server to have fair fights, that‚Äôs what BGs are for.
---
Heh I cannot see any such conversation, which makes me think I‚Äôve ignored that person. Goes to show
---
the flight is the same time difference but the flight is easier to get on and afk(dont have to worry about missing the tram or getting sent back the other way because of not getting off in time from afking) the flight is only like a few silver anyways
---
We all already know Kotaku is garbage
---
&gt; arguably the most rare epic BOE in Vanilla
---
Mostly because it only drops from [a handful of mobs](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1728). BoE epics already have super low drop chances, so having it only drop from a few mobs only further increases its rarity.
---
You wait until the mob they‚Äôve killed is dead, then you let them heal up. Then you hand them a pistol, tell them to walk ten paces, then shoot them. Like a fucking gentleman üßê
---
my turn to post this next week 
---
Indeed, is the only way to negate Poe's Law.
---
Only one person per server/faction if I recall correctly
---
That's more than enough for a competent semi-casual guild that will clear all content. Just find one that matches you're schedule and make sure you're clear on expectations from their leadership
---
Whatever the fuck man. This is WoW.
---
Gonna be pissy because people wanna gank in STV?
---
Now I am going to spend an extra 24 hours specifically ganking in STV.
---
What server are you playing on?
---
We don't know if there will be only 8 or 16 debuffs upon launch, do we? I have to imagine they just go with 16... but that stuff was all because of technological limitations, not necessarily the intended design of the game. So know one really knows.
---
Far as raiding, you'd prob need to have permission to be the one Afflic Lock even if their are 16 debuffs, and if debuff limits aren't a thing, well then it's prob the wild west again.
---
In the overall though, the highest Warlock DPS is still DM/Ruin Shadowbolt spam with Curse of Shadow and Shadow Weaving from a Shadow Priest applied, not Affliction.
---
I love a good pun!

---
Famous last words.
---
Affliction style gameplay is not, Affliction spec is.
---
Shadow Mastery &amp; Ruin spec is very common as most of the time you'll just put up a reduction curse and Shadow Bolt all day.
---
In Vanilla every class benefits from every stat except intellect, classes without mana don't get anything meaningful from intel and non melee classes don't use sttength. Agility provides dodge % to all classes, Spirit gives hp and mana restore to all classes, and Stamina is obvious

---
/w guy Hey wanna do WC?
---
Affliction is not really viable as a "dot" playstyle. as affliction, you do your assigned curse then corruption and spam shadowbolt and wait for nightfall proccs. \*  
---
Sure it might work in pvp if you are on Alliance side but thats about it.  
---
As Warlock you spam shadowbolt in all speccs.
---
&gt; But Undercity is. Closer to all the raids so that's where I'll be hanging out.
---
May I introduce you to your new best friend, the Hearthstone?
---
Get a free port to Kargath/Cenarion Hold/LHC whenever you need to raid!
---
I also love TB more than Org, especially the outdoors AH, but I still want to duel people and leech world buffs, so only my bank alts will hang out in TB.
---
Fairly sure they have said they will go with 16 on release? Not 100% sure though.
---
What do you mean Undercity is impossible to navigate in? It is very well structured.
---
Nothing beats TB though.
---
Who needs hearthstones when you have ancestral recall?!
---
They did, 16 on release.
---
tbh, ele has way too big of mana issues in vanilla to dps in raids
---
you can always heal though and your totems are, of course, useful  
---
race only really matters for min/maxers
---
Originally it was Jesus, then after Blizzcon 2013 ("You think you do...") it was changed to Judas.
---
I think he's banking on Classic's long-term success as President, so he's now "Jackpot Allen Brack"
---
Anyone who played vanilla knows about this!! Strange how many people here don‚Äôt!
---
But it will never be the same again. I'd be very surprised if any game can give me the same feeling that I had back when I first played WoW. And I have tried many different MMORPGS since then and they all kinda feel the same.
---
yeah and he had the warrior stance in his quickbar  :D
---
Just get up to shadow mastery and pick the talents you want. In raiding you will be probably using a lot of shadow bolts and curse of shadow / elements and maybe corruption for nightfall. The fights don‚Äôt really last long enough for curse of agony and immolate. SM ruin is a strong build with the extra crit and shadow burn and you will still have most of your affliction talents you would probably want for whenever.
---
Yellow &gt;= Blue &gt; Rank 14 &gt; Scarab Lord
---
well I just spent the past 3 hours playing this.  Good work.
---
[https://imgur.com/9k2Khi3](https://imgur.com/9k2Khi3)
---
Yes, this is a proper hybrid. You will oom 5% faster than full holy raid healers though.
---
From what I've heard, holy shield is non-essential.
---
Holy Reckoning is a legitimate pvp spec. Choosing 3/3 improved righteous fury takes away from that but imo it is worth it if you want to tank. There are other flexible talent points too.
---
To clarify, I was horde from vanilla to BFA. In vanilla I just kept my hearth in Org despite raiding MC/BWL up to 4 times a week. When I flew to BRM, it wasn't so bad because I always ate my dinner right before our raids started so I would grab my plate and eat a bit while I flew and the raid was forming. I tried the kargath hearth but hated it because I used it less than the amount of times I wish I couldve hearthed to Org.
---
I was just making a joke because none of the horde capitals are conveniently close to much :P
---
And keep a "Good Bad and Meh" list.
---
I end up with 30 or 40 people on a list that are generally up for dungeons and really good at their roles
---
If you like healing then no
---
Right now I run 31/20 with 5 piece judgement. I pocket heal for people tho so like I get killed pretty easily if I‚Äôm alone 
---
Sorry this may be a dumb question, but how do you precast sheep and release it? Never played a mage and don't remember being able to precast spells
---
Afflcition isn't a dot spec, it's a "put Corruption on everything you can to fish for instant Shadow Bolt procs" spec. It's slightly worse than the regular Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin raiding spec for singletarget and slightly better for cleave fights (which are very rare).
---
You aren't using curses for dps because your raid will want Curse of Elements/Shadows/Recklessness on the boss. You'll be allowed to use Curse of Agony/Doom if you're the 4th warlock *and* if there's debuff slots. It can work on some fights like Onyxia when she is airborne, but won't be really useful outside of that.
---
Siphon Life is terrible for raiding and takes up a debuff slot, you'd want to use that for farming and PVP, ditto for Immolate.
---
I was planning on having an Undead Priest and a Tauren Shaman. Not sure if having more than two hurts leveling, but easier groups for quests I guess.
---
LUL at the number of RPers in this thread.
---
The real answer is PvP servers will be most popular, followed by PvE, and then WAY DOWN THERE (less than 10%) will be RP
---
Wowwww lol I just over sighted that line
---
rend buff and zeps. plus every 60 has hearth in kargath anyway.
---
I mean, look on the bright side, the shitty PC quality and 600x800 resolution makes this seem even more like an authentic Vanilla WoW experience üëçüèº
---
My old raid leader would literally tell mages to unbind frost nova during onyxia 
---
The biggest reason that Ironforge was the main hub was that each faction only had 1 auction house until patch 1.9, and for the alliance that was in IF.
---
Why does this offend you so much 
---
You mad bro?
---
Best to consult a few different sites, look for the common threads between them all, and try your best to piece it all together. Ha! Is this seriously what journalism has come to? Where I, the reader, still have to do some of the investigative work?
---
Serious -- what are some good, unbiased, reputable sources you know of?
---
Seen the video, its good. I personally never atack someone who is half hp/fighting a mob cause honestly i know he thinks that im just a little bitch after, and honestly so do I. I feel like peope who usually do stuff like that are too afraid to fight someone their own level cause they know they are bad and would loose. I dont kill peope that are low cause i geel ashamed after and its just now worth it. That being said, you can rarely see me pass up on an honorable 1v1 (by honorable i mean we are both similar hp/mana %, preferablly full, and cca. max 2 lvl difference). I would even interfere with a 1v1 a see in the world cause i just asume its alliance scum pulling a cheap move on unexpecting horde comrade.
---
You?
---
&gt; Won‚Äôt stop fucking narcissistic YouTubers and twitch streamers from making hour long videos about it though.
---
point on the doll where the classic streamer touched you
---
because he thinks they're making a lot of money making videos about classic and that makes his pee-pee shrivel up
---
I was joking, but kargath isn't a great hearth imo. Org was the best for me.
---
Hide of the Wild pattern is from DMN, Dire Maul won‚Äôt be in from the start. Checkout this link..

Exactly. Just like I said in my reply to other gent in this reply thread -- as ridiculous as it is that I, the reader, has to do this -- I will usually read a few different sources (even the ones that are as shamelessly partisan as they come; ehem, CNN), look for the common threads between them all, and then try and discern what the truth of the matter is.
---
If the mob has 60% health and they are at 20% I hamstring them up and watch them die to the mob.

I came across it all very randomly haha. I was looking at a list over players who were "holders" of the scepter of the shifting sands. Searched some of the names listed, Velariance of the guild "Drama" from the realm Shattered Hand, happened to be one of them. Found this "blog"  after I googled his/her name [http://www.masterofwarcraft.net/2016/07/beta-and-early-vanilla-nostalgia-bomb.html](http://www.masterofwarcraft.net/2016/07/beta-and-early-vanilla-nostalgia-bomb.html) &amp; from there on you know the rest :)
---
Back in the day, warlocks were rare in both factions and one the least played class  (mainly because there were quite bad before their rework). Now I don‚Äôt have numbers but just a feeling that it was worse for alliance not only because of PvP but also because it didn‚Äôt feel very ‚Äòallianceish‚Äô for many.
---
I don't know, why don't you ask the people who post it?

During vanilla and tbc not once did stormwind have more popularity. Lvl 60s wanted the most convenient hub to late game content and stormwind had a pain in the ass layout for trainers of professions and class skills. Also ironforge had the shortest path between the auction house, bank and repair station. A big issue with stormwind was also that it was a pain to get flying because you got dismounted in the area the flight path was at which wasted even more time.
---
As a Rogue, this. Heh. 
---
did you forget discord also has a paid option so again, going off of your own warped logic, they don't need to farm your ass either?
---
I‚Äôm glad üòÑ
---
So if that's the case and they are sticking with it as a design choice, the answer is probably no on Affliction Lock for raiding, but again, maybe ONE gets to be the Nightfall Lock.
---
I'm glad we could come together on this issue. 
---
Yeah but how is spirit gonna help a hunter? And how much does spirit even help a warlock? Locks don‚Äôt get mana reg during spell casting lol
---
Lol tank shammy
---
It's just a matter of timing. If you start casting just before the tank is about to pull, you can get the spell to go off *just* after the mobs get aggrod
---
Oh, man. That's lame.
---
Yeah. It's also pretty clear that they only kept it in this expansion because it was free "content" they didn't want to throw away from previous expansions. 
---
kargath is the only hearth for all people raiding until aq. not having kargath hearth is like showing up without dm buffs and a reason for the bench/-dkp for repeat offenders.
---
Triggered.
---
To add on to the anti-SW comments, there was a memory leak outside the SW bank in the trade district for a long time where you would lag out or d/c. This is one more reason the dwarf bank was superior, and IF better in general. 
---
IDK if that's how it is now but definitely wasn't the case for a typical player in WoD. If you were struggling to down a boss in Heroic it made more sense to go and do the raid on normal for slight upgrades, because not everyone was in full Heroic Raid gear. Even LFR gear was a pretty big upgrade over Heroic dungeons at the time.
---
What do the 20 go in?
---
Add every single tank you ever group with to your friends list. When you want to do your dungeon, form it yourself (this is faster 95% of the time). Get your tank first then set up the rest of the group. Some folks will ask if you have a tank before they join and if you can spam your LFG msg with having a tank, the group will fill faster.
---
What a day in the life of a warrior.
---
On netherwing a few days ago I got a whisper asking if I wanted to heal gnomer, if I had a little more int gear I would have but that was a nice surprise, hope that's common in classic 
---
No worries, happens to everyone. I didn‚Äôt start playing until TBC so I genuinely thought I could be missing something
---
in pservers people duel in sw so they can get the ony/nef buff easily.... but in classic it will change
---
&gt;not having kargath hearth is like showing up without dm buffs and a reason for the bench/-dkp for repeat offenders
---
I don't know about that.. I raided MC/BWL up to 4 nights a week starting out and was just fine with an Org hearth. I gave myself time to arrive and was usually one of the first to Kargath at the time for raid formation.
---
Shadow bolt 24/7 is soul crushing.
---
I really hope they don't do that.  Release the server list first so guilds can figure out which one they're going to use. Let folks like me who haven't played in 10 years download the server and get a subscription going.  Put in some vacation requests at work...
---
CC should always come after the pull so that the aggro goes to the tank.
---
Ideally the tank pulls and the CC's land a second later
---
I generally never spam chat, instead sending whispers to all members of a specific class in a specific level range. Rude you say? You're playing a MMORPG, not a single player game. You should expect people to talk to you and invite/ask you to come play with them. We're all online in WoW to play with each other. 
---
Did you MS paint that entire thing?
---
Guys i cant decide which class to play, for pvp atleast, my options are : Hunter , Shaman , Rogue
---
What would be my job as any of this classes in organized BGs?
---
I remember people always dueled at that ice lake by Kharanos. Good memories :)
---
To conclude: **/who c-warrior z-westfall 17-20**, and BAM, victory?
---
I‚Äôm a bit of a weird case. I learned to read rather late, but once I did learn (after being given my first dragon ball manga) I read everything. Got to the point that I had read every manga and every Star Wars book there was (expanded universe pre Disney) in my own language. Being young and dumb, I ordered more online and they arrived in English, a language I couldn‚Äôt speak. Then I started playing wow, and with a mix of that and dictionary reading this Star Wars book, I knew English before I ever had it in school. Honestly I knew it better than my teacher when I started having it (he was some youngster stand-in who wasn‚Äôt very qualified to be fair, but still).

Blatant sensationalist falsehoods, such as video games causing addiction or violent behaviour is easily remembered by the ignorant. Today I study psychology and one of the things I find most interesting in the field is the cognitive benefits of competitive video games that are now steadily being researched (Starcraft 2 and other games have shown to be spectacular for this sort of brain practice).
---
Good try.
---
&gt; soul crushing

Isn't that what warlocks do though?

79% is pretty good for a new topic on this subreddit.

Wow, /u/doc_zaius himself shows up!!

Alternate thread title:

How to cold-call the shit out of people.
---
Fortunately, everything done by the Retail LFM feature can also be implemented as an addon - so we'll be able to form groups without annoying people with cold-calls, or spamming /1.
---

---
You'd make a great pet.
---
Eh.... that largely depends on your teammates as well. Playing vanilla reminded me how much less control tanks have than they do in retail (and have for a long while now).
---
Paladins were completely overhauled for a reason. They suuuuuck at tanking in retail (largely lacking the tools needed). No avengers shield..... no divine storm, consecrate requires you to spec into healing for 11 levels, no hammer of the righteous...... literally all of the abilities that make up the modern paladin tanking kit don't even exist in vanilla.
---
BUT THAT ROGUE WHO KEEPS BURST DPSING RANDOM MOBS TO STEAL AGGRO IS THE SAME THEN AS HE IS NOW.
---
The beauty of Warlocks is that they have multiple DoTs and don't need to cast spells constantly to do damage, since you can't drink in combat high spirit will helo them if they oom and don't have the hp to trade for mana, and Hunters have mana and hp do they not?
---
I fixed it but I cant edit it lol
---
Honestly I can only imagine. Esp if you need nothing from that run. But tanks should expect this as part of the class when they roll a tank. Because it's vanilla, I almost feel like this should be in the class description on the side of the screen during character creation. "Will be spam invited to dungeons". Try not to get annoyed and just simply accept it as part of the game for a tank. 
---
HAHa
---
As each other. I thought Org and UC just had 2 zepplins each in Vanilla, one to the other and one to Grim Gol. 
---
MC trash farming.
---
Org also has a TB zepplin out front.
---
idk i loved it in tbc. was so fun to see those insane crits with increasing gear.
---
That just got me so excited lol
---
&gt;We may be used to doing raids, grinding money, watching video's and reading guides, but the average player doesn't have the time nor will to do all of that just to 'play a game'. And as a result, you see Blizzard trying to accommodate for that by finding ways to allow all players access to all content, even if there are 'hard modes' for those who really want to 'be someone' in the game. 
---
I always wonder how much the player base shapes the game and how much the game shapes the player base. How does the game determine the current populations' behavior and proclivities? Does it drive out certain types of people and welcome other people in? In both cases, it's very difficult to know what the right call was. 
---
My personal belief is that there are ~40,000,000 people who have played the game and a huge chunk of those people are not satisfied by this casualization. We were kind of driven out. 
---
lol you are over stating spirit it takes a lot of spirit to equal to even 1 mana per 5. The idea is the stats could be allocated more efficiently 
---
You're right about everything, Only doing the dungeon once is the best way to go. However, try not to be annoyed by people asking you to play with them. Try to see it in a positive way, you're wanted after all and being wanted feels good! Politely decline and wish them good luck.
---
I agree WTF.  Talking to folks aint rude haha.
---
Le bait
---
well nowadays raids meet in org for ony buff and then hearth to kargath to start raiding.
---
Lol it‚Äôs not about the money for me. 
---
baffling
---
This post has the words I couldn't find.
---
If your group is good enough that 5% might not make a difference so the tradeoff isn't that bad tbh
---
lok'tar ogar
---
"or the restoration of the technology" bringing back old server structure ? Not crashing a sharding server when there are more then 30 people in one place would be nice.
---
its fun and honorless at the same time.
---
I thought they added that one in Wrath, no?
---
Guys just to confirm, the command is:
---
**/who  c-"warrior" z-"westfall" 17-20** 
---
Is this correct?  Thanks.
---
Absolutely. The Paladin and Shaman are exactly like a "leader" class.
---
Wait if there‚Äôs anything wrong with the link I‚Äôll definitely delete it but im currently on the site? ü§î

Be very polite and respectful when whispering people out of the blue. A lot get upset when being asked to join a group (they forget they are playing an online game where people group up and play together). Most mature people will at least politely decline if you're respectful/polite in your invite message.
---
Yea too close to the edge. Someone looked over and noted there was a little totem below, and no mobs nearby. We continued on. A couple pulls later and we were faced with half the dungeon baddies. 
---
Mine was the one with the shirtless, glaive wielding Night Elf. And here are ready to live that fantasy in 8.2. 
---
I think that‚Äôs the best idea I‚Äôve gotten! I was thinking that it sure would be unfortunate to pay a whole bunch of gold and have nothing drop for you lol
---
I'm kind of interested in what the original says lol
---
It's funny. I have been playing on project 1999 server for the last 8 years. There is no LFG tool, dungeon finder or anything else. You actually have to communicate and talk to people if you want to do group content.
---
Seems like people just want to play a single player game with no interaction with players when they are forced to do group conent.
---
Wait if there‚Äôs anything wrong the site I‚Äôll definitely delete the link but I‚Äôm currently browsing it without any issue? 
---
Just doing our part to rid the Azeroth of gnomes ... I mean lepers. 
---
Ele shaman strong and fun !! :D  Lightning bolt and purge op
---
where is it... Where Is It.... WHERE IS IT!?!?! 
---
I guess you're referring to private servers? Wouldn't know about that, only know what we did in vanilla, and then everyone met in kargath or outside BRM.
---
Am i the only one that liked the smell of the box and the sound it made when you opened it?
---
Hi, /u/Searika
---
that does not replace taunt. if you lose aggro you also lose the 2nd place on the aggro table aswell.
---
I just need my fix until summer
---
The problem is that these raid "meme specs" are generally quite fun in solo, small group play, pvp, etc. So people rather than acknowledge how shit they are in raids keep trying to argue that they are viable in raids so that they can avoid respelling constantly in order to not be a drain on the raid.
---
obviously, thats where the vanilla community was for the last decade.
---
The stats actually make sense if you understand Vanilla
---
Honestly UC has one of the most efficient layouts of any of the cities. It's small and compact, with the only real pain being the long entrance with the elevators if you are walking. I don't know why people say it's hard to navigate.
---
TB is so spaced out for everything, it's a huge pain IMO and doesn't have zepplins making it unusable as a main city. Don't get me wrong, I love the aesthetics and will be using it plenty since I'm going hunter.
---
I don't understand the part about the Hunters. If you're on alliance, the only people using Mail at level 60 are hunters, right? Tell me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't hunters have one of the easiest times getting geared in 60 raids? There is no one to compete with from the armor standpoint, and you are the only one with a real need for bows/guns. The only thing I would think would present a high degree of competition would be for melee weapons and rings/trinkets, and even then, melee weapons aren't primarily utilized by hunters anyway.
---
The gates open weeks later if you just wait for the servers to do it automatically. That's why guilds put the effort in to get them opened up as soon as possible
---
No it's really not better at all. The dueling area in IF is tiny and congested. It's objectively worse in every way compared to outside of SW.
---
but discord sucks imo. ts3 all the way for me.
---
I‚Äôve also been thinking about how to find a duo partner the past few days myself, I‚Äôll PM you. 
---
Anyone interested please feel free to pm me, plan warrior- Us east
---
There's your problem: you're playing BFA, a game that is objectively trash.
---
Jesus. That might be the worst fps player I've ever seen. I don't think journalists need to be the most amazing players, but they need to have a certain level of competency to understand the product. I wouldn't expect someone who can barely drive to understand and give a good review of some high performance sports car, so why would I expect someone who can barely control a game to give a decent review of it?
---
I hear you. I used to work in education, and summers off I definitely miss. Good luck to you! 
---
its true. but the fortnite younglings are all over the place, thats why every ts3 comment gets downvoted.
---
PvP happened.
---
Thats what my guild felt too. Made me lose interest and stop playing because it was now impossible to find dungeon groups. 
---
This is too true. You just dick punched me in the feels
---
Nah
---
spirit was mana per 5 seconds (mp5)-- Hunters used mana as a resource for a long time, so spirit = mana regen to keep fighting.
---
I remember them doing an entire episode dedicated to Classic and it mentioning how to get the Westfall Chicken, Linken‚Äôs Quest, and highlighted a gnome that had a tiger mount and how to do faction city rep grinds.
---
I would run a virus scan if I were you. That site was blocked as it tried to inject something.

In raiding the only damage debuff you can really use is corruption if your SM/R spec. No CoA ever pretty much because you can only do one curse per target and this will usually be CoE or CoS.
---
In AoE situations I would try and dot up any many targets as you can with Corruption while running up to group them. Then just Hellfire and Sappers once the group is close up.
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of experience with this and wow is visually boring unless you know the game already. The only way I have ever gotten new people into wow is to force them to sit down and play it or buy it for them.
---
To the people who roll on PvP servers and get upset about being ganked.... what else do you expect? You cant have the cake and eat it too.
---
I'd it happens to me, yeah it's annoying, but I get over it. If they're body camping ke, I just get up and do something for like 10 minutes. 9 times out of ten they get hired waiting for you and leave.
---
It depends on the economy of your server and if you can corner a market.
---
Side note: engineering is great for pve as well.
---
I mean that is true, I'm just trying to see it from the views of the game designers circa 2002ish to 2007
---
https://youtu.be/2Sb94BZtz3A
---
Get hyped!
---
I would say herb will make more money later on, due to people having more disposable gold to buy pots for raiding. 
---
Whilst everyone is levelling mining will make more as people will be levelling engineering and wanting to craft blacksmith items earlier on. 
---
yeah but in classic the world buffs wont apply to everyone in the city like on private servers. and only 1 can only be turned in every few hours
---
I've already cleared yellow with my boss, red and green are hand-outs and anti-fun imo, but blue would be nice, although I would appreciate more of a heads up.
---
Too much work. I just want to chill and game. I'll go through life depressed and die one die having attained rank 14 and know I'm still better than most you fuckers
---
Exactly. I joined a group through the classic forums and we have about 70 people part of a discord server. It's really easy to setup channels related to each class and pinning important posts or guides makes finding information pretty easy.
---
You realize that likely all of people you‚Äôre talking about are getting less than minimum wage for the work they put it right? You don‚Äôt have to watch them üò∂
---
&gt; **Classic**  
---
&gt;There is nothing new to share on Classic and it's still releasing in the summer.
---
[MMO-Champ](https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8424-Patch-8-2-Dev-Interview-Quartermaster-s-Bounty-and-Warlord-s-Trophy-Updates)
---
Probably closes we will get.
---
I agree, it‚Äôs comforting to hear him at least confirm a summer release again. 
---
After continuously reading the comments from rogues who plan on unfairly ganking everything in sight, I plan on not starting any fights unless they're a rogue. 
---
To bring order to the universe, I will kill every rogue on sight, simply because they can't be trusted. I hope all of the other classes can unite with me in this common goal.
---
Thunderbluff is also hard to nagivate but also really beautiful so if you want sunshine and fresh air so to speak, it's a nice place to hang out.
---
That being said, I vote Undercity because it's cooler and has better places to congregate.
---
Hahahahahhhahahahahhahaahahahahah. First of all, you smell through my screen, take a shower. Secondly : nobody knows the server lists yet. 
---
Already on it! Honestly had no clue there were issues with the site, I'll put an edit in my original post.
---
You've really saved a SS for every occasion, if only I had been smart enough to do that...
---
OnT: looked like an epic battle between the legendary wielders though
---
One step ahead of ya, watched it like 15min ago on your channel lmao
---
cheers
---
i actually prefer any other tank over a warrior that doesnt really know what he does in low lvl dungeons. threat is just beyond bad if they dont play propperly.
---
&gt; Spear isn't a weapon type.
---
Okay. Polearms
---
lol on point
---
Yeah this post confuses me.
---
The only two item problems in vanilla was some specs didn't have nearly enough good gear, and for a while paladin plate would drop for horde raids (and as a lesser problem shammy mail for Alliance raids). 
---
Let‚Äôs not get carried away here lol
---
Scarab Lord full stop. It was my main goal before I decided to go for something more realistic like start a successful RP-PVP (or just RP in general) guild and try to set-up server-wide events.
---
Isn't she interested in the story?
---
Of course you know your wife better than anyone else but I'm a woman and the WoW lore being very emotional at times hooks me up more that anything else (sole reason why I still play retail).
---
I suggest you ask her if she's interested in the lore, the best way would be playing Warcraft 3 (WoW is a "follow up" to WC3 story) and/or show her this movie and see if she likes it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIz4lgxlLHw
---
Blackwing lair the movie. 
---
Yeah getting anywhere in SW sucks. IF the bank, inn, AH, FP, and prof trainers/vendors are all a minute or (much) less apart. 
---
If you are main tank in raids you get first dibs most of the time so just git gud at tanking :P
---
Dwarf. Stoneform is amazing. You will primarily use bow, and Xbows. 
---
Herbalism is probably better, between normal herbs for potions, Swifththistle needed by rogues and Stranglekelp for AQ quests, Herbalism is in high demand.
---
I never understood how duo/group leveling works.
---
Because people have different schedules, is not like playar A will log on WoW and then wait 2 hours doing nothing until his duo PlayerB logs in.
---
I always did dungeons and elite quests with my guildies, but the concept of leveling together is something I really never understood.
---
I doubt that‚Äôs all people are going to talk about. If they are then I‚Äôd say ignoring them is plenty. If you don‚Äôt like people talking about a subject then you‚Äôre the bigot. (Look up the definition). And if they‚Äôre trolls then why isn‚Äôt the ignore button enough exactly? You can‚Äôt really censor people like that. Especially not in Vanilla if you ask me.
---
35. I got into WoW when I was 20.
---
Int gives faster wep skill doesn't it? 
---
It‚Äôs just more of a general annoyance that carries over from another fandom where  youtubers can spend ten to twelve minutes discussing, say, a twenty second trailer that shows very little actual gameplay stuff. Or in one case: Three separate ten minute videos discussing a magazine article and maybe a twenty second gameplay trailer.
---
Yeah I dunno, I find it rude too. While we are playing an mmo it doesn't mean we want to play with anyone at that time or even talk. If I want to do a dungeon I'll say in trade, don't just random whisper me because I'm a warrior. That makes you look beyond rude in my eyes. take a step back and picture is from the tanks perspective, then imagine the whispering thing as commonplace. Would you ever even turn chat on anymore? Probably not.
---
As a rogue people always messaging me for runs /s
---
everyone benefits from intellect.  It helps you learn weapons skills faster.
---
Didn't even have to click to know what this was.  At the time I was like eh, that's a little tasteless, but then again they did advertise, and it was held in a contested zone.  It was also pretty tough to keep raids like that one a secret on my OG server (Mannoroth).  Whenever I watch this I think, even if this was a surprise, the guild getting attacked didn't respond all that quickly, either.  Maybe they weren't very good at pvp?  Don't know.
---
Hah, glad you got your fill of nostalgia. 
---
Cheers.  
---
I know this is a month old but I just got back on wow and read this. Im a druid and I was reading how bears are the worst tanks right now. I decided to start leveling as Balance (level 84 rn) would it be better to go feral? I like all the specs so I dont mind either way.
---
I agree with your UC assessment. Always loved UC and never understood why people thought it was hard to navigate. Once you get to know the layout you are golden. 
---
&gt; Yeah but how is spirit gonna help a hunter? And how much does spirit even help a warlock? Locks don‚Äôt get mana reg during spell casting lol
---
Hunters, locks, and Shaman can often get mana regen during combat very easily by auto-attacking or just wanding after dots, and in the case of locks the health regen outside of combat lets them double dip on the benefits of sprit via lifetap. There's even an entire talent dedicated to increasing the benefits from spirit for locks. Dot + wand is insanely efficient and leads to no downtime while also never being low enough on mana to be jumped by a member of the other faction.
---
"Wonder if I can one-shot him."
---
You can use 2 accounts.  
---
So you can play with her as Alliance... and gank her to the bones with the Horde one :D
---
Fun fact, Detect Invisibility lets you see them as they're wandering around. One of the whole two instances I remember being able to actually help the party with buffs on my Warlock.
---
if you remove "the stats" its correct, thats probably the mistake.
---
Hey, I tanked WC on mine!
---
Thank you I had no idea that was even a subreddit haha 
---
That‚Äôs why you find someone with a similar schedules, or have an agreed upon times. Or levels an alt until the other gets on, or decide to go solo half way thru. It also helps to have common ground and enjoy some of the same things, which is why I made the tinder/joke list
---
I‚Äôm not expecting to get to 60 with only one person, but in vanilla, esp at release on pvp servers, safety in numbers.
---
I have all my vanilla wow manuals and the official atlas book still :D
---
From my experience herbalism is typically the better gold maker for pure gathering. However keep in mind that mining can be combined with DME and BRD farming to make more money, and herbalism can (possible idk if blizzlike or not) be used in DME for extra money.
---
No doubt we don't get any news from another project's developer.
---
Most of us want a world chat that isn't filled with politics 24 hours a day 
---
I would prefer to play on a PvP server. However, most of my friends who are planning on playing prefer RP realms, so that's most likely where I will go to play with them.
---
The funny thing about playing on RP servers for years is that all of us had no problem flagging up and drumming up some wPvP. I wonder if I could talk them into a PvP realm if they aren't dead set on RPing.
---
The dude obviously loves WoW, and presumably classic wow given that he's a Scarab Lord, but still have to stop himself from saying anything. I wouldn't be surprised if he lurks here. Had I been in his position I probably would've told people not to tell me anything because I wouldn't be able to not spoil things. 
---
Blue RN for me...
---
Vanilla Flavour is a series of videos for each class. They range between 6 to 12 minutes. Pretty good.
---
yeah now I know it's all about the trolling for you...whatever
---
Haha this is so accurate. He abviously is lvl31 at this point.
---
also annyoing while leveling with potheads, the permanent breaks they need to smoke or roll another one.
---
I wouldn't really get too caught up on the "semi-hardcore," "casual," or whatever labels. Guilds aren't that binary; they operate on a spectrum. Some casual guilds don't raid, some do, and so on.
---
You should hopefully be able to find a guild that suits you. On Nostalrius I joined a fairly hardcore guild that was just below the top guilds on the server, and I had practically zero WoW experience (only played a couple months during TBC).
---
The layout is only hard the first 2-3 times you have to go there and then it's ezpz
---
It is SUPER slow in vanilla. Hell dungeons with quests are often not even worth it, I recommend doing them for your own sanity but if you actually care about speed leveling you don't even do dungeons.
---
I still have the manual some where and I think an atlas but have to do some spring cleaning to find them
---
Mine is laying here next to me!
---
Are tanks or healers harder to find
---
video is from 2016 tho.
---
https://youtu.be/hooKVstzbz0
---
All you need, really. 
---
OwO
---
&gt; Was there some function in the game with a decent UI that allowed you to navigate player names that joined a list for a certain dungeon. 
---
I think in BC, but no one used it in my experience. And that still limits you to people actively looking through the tool. A lot of people are willing but not specifically looking. 
---
I return the favor next time I see people that do this to me. 
---
Trying out a Warrior on pserver the last few days, I am loving it!  Ride or die!!!
---
Seriously though, I think all of the difficulty hype is what scared me away from the class for so long and steered me towards either Druid or Paladin.  Warrior is definitely more strategic and gear based, but it makes for a very fun experience.  I found my class for when Classic hits :)
---
If I need to kill that mob, they dead 
---
Lol thats an oxymoronic statement.
---
Guilds decide their raid roster themselves and don't answer to you. If some guilds want to take along "suboptimal" specs, that's their business. If they don't mind sharing loot with suboptimal specs, that's their business. If they would rather keep a slot empty so that a suboptimal spec isn't competing with optimal specs, that's their business.
---
Why is this such a problem?
---
That‚Äôs a lvl 54 item
---
For a fraction of the price you can buy a helmet on the AH that actually gives you stats you want
---
18 spirit is useless in pvp
---
Secret hope is that we get a BC server as well, somewhere down the line.  I can play vanilla till the cows come home without complaint, but not gonna lie, I love me some space goats and blood elves.  After that, I'm good.  
---
Ideally they'd roll out servers for each xpac and allow you to stop wherever you liked.  Let me dream.
---
yes i just tested it out and works
---
yea IF is strictly superior layout and closer to everything lol
---
i dont get it youre expressing your opinion about the sub on the first paragraph 
---
but the second paragraph is true, constantly working on yourself will certainly help.
---
I dont see why people are getting so anal lol
---
I think it's 1200 or 1400, good enough for a laptop.
---
So sadly true and comical 
---
Me too, and I believe it won‚Äôt be. But if we start moderating chat channels then people will eventually not say anything at all in fear of being silenced or getting a 30 day suspension!
---
just buy some noggenfogger 
---
I'm enjoying feral for leveling. If I had to tank I can. Fairy Fire in feral form is a great ranged pulling ability while staying in feral form. 
---
Balance just runs out of mana for me. Plus I don't have the armor buff from being a cat/bear. 
---
I have agility gear for feral leveling and then I have INT gear for if I have to heal with a group. I never respec, just have more mana for healing via the INT gear. 
---
Kargoz has no inside knowledge.  It may be 2 months past mid july and still be summer.
---
He's talking about Predictions.
---
That's probably based on the easter egg from Blizzcon. Sadly I already had to gamble on it because I needed to submit my summer holidays at work.. we will see if it's a hit or miss lol.
---
I must admit I've not been keeping a particularly close eye on the development precisely because it's so far out from release. I like the look of the halflings and ogres, but I haven't looked into the classes much yet.
---
My primary concern is Brad and his crew at VR will hie too close to EQ in designing it. It seems like the majority of those over at /r/PantheonMMO really just want it to be EverQuest with better graphics. Which is to be expected, of course; just like here, the majority of those who frequent a sub for a game that's not even out yet are generally going to be the more hardcore fans.
---
That said, IMO one of the reasons WoW eclisped EQ so thoroughly as it did was Blizzard did away with a lot of the more punishing mechanics that didn't make the game more difficult so much as tedious. XP and equipment loss being the big ones for me, though of course others may argue that point. Personally, I was a big fan of City of Heroes' "death" penalty of XP debt. Even if you had it max'd out (2 full levels, I think? It's been so long now), you were always making progress toward the next level, and you *never* actually *lost* anything.
---
Aaand now I'm sad about City of Heroes again. Gorram it, me, why do you do this to us?
---
Yes, and +5 intellect can mean a 50% boost if a warrior is sitting at only 10 intellect
---
Ouch, thats rough.  Good luck to you, but I have a work conference july 16-18 so I'm hoping its after that
---
Mid-July is literally the one date we have that has a decent theory behind it, only Blizzard knows though.
---
&gt; outside Ironforge 
---
inside Ironforge, to be specific. Next to the bank, there was an area where for some reason you didn't get rested XP - and you could duel there.
---
&gt; in retail it seems people duel outside Stormwind city 
---
inside Goldshire city to be specific. Though I've been seeing some duels outside Stormwind back then during Cataclysm.
---
Don't spoil it.
---
This bonus is lost upon casting a spell
---
Id suggest asking people on this discord , lmk if the link doesnt work, https://discordapp.com/invite/r9cVrzJ its kargoz's discord community. Kargoz has been theorycrafting duo leveling for a bit now, some of his latest videos are on duo leveling. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxOd0DPfBmSpf70PQe5_MBw
---
Haha ah ok, so it's not a feature that was added later or anything... Got ya
---
If that's what it takes the keep the tusk-less knife ears out, so be it.
---
Yeah none of the major private servers release AQ40 and Naxx at the same time. They tend to follow timelined released schedules just as in Vanilla. 
---
Realistically TB makes the most sense as the main horde capital. It has crafting stations right beside the AH and mailbox. It's also closer to every Kalimdor raid than Org is. 
---
[30/0/21 aka SM/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BfDMfFnAAATjA0wE) is probably the most common
---
But you repeat yourself.
---
[Guide by Orcbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqWfj0cdeFo)
---
Black human horse is bought in menethil harbor
---
yes tank shaman.  Shamans can tank everything up to raiding and really the only reason is that there is no gear for it.  
---
If you can get the gear, shaman tanks are one of the best threat generating tanks in the game.
---
take a look at the enhancement tree.  toughness for armor, anticipation for dodge, parry, and shield specialization.  It looks like enhancement was almost intended to be a tanking tree.  You just need to hit defense soft cap.  
---
downside is that your damage mitigation will never be what a warrior can do.
---
I will note that it takes a dedicated player and it takes a certain level of skill to pull it off, but it is a very fun spec to play.
---
in the end though, they are better tanks than prot paladins.
---
Do you understand that they would actually group you with other players who are looking to get into the same dunegon? It was sort of useless but it did actually do something. It wasn't just a stone sitting there with zero functionality like most people seem to think.
---
Just wait for the hunter needing on the int/spirit staff from deadmine. ;)
---
Hey man, as a fresh 60, that agility and 30+ stam was pretty legit in pvp
---
Show me one that has anywhere near as much stam and agility on it
---
Hmm. Maybe? My memory could be misleading me!
---
The "soon" word appeared in German, not English, so it's not a trademark. That's good.

Never played warlock but according to my warlock friend DS-Ruin 7/21/23 has the highest dps output [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZfxzzGhoZvx0tM0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZfxzzGhoZvx0tM0z)

I was hoping sooner, but it may not be a bad idea to get outdoors and enjoy the summer.
---
Strange was of ignoring 32 stamina....
---
I was really hoping he'd spin around and knock a lot of crap over. 
---
1. See player killing the same mobs or getting ganked
---
2. Help them kill their enemy
---
3. /whisper &lt;name&gt; "wanna group up homie?" 
---
That's why I said "anything meaningful" sure it helps you level weapons skills faster but that isn't super important unless you just got a new weapon and your skill with it is 1/200 or something similar.
---
The release has said Summer 2019 for a long time. Summer starts June 21. That's 25 days into summer. I don't think you could hope for much better.
---
Yeah that is a few of them. I mean the optimization on some sets is lacking as they try to put all the stats for all specs in one set. One of the druids healing sets bonus (ZG set) gives +crit to starfall. Not to mention the garage that is the blue dungeon sets but other than those vanilla gear is cool. Just a few mis steps.
---
This blanket statement is misleading. Shackle pulling in 5mans is dialed. The range is good and the priest can easily get another shackle off if the initial cast is resisted. Also there are myriad cast timer mods that will track when your shackle breaks and can easily be re-applied even in the midst of battle. Further the 'agro' you speak of is as close to zero as threat can get. The priest only has agro because the priest is the only one on the other mobs' threat table. Any sort of hostile action by the tank (shouts) puts the tank above the priest on the threat table. Also consider the typical positioning of the group in a 5 man. The priest stands about as far 'back' from the pull as possible. In the shackle pulling scenario, the priest starts out in front and then runs to the back providing excellent opportunity to LoS ranged/casters. The tank, instead of scurrying about, can already be positioned where the pull will cluster to chase the priest.
---
Further, consider the priest shielding before the pull with inner fire up. Even if a hit or two come in from some ranged or caster, the priest will not be greatly affected. If a renew or other healing is needed, the priest can fade and shed some immediate threat on the table. Naturally, fade is only useful when others exist on the threat table...ideally the tank with his/her use of AOE threat mechanics.

&gt; My personal belief is that there are ~40,000,000 people who have played the game and a huge chunk of those people are not satisfied by this casualization. We were kind of driven out.
---
While I'm tempted to agree with you, it's always important to keep a level head. This subreddit has about 63k subscribers. Assuming that this number equals 1/10th of the total amount of people who disliked the changes and want Classic WoW's 'roughness', we're still only talking 6.3 million people - less than half of the playerbase at the game's peak moment.  
---
Release will have to see how things pan out, but make no mistake; the 'fanbase' that has so desperately been fighting for a no changes vanilla remake is a minority.
---
Oh gods. And the enhanced level of panic when you don't have burst attacks.
---
If you're in the first wave there is no way you will have that at 31. Probably low 40s is realistic.
---

First, the German version is not a trademark. That's very good news.
---
Second, its meaning is closer to English "in a moment" than "anytime in the future/soon". That's even better.

This comment doesn't help your case.

I've never heard "over sighted" as a verb until just now.

This is the best show I forgot about it and great meme

i had the same scenario earlier today haha, feels really good turning all that in!

There are people who know something new now, who didn't have the question.  If he had googled the answer many people would be unaware.

I would recommend checking out Ohhgee Haptix on youtube.

He has a few videos about roles and such in premades.

See I view this as like a girl choosing to dress up nice and put on makeup and people go "well you need to expect to be cat called constantly". The problem is an overly needy community not the individual playing a class...
---
It's weird, because it's like a mentality thing. It provided a block that I couldn't get passed. Logically, you think "OK, I don't enjoy doing these dailies... I just won't do them." But it never worked out that way. Instead, I would either login and do my dailies, or I just wouldn't login at all. It made the game feel like work; like a chore, but for whatever reason, I couldn't just force myself to skip them. It made World of Warcraft go from feeling like a fun hobby, to feeling like unpaid work. "OK, finish my dailies &amp; then I can play the game."
---
It almost got to the point where the dailies made me feel a sense of anxiety, which is crazy. It's not like Classic, Vanilla WoW didn't its fair share of "dailies." Of course, they weren't called dailies, you didn't feel an overbearing cloud looking down at you if you skipped doing something &amp; you could do whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted. Gold farming, reputation farming, getting attuned, honor grinding, gearing up, collecting raids mats, whatever. Hell, I remember on multiple occasions binding my cast for fishing to middle mouse, zooming in all the way to first-person perspective, putting on music &amp; just vegging out for hours... but it never felt like a chore. It was honestly relaxing. 
---
I think a lot of it is simply just the feeling of "hey, you *could* go do this" compared to "hey, you *should* go do this." When dailies became official, if you skipped them, it felt like other people were passing you &amp; you were falling behind. Which, if you're a busy person, was a shitty feeling.

since i saw this picture of him next to a gnome, i just can look at his face without laughing.

Life of the party aren‚Äôt we 
---
&gt;I was a filthy keyboard turner with ‚Äú1‚Äù through ‚Äú=‚Äú bound to my bar
---
I experimented a lot with keybinds. But, I was still used to mouse-controlled UI in Windows and all other popular operating systems of 90s. That meant mouse has one particular use - to hover a button, and click it. And clicking wasn't optimal in PVP, was it?
---
So, guess what I did. I enabled click-to-move, and bound all my spells to the numeric keyboard. I was rotating with WASD, and casting spells with my right hand on the numeric keyboard. Yes, I was actually letting go of mouse during PVP fights.
---
It's hard to stay relevant close with the wife's level while leveling let alone an internet stranger.     Duo leveling will likely only work for content creators and the unemployed 
---
The "=" button displays a "+" even though you have to press shift for that. On retail it displays a "=".
---
Count me interested. I'm not exactly a 9-5er, more of PhD student---which means that daily schedule and weekly workload can vary a lot (but are often demanding). Planning to take leveling at my own pace. I love 5-man dungeons. It would also be fun to work toward raiding (behind the curve) with a good group of friends.
---
If it sounds like I could be a good fit, let's chat on Discord! My tag is: Roy#1126
---
Well you're missing that they're using 1.12 as a base so they won't be true to their original form. They will be at their best state during the entirety of vanilla wow. 
---
They also didn't compete with tanks on much gear because they didn't crossover. Tank gear has no useful stats for fury warriors outside of a few pieces. Dps warriors will be wearing a lot of non plate gear in raids. 
---
If the classes are true to the balance in 1.12 then warriors will start off on a pretty even playing field with rogues so the bias of giving rogues 1h weapons won't be there.
---
You're totally right that the experience playing a warrior through vanilla isn't even remotely the same as private servers but they are basing this off 1.12 so I would bet my house that you're going to see fury warriors being extremely competitive with rogues.
---
You say that, but in EVE Online cyno vigils for fallen players are taken very seriously.
---
I don't know of any games which are more PVP or faction focused than EVE.
---
There's also a Starbase surrounded by containers as memorials for fallen players which could be killed by anyone at anytime but has stood for years and years.
---
I enjoyed the video in OP when it first came out and still think it's kind of awesome now but recognise that maybe it's not in the spirit of the event. WoW is a different game though and I think there's less clear-cut ethics on PVP.
---
Yep, that's a major weakness since if you're trying to maximize damage, you can't down-rank like you would as a healer.
---
I just enjoy playing a game that rewards players for the content they do. I'm not worried about an lfr player out gearing a mythic raider. I just dont think they should have anything above the ilvl that lfr normally has to offer if that is the extent of their abilities or initiative to achieve. This includes weekly quests that reward 400 ilvl gear. Difficult content should reward better gear 100% of the time. Doing difficult content only to get gear that isnt an upgrade because it lacks tertiaries and sockets that you got from the previous difficulty is incredibly underwhelming and deflating if you just spent two hours wiping to get the kill and hurts people's initiative to continue progressing because the loot is the light at the end of the tunnel. For a lot of people the journey isnt worth the destination anymore and that's a shame.
---
Dunno about gating but some of the more important stuff can be traded from the Goblin side (like the better jumper cables) and you will be able to use them as a Gnomish engineer just fine.
---
This. I 100% agree. Wow doesn‚Äôt make sense to people who have never played the game and just see gameplay, most of it is meaningless 
---
I do this, it works. It's a bit personal, but it works.
---
You can expect someone you might "who" who wants to join will be on the other continent so they will take awhile to get there.
---
I would say this is a last ditch effort after a few /lfg's and a few /1 or /2's because this is really going out of your way to get someones attention and when it doesn't work it feels like a waste of effort haha.
---
If I remember correctly, DS/Ruin (linked in this thread) had a minor DPS edge in a raid environment. However, because it depends on Sacing your pet, you will seriously under perform in most other aspects of the game - anything in the world or involving PvP will be more difficult. Also worth noting that you won‚Äôt be able to provide Blood Pact to your party, which may be more value added for progression than your personal DPS boost.
---
As a former Vanilla Lock, I strongly recommend SM/Ruin. That spec is more than adequate for all content.
---
Down voted because you can't spell Mankrik
---
You know, the funny thing is that my bro-in-law got me into the game, and being a gamer and being used to FPS games, I knew the importance of using a mouse on a PC, so when I started playing (as with any game) I re-bound all my keys in a similar fashion to yours, but then when I leveled up more, I found myself not having enough keys and asked my bro-in-law how he dealt with that dilemma. He saw what I did and said "What the fuck are you doing?" then told me to re-bind everything back to "1" through "=" and play with the keyboard, left hand on WASD and right hand just above it on 1234. Him being a veteran, I figured he knew something I didn't, so I did as he said...
---
Thank god I know better now. Not only do I use the mouse, I also invested in a Razer Naga mouse (one with buttons on the side) - best MMO decision I have made :)
---
Yes, I understand that about the BoE's, I have just read that there were BoP recipes as well. And I may have the Gnomish/Goblin backwards. 
---
I love this sub but god damn, why are there always so many shitty people in these threads downvoting anyone who sways away from their own opinion. OP is looking for a friend and all you idiots can contribute is how it‚Äôs a bad idea. Wtf?

what talent build?

Deadmines or Dire Maul?

I still can‚Äôt comprehend how in a day where everything is available online, I can‚Äôt find PDFs of these guides lol.

How did you convince her to try? Some one else was asking on here for suggestions recently

I do this caster style with downranking spells to 5%.

Explain strength on any piece of cloth armor.

Does that mean Undercity was the Horde capital then?

---
O.o I'm pretty sure my RAM was in the MB range, definitely not a Gig. Don't even know what my video card was, but pretty sure it had integrated graphics. All I know is that I messed with settings a lot to get the graphics detailed enough so I could read the text, but low enough so I move with 12-15fps when questing.

yea and u def need good CC

I feel like this happens a few times in stv if you do it right. 
---
basically anything that heals + anything that does damage
---
Pally/Warrior is iconic duo tho
---
and nouns can be used as verbs
---
This video gets posted so much.  Let me clear up some misinformation.
---
I was part of the alliance group.
---
&gt; I've been told that the person of intrest was a big fan of RP-wPvP events
---
False.  The troll priest was not a known person on Illidan.
---
I'm sure you just reading what Jackson(Azshira)'s chat bubble says in the video at 7:05 and based off that saying "I've been told she liked pvp" rofl....
---
It's a joke.  Originally when the person hosting the funeral posted about it on illidrama.com they said they'd be hosting it in winterspring because 'she liked the snow and fishing' etc.
---
&gt; but the music they used was fantastic
---
The upload linked here isn't accurate to the original video edit.
---
Youtube wasn't used when this was done, we passed the video around by hosting it on a file hosting service originally.
---
When the video was finally uploaded to youtube, it got muted because of copyright infringement (music).
---
All the various reuploads that came after that changed the music including this one.
---
The original songs used are listed at the end of the video.  
---
The scatman john song was in there (and that part is accurate).  SN used to play that all the time in voice comms.
---
Aight peace.
---
To confuse firestone warlocks
---
UC and TB weren't as popular due to having to ride elevators to access them from outside.
---
Upvoted for using 'DM' correctly 
---
I'll be doing dou leveling with my buddy.. we'll be Mage / Priest
---
In select circumstances you had dps warriors rolling on ap mail, and paladins rolling on spell mail. Hunters were generally easy to gear, but in my vanilla raiding experience not a whole lot of gear dropped. 
---
There's no problem here actually, esp not with the player that chose to pick the warrior. Needing a tank for a dungeon run is just part of the game, you basically always need a tank. Being that tanks are the minority based off the classes that can dpsand heal, you will literally always be needed as a tank. Again, not a problem, but if you find people asking you to tank for them annoying then maybe playing a tank isn't for you as that's literally a core part of the class. 
---
BiS for PVP
---
for PVE alot of other professions work
---
I have leveled warrior and pally solo before, not very fun. We‚Äôll be going horde.
---
I keep thinking about this and I frequently change my mind on the matter. 
---
On the one hand, Vanilla is great the way it is (was). The bugs and unbalanced nature of it all was what made it interesting. Classes that weren't as great at pumping out the deeps, were often great at other stuff or brought great utility. 
---
On the other hand, what if a few tweaks here and there made it even greater? Could tweaks make it the MMO we've all been waiting for?
---
Personally, I think launching classic in it's original form, warts and all, is the way to go. BUT, what I would really love to see, is poll system be introduced after a couple of years, similar to Oldschool runescape, where the game is continually developed but only based on majority vote from the players. 
---
And maybe clone the server before they start changing stuff, so the people content with the state of the game can continue to play without changes. 
---
But that's just me... I'm sure a lot of people would disagree. 
---
Druid - warrior
---
Warlock - warrior
---
Warlock - hunter
---
Come to think of it..  Try to avoid wearing the same armor type and your are fine!
---
Heals + dps is always a good combo, especially if you both are using different armor types.
---
Personally I'm going warrior/mage with my spouse. As a tank it's usually pretty easy to find a pug healer, but having a mage around is really helpful in instances (sheep), and they can make you food.
---
Druid/rogue is fun too since you can both stealth, but you'll be fighting over the same gear.
---
I feel your pain.
---
I'm a lefty so I was never able to use wasd.
---
I was a keyboard Turner using the up/down/left/right arrows on the right side of the keyboard while clicking my spells.
---
Those 4 arrows were the only keyboard keys I used in game, couldnt even reach the spacebar to jump without taking my hand off of the arrows.
---
Later I picked up a razor lefty naga when they finally started making them and that gave me a few more options for thumb buttons but to this day I'm still mostly a newb clicker. Damn lefthandedness
---
I'd say ret the 8% move/mont speed is nice and you don't have to have speed enchant, that is if you are not the kings buff player in raids
---
Sounds good man. I'll add ya to the list.
---
The main difference is that raiding was only a small part of the game that could easily be ignored by "casuals" or those without the time.
---
This is more a case of learning about a game before buying it.
---
Not a fan of hard games myself honestly but I just don't buy them...
---
Paladin for sure for stuns, Blessings and best single target healing. Warrior is good but very gear dependent.
---
Druid would be another good to add some HOT healing and DPS.
---
Lol it's all good fellow redditor
---
Cyclonian (40) can be killed with a healer or just a full group of warrior. Arguably the hardest/most tedious part is grinding the level 37-39 elementals in Arathi for the 8 essences, of 3 types. So in total, 24 essences.  Again, with a few buddies you can do it (best is if you're all warriors and agree to help each other until everyone has 24 essences). This might take upwards of 3 hours.
---
Also about 30 bloodscalp troll tusks, I believe from parts of STV. Those can be gathered solo.
---
I happen to think 50-60 is a really easy range, and part of it is a nice kickoff with Un'Goros pretty seamless ~1.5 levels.
---
Right, but that's a core part of the class. If I rolled warrior, I would do so knowing I would be asked to tank a lot. Any warrior should. That's just a part of that game, no getting around it. It's actually not rude at all. 
---
Before they rebranded to Steelseries they were called Icemat and they were released in 2005 :)
---
&gt;If it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it to be honest
---
Except the classes are 100% broken
---
So gatekeeping then.
---
Horde and dosent seem like youre interested in warrior. I'd say druid + rogue. At 60 you could probably solo some stuff with this combo as well. Could even go x2 druid
---
Might help to know your preference for factions or race. For example if you both want to be Tauren, then warrior/shaman would be fun. 
---
I never do that honestly. There's 0 fun in killing somebody who cannot defend himself. I gank all the time, but rarely even touch Green levels, as these fights are generally too boring and easy. Greykilling is not even an option, unless I want to help a fellow player getting ganked. Greykillers are just cancerous to the game anyway. You have to have mental health issues to take pleasure in killing people who cannot defend themselves IMO. It's not as if WPvP was ever scarce on relatively good sized PvP servers. There's way enough competition of your own level to have fun with.
---
You shouldn't have given it to him dude, fuck 'em.
---
cool
---
On the other hand I got one on my paladin, also pserver, for VC. Flew out from redridge, and as soon as I got there I got "WE CHINESE" in party chat. I still have nightmares about that run. I guess that won't be an issue in Classic though.
---
You can always level druid/priest or druid/shaman druid shaman is a pretty nice combo sins both have travel form
---
They aren't mutually exclusive things you know
---
And at that point (if you're Alliance) you can get the Bonebiter axe from SM which is actually better.. faster speed with a higher top end damage and more strength..    [http://classicdb.ch/?item=6830](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6830) 
---
If Vanilla released with TBC classes I honestly don't know why anyone would complain. TBC classes are basically Vanilla but better.
---
I came here to say this as well.
---
Then let‚Äôs make it like retail eh? Because everyone loves when every class is the same. 
---
Idk my only issue in life right now is that my gf doesn‚Äôt play wow and I am desiring a less attractive girl who does play wow and am trying to figure out how to make the stars align. 
---
But then it wouldn't be classic... it'd be TBC without the content lol. 
---
That's a no go for me my man. 
---
Once you land the route into the mountain from Thorium Point is substantially faster than the route from Morgan's Vigil.
---
If people can organize successful mythic pugs in retail, I‚Äôm pretty sure they will be there in Classic. 
---
that would be cigarette smokers.. but yeah, lump all potheads together...
---
Sorry to disappoint you but you can't have more than three of the same characters in a row. Best you could get is "Naaaill"
---
At this point, I think they should just open the gate to Hyjal so we can explore it since it was already built. It'll be a cool RP spot.
---
Husband and I are doing priest and warlock! With him picking up tailoring/enchanting (so we can craft a little gear and wands) and me getting herb/alchemy (to give us a bit of potion help along the way) it seems like a great fit.
---
"Hearth, you fools !"
---
This is outrageous. I'm a single player casual, have never finished a soulesborne game and after exactly one week of playing Sekiro I made it to the final boss. This game is difficult but it's not too hard. 
---
This is outrageous because it is the journalist's job to finish the game in order to provide a well rounded opinion on it. These guys are getting paid to write reviews about video games and complain that they are too difficult? Fuck you and change careers to chopping wood in Siberia.
---
But in 40 man raids, you only need 5% tanks except for a few select fights.
---
I had the same card, it was a cadillac of a card back then!
---
Yeah, I didnt expect much, esp from reddit, and this sub. Its my fault for trying to get my shit together before launch.
---
City Raids against the Alliance. Use to lead them every week with about 40-80 people depending on how many showed up. 
---
Sometimes things are more precious *because* of their flaws.
---
Don't know if you replied to the wrong comment but i didn't mention retail or say they should make them the same. I said to fix them because they are obviously broken.
---
While leveling up add friend every warrior druid priest shaman/pala. 
---
That way each time you get all the quests for a dungeon and are ready to do it you have a huge list of people to /w and ask.
---
Also join a guild thats even more people.
---
And as a last resort talk in world chat. 
---
Someone people see it as a hastle but it is actually faster to find a group that way than the lfg tool on retail, especially as dps. Lfg tool take between 9 and 15 minutes to get a group, while in vanilla buy socializing with people in world and guild you find groups in less than 5 minutes.
---
or for people who have similar schedules, and would like a partner to level with  
---
"Mommmm...Nonno got into the wine again!"
---
No one is saying "make it retail". Go back to Westfall with your straw-man ass.
---
Also, the classes are not "100% broken". Everyone doesn't need to be good at everything. I just think Shammy Tanks could be interesting and it's a shame they were never viable. I don't want them to be on par with warriors even, just Paladins and Druids so there's more faction balance and variety of tanks (even if in raiding Warriors will always be main tanks)
---
I'm a 29yo EU-(rp-)PvP brit bro with enough vanilla experience. I'm looking for an alliance guild of focused peeps who want to progress steadily and enjoy all vanilla has to offer with a real community emphasis.
---
Not interested in loosey goosey guilds who accommodate noobs in order to give them a place to fit in OR guilds who are so focused on progression that they're willing to go through undue stress to attain it. I want to be with high skill level players who don't lose their shit when things go wrong.
---
Will play mage on either faction and am happy to raid 2 or 3 nights a week. If I sound like a good fit for your guild hit me up with a pm.
---
I'm pretty sure there was no strength on any cloth gear past the original vanilla game, but correct me if I'm wrong. Any strength on leveling cloth gear or the original game's end game gear was likely left over from the scrapped monk style class/spec. I think it was priests that had a melee spec. 
---
Yep, ww axe is only really worth it for horde warriors. And even then in a fresh server scenario i'd much rather get corpsemaker, only slightly worse than ww axe but infinitely easier to get
---
Most people use discord because it makes more sense to use discord as your guilds forum rather than say a website forum, and using discord for audio too then just makes sense.
---
Discord is great for communities and such though the voice part of it is not perfect, so some guilds use TS3 for raids and discord for casual talk. 
---
Looked up my purchase price on Newegg... $176 out the door!  Not bad!
---
&gt; couldnt even reach the spacebar to jump without taking my hand off of the arrows
---
And, as a joke, right control couldn't be bound, because it was a "modifier".

There's a big difference between asked to tank by people around you or by people you've seen before. And being spammed by random people. Any tank can instantly get a group for whatever you spam them for. They don't need to be spammed to run a dungeon. All whispering warriors does is spam them, and hope someone didn't even know they wanted to do a dungeon. Any tank that wants to tank can say /1 tank lfg anything and people will literally build groups around them.
---
You are the type of person who goes "gold spammers aren't a problem just don't play if you don't like seeing folks spamming wts gold". Like spamming people shouldn't be acceptable. Ever.
---
Don't day random. Say wierd.
---
Random is the shit we have on retail where u literally no longer look at stats only ilvl. 
---
Gear stats in vanilla was wierd. Like blizzard getting stone way too hard while coding them to the game and laughing at the faces we'll make when we see them.
---
I saw some dude with full t2 mage next to me in av getting crazy procs and chucking insta pyroblasts like crazy on drek. He was using arcane missles a lot to proc. 
---
For when you go oom and still don't have a wand.
---
Also, disc priests originally were supposed to be a melee class, so that might have something to do with it.
---
Oh yeah. I have that policy too. Rogue = dead, doesn‚Äôt matter the level. 
---
Where people duel is really base on where the players are. In Classic that will most likely be IF and ORG, so that's where people will duel...
---
I was going to come in here and say dragonstalker 8 piece.
---
so stronk.  PvE DPS increase to all ranged dps sources and in PvP, holy crap.  when it procs, it's like Aimshot=Oneshot 
---
How about "An Easy Mode has never ruined a SINGLE-PLAYER game" 
---
In an MMO it obviously is a bad idea
---
I'll PM it.
---
Mage / Rogue  Stun / CC all day and lots of dmg, plus both very good at lvling on their own.
---
or Hunter / Druid. 
---
Even a bit of small tuning would change the entire balance dynamic. 
---
No changes.
---
I just like the layout of IF better. Once I hit 60 (and get my epic kitty cat mount) that's where I'll be for sure.
---
just duel gnomes near water, mc them on the priest and throw them in.
---
i hear most gnomes cant swim
---
Gotta be honest, I used to follow Rogues around and just block stealth with Faerie Fire spam while they quested/farmed. One of the great highlights of Vanilla, along with flinging people off blimps and boats with Mind Control.
---
I'm sold on it too, which is why I mained a paladin in retail WoW. But trying to play ret pally in vanilla was just impossible. You're not gonna be that holy knight in golden armor, maybe in cities while afking. In raids you're gonna be healing and buffing in your pink dress
---
It's not easy being green.
---
Unless there's a pill for that.
---
I've no interest in the Scarab Lord title and I only work 3 days/week^1 . And I can wait until September. Of course I'm desperately hoping I'll really only be waiting until late June or early July, but I'm forcing myself to expect it in late September, just before the equinox, in order to keep a tenuous hold on what little sanity still remains to me.
---
Rank 14, however, is the dream. I'd get immediate access to all the gear and mounts and I'd never have to worry about dHKs again. Endless world PvP and city raids, here I come! Plus, y'know, r14 is simply never going to happen for me under the cussing *awful* old ranking system.
---
^1 ^Because ^I ^work ^weekends. ^No ^Hook ^of ^the ^Master ^Angler ^for ^me. ^:'(
---
What level are you? 
---
Also I noticed my gear changes from INT to Agil depending on my spec. im around 105~ level gear on my 84 druid. Do I need two gear sets (other than trinkets) or can I just roll with one main gear set and use it between all specs?
---
Also, why not just respec for healing, it takes 10 seconds, no? 
---
I haven't played since WOTLK basically so if my questions are dumb, my bad. Back then you couldn't just swap specs in 10 seconds but it seems there's no disadvantage to doing so now if I wanted to go full healer mode vs tank mode etc. 
---
shamans are viable tanks. Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play. There's a guide here to help you tank raids: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;p=4977
---
I am in the classic discord https://discord.gg/classicwow voice channel if you want to chat and learn more about it
---
Spammed? yeah if someone copy and pasted "Heya, are you up for Tanking Strat?" like 5 times then yeah, fuck that person. If someone sent you a single message, that's not being spammed. Chatting is the sole way to form groups in Classic WoW, people need to chat to form groups. Public channels are inefficient, slow, and don't work some of the time. And yes, gold spammers are a problem.
---
Stacking Spirit as a hunter üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The same people who rage out when they lose a fair fight... and then immediately log on a twink for BGs.
---
Even the Ravager axe from Herod has higher damage, no stats but that proc can be really strong. I think it roots you in place though? So many not so great for PvP...
---
Loc buffs themselves.. prepare for fear spam 
---
Definitely. Vendor or disenchant the loot and sell the useful BoEs on the AH.
---
Maybe an odd choice, but I'd show her [Unbreakable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w). Simply because it's fun to watch and with some great music, it's one of those videos that would make an 2005 me go "I must have this game". 
---
That one corner of the inn (SE I believe). As long as someone isn‚Äôt standing in a guard you can cast any and all down
---
I understand that it's \*technically possible\* but if you have to put in twice the effort, it isn't really \*viable\*
---
Holy crap, I completely forgot about /who. That was such a great feature that I used all the time in vanilla. I mained a holy priest, so I would use it to find a tank and then broadcast in LFG that we were just looking for DPS. Got groups so quickly!
---
CC pulling seemed pretty common in my memory. especially if you multiple good CC'ers in the group. sheep/sap/trap 2 of the 3 mobs right off the bat, easier on the tank and healer and easier for the dps to focus fire.
---
it didnt have so much to do with a 'bad tank'. more so that multiple mobs pounding the tank (even for a second or two) put more pressure on the healer.pressure
---
As I had forgotten more than I ever knew about Engineering I was in the same boat as you. I would recommend [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSB1tjopCmU) from Frostadamus. It's Classic specific and goes into the various options in some depth which should answer the questions in your OP. Better than I could for sure.
---
You'll get a lot of Warrior/healer answers because Warriors are so much more successful with a healer buddy than solo, so why not take advantage of that. Outside of that, most classes can really hold their own on their own, so anything you guys want to play will play well together.
---
Warrior and Shaman could be a lot of fun. Shamans are a fantastic support class that can DPS or heal or both, and can hold their own when they need to. Windfury totem is fantastic. A lot of synergy.
---
Outside of that, truly whatever you guys want to play.
---
If you receive 5 whispers in 15 minutes even from different people is spam.
---
its not meant offensive, i smoked pot for almost 10 years too. it depends on how much you smoke, but a friend of mine is taking smoke-breaks at least once every hour.
---
She‚Äôs willing to try anything I‚Äôm passionate about. She realizes that me playing video games during my down time is better than if I was going out to bars. Basically she fully supports me gaming and is willing to try any game out with me so we can bond together over our hobbies. She‚Äôs recently become a fan of Rocket League and Cuphead so I‚Äôm making progress!
---
Also I‚Äôm just lucky to have found my soul mate who is willing to try out the things I‚Äôm passionate about. (Sorry to get sappy here) 
---
It's just all the RPers want to say something after hearing about RP-PVP problems. I'm one of them. I think I would just ignore this thread if there were no issues with RP-PVP.
---
The poll results already did show what people want to roll, so I don't really see a point to make another thread honestly.
---
Majority of the people will roll PVP anyway
---
yes, very.
---
you obviously didnt get the joke.
---
I cant wait for populated pve servers.
---
Frost Nova + Imp CoC from a couple mages wipes whelps out almost instantly. Seems like a raid positioning problem no? 
---
Why is there a sheep icon where the yeti's level should be?
---
If it's gold sellers then yeah you can clump that into gold spam. But the individuals don't know that you just got a whisper about it, can't really blame them for trying to form a group with the tools given to them by the game. Not trying to be a dick or anything, but it's classic man! you gotta temper your expectations of the game. No one is maliciously trying to upset you, just innocent players playing the game the way it was built to be played.
---
Then get your account flagged by mods for spamming. Heppend to me haha
---
I'm surprised they still them. I bought it so I could play Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising and kept it until 2010. It was a stud.
---
I think this is the sort of thing they could potentially add if they wanted to take vanilla in a different direction. But it's not the sort of thing they should consider adding right now. Test the waters first and make sure that it has the sort of appeal that they are looking for, and then they can debate whether or not they want to expand without doing burning crusade
---
^^ True, though my focus was on mentioning 5-player dungeons, which is the bulk of the zones people will ever do. The average person may raid 0-2 times per week, but they'll do literally hundreds of 5-person dungeons in order to get pre-B.i.S. gear, some of which people will outright settle for as practically geared before moving on to create the next alt. 
---
On the podcast Countdown to Classic they just had a vanilla class designer speaking about the shaman class. He confirmed that Enh Shamans were intended to be able to tank until around Sunken Temple. 
---
why herb/alch?
---
Yeah man, you got it. Every game should appeal to everyone's playstyle. That's why barbie dream house needs a hardcore mode because only making it casual is gatekeeping. 
---
You get bear at 10 and cat at 20?
---
I don't know how AV was back in vanilla because I never played it, but if we're talking retail there's no way you're killing Vann or Drek with all towers up. At least not in a random game. Maybe if you're a premade with top tier PvP or mythic raid gear.
---
Man, in retail we would do this on purpose to group up the entire room and AOE them down. What once was certain death is now a way to grind exp.
---
OP, I wish you'd be a bit more helpful when asking for things like this.  
---
Include a little bit of an idea of [what kinds of class fantasies](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b35ee7/help_us_help_you_choose_some_tips_on_asking_what/) either of you have to help us pair you up.  
---
It's important to find classes that you enjoy on their own, not just who are good at leveling on their own. The pairing comes in stage two of that decision.  
---
I always advise to NEVER play a class primarily to fill a group role.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4
---
Agreed.
---
DS/Ruin (7/21/23) is the most effective damage output build in a raid PvE environment, but SM/Ruin (30/0/21) is just behind it and so versatile you'll never have to re-spec.
---
Nice, I went to an 8800GTS sometime later, then to a Radeon 5850 1GB model after that.
---
People here have covered the basics, so I'll offer something slightly that I think might be fun: shaman - hunter or shaman - melee. Specifically, elemental shaman will provide heals when necessary and serious burst damage for PvP. 
---
If you do the hunter-shaman combination, one of you can get skinning-leatherworking and be able to craft gear along the way. Might not be optimal because you're sharing gear types, but you won't have much overlap in stat needs if you go with elemental. 
---
Outside of hunter, any melee class (warrior, rogue, feral druid, even enhance shammy) will provide some good options if one of you is a caster and the other is melee. If you go warrior-shammy or feral-shammy, you get the added benefit of having tank and heals for instances.
---
1. Rank 14 (Green) - Easily has highest value considering the time invested to acquire it. Immediately pays off for the entire life of the server.
---
2. Scarab Lord (Purple) - 2nd highest investment of time and resources and cannot be obtained by yourself. Assuming you don't get the title until the release of AQ, it has a shorter shelf life vs. Rank 14.
---
3. 2 Weeks PTO (Yellow) - Money + Free Time = No-brainer, but less inherent value vs. the two above.
---
4. Classic Release (Blue) - Too selfish to consider sacrificing any of the the above opportunities.
---
this guy markets
---
This is just sad.
---
I still remember the smell, and the sound of that little Velcro circle when I first unwrapped the original wow on my 12th birthday 
---
this is why i'm a part of this sub
---
Yeah absolutely! From that point of view I agree with the spirit and such as its wierd having both mp 5 and spirit in the game. Cause I always felt that  spirit was  suppose to be mp/5. But I think they had a hard time balancing it since they gave it hp/5 as well. Which I have never seen a good hp/5 build that would be cool though
---
yes
---
Also just lfg in the local area as well works too
---
I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs actually nice to use the same armor type as your duo because you can pick quests that reward that type of armor
---
Yeah, don't do that.
---
I would love to see a reboot of the Game honestly. 
---
Lets no do flying mounts, no LFG, no transmog (or at least toggle for how you personally perceive others). I ll be the first to say i love transmog, but i have to admit it has it's drawbacks, i did not think I'd miss the way people slowly progressed, including my characters. 
---
You mean they can be verbed? 
---
If you believe it won't be then you haven't played private servers or other games with unmoderated chat channels (Path of exile) 
---
I love the randomness of seal of command and the hands off easy rotation. They‚Äôre also really easy to level and you rarely die, though it takes longer to kill stuff. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to just pop on a seal and auto attack away 
---
After taking and failing miserably at 2 keyboarding classes in middle school, it was WoW that effectively taught me how to type more than 5 characters per minute. So not a whole new language, but a pretty similar story! 
---
You won't lose much time doing it maybe, but you will lose a lot of time doing it well.
---
Sure every game company could just cut enemy HP in half and call it easy mode, but to actually still provide a good player experience while making the difficulty lower does add a significant amount of time.
---
I don't recall which was completed first on most of the servers? Was it the  Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain or was it the war effort? Because the gong is only accessible 5 days after the war effort was finished. So technically, you could just no life a day or 2 to farm the rep and still finish in time by illegally procuring boosts to the required raids and gold for the required mats.  
---
I'm not condoning this by any means but it sounds like something I could do if I got 2 weeks PTO...
---
Hahah Brilliant! Need an online version of this!
---
Blizzard can do whatever they want. Really. They say "classic summer". They can hold off until Christmas and release it then if they really want to. They could release it tomorrow, or tank the whole project and move on. It seems like a lot of people think that this statement is some sort of binding contract. 
---
Personally, I would wager something happens on July 16th, announcement, release date, beta, release
---
Your argument is so flimsy. Sheep spam griefing is using the tools of the game. That doesn't make it acceptable. Also /who and whispering wasn't intended to find tanks for groups. That's just an unintended use of a tool that is being abused to spam people. 
---
Just because you view it as just whispers doesn't mean that it's not spam. Gold spam even when sent less whispers is considered spam, group spam is also spam. Im not saying these arent "innocent" people out to get me. That doesn't make it spam.
---
If someone says "whisper [friends name] for gold" and 100 people send a whisper that player was spammed. Even though it wasn't malicious by the individuals the communities mentality created spam. Which is annoying. 
---
Annoying =/= malicious and I never said it was.
---
I actually tanked Wailing Caverns with my voidwalker when the tank left.
---
Kargoz on YouTube has some duo leveling ideas. He and his friends have really been exploring the meta of duo. Mage-Mage, lock-pally, lock-druid, sham-warrior are all top tier combos. Other strong combos include Druid shammy, lock priest, war-pally, and war-priest
---
Respecting has to be done at a class trainer in town and costs gold. if you do it like 6 times you're spending 15 gold a pop, or something like that. I have like 30 gold, so that's 50% of my money to change, then if I change back I'm at 0 gold. 
---
I'm level 38. 
---
When I change into INT gear I gain around an extra 1200 mana, and lots of spirit so it's useful for healing. My Agility set gives me like an extrea 40 or 60 agility, so my crits are more often in feral form. 
---
Gear won't change based on the talent spec, not sure if that was a game change in later expansions. It is what it is. 
---
Sheep pulling was not common
---
It‚Äôs a terrible way to run dungeons and as someone else mentions, it‚Äôs only useful in a few scenarios
---
My personal feeling about that is it's too easy to be any fun.  I did not accomplish anything worthwhile so it does not bring me enjoyment.  That is assuming I don't have some prior interaction with the person.  
---
I almost never pick fights though, I find it is a lot more fun to bring justice down on the heads of my enemies for being foolish enough to provoke me.  It puts me at a disadvantage, and sometimes turns out poorly by letting someone get the jump... but beating someone down when they tried to gank you is very satisfying. 
---
Can't you level fishing to 300 in any zone though?  IE a non-contested one?
---
Oh god no, those prefixes (of the bear, of the monkey, etc) existed for years. So you'd find an item and it'd be a cloth tunic of the bear, simple as that. Then they streamlined some specs and certain stat combos started to make no sense (agility and spirit on cloth/leather/plate gear). So, naturally the game got simplified and you know the rest.
---
What I wouldn've much rather had was for every class in the game to have some kind of benefit from each stat. You could have your primary stats (like agility for rogues) but then have useful secondary stats (such as having spirit be used for energy regeneration for rogues). They could tone down the secondary stats a bit so they aren't the focus, but still handy when you get gear that adds to them. That way, nothing is useless.
---
Maybe warlocks/mages/priests get a chance to stun with blunt weapons based on their strength? I'm just pitching but my point is, make every piece of gear have SOME use, otherwise Druids/Shamans/Paladins benefit from crappy gear more than anyone else. 
---
The Cheat! Episode. I think that‚Äôs what hooked me in 
---
tomorrow!? aww shit
---
According to Kevin Jordan (via countdown to classic) that has never been the plan. It really seems like there isn't any use for strength on cloth armor.
---
crank the brightness to 11 people! there's gonna be blazin sunshine soon.
---
1. Warrior + Shaman, windfury totem is literally OP.
---
2. Warrior + Paladin, the flip side to shaman and a nasty combo.
---
3. Everything else.
---
I guess I die, should be more appropriate in this case
---
Tauren get herbalism is going to be a decent way to make gold  you also can farm them earlier than any other class with ghostwolf. Alchemy for the transmutes. 
---
Not gonna lie, I totally forgot doing that all the time when looking for people. I thought I had caught up on vanilla memories but that makes me wonder if there's still some more nostalgia left I didn't know about
---
Ok I‚Äôm sold. I‚Äôm rolling warrior like everyone else 
---
You can make a macro to cancel the spin. Works just like any buff.
---
You keep using that word.  I dont think it means what You think it means.
---
And there are people who think Prot Paladins should still suck in classic. Why must they suffer?
---
Almost as much as the people who design the game it's steeped in are invariably baffled by how much their players enjoy it.
---
I love programmers, not least because we wouldn't have games without them, but they're a weird bunch sometimes.
---
To be honest, how many younger teens would've just claimed to be 18 just to be sure they wouldn't miss out on anything?
---
I mean you still have vanilla content, you just aren't punished for playing one of the many "wrong" specs.
---
I love how many people ignored the post of above them and then just reiterated what the 8+ comments above them said lol. 
---
And I'm the idiot that freaking reread it over and over then spent a little more time commenting and narrating my experience. 
---
This reads like a diary entry
---
I second the guide from frost.  Good basic info.
---
What if you view this from the context of separate to 
---
just for discussion sake. 
---
Ideally i would love for them to revert live on their next expansion. but that would include taking away things like LFG and flying. Not the mounts, just the flight. But i don't have any hopes that would fly. So i think maybe a WoW reboot, but i don't see how that would work now that classic is announced. 
---
I would be so happy if this made it in. Duels inside IF was one of my best memories of playing alliance in classic 
---
NA PVP if that‚Äôs what you were going for, yknow, aside from making me scared for my life, memories and sense of self...
---
I thought it was funny. +1
---
Gnomish Death Ray, world enlarger, battle chicken, Gnomish Goggles
---
(irrelevant) and ultrasafe transporter are bop or require gnomish eng. Dimensional Ripper, Goblin Dragon Gun, Bomb Dispenser, Mining Helmet, Construction Helmet are bop.
---
I know I'm an asshole, and I'm sorry in advance, but we as a policy remove posts that only relate to Classic WoW due to the post's title (Rule #7)... so I've removed this post.
---
Plz understand.
---
What the fuck lmao
---
Lol @ huntards. That's a title that brings me back.
---
Yours...Yours has a Dick?!
---
There are two BoP gnomish trinkets: gnomish death ray and battle chicken.
---
Then there are 2ish items that are BoE but only useable by gnomish engineering: gadgetzan porter and world enlarger.
---
The profession can be leveld for \~100g, sometimes 80, sometimes abit more. 
---
So two trinkets for 50g each while death ray can crit for 2.5-4k. 
---
Well, I experienced as a very common thing, but I'm sure your experience is more valid since you state it with so much confidence.
---
Thunder Bluff is the best city. Looks beautiful and all the important stuff (bank, crafters and AH) are all super close together and it's easy to move around that area.
---
UC has the AH in the middle ring, crafters are in the outer ring (and you waste a ton of time taking a long way around from point A to B because of how they designed the rings) while the bank is up a ramp in the inner ring, and the mailbox is up yet another ramp in the inner ring. It's also stupidly long to get into the city or leave the city if you aren't using a FP. 
---
UC is hard to learn because its a circle and all looks somewhat same-ish. That's where it comes from. Once you get used to it, it's like you say, relatively compact and convenient. 
---
Removed as Rule #7, bait/misleading post. It's fair to post this as a question/obvious guess, but not to make it seem like an announcement.
---
Idk why everyone is team herbalism. While you're leveling nost herbs go for basically vendor price while ores (epsecially early ores) can go for alot. I'd say at 60 max herbalism is slightly better then dme mining runs with a healer. But while leveling mining is definitely better, there's alot of herbs you're gonna pick that are gonna sell for peanuts.
---
I went to a 480, which sucked, I bought a 580 probably not a year later.
---
I've got one. I'm not sure I'll use it much, but it has been a lot of fun to flip through it from time-to-time.
---
I thought this was like... common knowledge, damn. No wonder so many people complain about having a tough time finding groups... probably just asked 1-2 times in Trade chat when their potential group mates are out in the world far away from any channels.
---
Those are some very acute observations you've pointed out. Is there somewhere particular where you learned to have an eye for this sort of thing?
---
They will put in correct formulas and coefficients so classes will be different. Balanced, no, but different especially from PS's. 
---
As a vanilla healer or caster of any type, mana starvation was a real problem. Potions and flasks were an absolute necessity if your guild was pushing into higher level content. Rolling those professions is a great alternative to buying off of the AH, and also a good way to make some gold. 
---
Do people not use their map? The doors and hallways are so big, I usually just leave my map up and hold right click/autorun to go to whichever quadrant, then close the map to talk to NPCs.
---
\*innocent warlock noises\*
---
Thanks! As far as I know priests are the go to healers(?), will there be any high demand for shaman healers? I guess more of a support role? Sorry for noob, I haven‚Äôt played in 10 years...
---
Druid healers tend to get full T1 in a couple weeks... since there are usually only one or two Druids in 40 man raids.
---
I've explored several of these fun little areas in Vanilla. I'd add Cutthroat Alley to that list of yours, as well as the "Outland" area hidden in the Deadmines.
---
People always dueled outside both. They didn't just duel outside IF, plenty of people were dueling at SW as well. 
---
\+1 for the velcro circle
---
The 1 place where Detect Invisibility came in handy IIRC. Shame the mobs had high shadow res. :(
---
Not really, no. You could easily outgear LFR before they even released it for the first WoD raid. It also had intentionally horrible trinkets and no set bonuses specifically so raiders DIDN'T feel compelled to run it. 
---
At most you run one difficulty under your end game once or twice, and LFR is completely skippable even for normal raiders. Heroic raiders can faceroll normal to fill in holes in their gear if they want, but it's optional. Mythic raiders generally raid Heroic to see the raid before Mythic drops and then sporadically or not at all or just to faceroll it and sell boosts. 
---
Even with gear forging it's not worth it to run normal because of how rarely you'll get anything decent from it. Even world first guilds don't do that, and they do everything they can to get an edge up, because it's not worth it. 
---
"Oh bollocks" indeed. I had a macro to target those fucks and nuke as soon as I saw the /yell. 
---
Hunter + Priest is an underrated, deadly combo. Me and my friend have tried a few duos, but this one was incredible. 
---
We could kite and heal endlessly. We once got ganked in STV @ level 40 by two skulls - one a rogue and one a warrior- we killed one and almost killed the other one before he vanished. Killing multiple players in our level range was easy. 
---
We also kited a level 60 rogue across desolace with concussive shot + aspect of the pack which was pretty hilarious 
---
They are extremely good at AoE tanking though. Doing massive pulls in strath and scholo for rune/orb farming is really nice. 
---
But tanking in general is really hard in vanilla. I'd actually argue that warrior tanking is harder than paladin, especially with more than 3-4 mobs. A paladin will just pop a max rank cons and keep up a rank 1 cons and mobs are glued to him. The dynamite into Holy Wrath pull is pretty good too. 
---
i basically played a spirit stamina warlock most of vanilla
---
good days, at least it made weapons fucking massive upgrades
---
Gnomish is way more fun ymmv
---
Multiplicative speed buffs do not work in 1.12 as far as I know, it just takes the strongest buff. Could be wrong tho
---
Spell batching is not a bug, it's a feature.
---
World bosses will not be kite-able, this was quickly fixed when people started doing it, as it was not intended for lord kazzak to end up in stormwind. 
---
Being able to go through doors with fear and polymorph will probably not exist either.
---
Trinkets are off GCD yes. However you can't use 2 active trinkets at once like you once could(which is where all the super OP mage clips comes from). It was fixed somewhere before 1.12.
---
Vael bomb should work.
---
Based on how much chaos hakkar blood was, I doubt it will be in the game, perhaps for a small day community event. 
---
I apparently have 58 hours in Witcher 3, and ultimately got bored and gave up on it lol.   It ultimately got too convoluted, too many side quests, I had difficulty keeping track of what the stories were which ended up causing me to totally lose interest.  If you don't get into it in 9 hours I don't really think waiting til 58 hours helps anything, I just wasn't really playing anything else at that time.  I became overwhelmed by the massiveness of the game.  It's just too much game for me lol.
---
But it's autumn already. I don't want to have to wait until December...
---
The dopamine rush from turning those quests in back to back to back cannot be understated.
---
I think I am actually going to roll a lock. The amount of abilities is really appealing. I feel like healing with priest in vanilla will be underwhelming. Downranking while more immersive sounds not as fun as just having more abilities/variation to use
---
oooor you could also just not totaly no life classic if it releases in summer? or join later, who cares?
---
why so many ppl hope for a LATER release is beyond me
---
group composition: 1 warrior tank, 1 priest healer, 1 warlock, 1 druid dps and 1 paladin dps
---
your challenge: defeat this walking death siren before it summons adds
---
Especially because of the stam. For PvP that thing is basically BiS until rank 10.
---
Hence, block
---
There are no roles, just classes. Each class fill a completely unique purpose. 
---
Won't be cross faction linked....
---
Look up madseasonshow on youtube. He has a lot of videos about classic covering many topics.
---
You underestimate the value of stamina.
---
Just please no more of the FPS drops I encountered because of my absolute potato PC ending up with me spending 45 mins falling into the trench and trying to get back out again. 
---
By a god damn thread
---
I'd rather a return to the "When it's done." Blizzard, than whatever we have now.
---
it's bis for pve as well
---
Good idea. Knowing more about the world before the game would definitely help on the immersion angle.
---
Shamans aren't really viable tanks. Or at least if they are then so are SL warlocks, or hunter pets. I mean sure you *could* do it, but it really doesn't work.
---
I'll believe it when i see a video of a shaman tank a dungeon and MC without any strange stuff going on or outrageous world buffs or flasks or any of that.
---
I mean a shadow priest tanked Onyxia, that doesn't make priests viable tanks.
---
Directly responding to a post with a post instead of a comment on the thread while providing information that you yourself point out is suspect because it's the retail version and not the classic version and we don't even know which version we'll get... 
---
This is the quality content I come here for!

As someone with social anxiety I hate this. I always feel pressured to run some crappy low level dungeon I have no interest in. I usually am able to decline but there was a few times I got baited into a bad group. Mainly only happened while leveling tho.
---
Rogue + Druid is the ultimate fun PvP duo IMO.
---
Can also do some amazing PvE together with stealth runs
---
do you have to be a gnomish engineer to use the BOPS?
---
That's not really necessary at all. Any combination of warlock/mage/hunter would be completely fine. Probably the only thing you can really say is rogue + warrior combo isn't super strong, but it's still not going to be really difficult or slow at all if you have two players who know what they're doing.  
---
As a healer, you don't need to change spec, really. You're pretty damn strong as a holy paladin in pvp.  
---
The good thing about Holy is, that you only need 20 points in holy for the efficient healing paladins are known for. You can spend more points to increase healing numbers (30/31 points), but it's not that necessary. So you have a lot of freedom in how you spend points.
---
I do my best
---
I assume that's why I am getting down voted. Some of us want both cakes and eat them too. So I don't want to fall behind in wow and I want to enjoy the summer air.   
---
But this all pails in comparison to just being realistic with blizzard, do you really expect them to be ready before July/August. Don't get your hopes up.  
---
Under promise over deliver
---
&gt; Haven't heard about this ever (and I started shortly before bc, damn).
---
That's interesting to hear. To me it felt like back then, at least through Wrath, everyone had seen this video and had an opinion on it. Maybe it's just my memory but I saw this video on the same level of infamy as leeroy and the onyxia wipe animation. I'm pretty sure it got a mention on G4TV once. 
---
I think over the years my opinion on the funeral crash probably flipped 3 or 4 times. Then eventually we all just stopped talking about it. 
---
Mining is the only source for Arcane Crystals, which have a wide variety of uses. Every class will need a handful of them for a quest turn-in when Naxx is out, for one of their T3 gear pieces. Additionally they are transmuted into Arcanite Bars, which is another requirement for additional quest turn-ins for additional pieces of T3 gear. Arcanite Bars are also used as a reagent for a boat load of epic items, such as Lionheart Helm and Force Reactive Disk just to name a few.
---
In short, there's plenty of money to be made with mining if you're dedicated enough to farm. Instance farming nodes there will be no competition since you're in an instance.
---
Just some food for thought, you can't go wrong either way.
---
The ilvl thing is discouraging in terms of BiS vs ilvl I usually am wearing tank / dps / pvp gear in my dps sets and my tank sets to get into higher dungeons or raids for raid LFR. Which are not difficult just require higher ilvl. They had attunements already a game system. But I guess this is the problem with aiming games at the widest possible audience fault.
---
 But with the Vanilla gear they still seem random at times lol there was definitely a lot of experimentation with gear and on hit weapons effects
---
mind control and chunk them off a bridge.
---
If you wanna top dps meters, you will want to use goblin sapper charges, so yes, it's BiS for pve as well.
---
It's really too bad they didn't pursue those ideas further.  Warlocks also have firestone that adds melee damage and have a pile of damage reduction talents; they could have created a melee spec for them as well.
---
Horde
---
Decent at soloing even better as a duo
---
Primarily world PvP and bgs 
---
No raiding
---
Trying to stay away from warrior/priest
---
Is there any other search functions?
---
It‚Äôs possible to get exalted before 40 but depends on patch. Teldrassil, Darkshore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains and Desolace should get you the rep you need through quests. If you don‚Äôt make it by 40 you‚Äôll be very close, and Feralas will seal the deal (mid to late 40s zone). DO NOT wait until 60, grinding cloth to turn is is much more tedious, time consuming and expensive than doing it along the way as you level.
---
Enchanting section recommends using enchanting mats from the start; most guides recommend leveling the first ~65 points in enchanting by disenchanting.  As someone who leveled enchanting in vanilla, I highly recommend getting points from DE until it turns grey.
---
Illegal Danish: Supersnacks
---
I was replying to Weaponsonline...clearly
---
Honestly they could take the DMC approach and remove a limiting mechanic like the stamina bar and boom easy mode just set everything to normal difficulty and it's done. 
---
fair fights are for suckers
---
Why would you level fishing?
---
What's a zoomer?

---
There are some BoP things too but it's only worth it if you REALLY want them. To be honest getting engineering to 300 2 times can be a huge pain.
---
If you are a completionist definitely go for it because it's very good for a long term goal.
---
MMOs don't exist in a vacuum, unlike single player games. 
---
There's this thing called a Social Totem Pole. People do compare their achievements off to one another, hence why we show off our mounts, armor, weapons, etc. 
---
There are two ways to go about it.
---
1. Go gnome and just buy the sapper charges from goblin engis. More expensive in the long run though.
---
2. Go gnome, craft all the gnome trinkets, unlearn engineering and then go goblin so you can craft your own sapper charges.
---
I couldn't ever complete Oblivion in any regard due to the leveling system.  It was overwhelming complex to optimize your levels, and if you didn't level up optimally the enemies became impossible to defeat causing me to have to start over.  I can only restart so many times before I get bored and stop.  Skyrim fixed it all with a more logical leveling system.  Morrowinds was broken like Oblivion's except Morrowind had ways to also break it further in your benefit, but they locked Oblivion down too much.  Caused me to be more focused on how I gained each level where I couldn't really much focus on anything else.
---
KJ explained that he told the guy who was doing the stat distribution on gear that every stat would be useful for every class so the stats guy kinda just went ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø and put a little bit of everything, on everything.
---
Besides it's kind of cool when cloth is usable for melee. It's kind of a double edged sword. You get more DPS stats, but you lose out on armor so you take more damage.
---
32 here... 6 kids... can't wait for Classic. 
---
&gt; high difficulty being their defining point is a design flaw
---
lol no, that is exactly what attracts the audience for those games, this statement couldn't be more wrong tbh
---
I think that's a great idea. I've probably played vanilla too much to qualify but good luck.
---
Sometimes people can't take a hint and will even harass you for not joining their group. It usually only happens at lower levels since this type of player doesn't stay long enough to make it to max but it does happen.
---
Another fun one is when someone gets ganked and they harass you over whisper for not coming to their defense.
---
Fav wow video of all time. Keep up the good work.
---
I never knew that was a thing, seems pretty crazy though!
---
yeah if you were flying over where you wanted to go you could cast blink and be teleported to the ground and cut your journey short!
---
Classic wasn't that "advanced".
---
It was simply a keyword search across the amalgamation of the words for the character.
---
So if your name was Abc, and your class was Def, and your location was Ghi, essentially when you wrote `/who Abc Def Ghi` and optionally the level so `1-60`, it would do a plain text search in the combined string of `AbcDefGhi`.
---
I like simple instructions.  Thank you!
---
Somehow I forgot all about this gem...thanks for reminding me and giving me the feels.
---
It gets better at level 70 :P
---
Jokes aside, I feel you.  Druid can be a lot of fun but you can't think in the mentality of "oh i'll play as a cat to level".  Druid design is around shifting in and out to perform roles. Hot yourself, shift into cat.  Pounce.. throw up a shred and rip, swap to bear form.. Pop out and use nature's grasp to root.  Then heal yourself and into bear form.. or go into travel form to run away.  Need to be a bit more creative as your toolkit is far more spread out than other classes.
---
But yes, you will kill faster in cat form from a pure DPS numbers wise.  And if you have the talent to gain energy when you shapeshift into cat then you can shapeshift in and out of cat to get energy to do more damage.. but this will eat into your mana at lower gear levels. 
---
Nice writeup
---
Dueling refers to same faction fights for fun and practice, not world PvP. Also for the launch of retail Ironforge was the only faction with an auction house and by the time they added AH to other cities people already were used to ironforge as the hub. 
---
It's fine to unwind with gaming, but for me, having my financial aspirations fully vested in my job and then gaming in my free time gave me no self actualization. I think you have to yearn for &amp; work towards something outside of your job to keep yourself "looking over the horizon", in a sense.
---
43 checking in.
---
Pumped for classic.
---
i will meet you outside the gates of IF with my troll shadow priest for some honorable cross-faction duels
---
The rate at which you'll gain dungeon xp is slow, but is also dependent on how good your tank is and how often your healer is out of mana.
---
Absolutely agree. I had a rogue friend who shared the account with family to get rank 14. I usually beat him in duals even in half blues as a tailor shadow priest (net helped a ton with rogues) 
---
By the same token there were players on the other faction we knew by name because of their legendary world PVP skills. One of them, a shadow priest named Zizek really validated my choice of a shadow priest. Guy knew the class so well (binding different ranks of dispel and dots for example to fakeout and drain me when battling). Mind you I‚Äôm pretty sure he achieved rank 14. He made some good videos if you are looking for shadow priest vanilla pvp content - everything from taking on full raids to 1v1.  
---
One of my favorite memories was battling Zizek in the lava pits of BRM, MCing each other off ledges, levitating when MC broke, then trying to time jumps so you didn‚Äôt take lava damage and getting in mind control battles when we made it to solid ground. Battles would last ages as we fought for the upper hand. 
---
It was my experience in vanilla that ages ranged from 10 to 55 in guilds I ran with... But that 16-25 male group was the most prevalent. 
---
Paired stealth classes could be a lot of fun, especially in PvP! There are even some bosses you can sneak to and take down.
---
Haha, I may have been the 0.0001% who just always missed people talking about it. Leeroy and sorts is well known to me tho, don't worry. 
---
I hope Classic provides some similar diamonds, even though (or especially because) times have changed significantly. Every day I get more excited
---
yeah, both scenarios is super lame. Those people go on my blacklist instantly
---
i remember basically resisting hammer of justice every time
---
No need to reset points if you are only upgrading things you want to keep. Ex. Armour. It will only make you pay the difference of the previous rank. 
---
You will need to reset if you want to train new things or redistribute points. 
---
Maybe those items were put in the game simply as vendor junk, ways to make some coin.
---
Hmm we seem to have very different ideas of good game design.
---
Boom! Nailed it.
---
Thank you i appreciate it.
---
If you're going horde than a shaman should really be one of your classes.  I see you don't want to do warrior again, but shaman can pair with anyone really. 
---
Competent heals and great group buffs
---
Wipe recovery with ankhs (will save a lot of time!)
---
can use/wear a wide array of gear
---
Can tank in small-scale PVE (non elites) very effectively
---
Shaman / druid will guaranteed get into any instance you want provided the druid knows how to tank a bit and the shaman is OK with healing.  But even if not, either class can DPS or heal very well.  It is very cool to be able to make your own instance groups- a friend and I would do this and purposely gather all the pre-quests and it was a very profitable way to maximize XP from the dungeon
---
So yeah.. if you're horde really one of you should be a shaman unless you really don't like the playstyle. 
---
Or, people can just pay attention.  If it comes down to saving the healer at the risk of a losing a nonobservant DPS, that DPS is going down.
---
This is not worth it. A blue item from level 25 to 35 is not going to be worth 50s to 1g.
---
However, you could make money by boosting a lvl29 twink a couple of times through gnomeregan. Or a lvl39 through SM. Make them pay 10-15g per run and loot every item they don't need + every cloth (silk sells pretty well iirc).
---
You might not have a lot of clients but once in a while, if there's someone who's interested and who has no friend willing to do it, you could run a business out of it I guess. 
---
I am fully down buddy, im going warrior. message me
---
Personally I go 2/2 Shadow Word Pain and 3-4/5 Shadow Focus. I PvPed a lot so this may change if you plan on raiding. I only had1 character(S.Priest) from Vanilla - WOTLK and I focused all of my time into it, it's a bad ass class if played properly. There is a lot of min/max info out now about the "meta" builds but take it all with a grain of salt. 
---
This isn't exactly what I use to run but it is pretty close. I think back in the day I use to run 2/2 Imp Vamp Embrace but I dunno if I'd do that again this time around. We will see. http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGR0bZZVMTtMtot 
---
Personally, the best music for WoW is the game music, and maybe WC 1-3 music.
---
Players really miss out on the character of an area without the in-game music. It's like watching Lord of the Rings but instead of Howard Shore's awesome score you have dubstep or something.
---
That said, if you're just grinding or doing some battlegrounds and want some high energy music to keep you going, I totally get it.
---
Nice work on the compilation.
---
Nice!  Just scooped up a used one from amazon.  Hoping that flipping through will give me something to do while waiting for launch.
---
Wow, I didn't even see your post untill now and I just finished posting almost the same thing with my master guide.
---
Really anything...  but if you want to maximize your time after the kids are asleep later in the game then a tank / healer combo might be best for filling in your group and only having to find 3 DPS. This way you wont have to "waste" as much time and if the kids wake up you are essentially in control of the speed of the dungeon too.
---
At the end of the day, ANY class can really hold their own if leveling solo. Some are just faster than others. What do you enjoy playing?  Ranged? Melee?  Sharing armor types can get annoying from dungeons but if you're just leveling most of what you'll get will be from quests.  Or just be happy that your wife got gear or she can be happy for you. 
---
You can also double damage if you want. Mage can kite a lot, so you can rogue for some extra control.  You on a PVE or PVP server?  You can bait people out as a mage while you sit stealthed collecting "free" XP while you get anyone who tries to gank you guys.   Or go Mage / warlock for ultimate AoE.  Or Mage / Paladin for buffs and heals, and you can tank or dps as the paladin while leveling and if you're doing 5 mans you could tank pally or just heal.. or if horde go shaman and drop totems to help.  
---
As many details as you gave, there's still quite a few options that fit your list.
---
Short version: I would look at Warrior (group-powered damage), Mage (Glass Cannon and Control), Paladin (if Alliance and wanting to be a strong healer with good support) and Shaman (if you're Horde and wanting to be a strong Support with good heals) 
---
Long version:
---
Warriors - Not a glass cannon in the squishy sense, but because they can be controlled so easily, and therefore, not great 1v1. But you said that doesn't bother you, and if you have somebody supporting you with dispels and heals, you'll be a wrecking ball. Never leveling alone is especially nice bonus for Warriors who struggle compared to other classes. If you're consistently playing with a group and want a high damage class, I always recommend Warriors. You may need to respec for PvE though.
---
Paladins - Holy paladins are the best healers in the game, in PvP and PvE. You didn't say if you were Horde or Alliance so this may not be an option. If you want to play an alliance healer, especially with a warrior in the group to freedom, Holy Paladin is a solid choice. Lots of support through blessings, heals, stuns, and 3 different bubbles to keep you alive. You probably won't have to respec for PvE too. Ret and Prot do not fit your criteria. Boring solo levelers so leveling with a group will mitigate that. 
---
Hunter - High skill cap class due to things like kiting, dead zone, trapping and CC'ing, timing abilities between shots, etc. They are almost impossible to escape from though. The fastest class to get to 60 in the game, to meet your rushing needs. You won't have to respec for PvE content if you're MM I believe. Hunters definitely need peeling if they get in trouble, but excellent hunters make it hard to get themselves in that position. I'd probably recommend Hunter if you don't want to be the same ranged damage class as somebody else and somebody else is already playing Mage.
---
Shaman - 30/0/21 Ele/Resto is an *excellent* support spec in PvP. You can DPS, or heal, or both at the same time. Whatever the situation calls for. I consider this spec more of a support spec than a dedicated healer spec for that reason. You will be using totems *a lot* but theyre extremely helpful whether its windfury, grounding, earthbind, etc. It's also a viable spec in PvE, as shamans aren't required to go far into resto to heal. Your DPS won't be anything of note until AQ--ish gear, and if you'll have to drink a good bit in PvP. Obviously not an option if you're Alliance.
---
Rogue - Because they're so much more lone wolf oriented, you probably want to consider Warrior over Rogue unless you want to ruthlessly hunt other players in solo PvP. In a group setting, they don't really bring anything to the party that the others don't.
---
Druid - While druids are the definition of versatility, I think in terms of support shamans and paladins still do it better. I don't think you would be thinking you're making an impact on this class as much as others. Insane flag runners though.
---
Priest - You said you didn't want to play priest.
---
Mage - Mages are truly solid in Classic. The only reason I would think a person wouldn't want to enjoy playing it is if they don't like that glass cannon type play where you are using constant control and kiting to keep yourself at a distance, but you said you were interested in that so Mage is a serious consideration. Strong damage, excellent control, high DPS, can AoE grind, strong in group and solo content, decently fast levelers with AoE grinding. Definitely your "glass cannon" choice without the nuances hunter has of the dead zone and managing a pet etc.
---
Warlock - While Warlocks are an excellent class in their own right, I don't know if it'll fit your needs. They're not glass cannon damage, and don't offer as much impact as a mage for example. SL locks are hella tanky and one of the best 1v1 specs in the game once geared, but that doesn't sound like what you're looking for. I think the reasons you would want to play Lock you would find a Mage can also do and possibly better.
---
yeah, things like the Death Ray, Shrink Ray, etc. are all learned from your specialist trainer after you do the Loyalty thing - and the items are BOP
---
the XL one is kinda unique because it's only able to be "Learned" by Goblin Engineers, but any Engineer over 265 can use the item, and I think just about anyone can pick up the recipe in BRD
---
FFS! FOCUS ALARM! 
---
Just blame the hunter
---
I agree!
---
You could druid / shaman so you could have a healer / tank setup for 5 mans and flag carry and healer for BGs.  and lots of heals / control for out in the world.  Windfury doesn't work with druids though so maybe warrior or rogue instead.  
---
Are you against the warrior or the priest part?  Or both?
---
Blue = Dead
---
from Horde perspective 
---
My leveling partner (who is a warlock) gets multiple whispers a day asking if he wants to run things. He always says no unless I can come too.  So far it's been great having a wingman.
---
Now I could link the results of the MANY hunter pet guides that came up after a Google search ... but it only makes me wonder why you didn't do it 1st?
---
My rule is kill all gnomes but leave all other Alliance races.
---
make sure you take a /bow for your services to both Horde and Alliance.
---
"the stats are completely random and don't matter"
---
You mean like in retail, where all of the gear is just the same "main stat + 2 secondary stat" things, and the differences between stats are so small that it's pretty much just "higher ilvl = upgrade" ?
---
Killing rogues on sight...
---
*laughs in rogue*
---
Why are the mobs always so *angry*? 
---
lol its kinda what happened to me I think at 9 hours. I think the last quest I did was helping some family member get back from the war and i was laughing my ass off because apparently this dude has been missing for a long time and i walked like 5 minutes from his house to find him hahah
---
&gt; 18 spirit is useless in pvp
---
...but 32 stam is incredibly useful in PvP.
---
You shouldn't just trash an item because it has one thing on it that you don't like.
---
Must be german
---
Brill is always my hearth. I have quick access to Org or UC.
---
And if I need to reach TB, I teleport to Moonglade and fly for free.
---
TB is my favorite because everything is in close proximity. I park my mules there.
---
It is a great game!
---
How is this even a question. Be a real man and make your woman happy. 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=22438
---
But that's T3. Having a level 54 BoE helmet with more stam than a T3 helmet, yeah that's pretty awesome.
---
The armor type bonus wasn't added until cata iirc.
---
July 16
---
When it's ready!
---
Geesus. Same here. Then the Swarm appears...
---
Definitely! I remember being 4th grade, at that time tbc came out. The summer holiday between 4th and 5th grade was crucial for my understanding of the language. I'm from Serbia and Serbian has nothing in common with English so most of the kids in class, including myself, had a hard time during English lessons. 
---
However once the summer was over, I came back to school speaking fluent English at the surprise of all my classmates. Everyone asked me why did I bother to go to English lessons during the summer and almost nobody believed me that WoW was actually what taught me.
---
The best thing is I knew some of the words even the teacher didn't know! I felt so smart when I asked the teacher 'What's a polearm?' and she had no idea lol. Good times, the brain of a child is truly a knowledge sponge!
---
Gen Z and late Milennials seems very nihilist.
---
There actually IS an explanation for that, believe it or not.
---
Early in development, Discipline Priest was intended to be a melee DPS spec, like a "monk" or something, and that's why early on in Westfall and such, you can find cloth gear with agi and str on it.
---
Hell, even past release, in early patches of vanilla, Inner Fire still granted a bonus to attack power.
---
lol i've seen that a lot too. Probably just cause of alliance vs horde and shamans and paladins being the most stark difference.
---
Along with that I kind of look at it like an Inquisitor or Grey Knight of the Imperium in 40k. Space Marines with daemonhammers and psychic abilities, etc. but in a fantasy setting. Not to discount Warrior Priests of Sigmar or anything...
---
And you could have made this comment on about 90% of the questions asked on the entirety of reddit, so it only makes me wonder why you chose to offer this incredible insight on this one in particular?
---
I don't think it's "on you" to cave in but I also don't think this is worse sacrificing the relationship. 
---
Do 1 week Night Elf &amp; Dwarf and 1 Week whatever you like amd whatever Horde you can convince her of. 
---
Taking a  passive-aggressive "fuck you" attitude is immature and harmful even though it's what I'd probably do. (I'm a real piece of shit sometimes and it's held me back. Working on it ) Just showing that your willing to work with her "should" get her to work with you. 
---
You also can't buy it from the AH
---
No mana -&gt; cant cast a spell -&gt; spirit regen kicks in-&gt; get faster mana than without spirit-&gt; cast stuff sooner.
---
It's already 7 days since the last update. It seems that they abandoned us :(
---
&gt; Agility provides dodge % to all classes
---
and melee/ranged weapon crit
---
I'm limiting myself to only playing 1 character, so I might as well maximize my engineering. 
---
Yup that is what I am saying. People in the west are preconditioned to like paladins. In the same way that Japanese people are conditioned to be drawn to the samurai. Obviously both are very cool so their is over lap. 
---
Wtf are you on about?  That dps needs to move.  They are not as important as the healer the mobs were going after.
---
Weapon skill is important at 60, you want it to be 300 ASAP. 
---
Warlock always sounded so cool to me, but I never got into the class. There's nothing wrong with it, it just didn't click for me. I also probably just played it really badly back in vanilla. From a class fantasy standpoint, warlock is a more interesting class than mage in my opinion. If you main a warlock you might want to avoid playing a mage as an alt. They're too similar in role and gear so you would probably enjoy trying a class that's different.
---
Shaman on the other hand is going to be my alt and may even take over as my main (I'm currently planning on holy priest as main and elemental shaman as alt). I think solo leveling a warlock will be easier and quicker than shaman, but shaman has more options about role and contribution to groups. In dungeons, they can melee DPS, ranged DPS, or heal. In raids, they're going to be healers initially but can switch to the DPS roles later on. 
---
I'd say watch some videos on classic on youtube to get some information and read the Life At 60 series on this sub. If you're attracted to warlock, play them. If you think shaman looks interesting, try it as an alt. Don't forget that you spend a ton of time with your characters in vanilla so you should focus on what you're going to have fun playing.
---
As will happen. Not everyone is always going to agree and I'm just simply offering up suggestions. 
---
Or you could do your actual job
---
&gt; You just need to hit defense soft cap.
---
Literally impossible for Shaman, as there is very little mail gear with +def on it. Besides, you don't need defense for 5mans, there is almost nothing in 5mans that crits very hard.
---
Saving this for updates, thanks
---
Yeah I remembered the exact video you mentioned, found it for you: https://youtu.be/2HFjPDRxyPs
---
I was asking specifically about the pet training part of it, I did Google and I couldn't find any guide that talks about which stats you should prioritize. If you found one that does I'd appreciate if you could link it
---
Wow I remember this from yesterday when it was posted!  And very day predating yesterday since Classic‚Äôs announcement!
---
Because we want 1.12, not retail capped at level 60.
---
No, the commands I wrote worked, yours did not in the vanilla client. 
---
Classic wow thus confirmed to have been cancelled :(
---
I also like that spot in the Barrens! As well as Thousand Needles by the raceway but I just happen to like hanging there
---
I should add that I'm personally on the fence for this. Some areas are very beautiful and capture the vanilla feel, while other tracks (Ashenvale or Stone Talon Mountains) are more war-torn, and the new tracks wouldn't fit well. I would likely toggle off the newer songs in zones like this. For most other zones, I would be happy to play with both old and new songs mixed. 
---
&gt;I know I'm gonna get flamed for this bc Vanilla was a perfect game beyond reproach and all its flaws made it better etc etc
---
You've started off on the wrong foot because this has never been the point of not wanting changes. You don't fix what isn't broken. Not broken doesn't mean perfect but why mess around with something that works?
---
I'm sure we could all come up with our own individual list of things we would improve in Vanilla. This creates two problems. One, everyone's list is going to be different. Someone's improvement may be completely game-breaking to someone else. Two, improvements are nice in theory but we don't actually know how the consequences in practice. What we do know is that we like Vanilla, as it was.
---
lol, i remember sitting in sw when these would happen. first time i ever saw one i tried to help. never again after that
---
Well the whole situation is kind of dumb. Really either the tank should pick up the adds or the dps should cc/tank/kill them as appropriate. If everyone is just derping around afk and lets the healer die than they‚Äôre all just bad. As a mage if you‚Äôre worried about nova getting someone gibbed you should just use CoC.
---
Thot based metrics have no influence over a wizard of my power level.
---
Millions of people played and enjoyed 100% broken classes?
---
The Grimtotem plateu's in Thousand Needles. 
---
A mage shouldnt worry about that.  The frost nova is the right move and gives the tank a chance to pick up the mobs.
---
There are no music files in the CASC file for anything after 1.12 (and there shouldn‚Äôt be). 
---
The scripts and music queues/strings for the updated music files  don‚Äôt exist on the 1.12 client and they would have to manually code each and every script. 
---
I loved when people tried to heal the Alliance leaders ;) 
---
It varies based on raid at 60, but for leveling IMO you don't need anything outside of abilites, armor, and stam in that order. I usually don't have the points to really put any significant ranks in anything past that anyway, and they're a lot more situational. 
---
[This list](http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-pet-skills/) is the best "guide" I've found, although some guides like Joana's will tell you when/where to go to keep your skills maxed. I just check the guide and mark out when I'll be in a convenient area to swap pets and learn the new ranks.
---
I'm secretly anticipating all the salty posts from retail players flooding classic and finding out that there is a very real difference between tanks, and DPS with aggro modifiers.
---
for preraid bis?
---
warrior if u can tank
---
If I see Alliance I will always attack. Only once though, camping is stupid. 
---
Oh yes! Thank you! Tried looking for it so many times without luck.
---
Main issue with elemental in raids is mana. Elemental is amazing burst DPS so they do really well in both PvP and dungeons. Enhancement gets a nod in raids because they can do some totem twisting to buff a melee part and still melee auto-hit the boss while elemental needs to spend time casting so they can't spend time replacing totems. The typical argument against elemental shaman is that they run out of mana and bring the same functionality as a resto shaman. 
---
That said, a casual raiding guild (of which there will be many) will probably take you. It won't be until much later in classic but that doesn't really matter. My guild in vanilla was just getting to ZG in the months leading up to tBC and we had a great time. I'm guessing that Classic in particular will have a ton of casual raiding guilds because there are so many of us that are older and have much less time to play than we did 14 years ago. 
---
The short answer: play what you want. Pretty much everything is viable enough to get into a casual raid as long as you're not in a hurry. Remember that raid content can be completed with less than 40 players, which means that anything filling those spots can be a bonus. Focus on finding the right guild and you'll be set.
---
I love the gnoll patch in hillsbrad but it isn't efficient, I just love the little farm next to the ruined houses and there is a chest spawn often because those gnolls are mini elites depending on your class and the pull.
---
What do you want to do? PvP? Dungeons? Raids? Farming? How hardcore?
---
Oh absolutely. I'll definitely be listening to and appreciating the soundtrack for the majority of my leveling and early raiding experience.
---
That said, it's nice to take a break so the game music stays fresh - hence the playlist!
---
mind u war tanks actually get tier pieces
---
dps wars dont at least for a long time
---
Vestments of the Shifting Sands from AQ20?
---
I love this vid.  I tried out WoW back in vanilla days for reasons just like this.  
---
I only played Counterstrike and other fps games.  I never really cared to try out anything else, ever thing else looked boring.  A couple of my brothers had just purchased and started playing WoW.  As I finished my cs game and I started watching over my brother's shoulder and asking questions (and talking trash) about what the heck he's doing (hiding behind some trees)
---
He explains that he is in this enemy (horde) zone and 
---
that our other brother is out by this dungeon  entrance/exit taunting enemy players so they attack him and flag themselves, then he would come out jump in the fight.  
---
They never took the bait, but this really peaked my interests and after about a million more questions about what pvp was how it worked and watching him join a few bg and get into some more world pvp I was in and hooked.
---
&gt; Druid healers tend to get full sets in a couple weeks... since there are usually only one or two Druids in 40 man raids.
---
yea druid tier is the nr 1 disenchanted epic
---
after that its hunters
---
16
---
Storm lizard area in Durotar is a fun one of mine, especially if you‚Äôve got skinning.  
---
I'm pretty sure the name, guild, zone, class, and race tags all existed in Vanilla. It would do a plain text search across all fields if you didn't include the tags.
---
I mean it was a good read and I have literally murdered people with frostnova through this method, same thing for mages running into nig packs of mobs and hitting nova before splatting down in the center of those mobs
---
nah
---
While I agree with you on using the nova, don‚Äôt discredit the power of whipping out your CoC.  You have to remember this is Vanilla, the reason CC is so important in the first place is because your tank literally can‚Äôt survive ‚Äújust picking everything up‚Äù most of the time.  It wasn‚Äôt until Wrath when CC stopped being needed in dungeons and the term, ‚ÄúWrath Baby‚Äù was born.
---
Right? There's a novel around how frost nova is bad in 1 particular situation if you are playing with really bad players.... like the worst players.
---
Why?
---
Viability is in the eye of the beholder. Viable for who? The hardcore raiding and PvP guild? Yeah, probably not. Other classes will outdamage Ret paladins and Holy Paladins can offer all the support Ret can along with heals.
---
Viable for you? Totally depends on what's important to you. If you want to be a vengeful crusader, no other spec is gonna come close. If class mechanics are important, ret is a lot of auto attacking, judging on CD, and rebuffing their seal every 30 seconds. It isn't a difficult spec to play, Blizzard even said they designed it that way in Vanilla, and so the price to pay for that is a small rotation and not as much damage as a rogue or warrior.
---
Ret paladins aren't the meta, so if that's really important to you, you'll have fun playing something that is, so don't worry! But if you don't care about the meta, then paladin is as viable as you want it to be. Don't worry about what other people say, because their definition of "viable" is entirely different than yours.
---
That's the cheaper and possibly longer version, not everyone has greens available or wants to wait for greens, but yeah that's a fair point I'll add that in there as a note.
---
That was fixed really really early on. I don‚Äôt expect them to unfix anything they fixed. 
---
I remember this, wow that was early they got rid of that.
---
Oh yeah people are going to rage so hard that their tanks suck when the open right away on mobs. Threat is a real issue in classic and people will need to learn quickly. Or shit post here and get shit on by all the veteran tanks.
---
Not gonna lie when classic got announced I picked up all the old Vanilla Brady guides from amazing.  Dungeon companion one was especially nice. 
---
Hillsbrad farms, trolls in STV, and the Zoram strand nagas are all really great. I like places where you can get some good wpvp too. Zoram especially is just packed with groups going to BFD and so on, easy to pick off a few stragglers and make their entire group wait, i love it.
---
Oh and obviously the pirates in Tanaris unless some mages hoards all of them.
---
If i want to chill out i'd go for hinterlands. Has some really nice areas with trolls or the blood elves at the hut up north can be fun too.
---
I always liked Desolace due to the relative lack of gankers and pretty consistent, nice grey drops from all the scorpions, basilisks and the like. Very grey, but very peaceful place to grind.
---
Even with the /who it was painfull to find a group.
---
I always immediately skip the first zone and head out to the lvl 5 mobs.  You can solo as any class but just barely.  Then you're ahead of the pack... just have to grind it out.
---
this is how i ffound groups all thru vanilla to wotlk
---
even on kronos 1-3 i could put together a group really fast because nobody knew how to get out there in /who and private message all possibly relevant classes to you, or even guilds
---
I have a copy of the Dungeon companion that I expect to get well used once the dungeon map system goes away.
---
No that would be pot smokers who stop to smoke, they definitely don't pop a suppository. He also didn't say #ALL #EVERY-LAST-ONE #BANDEVILLETTUCE
---
Take 2 steps back, take a deep breath, and just reread it. There are habits in every group that someone is going to be annoyed by.
---
The chill stoners and unacquainted can fuck right off my classic. They are super annoying to play with. Additionally they have made poor life choices.
---
Once the mage gets improved Blizzard they can 'tank' the big pulls in instances with big trash packs. Super handy to have a mage.
---
As long as $15/mo filters out a significant amount of the cookie cutter edge lords that lurk in every free corner of the web these days (and which are 100% less fun than stupid teenagers yelling your mom jokes were in vanilla), it should be much more mature than pservers.  Which is my biggest gripe against pservers.
---
Can you imagine a fog weather effect for Mulgore? If you're in TB, it's sunny, but you can't see the ground far below, just a thick cloud of mist throughout. 
---
Random thought. Sorry.
---
The only auction house was in Ironforge, thus it was essentially the capital so everyone was at Ironforge.
---
depends on what server u were on. it couldve been peaceful
---
Who cares?  What could you possibly do that's so secret?  One look at you and I can tell you like hentai porn... you're not surprising anyone.  They also already have the data you're so desperately trying to hide.
---
This. If you want a flexible affliction spec, talent Shadow Mastery / Ruin. In PvE, you'll curse, toss up corruption, and spam SB. On trash you can tab around and stack DoTs, but on single target you'll mostly spam SB.
---
I'm planning SM/Ruin early in raids (through MC/early BWL) then switching to Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin once my gear allows later in BWL through Naxx. Warlocks scale very well with gear and the extra 5% shadow dmg (for SB and Life Tap) slowly outweighs the DoT effectiveness. 
---
Source: Leveled 2 warlocks to 60 in vanilla and raided one through most of Naxx and TBC.
---
Herbalism / alchemy is sorta the classic combination for raiders because you need lots of consumables. But it isn't necessary if you aren't a hardcore raider. I always  prefer to take professions to craft my own gear; that just feels better to me. So you can go skinning / leatherworking (take dragonscale leatherworking for shaman gear). You'll be able to make a little bit of money by vendoring the leather and maybe a bit of money selling the gear you make. It isn't as profitable as herb/alch but you can still make good money. Frostadamus on youtube has some good guides for professions.
---
Defcamp and Kargoz are a couple of youtubers who do good guides for classes and they cover shaman really well. Defcamp will give you lots of details for how to play a shaman and Kargoz will give you good guides for leveling. Note that you don't *have* to play that way, but it's a good starting point to get some ideas for what you want to do. 
---
I'm finding tanks on pservers seem to really be threading the needle when it comes to healer mana on the next pull. I hope that changes in classic.
---
What I'm noticing is tanks seeing a half mana bar and thinking that's enough for the next pull. Well, that's true assuming we don't pull any others by accident or any patrols. And that the mage doesn't pull aggro turning himself into a clothy off-tank. Or the hunter isn't afk and the mobs die fast enough.
---
There's a lot that can go wrong in a single pull and having a full mana bar allows me to handle a few contingencies. If you want to pull the next group while I have half mana, you better hope nothing goes wrong or we all get to corpse run.
---
Personally I just found out the hard way lol. 2 friends and I were leveling, 1 was about to die and was on the run, I blinked in and Nova‚Äôd and almost instantly died, never did that again!
---
This actually does spark an interesting discussion, at least for me anyways. Those of you that are familiar with Runescape would know that back in the day (world 2) Falador was the main trading hub. When Old School Runescape came out, the majority of people flocked to Varrock to trade because it was closer to the starting area (Lumbridge) and was easier to access via a lower level magic requirement. Additionally, since the game had the Grand Exchange for so many years, more people were naturally used to going to Varrock despite it not yet having the GE.
---
There were posts like this exact one all over reddit trying to call for people to go back to Falador for trading, but it never really picked up. At first there were a few people constantly in both areas, however it was something like a 10-90% split which eventually became 100%.
---
With classic, most people might just be used to going outside stormwind as that is where dueling has traditionally been held for the last 12 or so years, even if Ironforge may be "better" or more "vanilla-esque" 
---
Speaking of raids they should add some kind of tool to find us raids.
---
The stats did matter. One of the interviews with the original team covered the "random" stats on items. They intentionally made items like that to see what kind of creative builds players could come up with. Sure, it's not "optimal" but following a guide and doing what everyone else tells you is not how I plan to play Classic.
---
The regular retail player goes crazy and wants that transmogg
---
psh
---
Especially if you play on the side without salvation. 
---
THIS ONES FOR YOU, THRALL
---
\** Raises hand \**  
---
2 kids, needy house, busy career... Lost interest during Wotlk though so I've been out of the world ^^of ^^warcraft  for awhile now; I'm used to it. Plan on taking a few days off at launch but after that, back to family and house.
---
I remember the first time I did gnomer nerfed and I was so so so sad. These guys deserve to be frightening. (Not to mention dark iron landmines).
---
wasnt this attack of the show? OG hosts (Adam, I think his name was) before Kevin and Oliva Munn, before it went downhill
---
right? i think i was quicker doing 50-60 than 40-50. late 30s and 40-50 was really tedious.
---
This actually hits far too close to home. I spent my mount money on a str 2h sword (playing hunter) from the AH because I thought it looked cool.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to make the same stupid decisions I made playing vanilla at 14.
---
Crossing my fingers for this. Would be great to see a coordinated effort to populate servers, instead of picking one and hoping it doesn't die. 
---

Suffixes?

Another interesting part of this box is that the background behind this image and the others on the other side is a screenshot from a very early version of Hellfire Peninsula.
---
lol thats awesome yeah especially since the internet was still in the awkward teenage years during that time and good information was still kinda hard to find.
---
PREACH, i mean you will have WF but it doesn't come up to being the same threat difference that salv provides.
---
i think the classic community will be very mature thats nice.
---
Ah yeah that makes sense. Hopefully this meant we won't have such a tank shortage this time.
---
Tbh, all of the balance tweaks that vanilla needed got fixed in BC. I think just releasing classic BC servers after a few years would be all the tweaks/additions needed. 
---
Same with shimmering flats (for alliance that is the whole zone), pretty much circle round the zone with all the quests then hand them in.
---
Of course you get ganked 10 times by the level 60 bodyguard that every horde seems to have
---
Disenchantment
---
Cool, I will definitely have to look at other builds with more points outside of holy. Thanks.
---
min/maxer answer : take the scarab lord account, sell it for 6k+ buy a R14 account and play on that , and then take the remainder of the money to go on real vacation for 2 weeks
---
If I wait til healers get full mana every single pull, the entire instance grinds to a halt. Then its the dps complaining that the tank goes too slow. Half mana should be plenty for a pull if your gear is half decent. If pull goes bad , pop your cds. Use mana pots. If the whole group has to wait for you  to drink every pull, you probably arent playing your class right/ healing inefficiently.
---
sorry, i didnt mean for that to come off that brash. I can smoke and play at the same time. 
---
&gt; show yourself
---
AN ILLUSION!
---
OH yeah i agree this is why i put out this PSA. People are too fast to blame the healer, i get it some people playing healer can be bad. Or even make mistakes but you really need to see how the run is going. A Healer shouldn't be forced to use a potion when you have high gear levels because you can't slow the fuck down and let them drink. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
---
Well I can't speak for others but for me personally a lot of it was just plain ignorance. I heard other people say that only warriors could tank and having never played a pally or druid myself, I assumed it was true. We'll be going into it with more knowledge this time so hopefully we'll see a better variety in tanks.
---
umm. looks like youre the only freaking out here bud..
---
incorrect
---
I played an alliance rogue with a warrior alt tank in vanilla. The amount of times people didn't wait for sunder was too damn high! 
---
The lowest effort...
---
I generally wouldn't actively kill an opposite faction member if they're in the middle of fighting mobs.  I might go over to them and prod around, maybe give them a little scare but probably won't actively engage.  Unless I'm feeling particularly evil or I have some grudge with the member.  I'd be more likely attack them immediately after they take care of the mob, even if they hadn't healed yet, though.  So if I stop in an obvious place and wait, better heal up FAST.  
---
yea this is pretty much what you had to do, and then also pray there were no other contenders against you
---
To my understanding there has been no word from blizzard if they will or not but they should / i hope they will. And no need to be sorry for asking a question.
---
Lupos will not do shadow damage, I believe that was changed in 1.10 
---
Brokentooth will still have a 1.0 AS.
---
First off tanking isnt a core part of your class. Warrior has three amazing specs, all that do wildly different things that are not forced onto eachother. You can play warrior for years and never tank, that isnt a key component of warrior... So stop making it out to be like a warrior that doesnt tank is less of a warrior...
---
It sounds like you'd enjoy priest or shaman. 
---
For priest, leveling as holy is actually about the same as leveling as shadow. The most efficient thing you can do is front-load a few spells, then wand until the mob dies. (This is efficient because you regen mana during combat instead of pausing to drink afterwards.) If those spells are mind blast + mind flay or holy fire + smite, you're still going to get the same results. Holy also lets you unlock Holy Nova which isn't really strong, but it lets you do some AOE farming when you're higher level. You can heal dungeons as shadow (at least until around level 50) without a problem as long as you keep a different set of healing gear. In PvP 1v1 shadow is really strong. Holy/discipline is a ton of fun in group PvP because healing completely changes the dynamic of group battles.
---
For shaman, leveling is a bit slower. It isn't horrible but they aren't the fastest solo levelers. However, elemental shamans are amazingly strong in PvP and in dungeons. They aren't great for raids because of the mana issues and the amount of time it takes to down a boss, but both PvP and dungeon fights are much shorter and the burst DPS is amazing. You can also heal dungeons as elemental if you need to fill that role. 
---
If your focus is PvP, elemental shaman might be the way to go. Amazing burst damage and a really good toolset.
---
Don't forget that vanilla is as much about the leveling process as it is about the end-game. I know people talk a lot about how to get to 60 quickly, but that's a relative term. The record for hitting 60 is somewhere close to 4 **days** /played. For most of us, it will take at least twice that if not considerably more. So your best bet is to find a class you enjoy *playing* and then just relax and enjoy the ride. 
---
People don't understand how hard tanking can be in vanilla or how easy it can be if you give me a couple of seconds.
---
What are these priest cd's you are referring to that I should "pop" when a pull goes bad? 
---
At 60 you'll likely have to heal in pve, and yes, shaman healers are definitely in demand.  You have chain heal, which is awesome for healing multiple targets, nature's swiftness into max rank healing wave is a *huge* instant heal that can save a tank and prevent a wipe, and everyone loves totems.
---
They're also pretty nice for leveling, they have some great looking tier sets, and imo have an awesome class fantasy.
---
Oh that's a really interesting point, I never considered whether they actually had upgrades in there. Didn't their T0 shoulders drop from the first optional gargoyle boss? I remember my MS warrior friend wanting to kill the gargoyle a lot.
---
Anyway I'll be tanking this time so I don't care if there aren't any upgrades. I'm with you, I LOVED Scholo and can't wait to go through the agony of tanking it! 
---
For some reason my server in vanilla abbreviated Dead Mines as VC, because Van Cleef.  It wasn‚Äôt until Wrath, when I started on a different server did I ever see anyone call it DM. It still throws me.
---
Spot on. SM/Ruin makes you very versitile, would recommend.
---
If you've got skinning and mining its a wonderful spot.
---
Druids can take Feline Swiftness and have +30% movement speed at level 21, so almost as fast as wolf but with the added bonus of stealth.
---
Sept 23rd, last day of summer. Confirmed.
---
Nah, Attack of the show was more of a talk show kind of thing iirc. It was a show with Adam and Morgan though.
---
The different is chosen communication. If some dude whispered you begging for gold and you said hey man dont whisper begging for gold thats rude. And they counter with "Bro its not a singleplayer game". Itd be silly, thats your argument. You just view begging for tanks/heals to be justifiable and gold begging not. Not everyone shares your view.  
---
Random whispering to join your group isnt a social aspect of wow, that is begging. You are asking somebody to come waste hours of there time (especially if they are even just a couple levels overleveled). Like you get shit xp for groups, if they are overleveled by 2-3 levels they probably dont need any of the gear, and now you are saying hey come waste your time and do work (tanking is harder than any other role... if you dont believe me do all 3 roles and lie to yourself saying it isnt...) and gain nothing from it. And people go thats annoying dont whisper me you hit them with a "ITS A SOCIAL GAME". Which yeah chosen social interaction is wonderful, random happenstance interaction is fine it can be great, singling out random people and whispering them over and over is just annoying spam.
---
ü§î
---
Unpopular opinion: I would like to see Blizzard finish the unfinished questlines, instance portals(azhara crater, southern winterspring, etc). It would be cool to add these things and Kara if they didn't drop any loot as to not mess with the "core" game.
---
Paladins for horde, shamans for alliance \*shudder\*
---
Gunna have to beat the September 13 Borderlands 3 launch tho.  
---
BE ZER SHIELD
---
Hows this looking?
---
This is a really good point! I hadn't though about the layout and scripting. 
---
I thought 2h shaman with windfury procs was very strong?
---
They could be interesting. They might also break balance again as they always managed to do since the dawn of time.
---
Hell yeah, that is exactly what I replaced it with. Helm of marv was the shit
---
Priests don't have many good abilities to pop. But, if you are undergeared and still having mana issues, I recommend looking into Lei of the Lilies.
---
Depends on patch and in what context. But it's definately viable in the right hands and place! 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sold on Narv tbh
---
Neither are Facebook, Instagram, snapchat, Netflix, reddit, Twitter, any other video game, or jerking off. So since you apparently have taken it upon yourself to fix other people's problems, go work on yourself. If needs actually want to no-life this game, your shitpost won't stop them.
---
In 5 mans I'd say that 5% should never make a difference. Something has to go very wrong for a holy paladin in healing gear to go oom in a 5 man fight.
---
Paladin t2 8pc was ridiculous pre nerf. It received 1:1 spell damage to actual damage. I isn't even have items like lokamir and I was chunking kids.  Nerfed pretty damn fast though 
---
Half Mana is definitely fine for regular dungeon pulls, and "threading the needle" is just fine if you're actually threading it - because that means it's working.
---
Same experience as a warr. Always got whispers asking for a tank while levelling. Ended up being dragged on so many runs that, in hindsight, I didn‚Äôt need to do, lol.
---
These kind of spam whispers are fucking annoying btw.
---
Only for guilds who manage to progress to the end of naxx. You don't normally see loatheb until late in the dungeon.
---
Play an undead rogue and gank her until she changes.
---
Total drink time won't reduce by pulling more aggressively.  If a priest needs to drink for 120 seconds to clear a part of an instance it doesn't matter if he drinks four times 30 seconds or eight times for 15 seconds.
---
All in all, pulling more deliberately and slowly usually is faster than overzealous pulling. It's not only the healer who needs mana. When mana-based DPS goes low, the DPS goes down, and then the healer needs more mana because mobs live longer.
---
&gt; Use mana pots.
---
What about don't pull prematurely?
---
&gt;  If the whole group has to wait for you to drink every pull,
---
No one talked about waiting for 60 seconds.
---
But really the best way is to talk with your healer. The need for Mana reg is very gear dependent. Better gear means means better HpM and higher MP5. 
---
Mana pot is about it =P
---
Downranking is very important tho.  I have a friend that made a priest on the most popular 'instant 60' pserver and he donated to get full t3 for his priest.  The guy goes OOM like crazy because he refuses to downrank and it drives me bananas.  He's in full Naxx gear and specced properly and he just spams max everything, going oom after 20-30 sec.  it hurts. 
---
As stated mining can be used in brd and whatnot.  Unless you plan to run around fighting over black lotus mining is better as you can farm arcane crystals. I think people are underestimating the popularity of engineering now that priv servers popularized it.
---
You can understandwhy it gets reported. You randomly whisper multiple people that is pretty similar to a gold spammer.
---
Cool! Thanks :)
---
Haha mine too, the fact I couldn't tell which you meant is probably why they did it as VC!
---
Totally agreed. As a druid, the lore surrounding the Emerald Dream fascinated me. 
---
Here's another quote from Malfurion that hints at the Emerald Dream being a major event:
---
&gt; **Keeper Remulos says:** It was shrouded in nightmares, Malfurion. What is happening in the [Dream](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Emerald_Dream)? What could cause such atrocities?  
---

I tried a Paladin first then a Warrior in vanilla and promptly went back to my Paladin after getting to a troll cave I couldn't solo, but knew I'd have no problem with a Paladin so stuck with that. Tried another Warrior later after getting my Pally to 60 and gave up around level 20. One of the things I've been looking forward to the most with Classic is getting the chance to give it another go and stick it out with warrior. I was always jealous of never getting a Quel'Serrar as a Pally as there was no point for me to have it. Can't wait to wield one finally as a Warrior in classic!
---
Except it's not a tiny significant detail as it's been fixed over a year ago.
---
I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs trolling üò∂ I‚Äôve never bought gold and never will
---
So that leaves your "solutions" limited to mana potions or "git gud".
---
Mana potion (useable level 22) restores on the top end 568 mana according to the tooltip. Heal rank 3 (best heal available to a priest limited to using level 22 mana pots) costs 255 mana. So your solution to a pull gone bad is to use my non existent cool downs and drink a potion that gives me 2 extra heal casts.
---
Sure, high rank heals are less mana efficient. But you're not going to stop people from dying by tossing renews and spamming down ranked spells when the pull goes to shit. And two big heals are not going to save the party either. Mana pots are for that last little sprint to the finish line, they're not innervate in a bottle.
---
This is the only way of doing it. Spamming chat in cities or towns takes so long.
---
Also would be nice if they finished off the class quests that they missed before (Shaman Call of Air, Druid Cat Form, and maybe something for Mage Portals involving Dalaran or something too.) 
---
i just finished a 800 hour req in runescape so i definitely know about the grind. You're 100% right though most of the joy i get from WOW is from leveling which is one of many reasons why classic really appeals to me. I was pretty convinced I was going to roll a lock but the more I think about pvp healing the more I want to give it a go.
---
Locks are reallly fun to level though. so hard to deciddddee
---
I'd say it's much less annoying for every tank/healer if you at least attempt to look for group members in general for a few minutes prior to messaging each individual member of a class. Spam once every couple minutes, get a few people filled so your group can help look through their friends/guilds/local areas. If after 5-10min you still haven't filled, then use the who list to message the last 1-2 people you actually need either by searching by level or class. It's  pretty obnoxious when someone goes straight to /who, spams all the tanks and healers, gets one or both, and then can't fill dps because they haven't even put out an indication that they are LFM. Putting in a little effort makes you much less annoying. You'll also be on less ignore lists in the future as a result, making finding group members easier.
---
Didn‚Äôt the Eranikus stuff get wrapped up in the Shifting Sands questline though? I mean yeah the quests were incomplete but the story was resolved.
---
Did you really have to spend this much text to say that rooted mobs will target the player in range with highest threat?
---
I never said pull the mobs when your whole group is OOM. If everyone else is ready to go and the priest is half mana, I am pulling. Unless this pull is really hard for some reason. 
---
And sometimes I do this and the healer literally has a fit and sits their drinking while I die. Like I have some obligation to let him finish drinking before I pull. I have rage to manage too and I don't want to wait for drinks and lose all my rage for literally no reason. 
---
Total drink time will be reduced by pulling more aggressively. You get all the mages OOM and they all drink at once. Instead of having just the priest drink for no reason. Also, pulling more aggressively gives me more threat and makes the mob take more dmg and die faster, thus saving your mana. 
---
Shamans are good they struggle with mana sometimes but they also bring Windfury totem and lots of other utility to groups big and small. As a warrior I personally love shamans in my group to smooth out the rage generation while tanking undergeared. You will probably have a fairly easy time getting a raid spot because windfury is just that good. 
---
Every combo works fine, it‚Äôs even pointless to bother yourselfs about it, just play what you want.
---
Well the way I worded it you'd still be able to use like, potions and elixirs and foods in raids because you could use them inside.  World buffs would get wiped away though.  Like I said a lot less hardcore players have made their way to this sub recently in anticipation of an official classic server so that opinion is more well received but the private server meta was kind of ruthless and horrible a few years ago.  People would race for server firsts and try to downing Naxx in like 8 months then jumping to a new server to do it again.
---
This happened to me for a Molten Core run. I was just chilling in Org on my Druid when a random guild messaged me. They needed a Druid and there weren't many 60 druids on. Two hours later I had three pieces of Tier 1. I miss those grassy shoulders on my Tauren. 
---
Couple of things: the advice you're going to get about what people accept into raiding is really just based on the hardcore and semi-hardcore raiders. Casual vanilla guilds are much more about the camaraderie than anything else and they will pretty much always take a guildie into a raid as long as the role you're playing fits. So make sure to take the advice about what you should play with a grain of salt. Remember in vanilla, you spend a ton of time with your character so it's much more important that you find something you'll have fun with than it is to min-max (unless that's what you enjoy). Also remember there's a big difference between PvE dungeons and raids. 
---
That said, I'll give you my thoughts on the healing options:
---
- Priest. Defacto healer in PvE. Disc/Holy is a lot of fun in PvP and the dispel magic ability is really strong. Shadow is good DPS in PvE as well, both in dungeons and in raids. Though the raid utility in having multiple shadow priests is limited, so the typical preference is a single shadow priest. 
---
- Druid. Good healers in PvP and pretty tough because of the animal forms (cat stealth to stay out of combat until needed, bear to stay alive when being targeted by physical damage, travel form to run away if overwhelmed). They can spread their HoTs out over lots of people, which is really annoying to fight against. Their DPS specs in PvE scenarios aren't as strong. Moonkin is consistently bottom tier damage even in dungeons (though they can be fun to play). Feral DPS can be competitive even if they aren't top tier, but they're a little tricky (power-shifting takes some getting used to). Feral tanking is a good way to go with PvE; they can easily tank dungeons and can be a useful off-tank for raids.
---
- Shaman. Good group heals in PvP and some fun utility with their many totems. Chain heal is the only smart heal in the game (when it bounces, it actively targets lower health allies and it isn't limited to your party). Elemental DPS is really bursty and is amazing in PvP and in dungeons. It's not as great in raids because of the mana issues, but enhancement shaman are useful for melee parties in raids if you can get comfortable with totem twisting. They won't be top DPS, but they'll make a good individual contribution and will increase the overall raid DPS. 
---
- Paladin. Never spent time with them, but I can tell you a few things. They're really defensive healers in PvP due to the plate and their buffs. They're great single-target healers, so in small group PvP they're amazing. Less so in really big battles. Ret DPS definitely isn't amazing, but you might have fun with it. Tanking in PvE is ... fine? They don't do great damage, so their threat generation isn't really good and they don't have a taunt. 
---
Yes. If you need to do this, I'd recommend Voicemeeter Banana, though you'll get pretty bad (ok, really bad) audio latency unless you have devices that support ASIO. ASIO can cut the latency down to 10-20 ms or even less, which isn't too bad.
---
Disagree with the not dropping loot. However it solves the problem regarding "loot becomes to strong" or the "Having 2 diffrent kind of vanilla servers is a bad thing"
---
However doing this also makes it less interesting to join the new content, since it's quite oppesite to what vanilla's philosophy is.
---
Would rather have another option that solves the above issues rather then creating a new one :p
---
Like what everyone else said, when you pull the entire pack goes to the puller, therefore you want the tank to pull first so he has aggro from the start.
---
That's what alts are for! I'm going to roll a holy priest as main and then an elemental shaman alt.
---
Or I might do the shaman as main and priest alt.
---
Maybe I'll just switch back and forth.
---
Damn ...
---
I'm sure they won't add it back in but being able to duel inside Ironforge again in front of the bank would be fun
---
What kind of moron says 'who cares' to privacy and then has some kind of weird hentai porn projection? If you really don't care and have got nothing to hide why don't you post all of your mail and social media logins so we can all have a good read then? 
---
cant you just NOT watch the vidoes, and it wouldnt effect you?
---
I remember being 6 and my dad coming home with that box.
---
Well, to be fair, he shot while mobs were incoming and broke my LoS pull. 
---
Mages are very at AoE farming which you can start doing as early as the early 20s I think, but not every area is ideal and it can be inefficient if there's a lot of competition for mobs. They're also a very popular class at 60 so it can be hard to find a spot sometimes, though mages are very solid all throughout classic in both PvE and PvP. That's why they're so popular.
---
Have you considered hunter? Pet class like warlock and considered to be generally the easiest and most efficient leveler. It sounds like casters and magic is more your cup of tea though.
---
So, as a healer (paladin) who has also tanked.  I disagree with some of these points.
---
If I pull a single instance mob while my healer is at full mana and I die.  Its definitely the healers fault regardless of the cooldowns i decide to use or not use.
---
Also you have to live in gnomergan
---
well dont watch the youtuber, and just watch the 20 sec trailer. why watch it if you dont find any need to?
---
I actually agree with everything you say here. Good tanks either have good mitigation or pop a early cd at the start of a fight and allow me to drink from 50 to 80 or 90% before joining the fight. A good tank will not be half dead at that point and I can toss efficient heals. Bad tanks will be half dead and I have to burn expensive heals to bring them back to a safe health % thus negating all that extra drinking I did.
---
Similar to the dps managing threat and watching for additional pulls, it works best when everyone works together doing their part. But my original point was that if something goes wrong, I'll need more than half my mana bar to help correct it.
---
maybe one day we will feel 100% satisfied XD
---
If you mean raids, then probably what everyone here is saying.
---
If that were true we wouldn't be so hyped about playing a 14-year-old game ...
---
Yeah, I would be that priest too and let you die. Tanks are harder to come by then healers, but I don't play with tanks who think they can overrule the priest on "when is the priest ready".  Your description of someone "having a fit" is so contrary to the spirit of a cooperative game that that would be enough to not group with you again.
---
And why would the mage not drink when the healer drinks? Mages have unlimited water. If there's a pause and you're below 90%, you drink. At least that's what I did. Seems reasonable.
---
And what's about "all the mages"? Are we talking about a group of 3 mages, a heal and a tank? Well, if there's 4 mana users there, maybe listen to them.
---
Same lol
---
Yes I agree. But invariably something goes wrong and when it does my half mana is unlikely to cut it.
---
What makes you say only offtank?
---
Totally agree, I think they should do that in Classic but I fear too much time has passed
---
I mean its been a while since I tanked a dungeon with crappy gear, so you might just have weak tanks that are pulling too fast. Its entirely possible. 
---
But I have had issues where a paladin literally watches me die while he is at 75% mana and says "I was drinking". |
---
Ultimately everyone needs to work together. I am not scared that we are going to pull an extra pack and wipe because of your mana level. I have TONS of cooldowns of my own to fix the bad pull. Last Stand, Lifegiving Gem, Shield Wall, AoE Taunt, Whipper Root, Health Potion, Bandage, AoE Fear, Piercing Howl. I am ready to use all these to make the dungeon go faster.
---
if you think ilvl means more than stats on retail you either A. don't play retail or B. play retail and are really really bad.
---
The month is still young!
---
:S. I don't know why we are talking about level 22 items. Are you observing this issue at very low levels?
---
You knew about the Gnomer teleporter in STV from the goblin town right? :)
---
I remember speccing double trap/w-sting just to solo CC the Drakk fight in UBRS for attunement runs. I was shit damage but there was never a lack of CC. 
---
I made endless runs for my guild and our sister guild for weeks to get everyone into BWL. I had one job and I did it well.
---
But I was still called a Huntard and kicked from Strat runs.
---
Those were truly better times.
---
&gt; Explain strength on any piece of cloth armor.
---
Paladins.
---
Stop trying to force changes that were in the game originally and just YouTube the soundtracks
---
Stormwind on retail is the main hub, Ironforge was the old hub.
---
Stormwind got revamped to be more geographically centered (with portals and such landing/stemming from). But also because of the layout of Stormwind got revamped to have a bank and AH in close proximity.
---
But in classic, you will be using Ironforge as your hub.
---
My original vanilla char was a hunter. Going priest this time.
---
Nope, but I enjoyed writing it!
---
Verbing weirds language 
---
Rouge 1st?
---
[https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok](https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok)
---
Fair enough
---
This is super interesting. I should be more a lore nut for Classic. I just tend to try and catch up on things current. It's cool to see that the Emerald Nightmare from Legion straight up correlated with quests &amp; rumors in Vanilla! 
---
This is what I'd like to see:
---
After Naxx, release WotlK without the "QoL" additions TBC &amp; WotlK brought to the game. During Wrath as the first expansion, they include new things from the original world such as the Emerald Nightmare raid. There's no reason to revamp Kalimdor and EK entirely, when you can tie things up one at a time later! "threats" to Azeroth aren't always going to be from a single source. No reason to put all hands on deck through a portal into space!
---
Yes, but when I finally reached the GMs they explicitly told me that using /who and asking several people at once if they wanted to come to an instance (within the correct level bracket) was spamming and thus a bannable offence. I used no automation expect ctrl+c and ctrl+v. They really were killjoys.
---
Still makes it immensely shitty
---
I believe you're right! It's an incredibly long quest, I'm wondering why they didn't connect it with the "Essence of Eranikus" quest
---
You are the one setting up the premise of being a priest and lvl 22. In general, 100% mana before every pull is better than 50% but being more risky can make runs smoother, even including the increased chance of wiping.
---
Loved vanilla priest(all specs) and have hated it since they changed shadow. I plan on playing priest again
---
Solo tribute it is possible they will nerf tbh. It was absolutely broken in a bad way.
---
Arms warriors are NOT overpowered. You watched some shitty pvp montage that doesn't show how strong they are. Warriors are literally mortal strike bots in proper premade pvp.
---
I used to use this a lot as well. Would need to be patient though. When I was in a hurry to form a group, I wouldn't wait long for replies, and then get 3 or 4 people going 'yeah sounds good' when we only had one spot to fill. 
---
I also remember getting a lot of 'sure. btw how did you find me??' 
---
I was originally an alliance hunter and mage.  Now I'm probably doing horde warlock or druid.  So not only changing up class but changing entire faction. 
---
This makes zero sense. How does using swipe to tank cause me to spend more of a healers mana?
---
Yes there's Furor. Without the hat it's not sufficient rage to shout or swipe without also hitting a mob first.
---
I'm really not sure what your point is here.
---
???? I know how much mana you need to heal this pull. My job is to pull the mobs and get through the instance. Your job is to heal people and get through the instance. I have played with tons of priests who can heal just fine when I pull and you are at half or 75% mana. Then there is always some rare scrub that has to be "ready" with 100% mana per pull. I think I am actually quite good at waiting for people's mana and making sure they are ready. 
---
"Tanks are harder to come by then healers, but I don't play with tanks who think they can overrule the priest on "when is the priest ready"."
---
So what, you want me to ask you if you are ready every pull?
---
Played a Mage during vanilla.
---
Plan on having at least 3 level 60s.
---
Warrior - Prot
---
Priest - Holy
---
Rouge - PvP
---
&gt;sexual intimacy
---
Don't make me go full incel on you.
---
It is an example. It happens to be an example freshest in my memory because I'm currently healing dungeons on a pserver in my 20s. Since this thread and OP is referring to tanking and healing in general, then circumstances applicable to the discussion includes a tank and healer in their 20s, not just BRD and strat runs.
---
&gt;millions
---
Didn't they dip to around 1 million active subs?
---
If you've done all dungeons and you've read that I keep saying I don't consider leveling content relevant to this discussion, why are you consistently bringing up leveling content?
---
I'll go back to the very beginning of the discussion and you can try to take it from there, without using arguments based on leveling content this time. Here's my original point: Paladins are not "very capable" tanks at level 60. They are, at most, doable.
---
Yeah I have spent countless hours on the horde side, maybe I should take the leap to the alliance. 
---
That's really cool to hear. Thanks for that. 
---
Not all nouns can be verbed. Only the really verby ones.
---
Depends on the class tbh. For my Paladin, ilvl is always king because of the increased primary stats = more dps. Every ilvl upgrade is a dps upgrade, simple as. Doesn't matter if it's haste/crit getting replaced by Versa/Mastery. For my shadow priest, this can differ.
---
Ilvl is king in almost every situation in retail.
---
I would still wear a backwoods helm over it, honestly. But 32 stam is a shitload
---
Classic releases at patch 1.12, long after the AQ event. I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre going to just have AQ opened from the beginning.
---
And your specific example doesn‚Äôt negate the general point. Yes, there are exceptions to everything. Believing otherwise would be asinine.
---
Id rather wipe once or twice than wait 30 secs before each pull. It doesn't need to be lightning fast. It really adds up and can add half an hour to a run.
---
Mage Rogue
---
Well, I am not chain pulling mobs in deadmines at level 20. Your tanks probably shouldn't do that . Its quite a bit different when you are literally wearing grey/white gear.
---
I agree, I‚Äôd take the increased chance of wiping over the the assures prolonged run.
---
Add this one to the list: The sword seems to have procced (fireball hitting yeti), but the yeti is still full hp :P
---
Years + not even knowing, and assuming that it will not be a thing anyway.
---
THEY ADDED A BIT AFTER ELWYNN!? Well I know what I'm doing now!!!
---
"Good tanks either have good mitigation or pop a early cd at the start of a fight and allow me to drink from 50 to 80 or 90% before joining the fight. "
---
Yes, I am observing tanks pulling at 50% mana in mid level dungeons. I don't see why the discussion should be limited to only certain level brackets when OP was offering advice to wannabe tanks. I would hope by the time tanks are running UBRS they know how to consider all aspects of a pull including healer mana, patrols, and their dps members' threat generation.
---
I've always rolled preost, but I actually think I'm gonna roll a druid this time around
---
I thought only the intro music changed? Used to be Yesterday by the Beatles, the rest was exactly as I remember.
---
Blizzard explicitly stated they intended The Emerald Dream to be a 40-player raid in Classic. They even began building the zone. However, during Vanilla they scrapped the plan entirely because they did not want to venture down that path lore-wise/expansion wise.  
---
During one particular PTR cycle in Classic you could actually access The Emerald Dream raid.  
---
Here's a screenshot: photobucket.com/user/Congelatore  
---
That healer who let's a tank die due to drinking should be banned from all healing classes imo. It's like breaking the hippocratic oath! If we had a healers guild his membership card should be torn up.
---
As long as the loot is worse than AQ40 gear, I'd be okay with that.
---
That's not an unpopular opinion but I guess that's the trend 
---
Go the humor route. Show her the classics like Zynwrath:the movie, and Illegal Danish.
---
Or even some fun pvp videos like world of roguecraft 3, 2, and 1.
---
Cap it all off with Southpark : Make love not warcraft.
---
These are showcases of community and what the world means to all of us who come from that era. The reason we have been with it for so long and why we pine for the simpler days.
---
Exactly. You don‚Äôt need to wait for full mana when doing end game dungeons. Different story when tanks are way more squishy and the mana pool contains fewer casts.
---
Wait... when were they ever cross faction linked? Is that the case now?
---
Just let blizzard implement a dungeon browser which is not crossrealm and does not have a queue. Like: just select what you want to do, like you can do today in retail, and let people sign up for that.
---
I honestly do not see an issue there.
---
There's no point shifting for energy at least until you have furor and the helm so you're talking lvl 45 at the earliest.
---
Yes please. Make at least one RP PvP servers from the start or don't bother.
---
Wow i read right through that "and the stats are completely random" is my brain editing sentences before I can process it? 
---
Frustratingly annoying?  You must have a super easy life. Ignoring and a hard no both work
---
Scarab Lord all the way.
---
You wouldn't use it as a taunt. It would just be part of your normal rotation for generating threat.
---
The closest thing you would have to taunt is an assist macro to BoP the person who pulled aggro.
---
I would tend to agree with you with one caveat; while all classes are balanced, not all talent trees are anywhere near balanced. 
---
Balance, Elemental, Retribution, Demonology, Beast Mastery. All are good examples (though not a complete list) of specs that were basically garbage in classic. 
---
ur not trve kvlt sry
---
I did main a Or. Warrior in Vanilla, but this time I'll be leveling a paladin with my partner who is also leveling a paladin.
---
IF you got a lv60 paladin or frost mage do it. Just fir fast killing. Just remember looting takes longer Then the kill. 
---
You could always tell how the group was going to go by that first pull where you had to cc and burn the right targets. If it was a wipe I would usually leave the group 
---
All of OP's points are irrelevant to raid tanking because the post is a PSA for people who don't know if they would be able to tank in vanilla. No one accidentally becomes a tank in raids. All his tips would be basic knowledge to any tank long before they step foot in onyxia's lair.
---
When did they ask to make noise?
---
/who warrior 6-9 
---
Returns all warriors level 6 7 8 9 in your faction
---
You've never played the Stranglethorn Fever version? Boy are you in for a treat!
---
It's legit for sure. But there are better items to spend limited gold on.
---
Did you ever get to kill Onyxia? Or Ghaz'rilla?
---
If you're having trouble killing things around lvl 10-15 in bear form i don't know what to say, except maybe you're just trying to do quests/npcs that are 2-3 levels higher than you. Stick to same level and you should crush most things with bear form at that level.  
---
Cat form is very underwhelming when you first get it. You don't have pounce or ferocious bite, tiger's fury is useless. I don't think you even get rake for a little while. It's not really until lvl 40 once you get some good talents and skills it starts feeling ok.
---
Same here: always played human pala, but now I'm gonna switch to horde warlock. Did a transfer to horde during late Cata though, but the game was all different by then.
---
Of course! Like 30mins ago! hahahaha
---
perhaps but the thread is about when does it get better and that does improve it.  but yeah it takes awhile to get there. 
---
I never intended the idea be adopted that you should let a healer die in the stead of a dps. My intention was to illustrate that in scenario where a frost nova is used while mobs are near one of your party members, then you're basically forcing aggro onto that person, who certainly is ill equipped to handle it and will die in a heartbeat. There's a chance that there are other tools at your parties disposal to win the fight that won't result in an immediate death.  
---
The end statement was indeed a tongue in cheek remark. I thought the tone of the whole write up would express that =).
---
This topic has already been discussed pretty extensively. The general consensus was, ‚Äú#nochanges.‚Äù People playing classic aren‚Äôt looking to regrind in seasons. They want an end game in sight so they can min/max characters or do whatever they want at max level. Sorry mate.
---
I've also been curious about this question.  I understand that training rank 4 means 1-3 will be included, thus it's a better use of your points.  However, as you level, you're not going to want to wait for 10-20 levels to train that rank.  
---
Is there a method to the madness?  E.g. train rank 2 and wait until rank 4?  Or just train each rank as you level and then reset the points at a certain level so you can just purchase the max rank?  I think it depends on the cost of respeccing the Pet Talents.
---
In my opinion, the priority should be armor &gt; stam &gt; nature &gt; fire/shadow.  As for ranks, I've always maximized armor and used the leftovers in the order mentioned from a leveling point of view.  Would love to hear what the community says!
---
What's your favorite part/boss?
---
I hope I can experience this soon.
---
PURE. ALLIANCE. DUNGEONS.
---
Hey, i played a prot paladin at one point in vanilla.  In fact, i think the character is still in retail and is still wearing actual level 60 lightforge.  His name was Riker on Chromaggus server.  I don't think they suck, but they do have a significant lack of threat unless you are tanking undead, as i recall.  By the time you get to raid, you are expected to heal, Just like shamans.
---
(which is too bad, because i really liked playing Ret pally or Ele shaman.)
---
So this will be the case in classic??
---
Dont forget the yeti Doesnt Show his lvl( Never saw a sign like this) and he is infight and can charge atleast he cant use Skills without rage.. xD
---
its not dungeon run selling as in boosting like you know it from retail.. there is just a huge tank shortage in vanilla, so tanks offer their services for a fee. this was always a thing.
---
This is how the "2500 player cap" narrative was constructed back in the day. An addon that would run /who with specific searches to calculate the # of players. Though the number is not particularly accurate, because there is a limit on queries per minute and it only returns the top 50. 
---
It is not though. 
---
Just as you said people don‚Äôt wait for healer mana in mid level dungeons you will be surprised what tanks know and don‚Äôt know. 
---
In any case if the tank pulls at 50% and it is a wipe then they know the healer can‚Äôt handle it for the next pull of same difficulty. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt like an issue, really. Tanks and healers who complements each other well will probably team up again.
---
Those who don‚Äôt probably won‚Äôt.
---
What exactly makes the blue dungeon sets ‚Äúgarage‚Äù?
---
I would literally die if Classic launches anywhere near BL3 
---
do you know what episode?  I just discovered that Podcast and i would like to listen to that episode.
---
What makes you want to play Classic, just wondering since you never played retail? 
---
Always played rogue and hunter mains. I plan on a Druid first then a mage and finally wrap up my third 60 with another rogue because I love them. Also rolling horde this time instead of alliance 
---
Lol. A permadeath server would get nowhere. There would be no tanks as there is no way a warrior would get to 60 without a death.   
---
Or if you do make it to 60, then say have a server outage mid raid. Oops. You dead.
---
Just a reminder to people who are running to other starting zones if you rez this will still damage your gear regardless of it being in your bag. 
---
Sounds like a shit server :D 
---
Happens, that's the life of illegal private servers
---
Hello mate!
---
Your 2 is a good pick. But keep mining until the majority of the server reaches Pre Raid Bis(warriors).
---
Early phase vanilla mining is verry good because people are gearing up and not focusing that much on spending gold on pots. 
---
Later on mining will go down and herbing will be verry much profitable. Engineering is always a win, it‚Äôs verry good for all dps classes for both pvp and pve(sapper charges).
---
Maimed paladin on Alliance over raiding and war on horde PvP  
---
I will main a war again
---
No it‚Äôs not because there‚Äôs already a plan for the welps that includes aoe but there‚Äôs very limited space in ony and casters need to sorta stand in the same space. Plus fear moves people around a bit so it‚Äôs just waaaaaay easier to tell the mage bros to just not do that 
---
To this day it still baffles me that people treat me like some sort of 300iq 4D thinking mad wizard when I tell them this strategy. 
---
Organized raids will have more spots for mages because they are good DPS. That's not going to change.
---
If you roll a mage you will have more people to roll/bid against. If you roll a druid or hunter you might just not get a raid spot at all.
---
In the end, the answer is to play whatever class you like and just not worry about this stuff.
---
This and the shades in Strat UD remind me of all the times our only ranged dps was a hunter who sure wasn't fucking paying attention 
---
10/10, would wipe again 
---
When I wad younger my uncle passed away and he was the only way for me to play wow. It took a  year after he died for me to get my first computer to play in BC, and I would just sit and look at this picture and read the manual trying to decide what class I wanted to play. I'd look at this shit every day and watch the cinematic a couple times a week lol. 
---
As well as all characters with warrior in their name level 6 7 8 9 i believe
---
They're both good but farming mats is pretty boring. I prefer skinning.
---
Shadow Priest from Day 1 launch until the day I die. 
---
Always roll hunter, getting easy gold at 60 makes leveling alts wayyy nicer  
---
after about two weeks past launch there will be plenty of 60's who can help twink your alt with a fiery weapon enchantment or big bags in exchange for gold. 
---
I've always loved MMOs, but not many good/popular ones have come out in recent years. I wanted to try retail but there was so much to learn and understand that it kind of pushed me away, especially considering I was playing on my own. Now I've got a guild who are gonna help me learn everything in classic, and they've helped me choose a class and spec (purely from class fantasy and role picking obviously), also, considering I was like 2 or 3 when original vanilla WoW came out I never got to experience what people call the best MMO of all time so I've decided to give it a shot.
---
Will probably be an addon for that, don't worry.
---
You realize you can modify the game files and change specific tracks in the game to play whatever you want?
---
Who would you say is more bursty, Rogue or Hunter? Watching PvP videos is tough since they are always critical strikes and always using cooldowns. 
---
is this also working as a healer?
---
Is there ‚Äún-‚Äú for name?
---
At that point I just type /who name. I honestly can‚Äôt recall if placing the name in brackets makes it search for an exact match. I rarely used the function for that. 
---
Plate is always the easiest even in today‚Äôs wow due to the fact that only two classes use it. So it goes plate-mail-leather=cloth
---
While his statement is stupid it still is subjective. However, I agree with what most people say here. Most gaming journalists don't even seem to be gamers themselves. But! Don't crucify us all guys. There are still some us who try to write and report on actual important subjects;-) 
---
Indeed it is
---
Signature of an early vanilla item is excessive spirit and no green + stats.
---
I've never been talking about the difficulty of the pull. I'm trying to make the point that mana = crisis management. Less healer mana means less flexibility if something goes wrong. It's not my concern if people prefer repair bills and corpse runs in exchange for faster pulls. Cloth is cheap to repair. I've been in those pugs where we finish a no death run and everyone is like 'wow good group'. Often times there were a few instances where things got hairy but the group persevered because the tank held threat, I was able to focus all heals on the tank, and the dps melted faces. I dunno about others, but I love a no death full clear. Maybe others put more focus on time to clear which is fine.
---
What i'm most worried about when it comes to tanking in vanilla is not  the mana percentage of the healer, it's the DPS not giving the tank enough time. As threat in retail and classic cannot be compared, it's a different game when it comes to tanking. 
---
So if you're planning on tanking, be prepared to let your DPS know that you need those seconds at the start of a pull. 
---
Letting them kill the mob and heal up before, as to give myself a challenge instead of a cheap kill. Nothing to learn from a gank at 40% HP.
---
or C. was doing content where it didn't matter IE dungeons which are a run thru.
---
Sorry to be the noob. PTO is what exactly?
---
I don‚Äôt remember seeing it much for healers, but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if a small server had a shortage of healers.
---
It wasn't that I liked the instance so much, but I farmed SK a LOT in the hopes there would drop a Shadowfang. It was by far the best and most wanted item for some lvl 19 twinks. It would sell for an insane amount of gold at the ending of vanilla and even more during TBC. But regrettably, it never dropped for me... If I would get my hands on one now, I'll just make myself a rogue twink and pown the s**t out of everybody I come across with in WSG (-:
---
Played TBC -&gt; Wrath and just recently played a little bit up to lvl 92 Blood Elf Warlock but it wasn't the same so I've stopped to wait for classic. I had a 30ish BELF Rogue, and a BELF 70 priest. So I'm going full human rogue this time üòä
---
Now in retail /who doesn't even work properly with all the sharding and server bullshit.  This is one thing I used a lot back in the day.  Also if your in Westfall for DM /who human Xlevel - Xlevel as humans tended to stick to their own area when NE's would be on the other continent.
---
If you have herbalism you can stealth through Maraudon and pick all the ghost mushrooms.
---
Anything not min/max approved is complete garbage.
---
yeah i thought you could, but it is impossible to hit 440 defense.  I was wrong.
---
you can get pretty high with just trinkets/rings/neck/back/shield and a few defense pieces of mail, but you dont want to sacrifice other pieces that give you better avoidance or high stamina.  Also, Hand of Edward the Odd is the preferred weapon for shaman tanks as well because of the insta heal or chain lightning.
---
&gt;coming Summer 2004
---
Soo... Nov. 23 release date confirmed for classic as well?
---
Private servers only.
---
That minimap tip...yeah, you can zoom out just far enough to be no help whatsoever, or you can zoom far enough to see that rabbit on the ground next to you.
---
Yeah. I mean if classic is released in June I‚Äôm still taking time away to play BL3. If they‚Äôre even remotely close I won‚Äôt even resub until I get my BL fix.
---
I don't ever see a downside to AoE rooting.... It buys time, for a tank to build threat, or for you and others to get another form of CC out... If a rDPS or a healer for that matter dies to mob that's frost novaed, I don't want to be in that group.
---
I have a lot of time played on a mage, my main. The only time nova isn't a good option that I can think of is when you use it and it breaks another form of CC, like a poly u might have casted earlier. But that's easily fixed by recasting poly on the novaed mob...
---
One other situation, mobs are running to the tank  and as they are running by the healer you frost nova, if there are a lot of lobs, or they hit really hard, or they daze/stun, that healer might be dead before they can move. 
---
Respectable loyalty.
---
Paid Time Off... many of us WoW vanilla fiends are well into our 30's-40's now and got jobs...

Yes there is, [look here for options on who.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/MACRO_who)

I‚Äôm 25 and own my own business. I can completely understand this. I saw a post about a guild called ‚ÄúDads of Azeroth‚Äù (my wife is 6 months pregnant) I feel like I will be joining in on that lol
---
!remindme 3 months 
---
It will be hilarious seeing people try cope with cc being a thing again. 
---
I‚Äôm tempted to roll a tank, because I know I can do it well, but I‚Äôm not going to be able to raid so there‚Äôs not much point.
---
But I still default to moon - sheep, square - trap, star - sap.
---
I don‚Äôt think many retail players will share my mindset.
---
I don't really see why you'd want to take people in BWL who are struggling with ubrs...
---
Since launch I have been 100% Horde and 80% tank. This time I am switch to heals and Alliance.
---
I think for tanks it‚Äôs being ok with that play style. You‚Äôll always do the worse dps, besides heals. And if you are doing your job there is nothing spectacular to look at or think about. And if you wipe, most folks blame you partially or fully. It‚Äôs a lot of pressure especially if a 40 man breaks up cus you are having an off night, or just a lot of lag, and can‚Äôt get the mechanics down. And then 39 people think you‚Äôre a noob. 
---
We all hear about tanks being prigs but I feel like most didn‚Äôt start that way. It‚Äôs the thankless, soul sucking of sky high expectations and the realization if you don‚Äôt do it well, everybody fails...
---
Loot wouldn't have to be better, just different. Fill in the gaps, add new resist sets etc, you could have dream be mostly "nature t3" with similar gear levels. Naxx t3 would be great for doing it, but dream t3 would be best and vice versa. I always thought that'd be a great way of adding content laterally.
---
I'm interested to see if there will be a change in the general attitude of the community on official classic servers compared to Pservers.
---
I'm sure all the old veterans from back in the day are going to be mature enough not to be toxic... but I'll wait and see for the results when it comes to the (possibly) younger modern wow players and people joining from other games (like OSRS etc).
---
Look at any caster set none of them have spell damage. For the amount of work required to get them there is much better items
---
Unless you mean the typo i am a Realtor and use garage in almost every description lol
---
This is a bit of a deviation from OP, but along the unfinished stories, wasnt there dalaran, a big mage city encompassed by a dome that wasnt ever accessible? Im not one to dig deep in WoW lore, so if someone could give me the TL:DR version of this, or tell me that my memories or incorrect, much appreciated.
---
ah ha, ty
---
Servers are going to be larger than pservers most likely, and naxx isnt as intense as recent raids in retail, it was challenging when people didn't know what they were doing. Regardless, gravemoss will be valuable at the start and will be more valuable as demand increases from naxx.
---
Weird try hard types think that using the mouse only is superior cause they saw a meme arena streamer so it once
---
If you do D can you also stop my parents from kissing at said dance? I wanna fade away 
---
The important thing is that the stats were only randomly generated ONCE. So when that Helm of Narv dropped it was the same one that every other Hunter had. You felt great that you got a purple item instead of feeling bad that it didn't roll with a socket or Titan Forging.
---
THANKS, MOM
---
If somebody really wanted to, I would imagine they could map strafe left/right to mouse buttons or something.
---
Shut the fuck up dude
---
Healing plate/mail (Resto Shaman/Holy Paladin).
---
We get high?
---
Ah. I was mistaken on which show had the WoW thing i was talking about earlier though, it was indeed on Cheat.
---
Well yeah with a post like yours, you have opened yourself up to criticism by not stating why you believe IF is superior to SW. That's why you got the hate. 
---
For me personally idc where you alliance scum duel. (JK about the scum part all in good fun don't hate)
---
For the horde.
---
I'm going with a fresh perspective.
---
All of us watching this sub waiting for release date news**
---
I run a little agency.
---
I feel like the release of this game will destroy my company
---
Started NE Hunter but switched to priest when BWL came out.
---
Going to roll NE hunter main with Warlock alt to duo level with my Paladin wife.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a struggle. It was just faster to have one cc‚Äôer who knew what to do than stop and explain the fight every time.  Some times you were running alts or off speced characters because you already had a tank and healer and all that was available tonight were the ot and such to get attuned.  
---
The term is about the nameplate colour, hostile player names are red, no matter the faction 
---
It will probably still be in SW because of onyxia buff and PvP vendor.
---
Nope, all classes and races are set in stone. 
---
Started with gnome rogue, going Tauren shaman this time around. 
---
This is true but, if you are a guilds MT, you aren't farming that yourself. Unless you are in some patchwork garbage guild. Your tank having TF is basically required for any guild that wants to be a good progression guild.
---
But slowing down a bit could be the difference between the healer having to drink after every pull and the healer not having to drink at all. 
---
Especially if you're making the healer stop drinking to heal at 75% mana each pull and there's no mage in the group for free water. 
---
A lot of end game pvpers will use ‚ÄúS‚Äù as a combat key. Eradicating the ability to ‚Äúbackpedal‚Äù or go backwards. Because I guess it‚Äôs bad? So you hold down both mouse buttons, spinning around like a total idiot while spamming space bar and 123123123133123
---
I don't remember needing to type z- or c-
---
I feel you homie. I already want to buy a laptop for when I‚Äôm just chilling in the back waiting for someone to come in.
---
I own a tea shop so it‚Äôs pretty low key for the most part. Older people with their moms and dads coming in for a light lunch and some nice organic tea. 
---
My point is investment wise it will take time to mature. Better off investing in something with a quicker return, like heart of fire as everyone will be spamming brd. I have a whole spreadsheet of investments, of course :&gt;
---
I work on my property and on my YouTube page and thats it. I don't usually play during the day, because kids. But come launch.........
---
have the sheep go after the mobs are engaged so the mage doesnt get swarmed, your taunt resists, he dies, and then things go wrong fast
---
All I saw was the guild name in the title and immediately got taken back to when this happened. 
---
given how much more understanding and favorable people have been toward bear druids and dual wield tanks, yeah
---
he means porting over pieces of gameplay code necessary for the running of the game over to the new code base where they had been removed because the systems were no longer required.
---
Possibly that would help from the fatigue of sleeping 2 hours a night for the first week.....or it might just send you to sleep!
---
BRD aoe most likely, if all you want is raw vendor gold. Classes like warriors better off grinding mobs for greys/cloth.
---
Hunters &amp; Maura come to mind. Of course thorium + arcane crystals / rare herbs.
---
Yeah, that date would be good. I think in the backs of all of our minds, we are waiting for the push back into spring (I'm in Australia)
---
As a warrior that ran around begging mages for int, it is not a useless stat at all 
---
...that's not what meta refers to
---
They could release a new t1, t2, and t3. They could also fill in blanks, adding raids inbetween the current raids like ZG and AQ40. The new raids could fill in slots that certain under developed specs didn't have. The new shaman tier gear could be focused on melee/tanking shaman while the warlock tier buffed pets, etc, etc. Make certain specs and builds more viable by adding lateral gear upgrades that target classes and specs underutilised due to bad itemization.
---
Kargoz just did an hour long Livestream on it. Made Paladin Warlock sound absolutely insane.
---
So you've lived long enough to become the villian. Alliance scum.
---
I tanked BFD as warlock, it was a lot smoother than the average pug tank.
---
Atleast his heart is in the right place lul
---
Given the fact that we knew little back then and that psvrs are actually not a mirror of vanilla back in 2005~ I think we might see meta changes to some degree. I estimate IF there are meta changes they are small, but who knows.
---
I was 13-15, I lied and told everyone I was 18.
---
The multiple "asshats, probably haters from Retail" are likely being meta and downvoting your post to emulate the supposed person you're complaining about. Downvote copycats if you will, not haters..
---
Warrior/Shaman is pretty beast. 
---
you can even get away with going mostly offense with the Shaman too.
---
Even in dungeons if you are with the right crew, 5 dps specs with 2 (like shadow priest ele shaman) being able to patch heal can wrecking ball stuff.
---
Ouch :(
---
Are you telling me I can‚Äôt role monk? That sucks man I really like their tier 1
---
A different flavor of asshat
---
Grave moss drops from the 25 ish zombies. Well the worms that spawn from them. My point is not that you invest and hold on to it, but that should influence where you grind based on what point in the patch cycle it is.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd rather the game come out later than still have issues. Still, I hope July 16 is enough time to get it all straighten out.
---
Planning on doing this myself as a human paladin which presents a few extra challenges, main one being there are no paladin trainers in Darnassus. So I've learned it's best to set the hearthstone to IF before going plus grabbing the flight paths there and menathil harbor so it's easy to get back and forth for training. This really only applies if you're planning on going paladin, mage, or warlock since the other classes can train in Darnassus. Still not sure if it's faster to run through the wetlands or swim up the coast from westfall to menethil. Leaning towards swimming now especially if you're able to drown yourself as soon as you hit wetlands territory and rez at the harbor graveyard but haven't tested it yet.
---
Find a place you like to farm, create your own way, hope it doesn't get contested...
---
Nearly anything in classic made you gold. Thing is, the most 'effective' methods became the most contested methods (Black Lotus mafia)
---
Thus for a normal player those most 'effective' methods aren't actually effective at all.
---
The reason DM was so effective was because it was uncontested... So pre-DM, if you find a spot that makes you reasonable gold, and is uncontested, go for it.
---
I remember often doing Felcloth farming in Felwood, unless there were people there... Then I would go skin Adolescent Whelplings in Swamp of Sorrows... Their Green Whelp Scales were required for Enchant Gloves - Skinning... Making them decent ish to farm...
---
If that was occupied I'd sometimes go kill Sky Shadows in Deadwind pass (they drop Ironfeathers and Vibrant Plumed at a reasonable rate)
---
But those were my personal farming spots, I had more if I felt like doing something else for once... Once again, pretty much anything made you decent gold...
---
Yes. As others have stated, not only is the playerbase coming with more understanding of mechanics (by and large) but we are going to see a slight shift no matter how close they try to get it to pure 1.12 as possible. 
---
Networks and server hardware will give a slight difference on some things. It might be small in most cases but I a sure players will find a way to best utilize some of the new technical freedoms, or hurdles, that we will face.
---
If people stick with what they claim they are going to play, rogues are 3rd. Classic is shaping up to be World of Warriorcraft.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs optimal to have no strafe or movement options. I use strafe on A and D, W for moving forward and S is open as keybind. Some classes require strafing like hunters for example. But it only really matters a lot in PvP scenarios. You could move with your mouse only if you wanted to.
---
Exactly the same for me.
---
Hunter turning priest.
---
PTSD of not getting into groups. LOL
---
100% it will change. Somethings are the way they are not because they are optimal but, because people get bigoted. They see pro's who are making one thing work and assume its the only thing that will work. Or that the pro's have discovered all the optimal strategy's.
---
 For instance tips had a R14 ret paladin on from actual classic. Who was explaining how difficult it was for him to rank with people. Not because his Pally couldn't replace one of the warriors but because introducing him to the team. Meant they had to learn the strengths and weaknesses of a Ret Paladin. Most people are unwilling to learn new things. 
---
While I think its bad if someone is just down voting stuff.. I know I hate that crap, using words like "Probably haters from Retail" is more than likely why?
---
Please lets be one community and not two sides.. Everyone wants it to succeed!!
---
Spirit is actually a pretty good stat in vanilla. Even for warriors. If you get enough of it, it reduces your downtime while walking from mob to mob while leveling considerably. The biggest factor to leveling is not your TTK (time to kill), but rather the time it takes to engage in combat. Anything reducing the time to engage is a huge xp boost.
---
However for raiding or anything other than leveling, its a pretty dead stat. But hunters benefit from it much more than rogues or warriors, because of their mana regen.
---
I would go on official forums demanding blue posts about it.
---
Should check out Frostradamus on youtube. In the very early game, like people who hit 60 the first week, are going to be vendoring mats - leather/ores/herbs - and grey items. The other 2 in this thread are saying thorium, arcane crystals, rare, herbs, cloth, etc. but those will not be selling in the very early game, because no one will have money to buy them. There will be no real market for trade goods for a few weeks at least. Even when there is a viable market for trade goods you will be better off killing mobs and grabbing the nodes when you see them I'd say.
---
It might be back just by virtue of the data, it wasn't a systemic change that fixed it and they aren't going to go back in and re-fix it.
---
Q and E
---
Hunters are more about sustained damage because they will fire off more shots during a fight. A Rogue has to put more work into getting to a target and then sticking to it, but the payoff is greater.
---
Exactly why I‚Äôm going priest. Just watch the chat for ‚Äúneed healer for ____‚Äù
---
Welcome aboard!
---
Unpopular Opinion
---
I'd be interested in some Vanilla WoW getting the same treatment as OSRS with some updates here or there. 
---
Shit... I just bought 3 of them!
---
Funny meme and half right.  Itemization was seemingly random and poorly thought out by the devs at times; but I'd argue with such a low stat pool at the time, ANY stat was worth more.  Especially at lower levels. (I.e. a single stat point was more impactful)
---
I'd imagine the first thing people are going to look into are the proper prox rate and spell coef of currently unknown item procs and some skills.
---
I absolutely can frosee people discovering something that was never documented during vanilla or was wrongly guessed on private servers and people running wild with the concept.
---
The way homie gear started, it was actually a blue set. Then once season 1 came out it became epic. So you will have options. But the honor grind is tough. If I were you with taking your time. PvP as you level just to get that extra umph when you hit 60. Just my opinion. Might not be the best option 
---
So jumping in the air, spinning around and attacking, and then landing face-forward makes you an idiot in WoW?  
---
Easy HKs for ranking :p
---
dude i swear I always remember him as mankirk too /u/dhoraks89 !
---
1.12 technically. 
---
No official word yet on where pvp gear comes into play. Personally I‚Äôd love if it was in sooner rather than later but probably on the 2nd content piece, or in between the first two. 
---
Also literally just following joana for horde at least is more than enough.
---
BIS for Shaman tanking actually 
---
As much as I want everyone to get along I feel like the large majority of the retail playerbase hates us. 
---
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?!
---
The man has a tattoo of welcome aboard...
---
a little of both I assume...
---
They haven't announced the pvp situation yet, but there might not be honor full stop at launch, let alone honor gear, either way you'll need a bit of time to level and a bit more time to pick up your dungeon pre raid BIS before the honor system kicks in. 
---
I re-bind W and R to strafe left/right. I don't have forward/back keys other than my arrow keys I rarely touch.
---
With mouse turning all you need is strafing, which I think is Q/E by default? I don't remember. You don't really need a backpedal button since the mouse is faster than keyboard turning and you can strafe in the same direction without "you must be facing your target to attack" spam.
---
I don't think it's as big a jump in efficiency as people make it out to be. I just re-bound the buttons so I can access all my keybinds with one hand more easily and free up a couple extra keys for abilities instead.
---
I think so, I also think at some point down the line, Blizzard will implement some minor class balance changes, especially if some specs start to become completely neglected. 
---
I use okl; (lefty)
---
There are a couple choices.
---
* Zygor, who has said as soon as they have the API and beta access will see if they can port.
---
* Duggi, who .. I have no idea, cant find any info.
---
* AAP, which I hope gets updated.
---
* Original TourGuide ported to new API (If that can happen)
---
* Quest Helper (would LOVE to see this updated)
---
If you do use a guide or a addon that helps point the way, don't forget to try and get the lore in as best you can. You cheat yourself on the richness of story if you just click click kill click click.
---
As someone that spends way too much time on this sub, I'm always amused how quickly things get downvoted.
---
For the record, I *don't* think this is retail players downvoting for the hell of it. No evidence behind this, but damn, that'd be beyond petty and ultimately super pointless. My guess is that it's a rogue (Rogue?) r/classicwow mod that gets alerts every time a new post pops up...
---
I was thinking "Play The Objective".
---
Something I wish my fellow Alliance would more of, instead of derping around in the middle of AB, accomplishing precisely fuck all when the Horde has 3-4 flags.
---
From what I remember though blue gear was still good and could be bis in vanilla. I didn‚Äôt have a clue what I was doing in vanilla and only hit max level just after tbc dropped so I didn‚Äôt get to experience the grind.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to insult anyone. Relax. 
---
Ironforge is BiS
---
Ok, was that set any good for shadow priests?
---
Or should I be aiming for the felcloth set or something?
---
bUt tHoSe rEtAiL RaTs aRe TrYiNg To RuIn CLaSsIc!!!1!
---
This "us vs them" bullshit is getting old.
---
Hah these are both of my level 85s. Solid choices friend. 
---
I was 10 years old and got to 58 before Bc dropped. So I honestly am right there with ya
---
Lots of mention of DM for your reasoning when it's going to be at least 3-4 months out from launch. I'm not even going to consider DM farming information on my frost character.
---
I don't care if you're insulting anyone. It just appears that you seem to have something against jump shots in WoW. And it almost sounds like you're trying to make the case that back pedaling is somehow just as good. Particularly with this bit:  
---
&gt; Because I guess it‚Äôs bad?  
---
Followed by the comparative description of jump shots.  
---
I think one of the most valuable skills as a tank is group awareness. Being aware when your healer/dps are drinking or when someone is about to accidentally ninja pull are lifesavers in their own right.
---
If you always check your group is ready before you pull (at least visually you don't have to always ask) then you'll have a much better time.
---
Actually when I play rogue that‚Äôs exactly how I play. Sorry I came off offensive. I was asking in a question in a sense of ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter for all people‚Äù I know back peddling is bad. I‚Äôve watched plenty of videos proving it. Sorry again for making you upset.
---
I dont think it offends him, and I fully understand the annoyance of this. There will be youtubers that make a video on this. This one simple statement. That literally gives us no information at all. They will spend 10+ minutes rambling about it but really saying nothing. Its just bad content, and a lot of the content creators for classic do this sort of thing. It most certainly is annoying and lazy content. 
---
Yeh. I know. Dat moment when....
---
...you‚Äôve bought arcane spell power stuff for your arcane Mage and realise that it doesn‚Äôt effect arcane missiles or anything except your wand... 
---
üôÑ

You see. I don't feel that. 
---
I am sorry if anyone said or did something to you that made you think that.

I myself ride the line between the two worlds. I am a player who started in vanilla, yet my moral compass would never allow me to play on a private server. Also I am not against everything in live wow. That being said, I also havnt played in over 2 months, and that is after maxing every class but 1 to 120. Its the grind that gets to you and I long for the older, less trivial days.
---
I truly dont think a large majority hate you. If anything I have seen over the years is Blizzard fans are Blizzard fans. 
---
As a current retail player who played in Vanilla, and will no doubt dabble again on release - this. 
---
I'd love to see what they originally planned. However if they diverged from the actual expansion path what they've effectively done is created a second "retail" version of the game. Now they have to manage Retail, Classic, and Classic Plus. 
---
But hey, they were resistant to Classic for years until we persevered. So maybe if we lean on this hard enough we'll get it.
---
You are like ALWAYS on here man!! What gives?  ;-)
---
The game the journalist is talking about (Sekiro), wouldn't be "ruined" by an easy mode though.
---
I platinumed the game several days ago, and until I discovered the trick of holding block and quickly releasing and tapping it again to parry, I was really disliking the core mechanic of the game. The harder bosses require relentless aggression with basically zero mistakes, if you're not holding block. Once someone clued me in that you could do that, the game instantly became 10x more forgiving.
---
Holding block when trying to parry is essentially the easy mode of Sekiro. It's the equivalent of shield-turtling in a Souls game.
---
I don't see what harm adding an easy mode, where enemies do half as much damage or something could do.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **5th Cakeday** TribeOnAQuest! ^(hug)
---
Yeah, tanks should be letting their rage drop down to zero before the next pull just because you don't know how to manage your mana correctly and it is possible one of the dps could do something wrong.
---
Most of these examples are the exact opposite of garbage.
---
Balance/Resto is a very strong build for raid healing as druids, often called Moonglow spec and is used in PvP as well, especially with additional points in Balance to get 5/5 for Starfall, while still getting Nature's swiftness for additional burst damage/healing etc.
---
Ele/Resto is a very versataile PvP spec for Shamans and commonly used for that. It has similarities to the druids Balance/Resto spec as it also gets the 21 points in resto to get an instant cast buff.
---
Ret Pallies don't seem to do well in PvE raiding and are exploitable in PvP (dispell). I give you that one.
---
Demonology has 2 extremely strong specs: For PvE raiding the DS/Ruin is the strongest scaling spec for Warlocks because the Succubus sacrifice buff scales with gear unlike Shadow Mastery. SL Warlock is one of the most survivable PvP specs and is likely the strongest dueling specs for Warlocks.
---
Beast Mastery provides the highest DPS for Hunters in pre-raid equipment and is also a very strong PvP spec. It is also the most powerful leveling spec for them.
---
Soupa....you play a rogue... Are you trying to tell us something? 
---
Yellow if it doesn't come out of my meager PTO budget.
---
Yeah, tbh i made another comment about this at some point.
---
My best idea was quite similar.
---
Bassicly after classic is fully launched (nax done etc)
---
If blizzard sees profit in classic, they could start releasing new servers that will, the things they intended to have in classic but never managed too. While still having nax as the last or second last raid. So they would maybe add Kara after BWL and Hyjal after AQ etc etc. There is a lot of things they never got to add which they could do.
---
I played on a pserver with some custom patches that replaced in-game models with their updated counterparts where relevant. Looked nice.
---
I also had a patch that added cata music to the vanilla zones so there was less repeating music from zone to zone. It was pretty cool, but I'm not overly wild of some of the new music.
---
I've poked around DBC editing before to tweak music on the 1.12.1 client and it's a lot of work, updating and referencing multiple DBC files to change or add music to a zone or subzone. As cool as I think it would be, I don't see the little team Blizz put on Classic bothering with this. Maybe later down the road if/when Classic is successful they'll find some money to pay somebody to throw together some database patches for models or music.
---
I flip the scroll wheel to strafe 
---
Obviously its not a large majority, but every time, I feel, I've tried to start a classic discussion over on the retail reddit it hasn't ended well. 
---
This sub is where I should be posting, but r/wow should be all things WoW, if that makes any sense? Maybe its the small majority that I find the loudest? I'm not honestly too sure why I feel this way, ha 
---
So irresponsible. Now I have to have an emergency meeting with my psychiatrist. Do you know how much that costs me?  
---
How is "I like this idea, what do you think, would you also like this?" in any way "trying to force changes"?
---
Idk I'd love added tier sets for off specs.
---
Hold on I‚Äôm mailing you gold for your mount. Will that do?
---
This guide thinks that mages &gt; warlocks for RDPS. plain untrue, for most of early raiding locks &gt; mages, and at aq/naxx they are pretty much on par unless a mage is the lucky one who gets ignite rolling.
---
Oh my god.  
---
Would it be better if there was just a completely mirrored keyboard?  
---
Num pad on the left, everything just totally flipped?  
---
I tamed every beast, now I aim to tame every player with Mind Control.
---
Stop idealizing elitist behavior. I did clean every boss up to C'thun, and i let my Hearth to SW without any problem. 
---
Compared to original vanilla? Yes, it will be very, very different.
---
Compared to nowaday's meta on private servers? No, it's probably going to stay the same for the most part. I don't expect anything will change regarding optimal races, classes and builds. Some item procs will likely change, some armor or resistance values here and there will change, but overall I don't expect any of those to have enough impact to actually change the current raid meta. Classes disparities are just too big in 1.12.
---
Nevermind The Emerald Dream, "Medivhs Tower" was toted as a dungeon/raid on the official WoW website before the game was released and was the first raid they worked on. Plus of course the Atiesh staff created a portal to Karazahn.
---
I'd love to see "Medivhs Tower" (not Karazahn redux) as a Vanilla raid.
---
Because Blizzard is clearly monitoring all Warcraft forums. It‚Äôs a topic that doesn‚Äôt need to be brought up. It could be resolved by looking up the soundtrack on YouTube. It doesn‚Äôt need to be added into the game. It shouldn‚Äôt even be a second thought
---
‚ÄúStep 1: Reach Level 20
---
Head to Westfall, Westfall is pretty shitty in total, but it lays a strong foundation for the next quests. Things to keep an eye out for:
---
 Times are Tough: Loot Li Li for  Harvest Watcher Heart which starts a quest.
---
(Quest #57935): Loot Moonbrook Thug for Red Bandana which starts a quest
---
For  Evidence Collection, just queue up as a tank/healer (sorry DPS) and use the item then leave
---
Keep the quest to go to Stormwind City, but don‚Äôt turn it in, it continues to scale with you.
---
Step 2:
---
Duskwood
---
You should be level 25‚Äù
---
I absolutely support people using free guides and collaborating to improve those guides. For most people this kind of guide is perfectly fine to get some direction while levelling. üëç
---
If you‚Äôre referring to our guide which we have a patreon for, I‚Äôm not sure why you feel the hard work we put in deserves to be campaigned against. We made it available because there wasn‚Äôt an in-depth speedrun guide for Alliance. 
---
Compared to the above, we supply a 1-19 which is over 15 pages long and covers every starter Alliance zone. It‚Äôs thousands of hours testing. Is it really so offensive that we ask for $5 for that work, or $20 for over 60 pages of guide for the 1-60? 
---
I‚Äôll be cheering you on in your work 100%. Not too unreasonable, I think, to request the same. 
---
That is legitimately a thing, as best I know.
---
May be an easy way to add in "niche" gear sets for Shaman / Druid / Pally and a few other specs such as shadow priest, etc. 
---
Again, probably never will happen, but this could be an easy way to 'balance' those specs without messing around with the actual talents / abilities numbers
---
If you break it down to the detail then very much yes. But in general terms these roles do apply to varying degrees. For example you wouldn't send a Warrior or Priest to get the flag in WSG would you? Similarly you don't want a Rogue or Druid to zerg for midcontrol. So yes the classes are each very unique but they share some stuff with other classes that let them do certain jobs or roles better than others.
---
As what class?
---
As a mage, the worms and turtles in Mara are a decent AoE farm spam. So is the top of the Arena in BRD.
---
Whats the annoyance of that? Just dont watch it and let the people who do enjoy it enjoy it?
---
Sounds like such a waste of energy
---
Who the hell would buy a leveling guide when there's literally hundreds of them online for free? It's not like a paid one will provide you with anything new and magical that will make you level faster than others, I didn't even know this was a thing lol.
---
I literally never connected all of these, this never even occurred to me but this would be pretty awesome.
---
I'm in the "let classic be classic" camp, but later down the road I would love community discussion on all the unfinished content like Emerald Dream and Azshara Crater and would very much like to one day see them in-game, provided they are on par with existing content difficulty and ilvl-wise and don't render existing content obsolete.
---
Additional content could be a fun way to explore tier sets and bonuses for "nonviable" specs, though then we run into balance issues if there is no way to offset/compensate for the utility certain classes bring that arguably more than makes up for putting out fewer raw numbers on charts....
---
It's a fun topic, and one I want to see at least explored down the road.
---
Have you heard of the no changes guys?
---
I'm thinking simple here. I just want to run around, whacking things with a big 2h mace/axe and see those white numbers go. Mainly for leveling and pvp, don't mind tanking/healing for raids.
---
Oh no brother. I get that. . I do. 
---
This is a safer place to discus classic, for now. You probably know this, but the official wow forums have been a toxic pile of burning kodo poo for YEARS. I vowed to never go there again yet I find myself reading and posting on the classic forum.
---
I am afraid the Live side gets into a herd mentality. One person talks crap and the rest pile on because they think its safe. To be fair, this community can do the same at times. 
---
My hope is, and I am a dreamer, that once Classic comes out and we see people try it and form real opinions and not just opinions made for them from some post somewhere, that all main stream community channels will be safer for  both sides.
---
So keep the faith.
---
Emerald Dream, Karazhan &amp; Crypts, Outlands (specifically Hellfire peninsula), Dragon Isles, Ghost Lands, Mt. Hyjal, Azshera's BG + general quests, Caverns of Time, Uldum, and several other missing zones in the Vanilla world map were all planned at one point in time to be included. That is before they decided to space out content for "expansions" which did anything but expand the game.  
---
Idk if it works on retail, but as a rogue on pservers brd pickpocket runs were aight.
---
Hi, /u/dantech2390
---
I'm starting to like my orc warlock too.  Played UD lock back in the day, but the orc look, lore, and yeah, the stun resist, really makes them shine.
---
Include the rest of the Vanilla Azeroth map with horizontal content including Karazhan &amp; Crypts, Outlands (specifically Hellfire peninsula), Dragon Isles, Ghost Lands, Mt. Hyjal, Azshera's BG + general quests, Caverns of Time, Uldum, Grim Batol, and I'm in.
---
"Vanilla +" has so much potential to add content to without power creep to keep the game relevant for years.
---
"Horizontal Content" is what we call it.
---
2019
---
Paying for information about a 14 year old game.
---
Does not compute.
---
Conveniently Michigan just legalized rec pot this year so it checks out 
---
[Citation needed]
---
ya, it wasnt needed in retail, i believe, the z- and c- worked, but it was still search fine if you didnt use those.
---
On every pserver I played on, you had to type those or it wouldnt work right though.
---
Yes, to avoid powercreep, gear "ilvl" should never suprass C'thun / Naxx in raw power.
---
You can also share your times here: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=904 
---
On another note, no need to pitchfork for Alenya‚Äôs guide. If someone wants to charge for their hard work that‚Äôs their right. Anyone who can find their way to his guide can surely navigate google on their own?
---
It was not but definitely fits the criterion for potential "Vanilla +" horizontal content.
---
You didn't answer the question. In what way is it "trying to force" anything? By asking random people on Reddit "hey, I thought this was neat, what do you think", in what way is OP trying to force something on you or the devs?
---
You're being incredibly dramatic and it doesn't help anything.
---
You don't need +defense in 5mans. At all. There are very, very few things in 5mans that hit hard enough that you would want to avoid being crit. Especially for a meme tank like Shaman, you'd just want to stack tons of stam/spell damage.
---
I love stuff like this.  
---
"Quivers increase wand attack speed but never actually happened in Vanilla"
---
Use google.
---
I never said anything about quivers.
---
Use your eyes.
---
To what end? There's no pvp ladder or rating, any guild that is serious about raiding will tear through all the raids... I don't see what competitive drive there is for people to try to take the meta to the next level. Just enjoy it for what it is. No I don't think there'll be some amazing melee moonkin or ele/enhance spec no one's thought of that will blow everyone away.
---
It's the newest one that just came out this week. 
---
I'm all for capitalism and harbor no real ill will towards it. However, in my heart, I'm 100% an opensourceware guy. I would've gone broke and hungry a decade ago if not for programs like Inkscape, Gimp, and Linux and I bring that with me everywhere I go.
---
Personally I'd feel a lot better if guide writers instead said "Donate $5-10 to one of these charities for full access." I would support that 100% especially since videos and streaming offer such a great middle ground between free education and supporting creators.
---
At the end of the day if someone does purchase a guide and thinks they got their money's worth, FANTASTIC! I'm all for it. But, I've come across a few new players who thought paid guides were the only solution which is why I've posted this.
---
Same thing happened to me. I was a counter-strike player many years ago. From Counter-strike beta 3, to counter-strike 1.6 etc etc and i lost a bet with my ex wfie to play Vanilla WoW for 1 hour. Guess what happened ive not played Counter-strike since lol. 
---
Australia will probably never get to rec, medicinal is still a lot of a struggle here. To get a script takes the right Doctor that doesn‚Äôt think morphine based is best. And the price is through the roof!

We're talking about doing a dungeon. Not gold spamming or begging or just whispering to annoy. You've been dodging that all day and focusing on the other justifications for my argument. I think it's because you know I'm right
---
Nah it‚Äôs a pain in a new game since I need to re keybind everything but it works the same as wasd.  (Tbh I actually have more buttons and since my hands are fairly large it‚Äôs still easy to hit right shift and control as well)
---
Division 2 Pc was great since they had a way to hit a button for a left handed mode which was amazing!
---
I can already feel that tendon in my neck aching from being slumped over my keyboard for 12 hours a day.
---
Totally worth it, though.

Old eq player here too. You're gonna love it!

I really hope you don‚Äôt quit your day job

The Demons are nice because you can just grind there from 55-60. Enchant demonslaying and stuff too for good times.
---
Hey man, do you happen to have a list of weapons you plan on using while you level 1-60? If so I would love to see it, if you're willing to share! 
---
Cheers,
---
I didn't know who Alenya was until just now when they commented.
---
I'm not here to brigade or pitchfork, just to say there are free solutions especially since there are plenty of people who will be looking to take advantage of ignorant players. I was there in Vanilla when Chinese farming hit it's peak and I'm not going to be surprised to see it happen again.
---
None of the links say anything even close to that.
---
No? If you're referring to the completely fabricated and then deleted from a website for WoW hacks "leak" that was 1.9m for a single region. 
---
The mage on horde? I used to fuck over the daytime guy all the time lol. Never farmed there at night that I can remember. Screwing with gold farmers and bots was a hobby of mine on mal'ganis through TBC. 
---
&gt;Of course you get ganked 10 times by the level 60 bodyguard that every horde seems to have
---
So glad I'm rolling PVE...
---
Rabble rabble rabble!
---
(in support of noisemaking)
---
No one said that a warrior should tank, where did you get this from? I'm fury myself. However as a warrior, you should expect to get whispers to tank as warriors are basically the only class that is ever spec'd to tank. Randoms just see "warrior" in the list, not your spec. It never hurts to ask. 
---
It would be so retarded if they added one after launch. People do not wanna reroll.
---
I think he meant May 4th.
---
They probably only filtered by "war" instead of "warrior" and since you were a "war"lock, you popped up on the /who list as well.
---
Why would he marry a chick who isn't hot?
---
My best guess would be bgs in very close to release, at most 6 weeks delay from launch for people to experience and get sick of TM zerg. I think honor and pvp trinket will be in at launch or with bgs. Rank 10 or 11 rewards (ie blue pvp set) will get put in approx 2 months in with phase 2 (dire maul), and then rank 14 gear (epic set) with BWL in phase 3.   
---
They might delay the epic set to release with AQ40 but just getting rank 12 is going to be extremely difficult on populated servers so I don't think gear inflation is much a concern. You're literally talking one or two characters a week getting gear and those people sacrificing all family and career they have for it. yay epics...
---
After all the duping and the number of people who bought this mounts for a little bit of nothing, it just cracks me up seeing people trying to sell them for gold cap now.
---
It wasn‚Äôt the only IF at first during the beta all cities had an AH but they weren‚Äôt linked.
---
Blizzard then removed all the other AHs because they weren‚Äôt used and since they couldn‚Äôt link them at the time it created a poor experience to the user.
---
IF became the hub because getting to BRM was easier as well as Menethil Harbor the flight point in the burning steppes wasn‚Äôt added until later and there was no flight point in the searing gorge either, and you could also not fly directly to a flight point across multiple paths either so you had to talk to the flight master at every stop.
---
I came here to say the quality of this image suddenly made me super hyped for Classic again out of nowhere
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: I love RP. I love world PvP. Please don't make me have to choose one or the other.
---
Pretty quickly after the announcement they made about plans for servers at launch (at the time, no RP server was planned).
---
They said they appreciate the community's 'noise' it made about it, and to keep it up since that's how they are able to see things from a developmental standpoint.
---
:kappa:
---
&gt; .. but yeah, lump all potheads together... 
---
When did being passive aggressive become not hostile? If you 
---
Do we even have an estimated release date yet? I keep checking in and finding out theres been no news :(
---
Most of the posts are being repeated 100 times per day.
---
So it's not surprising that people are quick to downvote them.
---
I got curious so I looked it up. Guys name I was thinking about was stronger. He joined Aeternus at some point and they brought him in some farm raids. I think I do remember a horde troll mage that farmed there too. 
---
lol yeah 320 extra health back then was a big deal
---
&gt;For example you wouldn't send a Warrior or Priest to get the flag in WSG would you? Similarly you don't want a Rogue or Druid to zerg for midcontrol.
---
This statement doesn't make any sense. You are the one arguing that two classes can do the same thing, not me. 
---
Shaman. Level with slow 2h with rockbiter for those huge white hits, earthbind totem kite between swing if you want to be efficient. You have ghost wolf, heal and self-rez for a smooth leveling experience. Windfury is great for wpvp while leveling. At 60 ele/resto is better for pvp while being viable for raid but enhancement is possible if you put in the work. 
---
Get them to 1hp, let the mob kill them so they get durability damage. 
---
The threat of getting ganked is what makes PvP servers so damn fun and immersive. You're always watching your back. When you come up on a camp of murlocs and see dozens of dead murloc corpses littering the beach, you know someone was there before you, and you *don't* know if they're friendly or not. That's exciting! 
---
I won't camp them, but I will kill them. 
---
I'm from Northern California so even though it's legal now here, it's always been kind of legal anyways lol.

I'll be blasting off into Azeroth with 2 weeks of paid vacation and 2 ounces of purp babyyyyyyyy.

Soon‚Ñ¢  :(
---
AdventureQuest-y
---
There is indeed multiple buffs that are good for classes and it's your choice to decide which one.
---
For a tank typically it's kings. For a melee dps typically it's might, unless if geared and he's kinda offtank then kings. 
---
Hunters it's kings.
---
Mage/warlock you decide between mana and salve, if there's threat issues you go salv if not go mana, kings is pretty mediocre on casters because they scale very poorly on int. 
---
I suppose people will learn eventually, just as they had to in Vanilla. I recall the waiting period being drilled into me not because a tank told me, but because whenever I'd pull aggro I'd either lose 1/2 of my hp (as a mage) or die. So as a DPS, it does pay to wait. 
---
The Monster Zero Ultra is a nice touch. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsnR59GF51c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsnR59GF51c)

Ask them which one they want, then you won‚Äôt have to worry about choosing wrong.
---
Joined the discord, pretty disappointed. There's really no 'community' there when it comes to classic speed leveling. A few people talking. About 0 collaboration, 0 guide sharing, etc. 
---
RP-PvP servers are some of the most fun experiences I had on retail. Huge guild rivalries and large scale wpvp on a regular basis sounds exactly like what I want to invest my time into. Please make it happen bliz!

Not any good for SP due to the high spirit and the lack off +spell damage.

Scroll down to Surrender01 his post, there's all you need to know
---
They haven't said anything yet. My guess is it'll come in with ZG
---
To be fair not knowing the pulls is completely excusable. Not knowing how to tank however, is not.
---
I figured people just bought em for the novelty, that's why I have one from BC. Way better guides exist than the ones a few randos threw together for Brady 13 years ago
---
Yep that's fair enough. I'd love to donate to charity but tbh this is going to helping my mum in her retirement, and I'm a bit biased towards mum &lt;3
---
 I 100% support what you guys are doing.
---
And like you, I always point out there are other guides available. I'm totally comfortable with people electing to use a free guide. In our case, the people supporting us are getting the fastest alliance one we've been able to produce. Not everyone is going to want that, but for those who do, I'm pleased we were able to get it done before Classic &lt;3
---
Ion said that they'd consider adding one if there was enough interest. So, we're trying to show blizzard that there is enough interest, especially since it seems liek they've been genuinely listening to the Classic community lately. 
---
PvP set is great since it has a lot of manaregen on it. Felcloth just have dmg and stamina and mana is a huge issue for shadow 
---
Time to move to Northern California then üòú
---
I think it only just started for classic so give it some time
---
While levelling, if they are a mana class give them wisdom, if they aren't give them might. That's pretty much it. Kings is not good in bad gear, and salv is very rarely necessary while levelling. If they want want salv they will ask you for it.  
---
By the time you get to raiding you will have played the class for 150+ hours and will know exactly how the game works so it will be obvious how it works in raids at that point.
---
Yeah, like ore and stone so I can level my professions
---
just wear heirlooms noob
---
It has that little platform that's perfect for it though. Where Stormwind just has the main bridge or closer to Goldshire I guess.
---
They definitely fixed it purposefully before the last patch so I'm sure it won't work :(
---
I think retri gets away with the fantasy since it doesn‚Äôt have much interesting talents aside from Seal of Command and Vengeance. Which are not even that cool. Their self reliance and free/unique mounts are also cool but that has nothing to do with retri itself. I think holy and protection have way more interesting choices.
