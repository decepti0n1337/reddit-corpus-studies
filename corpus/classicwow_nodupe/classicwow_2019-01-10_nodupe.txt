No you didn't
---
---
---
as you should, focus target has no place in vanilla.
---
Ya I think I'm going to get a boar at least early on. Being able to feed it mage food is a big plus.
---
With classic it’s a lot harder to change characters and roles It was so much easier as a Druid
---
Is it really vanilla if you’re playing a blood elf?
---
See, this is why we should insist on vanilla models, none of this "updated graphics" garbage
---
I added the ambiguity purposefully, because if you mention another expansion, the post is removed by the mods. 
---
No need to be sorry, it was much appreciated, so thank you for your thought out comment :)

I personally think that what makes Vanilla special is the journey to endgame, the game starts at level 1, not at max level. So you bring out some points that there is still challenging content in retail, if the player goes looking for it. What we love about Vanilla is the fact that everything was challenging, to some degree, but much more than modern MMOs. This is what we want back.
---
We want the leveling experience being much more slow paced and challenging. We don't want to be able to aoe grind massive amounts of mobs without having aquired the gear to do so first.  
---
We don't want to be able to instantly teleport to dungeons or across the world, unless of course we have a warlock friend in place or a mage that can port us to a nearby city.  
---
We want achievements to mean something, as in not the ones you get in a journal somewhere, but the ones you can only remember or show via an item you got. That is, managing to complete a tough quest, gather an item set that's tough to gather and takes time and dedication etc. etc.
---
So if they bring in a cash shop that let's people look awesome without them putting in the effort, then that detracts from our enjoyment of the game as well. Looking awesome should take time and dedication. If everyone is awesome, then noone is.
---
It is definitely more difficult as beast mastery. Personally I found a 0/24/27 build to be extremely good against warriors. Even the hybrid intimidation/scatter builds are better since you have 2 ways of getting distance. And it isn't hard to get an intimidation off on someone before your pet gets cc'd, even though everyone assumes no beastial wrath makes it sick. 
---
Counterattack + deterrence along with improved wing clip and scatter gives you a shitload of ways to get out, though, which is why that build is the most popular. 
---
It will have to be tagged classic if it uses the same launcher but I expect it will actually be a separate launcher option in the app like the test server, alphas/beta's and the classic demo was. That way they can recycle names
---
&gt;Item you will go out of your way to get while leveling
---
Sure lots of stuff. Light of Elune, Carrot on Stick, the AV trinket, the plaguelands trinket that gives Argent Dawn rep, the Sunken Temple class quest reward, various keys Scarlet Monastery/BRD/that dwarf tunnel, that bag from Strangethorn Vale...lots of stuff.
---
I plan to count my leveling time in days, not hours. +- half an hour every play session isn't a big deal.
---
I share your hope for BC.
---
I think it's fair that you find leveling a warrior boring, it is one of the tougher classes to level. I personally loved leveling mine. I was a warrior main as well in Vanilla. For me it was the journey that was the game, it wasn't only the endgame.
---
Tough to clear MC if you're the only one that dinged 60 :)
---
And yes, Vanilla isn't really about getting max level as fast as possible, well perhaps for a few it is, but as you said, it's quite boring if you view the game that way.
---
I honestly don't know why they have levels anymore in retail, because from what I hear only endgame seems to matter and have content.
---
This is different in Vanilla.
---
[*Fixed for Horde Players](https://imgur.com/a/bXQAsKb)

"Unsuccessful" (broken items) 
---
Pretty sure Nost had 150k active at its peak, so it seems like 500k would be a very safe low estimate.
---
Yep I deserve downvotes for this I'll go ahead and go fuck myself 
---
Aren't healers a Warlocks mana battery?
---
"Amount of casualness" isn't an important factor when choosing faction. 
---
 * If you want to play a paladin or shaman, faction choice is made for you.
---
 * If you have friends you want to play with, play the faction that they're playing.
---
 * If you want pretty races and towns, play alliance.
---
 * If you want horde racials, play horde.
---
You missed the joke. S/he is referring to items going red when durability goes to zero after you've died lots of times, rather than red item rarity.
---
Yep I got it I already said I'd go off and fuck myself 
---
I really don't agree with your points.  The point of wow classic is to play the 1.12 patch.  You are really going over the top with your arguments that the game needs to be turned away from the 1.12 version to be playable and satisfying in the "mid term" (6 months).  I've come to expect a patch 1.12 wow classic.  For them to undo all the massive improvements to gear and the game in general from 1.1 to 1.12 so that you can spend more time on raids or dungeons is something I don't agree with.  If you can do it in 1.12 you should be able to do it on wow classic release, end of discussion to me.
---
You seem to not care whether or not Classic is a faithful recreation of the experience that was had. Even if we will experience the game differently because we are different players and things will be a bit easier, shouldn’t they still try to make it accurate? Shouldn’t they make sure that details like this are as accurate as possible? “How strong a character has potential to be when entering X content because of accessible gear” seems completely within the realm of something that should be faithfully recreated. 
---
Clearly you don’t think so, so why even write a comment like this? Because you don’t want the game to be as historically accurate as it can be, just because it’ll be easy anyway so who cares? Come on. Maybe you think it is worth making right, but don’t agree with how negatively it could affect the game if it weren’t done correctly. Cool! Then write something constructive about that, instead of downplaying a concerned OP because he wants an authentic recreation project to be as authentic as it can.
---
I think even with 500K players it would be considered wildly successful considering it's just a remaster of a very old game at this point, especially if they indeed charge 15$ per month for it. I would not expect more than a million subs, MMOs are not a very popular genre at the moment. 500K-1million seems realistic for the mid-term, short term there will be maybe more trying it out, but how long they stick with it is something we have to wait and see.
---
You can find all the theorycrafting sheets including Life taps VS Sbolt on the warlock discord https://discord.gg/HUUec3u
---
Warriors might be great in raids but they are perhaps the most played class, so it's harder to find a raid spot than you  might think.
---
For any sort of competitive, pre-made and high level pvp- disc is much better, and more viable than shadow. As someone else said here, you'd also probably be better off solo queueing as disc, if you wanted a higher win rate.
---
TL;DR Blizzard originally planned to have artifact items in the game that could only be acquired literally once per server, but scrapped the plan in fears of players not liking that
---
I went from warrior, which is my main for the longest time during tbc, wotlk, I enjoy tanking very much. I MT’d for my guilds and achieved couple server firsts. 
---
To rogue which is my main alt during tbc and main during panda, ganking people during lvling is the best mmo experience I had.
---
Then i switched to priest, which was my vanilla main and raiding mc with, i also enjoy healing and easy raiding and dungeon group spots.
---
To mage, my first character, and for the easy aoe grind and aoe farm, to support my other alts or switching main later on.
---
Now I am considering hunter, a class I have never played except lvl19 twink back in vanilla days. I even watched all hunter guides and read about in depth pet guides.
---
I hope I don’t have to switch again, because i will go nuts. After all, i still have warlock, which I also raided with back in vanilla, paladin which i lvled multiple times but never raided, and druid which I have never ever created a character for.
---
I think i am settling for the new fresh experience of hunter which I never really played instead of going back to my roots of comfort zone. 
---
The "1.12 version of WoW" has had the AQ opening already happen, has Nax out, has BG's out. Blizzard has already announced none of that is happening. This 1.12 argument is completely flawed. I wish people would stop using it. Argue it for talents, which is why Blizzard chose it. I never said to change ANY talents and my post defends and applauds Blizzard for choosing 1.12.
---
Nerfing content is also not "improvements". It's just nerfed content that has already been nerfed due to 1.12 and spellbatching already. 2 nerfs is enough and 1.12 is a HUGE nerf. Additional nerfs are uncalled for, unneeded and will simply break the game imo. To revert those nerfs is also simple. Release structure is not as simple, but I believe there should be more content to spread out the content more and Classicast agrees with that sentiment and has argued for it recently. 
---
Warrior is not very strong 1v1. Give him a pocket Paladin of any spec though for Blessing of Freedom and Cleanse, and there is nobody he cannot smash.
---
[removed]
---
Actually Retribution has very solid damage talents. The problem is that Paladin lacks any BASELINE abilities for it, and also doesn't get an additional Strike with talents, something that was only fixed in WotLK.
---
So u added ambiguity to circumvent mids?
---
So u added ambiguity to circumvent the mods?
---
alliance for faster bg queues. since on average more ppl pvp on horde.
---
For the first couple of weeks, 2 million because of current subs checking it out. Then it will drop to 1 million. After two months, around 500k once players have had their nostalgia trip or their rose-tinted glasses have fallen off.
---
Level through the blood troll starting zones, then go to hillsbrad and kill beasts - there are a lot of different circuits you can run, meaning you can choose a different spot if there's competition, and the level range of different animals spans 1-30. Once you get to 30, you can go to arathi highlands and do the same thing. 35-40 is very good in swamp of sorrows - dragon whelps give extra EXP and the jaguars drop comparatively nice loot while being nicely spaced apart. Rince and repeat - just be killing beasts, basically. There are tons of different areas in the world with beast mobs. Because they're typically spaced close enough to be efficient without forcing you to pull more than one they're perfect for grinding.
---
To add on to your post: The most popular server has already stated they will be shutting down once Classic is released. People hate what they don't understand, I suppose.
---
Yes, I am neither promoting any private server nor mentioning other expansions, I just want an answer related to the world of Azeroth as it was in Classic. I am highly unaware of how that is to be considered as rule-breaking. Thus the ambiguity. 
---
So you're asking a question about a private burning crusade server on a wow classic sub. Genius. 
---
Are they? If so, is that bad given that like mages don’t need a healer to do damage?
---
So saying u are playing a belf isnt im0lying another expansion?
---
I don’t even think you’ve ever made it to 60, judging by your list
---
To be fair id be not using corruption if it were real vanilla. Too few debuff slots usually. On this server all the raids are 5 man and it’s scaled appropriately, so you can get away with it easily. I know it isn’t even close to how the actual raiding would feel - but as I said in op, I’m just playing around with classes and such to see what I enjoy to play 
---
[These](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18583) kinds of items used to be "red" color quality earlier on before they were changed, and were basically GM items yes. There might have been an "artifact" level item planned beyond legendary, but that never came to be. Vanilla was a hot pot and really could have gone in any direction so its not unreasonable to assume that there might have been plans for that extra item quality.
---
Go up, read again, in silence. I am asking a question about the grinding spots in Azeroth (Classic world that is). How exactly would me writing "Orc hunter" instead of "Belf hunter" alter anything about the essence of my question? The only thing I'd see happening is that you would feel better.
---
1. There exists tons of servers with Classic emulation and TBC races/classes. How does one determine whether it's Classic or TBC?
---
2. Why the fuck does it matter if I write Blood elf instead of Orc? Does the quests in Azeroth suddenly yield greater experience, or does the answer to my question alter completely? 
---
Blizz already claimed they only have 1.12 data and newer
---
Thank you! Any specific reason why beasts should be a priority for killing?
---
I honestly love it more than retail. I am currently leveling a Paladin and am doing so going in the Ret tree (duh) but I have gotten a large selection of "holy" gear to help add to my Mana pool as I love offhealing Vancleef. The idea that I can offheal and DPS at the same time is so unheard of in today's market.
---
I am having a wonderful experience about managing the mechanics of the 5 second rule and at the same time outputting as much DPS as I can. I get to use utility. Combat is engaging (even if the rotation is 3 buttons) but I'm having Moe fun hitting 3 buttons than the 4 or so I hit on retail.
---
I love that leveling is a core aspect of the game itself. The journey is as important as the end. That's something retail misses by a mile. What's it matter to level nowadays as it's just a nuisance because it's been left unattended for so long. 
---
That guy is great!
---
A whole lot of words to say nothing
---
This might help. 
---
https://www.hookedonphonics.com/
---
Lol salty much....there a literally hundreds of grinding guides out there based on your lvl...in the future u might not want to say u are deliberately circumventing rules
---
The ladt sentence.....
---
Is there an accurate pie chart of level 60s on private servers? I don’t want to play an overplayed class, but also don’t want to play Druid or shaman
---
Yes. Introducing microtransactions into Classic drives away the core audience, gutting their revenue from subs. If WoW goes F2P at some point then it's a different story.
---
The last one is debatable according to my internet search history.
---
"Funnily enough, even though the updated BRE seems OP from a personal DPS point of view, if the debuff from the old BRE stacked with other armor reducing debuffs it would be far stronger since the raid dps increase would be way more effective than simply increasing one person's dps." Not if you get BRE's for all of your warriors :D
---
My bad lol
---
Because belfs were not in classic...when they were added thw grinding spots changed
---
Unless they can throw boulders and fart so hard it knocks five people back 30 feet, no they're not strong. Not WoW strong anyway.
---
30.0 feet ≈ 9.1 metres ^(1 foot ≈ 0.3m)

Not salty. I just dislike people like you, because when I was creating this thread, I was prepared for a statement like yours. But what exactly value did you contribute to the thread or my question by being so picky, irrational and off-topic?

How did they change?
---
The Recipe for Savory Deviate Delight. Then I fish the deviates, cook them, and sell on AH. I've made my mount gold this way since vanilla WoW, and it still seemed to work well on the private servers I tried it on too.

Locations of new spots..changing of mob density...xp per kill etc
---
Are you think euro and American combined? Or are you including the asias?
---
Warlocks are one of the few classes that I really don't know well.
---
But I'm currently playing a Priest and I always keep an extra eye out for the Warlocks in my raid and throw them a renew if their mana is getting low.
---
It's not really a big deal, from my POV anyway.
---
It was a little annoying when doing 5mans while leveling though.    
---
If I'm OOM, sitting and drinking, IMO the warlocks should be drinking too. But if my mana is fine then it's no issue.
---
Lol ppl like me?  You dont know me...i stayed on topic since u said u were deliberately ambiguous 
---
Not... Not really? It's a meme, not a serious post.
---
Rouge is best imo.
---
You just go to a raid and dps.
---
Every other class is forced to give water, lock stones, agro mobs in tanking, buff the shit out if ppl. Rogues just lazy ass MF there for a ride. Literally you just sit down with your dick out 75% of the time. 
---
Nothing personal, but in every thread there is one person trying to add unrelated stuff. Anyways, we're cool man
---
Never heard of this Siv guy, but he's funny and pretty entertaining. 
---
Next time try just saying hunter...no ambiguity attempting to bypass mods 
---
How has nobody mentioned TipsOutBaby?! His vanilla content is fantastic! 
---
&gt;I personally think that what makes Vanilla special is the journey to endgame, the game starts at level 1, not at max level. 
---
Yep. Levelling is almost non-existent in modern WoW. It's really silly how they still even require people to level through old content at all, and not just start everyone at the current expansion minimum level (110 now). I guess it's so they can sell character boosts (which wouldn't really work in vanilla btw, so I'm not worried about that). 
---
&gt; We don't want to be able to instantly teleport to dungeons or across the world
---
That's another thing people get slightly wrong about retail too. While you can summon if you are two people at the summoning stone outside the entrance, there's no automatic teleport there like in the LFD tool. It's also not uncommon to be ganked by the other faction if you try summoning. 
---
&gt;We want achievements to mean something, as in not the ones you get in a journal somewhere, but the ones you can only remember or show via an item you got. That is, managing to complete a tough quest, gather an item set that's tough to gather and takes time and dedication etc. etc.
---
That still exist in retail. You just have a ton of useless achievements and shit piled on top of the meaningful stuff. 
---
But yeah, I agree with all you are saying. My main mission here is to try and break some of the prejudice that exist here about retail. People think it's much worse than it actually is. 
---
For example. Like half the people quitting the current expansion did so because it was too grindy and Blizzard hasn't brought out enough cosmetics/mounts/whatever that they like. That's the direction vanilla is in as well, although obviously different in many many ways. 
---
Alright 
---
By having a pocket dispel.
---
Basically in 1v1 some classes just don't beat certain others in classic. Sucks but oh well.
---
Lezonta the fking god. Him and MN are my favorite streamers to watch.
---
Can you even buy gear (transmog) in retail? How would that even work since there oviously won't be transmog in vanilla? I only know you can get pets and mounts, which could work in vanilla too. Although I agree with you about earning it, everyone will know you just bought it so I don't think it really matters that much. It's not like you're cheating other people on their achievements. 
---
I played on a terribly old computer with dial up.
---
TIL she was throwing boulders.
---
The main thing I don't like is the lack of quests.  I kind of like leveling when I have a constant diet of quests, but in vanilla I'd have to grind mobs because I ran out of quests.  That combined with the fact that grinding mobs by yourself is the fastest way to level.  Which I actually kind of like to do but finding a good spot where the mobs don't have annoying abilities, people don't come and steal your spawns, and you don't get ganked can be tough.
---
Me and my buds are starting one on ally, EST. Always down for one more. Feel free to pm me 
---
Didnt one player some how had one drop for him? I think he was allowed to keep it but they modified something about the item after it was discovered he had one so it wasnt so strong.
---
Whatever the number is, i hope it consist of players that know why they play classic and don't want some frankenilla monstrosity.
---
But think how easy it would be to over pull in dungeons! Sounds perfect!
---
Lol this response is gold tho 
---
Yeah-no. Blizzard is trying to do as little work as possible to get the show on the road. Going back to 1.1 and working your way up to 1.12 is tedious work. 
---
So 6 months into WOW they buff MC gear. Why does that matter?
---
It can be a good or bad thing depending how you look at it.
---
It's like doing MC for the very first time pre dire maul days with the old talent setup. Dire Maul items were a game changer. Or doing AQ pre nerf.
---
The game is essentially easier. 
---
Yeah if you run a pug, 50% of whispers you get are ‘fury warrior here’
---
Balance/balance
---
Because this is how it will be in Classic when  the content is already nerfed with nerfs to encounters that happened over several patches, buffs to talents and spellbatching allowing heals to hit instantly. 
---
This is just a pointless nerf on top of necessary ones. How much easier do we need 2004 raids to be? Does Blizzard think the modern playerbase is this bad and incompetent. Guess were were all super advanced gamers back then. 
---
It's turning into WoW Vanlla Timewalking at this point.
---
* stealth so you can get the first attacks in, which is huge in PVP.  
---
* 3 decent dots (Rip after your out of stealth burst, Moonfire, and Insect Swarm)  
---
* 2 hots  
---
* instant burst heal on cool down  
---
* roots with no cool down  
---
* spell interrupt with bear charge  
---
* good mitigation against melee in bear form.  
---
* immune to polymorph. 
---
* pretty much the highest mobility of any class
---
I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
---
lol
---
It's interesting that anything besides dumb memes gets mass downvoted in this subreddit. It's almost like you can't have a real rational discussion or give feedback without being harassed by people who seem to want Classic to fail, to prevent any real feedback and discussion and seem to be here for ulterior motives.
---
/r/wowservers is what you're looking for. 
---
IIRC artifact items were intended to be a quality above legendary and red in color but were never actually obtainable by players in any way. When they finally did release some artifact items in Legion they used the pale gold color that heirlooms used to use instead of red.
---
I'd say prot paladin might be the only spec. Like every paladin out there in Vanilia you'll eventually wanna spec prot with enough tanking gear to see how it goes. Sure you might get a few laughs by being overgeared for 5 mans and tanking it successfully Or rolling on a deathbringer to become a nuisance in pvp. But overall they don't have a place end game in pvp or raiding. 
---
Don’t worry about it scrubby
---
For top end guilds that will have MC on farm after 1-2 months I agree, it matters. But for majority of the semi-hardcore guilds, it's going to take them 4-6 months so it doesn't matter so much. Even with staged itemisation, they'd be no worse off. I think it's smarter of Blizzard to appease the semi-hardcore crowd than the 1%.
---
I mean... i don't entirely get your point. Warrior is the best tank and once geared also  the best DPS. In group PvP they are overpowered as hell.
---
While mage is the "easier" class with more utility, and probably would suit the more casual player, warrior that commits will be far more needed than a mage.
---
This post was removed because it's either about private servers or TBC, I'm not sure which. Either way, neither of those fit in here. Please try r/wowservers.
---
It's more like 1-2 weeks for the top guilds who clear MC in greens due to 1.12 talents. All these additional nerfs will just make it so the non hardcore guilds clear it in a month or 2 (leveling time). 
---
So Blizzard confirmed 16 debuffs, which means we'll have it for MC etc. How much would that effect / help shadow for raids? Would you say one spriest per raid to help warlock dmg?
---
I think your scale needs a bit of adjusting. 
---
First the hunter is not “bad dps”. A well played hunter is always welcome. They just don’t scale as hard as the other pure classes.—At T2.5++. A ret paladin is “bad dps.”
---
Being a player with limited time myself, and having played that way for a while I can say you should aim for ZG/AQ 20. While also hopefully hitting some MC/BWL with generous gear distribution.
---
The easiest classes to gear for this playstyle I have found are: Warlock&gt;Hunter&gt;Mage&gt;Rogue. There are just more dps slots than others, you can always prove yourself and get a spot. Healers aren’t as bad as tanks but there aren’t as many slots. Wouldn’t recommend tanking.
---
Basically on a tight schedule you will save yourself hours and hours by playing a pure dps class. From leveling, to gearing, to find groups. It’s just going to be a smaller time commitment.
---
Make a macro that puts your pet on Passive when you FD. That way your pet won’t instantly put you back in combat when you feign. 
---
Thats a lot of perks, thanks for the write up. Ive been looking around and I always see them described as “jack of all trades master of none” and that they aren’t sought after for raids or dungeons. In your experience, how hard was it to get into PvE groups?
---
2 weeks? I've never looked at private server data so assumed it took longer. That's playing 10 hour days of pure efficiency.
---
Yes, they're not going to do any of that.
---
Darkspear PVP US please 
---
Seriously lmao he's just being a cheeky Brit.
---
Yes, lots of People in my guild are like myself. With some of them playing 1 expansion before beginning to play on private vanilla servers. Also alot of new people have started on this server just now. To prepare for classic i reckon. You’d be surprised of the community of these servers, you have dedicated ranking discords for bgs and people know every r14 player, people know exactly who on the server has tf etc. You have guild rivaleries going back 3-4 private servers who tries to wipe eachother each week in brm because they learned the other guild’s raid times. Everyone knows who the most hardcore and best guilds are: APES, RETURN, nefarious, salad bakers. Quite fascinating really how these private servers have this Huge communities filled with unique personalities.
---
The min/max way of doing it is have a healing priest spec shadow enough just to keep the shadow debuff up while healing. In practice most raids probably won't mind taking along 1 shadowpriest. They can come in quite handy because if any dps class gets beaten by them on the meters you can safely just kick that dps.
---
I remember something similar to this
---
Okay. That’s what I got from your post
---
Hardcore guilds will have rag down within 3 weeks of server launching.
---
Gear just helps clear MC faster when its on farm, can get a 3 hour run down to maybe 45 minutes. Then of course bwl progression
---
Really glad this sub is turning to memes now over  simple nostalgia karma farms
---
You take your deaths like a man and get your revenge at 60 when everyone wants you in their groups and you're overheated enough to not get kitted like a chump 
---
You're limited unless you have a shadowpriest shadow weaving, but you shouldnt have too much problem finding a group. Long as you aren't a ret pally or feral druid 
---
Travel to the Hinterlands and kill a troll priestess sitting on top of on of the pyramid/temples for the mallet (unenchanted drop) and then travel all the way up the massive pyramid/temple filled with lvl 45+ elites. After fighting your way to the top of the mountain, or corpse running repeatedly, you will then enchant the mallet up here somewhere. My memory is a little hazy so I don't remember exactly what happens up here. 
---
Bonus points if you are running the sunken temple hakkar quest chain which also takes you up to this same location to retrieve an egg in the back of the cave which is also up top.
---
Locks can do respectable damage, but if they are top of dps its probably because they are the only one in the raid.

Good feedback, thank you.  I used to raid with 2 real life friends in a house and we were in a semi-serious  guild of 70+ - it was awesome.  PvP BG's was immensely fun.
---
You can check off the last one for my girlfriend.
---
I can only speak for myself, playing mostly on European servers and for me it was no problem getting into groups as either tank or healer on Magtheridon-EU. I do believe people will slightly prefer you as tank over healer, due to no resurrection, but it's really not a big deal. You might have a pally, shadow priest or shaman in your dungeon runs to take care of that deficiency. 
---
I think alchemy can be quite useful for druids in PvP as alternative for engineering. Some nice trinket ([Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811) and many useful potions still in Classic.
---
things are easier now, guilds kill vaelestraz in less than 20 seconds

Yes, it was a legendary necklace that only one player obtained before it was patched out of the game.

150k on one server?
---
Thinking of going Priest in PVP. Is Shadow as melt-facey as the meme suggests? Is holy-disc good or should I just roll Pally if I want to heal in PVP?
---
Lolol
---
Active was around 10-15K at any one time on their biggest server, but they also had a PvE server with 2-5k pop at any given time. I think that 150k number is total accounts.
---
Druids can annoy rogues with Feary Fire. In classic I felt it was really strong. 
---
I played a war and hunter to max in vanilla , due to time constraints ill be playing a hunter this time ( won't have a ton of time so I can't tank raids).
---
I will likely level a lock and war eventually too
---
It's not really that people are bad, it's diffusion of responsibility.  Decursing?  No one is specifically told to do it, or perhaps the two druid healers don't actually know the mechanic and the leader fails to tell them.  Who knows.  
---
The big benefit of a proper raid / guild environment is that you have clear leadership and an explanation of (xx need to do yy), (phase "xx" all of the range dps need to do it hard, melee back off because of crazy cleaves or whatever.  
---
This shit is funny even if you don’t know the reference

I am supporting changes? I'm saying I want the most vanilla classic possible.

See here for vanilla Poison Cleansing Totem (there was also a Disease Cleansing Totem): http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Cleansing_Totem
---
I had lots of problems with threat and that was as alliance with paladin blessing of salv. The odds that you'll have shammy in your group are low so you'll most likely be limited by your tanks threat. In full naxx bis warlock actually is the #1 dps in the game for single target so on fights like rag or ouro where ranged can't pull aggro off the tank you will be top of the meter however you lack any burst damage cooldown like mage's arcane power spell so you'll start off the fight below the burst dps and slowly their damage will drop off while yours stays steady and consistent. Also warlocks scale off of each other thanks to the talent improved shadowbolt debuff. Basically the more warlocks you bring to raid the more damage you do so make lots of friends!
---
Wish that was more than one in existence. That fire and nature resist is dope
---
I like the approach, but people come to classic for different reasons. First - some are levelers, others raid, others dungeon spam, etc. Second, roles are a thing - some won't want to heal, others don't tank, others don't dps. Third, some people just like classes - I personally can't stand hunter.
---
Sadly, it's not very easy to quantify this decision
---
No idea how vast your experience with the game is, so I will respond as to relatively new person or person who did not have too much time to  work everything out. Just mine point of view. Obviously depends on weak points in your playng tactics. It is what wastes time the most. Please note that I have only experience in retail, not vanilla. I am interested if it was different for druids back then, but if not:
---
\- druid can insta change in animal form - it is invaluable when you have gathering profesion and uneven ground. Swimming (!!)
---
\- you quickly get quick form to run about. 
---
\- you get teleport for moonglade
---
\- for me it is the best class becouse it has self heals, reasonable armor for a class with healing 
---
\- quick instant spells with running possibility
---
\- and you have possibility to kill enemies from distance
---
\- summary: mobility, attacks from distance, good self heals and leather armour saves you from a lot of deaths. 
---
\- saves gold grind becouse no mount necessary
---
\-in retail they are/were incredible at AoE if you put talents right in kitty form.
---
(btw, if ever in retail and trying archeology - this is the ONLY reasonable class, nevermind dwarves).
---
If you are good in playing mages - they are the best from time point of view:
---
\- teleports everywhere (and I heard in vanilla you wait  very long for flying). It saves time and probably gold grind.
---
\- you can set hearthstone to the inn, so you get another teleport point. 
---
I am lousy at this class and all deaths beacouse of the lack of armour, lack of healing, no possibility to run when cast a lot of spells are getting to me.
---
The hardest part of killing Ragnaros for a dedicated guild when classic launches is going to be the Hydraxian rep. I actually mathed that out and basically the answer is two groups depart from efficient leveling (i.e., questing) for a bit to go grind mobs in Silithus. Expect the first Rag kill 7 or 8 days from launch. Possibly as little as 6 days. I know the solo record is 4 days, 20 hours, but you have to remember two things. One, Joana has confirmed he knows he can do it faster in 1.12. He is estimating 4 days flat for his new record, maybe less. Two, that is a solo leveling goalpost. Not oh hey, 40 people are going to work together while doing nothing else for the next few days. If you actually do the quests for instances every single one of them is a huge boost to leveling speed if you can get the group assembled right away and you don't wipe or make mistakes. Pretty sure a dedicated guild can group with each other and satisfy those requirements. This also means that classes that normally depend heavily on weapons will be able to get instance quest rewards, which will speed them up substantially. Not to mention elite world quests. Planning a solo leveling route is a pretty interesting challenge. Planning 40 separate leveling routes that intersect at the right times for quests you can't do solo but are efficient xp/hour, be it world elite or instance quests, is actually a much more insane challenge. It is going on right now, people are already practicing just the leveling portion of this. 
---
When I played Vanilla I let raids for MC in 1.12 as alt/random runs all the time. We frequently did MC with 30 people, 25 of whom were in literal greens and were random bodies. We had a geared tank for obvious reasons. Those people sucked and we still cleared MC. There are people now who have been running MC for 14 straight years. They do not suck at it. 
---
This should be the top post on the sub
---
I'm very concerned about this as well. 1.12 talents were pretty significant buffs and the earlier raids were not designed with them or 16 debuff slots in mind. That combined with players having a much better knowledge of fight mechanics, BiS lists and the such leads to steamrolling through raids.
---
On private servers it's not unusual for groups to kill bosses in under 30 seconds. Or to clear MC with 25 players. And I'm not referring to records or the best of the best overgeared groups here. Just looking at some of the kills that happened today on private servers. Flamegor 22 seconds. Vaelastrasz 34 seconds. Shazzrah 33 seconds. Gehennas 38 seconds etc. if you want actual records it's way worse. The record for Vaelastrasza once referred to as "the guild breaker" is 16 seconds.
---
I find it very hypocritical because I've heard the sentiment that vanilla WoW had real raiding with only one difficulty setting; hard. Whereas retail is for casuals with things like LFR or that bosses went unkilled for months in vanilla and undefeated content makes a better experience etc but that couldn't be farther from the reality in Classic. I think Nef will be killed the day BWL is released. C'thun will be killed the day AQ40 is released. KT will be killed the day Naxx is released. The only reason Rag won't is because people will have to level first but I wouldn't be surprised if he's killed the first week of the game. 
---
I mean think about it. Using your for many classes one button rotation to kill a boss that either has no mechanics or you kill him so fast he doesn't even use his one mechanic yet. I raided for over 10 years consecutively from Molten Core to Hellfire Citadel and that sounds so abhorrent to what raiding is to me. The terms loot pinatas or target dummy-esque bosses come to mind.
---
People have told me that perhaps classic WoW just isn't for me if I'm looking for difficult raiding and that's such a shame because what first introduced me to my love of challenging raiding was vanilla WoW in 2004-2006. The reality is if left unchanged raiding in Classic will be the easiest rendition of raiding ever in 15 years of WoW raiding history.

I've been mostly horde for \~13 years and have decided to roll alliance this time around because I've seen the light (teehee) WRT everything paladin. I've been playing on private servers to learn the quests and...omfg the night elf starting area. Humans seem the best so far imo.
---
Alchemy is a fabulous talent and really enjoyable to level up (in my opinion). It can be difficult to level, but the pay off is tremendous.
---
I really think everyone should level a primary profession as they level. Growing your talents as an artisan only helps to cement that feeling that you're in a living, breathing world.
---
&gt;  Even if you went disk. Your heals are not going to be as high as shadow half the time.

---
I feel like they've talked about it more in the veins of "until it's no longer necessary" which in my mind would be after the 1-10 experience or maybe even later than that. 
---
Westfall and the barrens for example could perhaps need sharding on the first two days but after that people would be spread out enough so it would only be needed in the 1-10 zones.

Funny coincidence; I’m from Sweden but went to high school in Grand Rapids back in 2001. I’m sure we were best friends. 
---
Fair enough!
---
I mean that would be a true vanilla experience.
---
If you are the only lock in the raid, you will buff curse of elements and miss out on shadow - decreasing your dps, though.
---
owlmeme is fakenews btw , cat is fastest lvling 
---
How does this answer his question at all? Did you even read the OP?
---
Alliance have a "easier" time raiding as you only need 4 paladins for all blessings and they also bring BoP along with dwarf priests beinging fear ward.
---
  
---
This however doesn't mean that a Horde warlock could not be top 5 DPS on certain fights. It does mean you will need to make more liberal use of LIPs and a bear tank or DW Tank will help a lot. You might need to go for 6 piece t3 for the threat reduction once you get enough pieces. And you won't always have a shaman in your group for Tranq. Air as melee gets prefer2nce on WF most of the time.
---
In other words: you will be threat capped often but it is you'll be in the top dps on certain fights.
---
Someone did that to me, so I started doing it any time I went to Mara with new people.  Usually veterans would jump in and go along with it.
---
Its not the bosses though. Its the Hydraxian rep for the quintessence or whatever right? How fast can that genuinely be farmed? 
---
Lmao ded 
---
Rogue or Paladin for duoing with a Mage?

---
Survival and balance 
---
there are a lot of change-apologists who think progressive itemization is just an irrelevant hoax, you'd be surprised
---
Really fast, you can start farming it b4 level 60 in silithus
---
It's not an assumption. The players are playing the game and seeing how it feels and making a judgment. Some of us have played servers without these things, but the one's with that grocery list are decidedly the better game and product. 
---
Platinum WoW. Very funny guy!

Thanks OP for bringing this up, here is the album that has more comparisons if anyone is interested. Lite Overview of Progressive Itemisation https://imgur.com/a/Aiw6Yx3

Why start a journey at the end? Your gear progression matters as much as your raid progression in an mmo.
---
Hunter is very easy 1-10. It just separates the players who know how to kite and those who do not.
---
Here's the album with a few other items that appeared on here a few months back. Lite Overview of Progressive Itemisation https://imgur.com/a/Aiw6Yx3
---
If you played on EU you wouldn't know the difference. 
---
I still remember healing that fight as a low-level shadow priest. It was absolutely hardcore. Almost everbody was dead at the end of the fight.
---
BGs are team fights though, at least if you're up against a warrior, which is very unlikely to run alone. 
---
waiting for blizzard to upgrade gear in your bags is neither a journey nor progression.
---
Survival is really good for pvp. Most hunters will have more points in it than any other tree. Even having 31 points in it isn't horrible, even if giving up scattershot is a terrible decision.
---
i think he means the only *person* in the raid.
---
Name me an item that fills this criteria. If you mean bonereavers edge than you would be mistaken. Nobody is not going to use that sword until 1.12 or something. It is crazy in pve and pvp from day 1 compared to what else is available at the time always.
---
\&gt; "Blizzard probably simply"? As John Staats said, you are 100% wrong. The players before you were 100% wrong. The players after you will be 100% wrong.   
---
What that makes no sens. Whether blizzard knows the values or not is binary. It can either be yes or no, a 1 or a 0.   
---
Really? I guess this /r/unpopularopinion territory then because myself and all my classic wow friends don't enjoy this youtuber. Pretty much all of my group has expressed annoyances with his content because it feels like its stretched with very little substance. I don't have anything against the guy, but when its a 22 minute video of camera panning and casual/uneditted talking, it gives off (to me) the feeling like my time is being wasted. With the current landscape of Youtube, I have a feeling he intentionally designs his content to be on the long side to not only to rake in ad-revenue but give the facade of there being a lot of substance to the video. I should give him the benefit of the doubt but too often this is the case.
---
Contrast this to say someone like [Kagorz](https://youtu.be/Wi-7oKvOM4c?t=288) where his videos are 30+ minutes and he can barely get all of the facts and information done in that amount of time. Watching his videos feels like I'm in WOW151 at the University of Arizona, taking notes for when I have a Web-Assign online quiz due that night. It's insane how much I've learned.
---
Get some engineering toys and potions (FAP). Hunter you got to try to intercept, hamstring, stun, etc. and try kill him, that's about it as far as I know. 
---
Mages I never really got my head around, they have too much shit to keep me away if they are somewhat decent players that I could not kill them at all. But I'm not an experienced PvPer at all, so maybe it's possible. I never had engineering either, which would certainly help, but if they have it too it sort of balances out, so I don't know. 
---
Paladins can farm DM just like a mage and priest. 
---
Consecration-y good times?
---
So I’m getting feedback here summed up into “just roll pally and forget the mage farming”?
---
Pvp hunters have 30 points in survival 
---
it puts up a high-priority debuff on the target.  it is negative raid dps.

---
Hello there!
---
Someone allready linked the Warlock discord and talked about the LT vs downranking spreadsheet. The consensus of the sheet is that its never worth it to downrank Shadowbolts instead of ussing LT from a DPS pov. (Unless health is an issue).
---
Other things you want to do is use Mana potions and Dark/ Demonic Runes. These do not consume a GCD like LT does. Meaning they cut less into your DPS. First Aid also always comes in handy especially in Dung content imho to take some pressure of the healer.
---
The more geared you get the bigger your health and mana pool will get along with your LT scaling with SP. Also dependant of the fight lenght you might want to skip corr on certain mobs if it can not run its full duration. This will also safe mana.
---
Greetings Zephan
---
\&gt; Raggy's splash ability thing would 1-shot any player in greens on live   
---
I't never one 1-shot anyplayer. Full greens vs. full epic u still take the same damage since no one except tanks bring fire res gear to MC. Instead you u bring fire res pots and take the MC fire res buff from UBRS entrence if ur healers are running out of mana b4 u kill ragg.
---
So much dodge
---
I use a Logitech G600. I had a Naga but learned that Logitech actually builds mice for male adult hands and they keep working, unlike Razer products lawl.
---
There is discord dedicated to guilds forming for Classic might be worth checking there aswell: https://discord.gg/d7AZxZA
---
rogue because you can choose when to fight
---
Prot Pally could tank 5 mans with ease during the leveling phase and had no issues with the pre-MC grind. Even in MC and BWL they were the go to Mob tanks because of high aoe threat. They had their place.
---
Balance is useless until it is fully geared in cloth SP gear... then you can 1 shot people with starfire!
---
Get a pocket healer. 
---
Warlocks on pservers start off mid tier and end up as top dps along side mages further down in content.
---
But with Blizz going with 16 debuffs from the the get go aswell as 1.12 items we can expect locks to be competing almost from the get go.
---
Also as a warlock I would like to extend an Inv over to the [Classic Warlock discord](https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq)
---
Frost mage is easiest by far. Warrior struggles without a healbot, rogue is high skillcap if you plan on going toe-to-toe with people, and very unforgiving if you get caught or taken out of stealth early. Very prone to kiting. In terms of abilities all are about the same -- there's not a lot of buttons for any of these classes.
---
&gt;This technology would have allowed billions of people to access content they otherwise wouldn't be able to access.
---
Yeah that's what they said about LFR.
---
But seriously, I don't really see the point of doing that.  Yeah they could "access" it, but I don't think the product would be worthwhile.
---
0 is the importance of progressive itemization.
---
NO CHANGES, NO PROGRESSIVE ITEMIZATION.
---
does it make things easier? YES
---
does it matter? NO
---
I'm still leveling.
---
I'll have to try that.
---
If I remember by the time I get back to my computer, anyway.
---
Ima probably go mage then. Just got to get over the buff human in a dress look.
---
If it's authentic vanilla mob respawns and quest items you basically never want to party unless it's just a "kill x" quest. On the other end of the scale if there is dynamic respawns and shared quest items you'll probably spend most of the time grouped with anyone else doing the same quests.
---
Exactly! Also in a raid group you do the same raids several times over with the same group of people which really helps you all iron out those things and get on the same page.
---
I've seen successfully run PUGs of MC before, but from my experience they're only really done well and quickly when half of the pug is alts from some hardcore guild.
---
&gt; "Just tune it". That is a ton of extra work for Blizzard that will ultimately result in people just stacking more of the most OP classes (mostly due to 1.12 changes) and make it even harder for DPS hybrids to get a raid spot. We will simply stack more warriors, rogues to offset any change they make here.
---
I think this response is misguided. You are trying to make class balance the enemy of game balance.
---
If some classes are genuinely OP that is a separate problem that should get a separate solution. 
---
You also seem to assume that informed guilds are not already stacking their raids to the point of diminishing returns, but they will suddenly start doing so if raids get tuned to be challenging. That seems unlikely - they already minmax everything else, so why would they not already be minmaxing raid composition? People who clear MC in 45 minutes are clearly not the kind of people who say "we are geared, skilled and prepared enough to have this on farm let us stop trying to optimise further".
---
I think it makes far more sense for Blizzard to tune the content to be challenging with 1.12 gear and mechanics, and modern internet infrastructure. And then if some classes are so OP they genuinely break the game fix them. If not, no problem.
---
Do some solo time, and group up for elite quests and dungeons, imho.
---
I think threat is going to be your main issue. If we assume a Warlock can just go balls deep on his DPS and threat wont be an issue, sure you could top it at some points in progression.
---
But that wont happen. You're going to be held back by threat.
---
Gnome is objectively better and is the master race. Death to Talls!
---
Which false claims are these?
---
So basically 1.10+ makes initial content ezmode?
---
The advantage of larger groups is little to no downtime for eating/drinking (depending on class composition), quicker completion of slaying quests and easy completion of elite mob quests. Not to mention less tedious if you're with friends. The downside would be less experience gained from killing mobs and collection quests taking longer. Whatever the optimal leveling path may be in 1.12, I think it involves a party of 2 or 3 knowing exactly where to go and what to do. We'll find out in 6 months I guess.
---
I think it will be start area (1-12), i don't believe they will do it outside of 1-12 because it simply seems almost impossible to balance horde/alliance then. Because the barrens is all the way to lvl 28 zone, meanwhile westfall is only until lvl 16 max. If they want to do something "outside" of starting zone im sure it would just be "every zone is sharded first 72 hours" 
---
But really, i don't think they would do that would be a huge advanage for people that rush 60 because they will have such a big headstart first 72 hours
---
Okay so I have a question... for those that want progressive itemization, what's the main goal? Just to provide more challenge for world firsts before the content is nerfed?
---
I'm not being snarky, and that could be a valid reason. But, we're asking Blizzard to provide the Vanilla experience indefinitely. After Naxx, there's  nowhere else to go, unless you're after some changes after all.
---
For a fan base that is calling for our beloved world to return unchanged, it seems like a lot of people are only interested in the first "cycle" of changes that already happened. If it's too "easy" after a certain point, do you plan to keep playing?
---
I guess my point is, if you're asking Blizz to keep Vanilla up for the long haul, why are you worried about what it's like when it reaches the end state, if it's the same experience we left it in when TBC came around, which we all miss? And if that first cycle is all the hardcore players are interested in, which only a handful of the total player base will get to experience, why would they cater an entire expensive title to people who will get bored in a few years because MC is too easy?
---
Sorry if that came off as an attack, this community is bringing back something I loved and lost and I appreciate that. But I wasn't hardcore, saw some MC and ZG, and dreamed of trying BWL (before my guild died...) along with most players at the time. I know the meta has changed at the top tier, and "everyone" can clear MC in greens these days, but it's unreasonable to expect a long term lifespan of this game if you think they are designing the experience around the relative few that can genuinely complete it with ease.. 
---
honestly, it's just after the blizzard hate train cause of all the events that happend, everyone is suddenly like "everything will go wrong now" it's pretty dumb but that's just how it is. I understand people being sceptic tho and wanting to make sure what the community want/don't want but so much of it is blind hate without any reasoning.
---
Crazy shit like being able to bind one button to heal the raid member on lowest health without having to target? Or one button to decurse any target within a give priority list order without having to target?  
---
Or cast sequence macros that mean you could have one button rotations because the API had basically no restrictions? 
---
Why do people not remember vanilla like it was? You say add-ons are crazy now, back then we didn't have to even play the game.
---
Just choose female then, suits the cloth classes better for human :D

It’s tier 1 in mc/bwl and tier 2 in aq/1st half of naxx, them tier 1 again late naxx, 4 horsemen is one of the best fights for hunters in game. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg&amp;t=12s
---
I was one of hunters. My guild ran with 2 hunters mostly, sometimes 3. Hunters will outgear locks due to less loot competition.
---
I would give a higher nr to warlocks. Soulshards are not as bad as they are made out to be. With 0 shards it takes mybe 15 mins to get about 30 ans id you use DS here and there on trash you wont ever fall without any.

Also it is fairly "ez" to get into raids as you are wanted for curses and summons, ss and hs

Have a play around with a couple, I would. Rogue you might find easier in many ways, simply because you can escape and pick your battles more. I loved my rogue back in the day. But mages have some great abilities.
---
Warriors are a lot of work, and a long grind to get to high level. But they can be a pain in the arse to fight against if they're played by a skilled player.
---
This! We are starting with patch 1.12... Can we leave at that. 
---
I guess the main thing holding me back is being a broke bitch, where warrior and mage are polar opposites in terms of potential. Ease of leveling is also night and day.
---
You saw a rogue and didn't die? Impossible!! 
---
The one with more skill :)
---
They are all a bad choice for a new player, but the Mage is by far the easiest spec for PVE, the most wanted in raids, the most wanted dps in dungeons and with Frost spec you just hard counter certain classes without having to be skilled. You will have to be skilled to beat others though. Do not touch elemental spec until you have mastered frost. 
---
Mage also has the best quality of life. Water/food is free, they farm gold the best, so they can easily afford respecs in between raids and pvp. 
---
If you really want a faceroll spec for pvp that is also wanted in raids (still have to repsec like everyone). Lock SL spec (and you can google soul link pvp spec vanilla) and find forums talking about it with links to the spec, is probably it. Mage, Warrior and Rogue not so much. Rogue is probably the absolute worst choice for any new player. You will never get in dungeons, you will never get in raids and in 1.12 you are in way overpowered. You are GOOD, but you aren't facerolling anyone. 
---
I would say this though. Vanilla WoW takes a long time to level and you have lots of time to grow as a player and incorporate keybinds. If you are good with keybindings, know how to strafe and have a gaming mouse don't be afraid to play something you really want to. It may take time to learn it and get great at it, but you are going to have that time. If you are older or maybe have health problems or something then I would  probably go with the lock. Locks still have lots of buttons but you have time to think, movement is not all that important and they have some really fun specs for when you get better that do take skill. Locks are very underrated in Vanilla WoW imo. So are druids, but druids are one of the hardest classes to learn in PvP and there is no real training wheel spec.
---
Ima noob just trying to find out. So they are both the same? The gear scaling thing dont matter? 
---
not ezmode. It just renders some content and item drops irrelevant (including some drops off raid bosses in MC / BWL). 
---
personally I hope that the 1.10 itemisation patch is not in at release (and potentially not ever put in, or at least not put in in the same way). I think it was a mistake back in 2006 and one of the nice things about Classic is that they can avoid the mistakes of the past.  
---
Just trying to tell you that you should probably play both classes till lvl 15-20 and then decide yourself because its more impotant to play class YOU like and not listen to others 👍🏻
---
Hunter's damage doesn't scale very well with the high-level gear.
---
Ah. He's hilarious. When he started talking about the shotgun to the stomach I lost it. 
---
What exactly does that mean anyway?
---
It definitely helps you to kill bosses if you have better gear, nobody can dispute that. My main concern is how you lose so many gearing milestones because of it, so many of your gear slots just never get upgraded with the game all figured out and in 1.12 state.
---
I'm not exactly sure how it is for hunters in PvP, but with the PvE gear in the final two raids, Hunter's have pretty weak DPS. Basically Hunters have very good damage for the first couple raids (MC, BWL), but they are not very effective in the final two raids (AQ, Naxx). Basically they're brought along for utility because their damage is so meh. Mages can top the charts, and are the best AoE class.
---
I'm not exactly sure how this all translates to PvP, but at the end of the day it'll most likely come down to player skill, and not gear.
---
In a 1v1, mage usually wins. In a group situation, hunter can make a mage's life misery. In both cases there's a really high skill ceiling so it's mostly down to gear, context, and skill.
---
I wouldn’t worry about it. if you’re having fun in a party then play in a party.
---
Adding on to the other reply, Hunters don't get any significant upgrades to gear after bwl. Mages do.
---
Hunters can freely move and use spells in vanilla right?
---
I tried playing on private servers and it turns out I just fucking love vanilla wow.
---
Verdant Keeper's Aim. Solid bow that does perfectly well right up until it's replaced with Blackcrow or Carapace Spine Xbow.
---
&gt; collection quests taking longer. 
---
Exponentially longer.
---
&gt; We'll find out in 6 months I guess. I'd love to read some peoples' theory crafting on this matter.
---
All Vanilla leveling guides *and* pserver guides say it's objectively less efficient to level in a group.
---
Make Staysafe watch this, so he fixes his mic issue,
---

---
Happy birthday Esfand.
---
&gt;I think it was a mistake back in 2006 and one of the nice things about Classic is that they can avoid the mistakes of the past.
---
If only...
---
Not aimed shot. It’s a 3 second cast. And you have to stand still for multi to go off. No traps in combat either you have to FD.
---
I’d recommend hunter over mage. Higher skill ceiling imo, tankier by nature, pet op, the list goes on.
---
Also night elf hunter is seriously strong with shadowmeld out in the world.
---
Is hunter as strong as a mage in 1v1 situations?
---
&gt; I can do 5 lock outs in 15 minutes
---
So 3mins per run, with logout, camp and moving back into the instance. You would have to pull every pack to get that done and even then its cutting close.
---
[Vanquisher's Sword](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10823) it's my third favorite sword model in Vanilla.
---
Why do questions, albeit noob questions, get downvoted and shitty memes get upvoted on this sub?
---
that overview of destruction at 3:40 is just fucking amazing.
---
Not an expert, but like the guy above said, it makes some items irrelevant. For example a weapon like Arcanite Reaper is very strong, so famous that it became a heirloom weapon.  Someone has to make it with 20 arcanite bars, which themselves have 2 days cooldown.  Then a year later they release Alterac Valley and the Ice Barbed Spear reward, which is so easy to get its like free.  Ruined two entire industries.
---
That's just one example, but it's the same with many other items.  Just look at the lists above of all the OP stuff they released later on that made past items irrelevant.
---
It doesn't matter for top end guild since they can clear MC in quest green.
---
Your first paragraph says it all. Yes, it's to experience the game as it was then. It's all about the journey which is why so many people fell in love with the game. The build up should be slow and steady over the life of the game one patch at a time.
---
Starting out at 4/12 and jumping right into 6/12 then, 9/12 and ending on 12/12 isn't that fluid. It devalues things before it, earlier in the patch cycle or makes it completely obsolete right from the start. You then miss out on those little things that made it great. 
---
that overview of the destruction at 3:40 is just fucking amazing.
---
Tips Out is going to get me through this trying time waiting for classic to release.
---
The idea is that you always have somewhere to go for upgrades until Naxx. Dungeon Gear should be worse than Molten Core gear, MC gear should be worse than BWL gear and so on. It's not about challenge as such, it's about maximizing the amount of upgrades to be had.
---
Shadowbolt debuff doesnt stack. 1 warlock gives the same bonus as 5 of them
---
You get downvoted but its true. You could only possibly top the meters late in the game. So lets say Naxx. Competent and geared warriors will always be ahead of you (at least few of them that dont offtank) and the mage with most ignite damage will also be higher than you. Its realistic to be top 5, but never the best dps in raid.
---
Mage for lategame. Hunter for early
---
That doesnt tell much how they compare in endgame
---
Why are other people saying hunter? Tankier, pet op??
---
I've been waiting for an opportunity to say how much I hate the Ice Barbed Spear and that AV quest in general!! Like jesus talk about throwing a lot of really cool items out the window. :/
---
So yeah, here comes
---
I hate the Ice Barbed Spear.
---
...and if I were to make a change to Classic, I would remove or at least severely nerf all of those quest rewards.
---
Different goals I think.
---
Some days I want to relax and watch something interesting m.
---
Other days I’ll watch informational stuff like you suggest. Both are good at different times or for different audiences.
---
Hunters were bottom tier of the "pure dps" classes, they scaled terribly.  Like they were better than any of the hybrids, but you didn't want to bring more than what was needed for tranq shot.
---
Arms warriors were also not great unless you were Horde because of Windfury totem (which also boosted Fury Warriors to be even better). Fury Warriors were the best DPS spec for most of the game because they scaled better than anyone else thanks to how rage worked.  You are correct though that threat was one of the biggest roadblocks for warrior DPS.
---
I C BAJS forsen1
---
Literally noone says Itemisation DOESNT make things easier. Everyone knows it makes things easier.
---
But a lot of us truly believe it doesnt matter at all. The itemisation is as it was in 1.12, which means Naxx will still be as comparatively hard as always, AQ40 will still be pretty darned tricky and dependant on nature res gear which didnt change, and MC will be an easymode introductory raid.
---
It doesnt matter that MC will be faceroll easy. For most people nowadays MC will always be considered faceroll easy, and not because of the itemisation, but because of the mechanics. Each boss had a maximum of two mechanics to look forward to, compared to the multiple complex dances and reactionary things present in the average 5man nowadays let alone 40 man.
---
The average MMO skill of most people will also have gone up massively. Everyone will know what to expect and probably 80%+ of people going into MC will have already cleared it in Vanilla or at least run through it at high level for glams.
---
I guarantee if you take the average MC group that will be going into MC in Classic when it releases, you could give them all 1.9 level items and worse and they'd still feel like the instance was faceroll. Not because of their stats, but because of the knowledge and skill of the community.
---
In addition, if the 1.12 talents persist from launch, there's absolutely no point in having progressive itemisation anyway because you've already spoiled the original feel of MC due to that. At no point in the game's life did we have 1.12 talents with 1.9 items.
---
It's pointless trying to work out ways to introduce progressive itemisation when you'll never truly capture the original difficulty anyway. Let MC be the faceroll dungeon you go to for nostalgia and a shot at some awesome items like bonereavers, bindings and the talisman. It'll still be FUN. 
---
Having progressive itemisation will introduce a massive issue that was NOT present in Vanilla - lots of people will know what items are GOING to turn into in 1.12, so you'll have a strange dichotomy of people needing/rolling on items that suck for them because they know it'll become far better in a few months time. You'll have people going on Strat/UBRS runs with a big website open and making the group pause every drop to look up what a drop WILL turn into and stopping to see if they need it, rather than just choosing the item as-is based on what they see.
---
I'd rather just have all the items drop as they do in 1.12, to match the 1.12 talents. Let the early raids be easy, because when Naxx was out the raids WERE easy. it's a SNAPSHOT, a museum piece, they'll never replicate the exact feeling of difficulty of progression and for more reasons than just the itemisation.
---
Thing is though, everyone will still KNOW that the Ice Barbed Spear exists and is coming. The knowledge that they can just get an IBS when AV arrives will still be there, so the Arcanite Reaper industry is just as in danger even if they delay it. People will still make Reapers for nostalgia anyway though, and they are SLIGHTLY better thn the IBS stat-wise so it's not like it makes the item irrelevant.
---
Doesnt mean much. Hunters have good burst which is more relevant to sustained pve dps
---
If your a noob you will have a hard time with both.  Especially hunter requires a lot of skill to be good. 
---
But im only looking at pvp wise. 
---
What would u reccomend?
---
Because they like hunter fornone thing. They are also talking at least partially about pvp. 
---
While playing a Hunter on a private server I was contemplating how easy it would be to hook it up to the big screen in my room, program a PS4 controller with all the necessary binds, and go to town with a left stick moves right stick controls the cursor setup.
---
Still thinking about it.
---
It doesn't change, those are always rumors and they've been there at every new expansion.
---
Mages are kind of squishy. Hunters are harder to kill in terms of armor —&gt; tankier. Pets are, well, kind of OP. Sometimes you might even have a good laugh as your pet solo’s the enemy! 
---
I’ve been watching Congelatore’s playthroughs recently. He also streams. 
---
I’ve also tuned into SoupaSoka’s playthroughs as well. 
---
Both are really good. Gear scaling doesn't matter too much in PvP, most PvPers don't have super high end gear. 
---
I believe it’s because of how much xp you lose that you would normally get if you did the quests solo. People on my pserver sometimes get annoyed when I don’t group while questing. Then they later wonder how I level so much faster. I only group for elite quests that other people happen to be doing. If there’s no one else around and I can’t solo it I skip it.
---
It's a valid concern, I think many people here are worried Blizz will screw up in some way.
---
I feel like Blizz will change the drop rates of these items if anything. 
---
Even to the level that if an item is too strong at launch maybe the bosses won't have it in their loot table until a later 'patch'
---
Vanilla hunter is quite interesting. You’ll find it awesome if you like a challenge. 
---
Deadzone is the area between the min range of ranged abilities (10yrds) and the max range of melee abilities (5yrds). It’s how hunters are balanced and it adds a lot of interesting ganeplay for hunters and even more so his adversaries...
---
Autoshot weaving is the thing that hunters can move or use abilities BETWEEN autoshots, but must stand still for a brief moment to get the autoshot off. Again, this leads to a high skill ceiling, challenge and fun to the class. Hunter has one of the more interesting raid dps rotation. 
---
Beastmastery is the best leveling spec in vanilla, period. 
---
Raid damage scaling is one of the weaker points of hunters. Their damage doesn’t scale that well with gear. But, they are needed in raids, who, from my research, often bring about two hunters. Being a good hunter is important. 
---
Huntards is a derogatory term for hunters who are bad at their class, leading to frustration and hate mail from other players. A good hunter stands out. I love playing with good hunters - their bag of tricks is so cool and useful! The best survivalist class hands down.
---
Don’t let anyone persuade you to not play hunter due to the less good scaling - there’s so much more to the game, and good consistent hunters get raid spots all day in vanilla.
---
Gearing competition pre-bis may be a thing, but no more than warriors and rogues.
---
#typicalroguebehavior
---
Nightfall is the axe you're thinking of!
---
Every sub.
---
Whats the best spec for end game. Hunter pvp? Do racials matter? How are hunters in 1v1 pvp situations?
---
Only everything except aimed and multi.
---
Yes they are
---
10-15k was concurrent players as you said, according to wikipedia 150k were active while total registered account were 800k.
---
I really love the cruel barb but I doubt ill run DM. The barb makes leveling early so much easier.
---
Are you sure? Cuz if they are id rather hunter then mage just due to appearence &amp; and i dont like the cloth dresses.
---
I don't like people
---
Why not wait till we know literally anything about servers aside from the fact they will exist. It’s impossible till we get more info. 
---
If Arcanite Reaper is the best BOE wep you can buy for several months, there most definitely will be a healthy market for it.
---
I had that on my hunter! 
---
It was the first peice of mail gear so made sense at the time. 
---
It can be, due to coordination issues. Also, people in larger groups underestimate how much mobs they need to pull to keep up on mob xp.
---
You have to pull 3-4 times ad fast this means, you pull like crazy. You need tl attack every camp in sight without thinking twice. We are used to pulling elites in group settings - here 3-4 mobs can be a problem for five players. Out in the world, 6-8 mobs could be a problem for a three player group, depending on class comp.
---
Basically, you group will be as slow as the slowest player in it. 
---
They can't, unless they massively retune any item implemented after MC to be dogshit or to downscale all of the raid gear and make it into a rating system like the expansions.
---
Naxx already has 2crit+2hit+loads of stats+loads of AP/SP. Now, raids wouldn't need to be beyond Naxx at first, but at some point you'd need content beyond current and at that point we'd be seeing 3 hit 3 crit items, if not 4/4, 4/3 or 5/2. Yellow hit cap off 2-3 items? The hard cap might even be reachable at that point along with weapon skill cap and crit soft cap. Or we'd get "Naxxwell radiance" or something. Which imo defeats the point.
---
Stat scaling from TierX to TierX+1 is already high in Classic, an MC geared person getting BWL gear or a BWL raider getting AQ gear is a massive jump.
---
I bet she can bench more than Arnold
---
Compared to whom - dps or tanks?
---
Silly expectation. They should just add the items in their final form and tune the content to be relevant by modern standards. The content is trivial with addons and knowledge of how to complete it. "uhhh duh but you just dont use duh addons..." Okay stupid. The subtle nuances in item change are FAR less impactful than the cumulative knowledge of millions of players completing content that is over a decade old. Put the items in with the final itemization and tune the content to be FAR more challenging than it was 10 years ago and this will serve to increase the longevity of the game and offer a challenge for all of us for years to come.
---
Why do you think druids are hard to find raid spots with? There aren’t many druids, and raids want at least two. And those two will get stacked in no time at all...
---
A good PUG-host will manage his PUG like it was a guild run.
---
Nice catch, I completely forgot to mention them. Class quests are unlikely to be hardcoded into the final product because of how unimportant some of them are and how they have tendency to send you half way across the world. Every warlock should do the voidwalker quest because of how universally useful it is, but probably skip the succubus questline until 60. The same logic can be applied to most other classes.
---
What I've tried to do is visit a city around the time you should be reaching level 10, 20, 30 and 40. I'll figure out some way to signal a suggestion that class x should look into doing their class quest now. They tend to be short so it wouldn't be a whole lot of work for me to make a new section for just them that's easy to navigate.
---
If you're set on doing a specific quest you can always reference the Overview table and see around what level I'm doing the zone and decide if you want to wait or go for it right away.
---
Thanks for your input!
---
Druids.
---
Dungeon reset cap was 5 uniqe dungeon IDs per hour. It was set during vanilla but I dont recall in what patch.
---
Hunters are overall one of the stronger pvp classes, not least in 1v1. However, much depends on who get the jump on who - therefore night els hunters are the best snipers with shadow meld and stealth cat. 
---
Racials matter a little bit but meh. Orc have 25% stun resist which also kills it in pvp. Leveling BM and endgame MM is usual, but at some point with (very) good gear, hunters can switch to 21/30 survival. However there are melee hunters at that point also.
---
So you’ll have to look into it some more!! Check out Kargoz’s hunter leveling guide after watching platinum wow’s hunter how good are they vid. 
---
To literally any other role.
---
Gear does scale worse for hunters than mages. Hunters do have a deadzone that can be exploited, duels with hunters are often oriented around this deadzone (both in hunters trying to get out of the deadzone and prevent it from happening, and in the opponent trying to do it). Hunters actually have further range than casters which they can abuse as well. In 1v1 situations across the entire board, mages are superior. In group PvP, mages are also superior. In PvE dps, mages are also superior. No class comes as close to mage in overall superiority in every aspect of the game. Hunters are not bad in PvP by any means, but they are worse than mages who are the overall best PvP class.
---
Based on your other comments it seems like you prefer hunter. This is still a totally good choice, but no it isn't as good as mage.
---
Hunter in pvp is a double edged sword. If your bad you will have a very hard time because everything from skill rotation to cc to movement is hard compared to other classes. Now if your very good with it hunter can be an absolute beast in pvp. 
---
Mage is a little more forgiving. You can do reasonably well pretty easily although to be at the very top it requires quite some skill too.
---
Hunter is good in pvp - ot has a different role than mage, but it’s good and more self-sufficient. You’ll get plenty of opinions on this, but the bottom line is that although a (end game) mage typicallh beats a hunter, a well played hunter is a nightmare for most classes. 
---
Be a good boy and watch this vid now: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhX8amTi5E
---
That’s not how it was when I played vanilla - healers were easier than dps. Maybe it’s different on some ps’s...?
---
Sadly probably add more to the list 😭hope not tho 
---
I always preferred being in groups, especially if it's with friends and you're doing the same content together for long periods of time. Kill quests will fly by, but the gathering quests will take about the same amount of time because you need that many more "wolf dicks" as my friends put it (especially if the drop rates are on the lower side). And you don't really have to wait for parties to form for dungeons and elites, which you can do if you got a dry quest range. You can also be social and really have fun.
---
On private servers there were many times I multiboxed with different classes in a group. It always appeared to be the same speed of leveling solo, but you are leveling 5 guys at once.

---
every class is good in pvp, every class has atleast 1 spec they use which is good in pvp.  in the end just play what you think is fun or cool and get good.   some classes are better in 1v1, some better in groups.   none of this matters just play what you want
---
Let's see...
---
Vanilla: #1 Night Elf Priest #2 Human Priest
---
BC and Wrath: #1 Blood Elf Hunter #2 Blood Elf Paladin 
---
Cata: #1 Tauren Warrior
---
MoP: back to the hunter and then quit
---
Legion: #1 Goblin Mage and then the tauren warrior again
---
BfA: Worgen Druid mostly
---
Those were the main chars at least. Twinks had a whole set of class/race combinations over the years...
---

---
Moonkin and their dance.  All I can do is sigh. And this is coming from someone who mains prot pallies.
---
Seriously though, that moonkin dance is probably the best way to troll a corpse of any player next to cannabalizing them or humping them as a cat.
---
Hey there,
---
Although I don't know much about it myself, MadSeasonShow did a nice video on it and I totally recommend watching it.
---
You can find it over here;
---
https://youtu.be/YyFN01p2xLo
---
I think, in the end, the differences are marginal and will only play a role in try hard guilds.
---
Good luck with you decision!
---
Why are some people saying hunter? 
---
For me it's not about fastest. Owl holds AoE aggro :)
---
But for research purposes, you got source?
---
doesnt matter how classes compare if he isnt playing a class he likes
---
So what?
---
Vanilla is not about difficult raids, everything up to aq40 is just skill check, not itemization.
---
Want hardcore rading? Go top guild in retail and star rading max lvl keys and mythic raids.
---
Vanilla bosses are simple in mc/bwl, so let ur whishes for “real hardcore” be with you, because it will never happen.
---
2-3% for rogue and 4-5% for warrior seems to be the ballpark. Human is best because so many of the good weapons throughout the game are swords, and a few maces. There's a few axes but still a lot less than swords. How much it matters depends on the person I guess. It would be a similar jump to getting a full tier upgrade to your main hand weapon I'd guesstimate.
---
Do you want to be pushing progression as the #1 guild on a competitive server? Min/max everything. And yes that weapon skill is noticeably impactful at the highest levels.
---
To be reductionist, if you're a top top top raider you probably have strong feelings about bringing a "meme spec" (aka any healing class in a non-healing role) to your raid, because you aren't there to carry someone playing "for fun". So why should your raid carry your dwarf rogue instead of a human rogue playing to win?
---
All other scenarios: play whatever you want. This applies to like 99% or more of the playerbase.
---
Only you can know how hardcore you plan to be. Personally I let RP be a big factor in my race choice, and that is fine for the kind of raiding I'll be doing!
---
Dont remember excactly how it was in classic, but should be like this:
---
Defense gives 5 different stats - reduced Chance to get hit and crit, more parry, more dodge, more block (if shield). For each Point of defense you get 0.04% increase for These towards the 5% base Chance against a enemy the same Level.
---
For each Level above yours, they have 1% more Chance with everything.
---
60 = 5%
---
61 = 6%
---
62 = 7%
---
63 = 8% (Bosses are 63)
---
Since most Bosses dont have shields and you will attack from behind anyways, block and parry not relevant here. Its about dodge, miss and crit.
---
So your base Chance to miss a Boss is 8%, his dodge Chance is 8% and you have a 8% reduced Chance to crit.
---
5 weapon skills will give you 0.20% improvement (5x0.04). Therefore your Chance to miss is only 7.8%, his dodce Chance is 7.8% and the reduced crit Chance also goes to 7.8.
---
TLDR: every 1 weapon skills gives 0.04 Chance against miss, dodge, parry, block and reduced crit Chance.
---
5 weapon skill Bonus gives +0.2% hit Chance, -0.2% reduced dodge for the enemy and +0.2% crit Chance for you
---
If you're a fury warrior who manages to get their hands on edgemaster's then you can get away with being pretty much any race. But that's a long shot. For rogues I'd say it matters far less because they get a bonus +5hit from talents anyway so they have a much easier time being in that sweet spot of having the right amount of +hit.
---
Yeah, a lot has changed over the past 14 years.
---
Seems like every man and his dog now has a healer because of how scarce they were back in the day.
---
Tanks are in the highest demand now, followed by DPS.
---
I was going to post some current chat data to back this up but it's kind of a shit time for it ATM. Less than 30mins before Ony and ZG resets so most players are logged off and waiting for the reset or madly trying to get DMT buffs before their raids.

---
UBRS is about the only exception to this. But that's because there's not much loot in there for healers so not many want to run it.
---
Mage is boring in raids. It's spam click one button. On the other hand having little to no accountability is nice.
---
Agreed.
---
I know I'm a good hunter, and there's something fun about being an asset because of your skill. I'll still roll something else too no doubt. Still undecided on that front.
---
What’s your opinion on RP-PvP vs RP servers. As far as your preference goes, where do you see yourself for classic, and why?
---
Legitimately curious as I’ve been debating between the two myself.
---
You multi-boxed 5 characters?
---
What’s your opinion on RP-PvP vs RP servers. As far as your preference goes, where do you see yourself for Classic, and why?
---
I don't think servers will die without the ability to transfer.
---
Transfers make it so if you kinda don't like your server, then you move. Without transfers, you need to full reroll, so people will tough it out.
---
Just go the faction your guild/friends are going. Both Orcs and Humans are amazing for Warriors. 
---
Swing timer
---
Mostly on wow sub. Im joined other subs to but i don't get as much dislikes as here when my opinion is not the same as yours. 
---
I wonder how much they'll sell for.
---
You forget to factor in, that increased weapon skill reduces the penalty of glancing blows. Against a boss you have like 40% chance to do a glancing blow, which does significantly less damage than a normal swing. Once you have +15 weapon skill, or 315 in total, that effect is nullified, meaning that 40% of your attacks will no longer do ~30-40% less damage, but will instead do the same damage as a normal hit.
---
I might be wrong but I don't think you can feed any pet with mage food
---
In 1v1, they probably got scatter trap aimshot'd too many times, which feels incredibly oppressive especially in the early game or if you're being jumped. The skill floor for hunter is definitely higher than mage (because of scatter shot, trap, aim shot), both probably have similar skill caps. Duels and wPvP are different. Especially for hunters who get their kiting abilities gimped by the duel area. In wPvP kiting is ungimped and surprise is more of a factor. 
---
In group PvP, their position is completely indefensible. 5 mages can wipe unsuspecting raids, 5 hunters wont. They have different roles in BGs but mages can do it all, with hunters only being better at defense (in non-AV where mage is definitely better).
---
This is how we are doing it, solo questing/grinding till we are all of the level we need for dungeons then form up. Seems like a great way to level.
---
&gt; For rogues I'd say it matters far less because they get a bonus +5hit from talents anyway so they have a much easier time being in that sweet spot of having the right amount of +hit.
---
Isn't it also just as much about glancing blows as it is about hit chance?

You cant nerf knowing what you know now compare to what you did back then... 
---
MC and BWL was hard because everything was new, now everything is a spreadsheet... pre bis gear and so on..
---
the first lvl 60 will be within the first 2 weeks, the week after MC will be cleared and so on...
---
Atleast 1.12 will give us some more balance to the classes and teaks.. so we dont have all the "useless specs" 
---
Yes but the more warlocks you have the higher the uptime on the debuff. Basically if it's up at all times you get 20% more damage for free which is really nice. I think you need something like 5+ locks to reach 100% uptime
---
&gt;Yes, it's to experience the game as it was then.
---
Guy in your group will refuse to roll on item that is good for him, because he knows it will be crap in 3 months. Other guy will spend his DKP on an item that is worse than what he currently has, because he knows it will be buffed.
---
How is that for "the game as it was then"?
---
There is the will to revive a gaming classic, and there is dumb extremism to the point of Trumpian mental gymnastics that ignore reality. The people advocating for progressive Itemization on classic, are doing the latter.
---
No there won't be.
---
People are lazy. People don't want to work for something they already know will be shit in a few months. They will rather spend their gold and time on things that will still be useful then.
---
You, like the rest of the extremist crowd here, are deluding yourself.
---
&gt;  I think it's smarter of Blizzard to appease the semi-hardcore crowd than the 1%.
---
Please give this man a reward, because he gets it.
---
I disagree
---
Well i guess you need to level up a mage then, you can go warrior later. It's indeed the far more forgiving class, and if classic is to stay forever, you can always level whatever you feel like after.
---
The utility, the farming and dependency on gear are indeed far superior to the warrior.
---
It's not that the tech is worse, it's far better, but there are more cost-reducing options now and Blizzard seems to have picked them which comes with a trade-off.
---
Sudden, high load change that is hard to predict means that the necessary resources for the service might not be allocated. But you can increase the base resources if wanted, although that costs money.
---
Stop blaming engineering, science always goes forward. Service quality, not always. 
---
Get fuck
---
There is an even more straightforward technique. All melees stack where the tank is on the wall so they dont get pushed back and all just go all out on DPS making it a DPS race vs the farts. Either the healer can keep all three alive in the gas or you just die. 
---
Always makes for a fun fight.
---
I know the IBS is coming in 6 months time so why bother upgrading my weapon? Thats such a silly thing to think. No I wont have a green weapon for 6 months just becasue IBS will come out at some point but I sure as hell wont be going near crafted gear if its there and avalible to me. 
---
Fuck yeah youre right, I always forgot glancing blows ...
---
Super EZ mode. 
---
Did she have the trophy on her head in vanilla too? Never seen that 
---
I'm okay with it continuing to scale high, though it can be mitigated to curve out and not be exponential. Levels made power scaling exponential relative to lower level gear, and instantly made even high-tier gear worthless from the previous expansion.
---
If you have each raid tier have gear that is, say, 20% better than the last (based on the originating MC gear) version, even after 10 raids, that's only 200% stronger. Very noticeable, but you won't be soloing MC with that. Even after 50 raids, you won't solo it. 
---
Alexensual , but lookout I'll get downvoted because he's edgy
---
Right:)
---
Goddamn you're right... hey it looks like there was a need for healers on Deadmines... guess people are catching on not to level more healers:-)
---
The earlier the progression, the higher the damage from orc/hu in comparison to other races. 
---
On Nostalrius with crap items in the beginning it was something like 13%. Later in Naxxgear trolls overtake orcs, because warriors will not use as many white attacks anymore and the strong items arent axes. You have so much rage that you cleave/HS on cooldown generating bucketloads of rage per non HS/cleave swing and off offhand and WF. 
---
The big name pservers were suprisingly accurate on items like arcane crystals, enchanting materials etc. and on these servers they went for 800-1300g. So it's not too bad seeing that lionheart costs about 300-500g, Arcanite Reaper \~600-800g, Stronghold gauntlets 400g.
---
conjoured food and water...

No changes

---
If you actually played nost you'd know there's a market of tryhards that will pay autistic amounts of gold for a 1% damage boost. The scarcity of loot in a 40 man promotes competition between players to the point they will do anything for an edge over their peers.
---
Whirlwind Axe then Ironfoe.
---
&gt; Raids will simply be pugged until at least AQ. 
---
There will be pug raids up and including NAXX. But it doesnt mean there wont be guilds. There are numerous guilds that have most of the people lined up ready for the launch as we speak.
---
You know what REALLY killed WoW retail ? People fucking complaining in forums, asking for changes that THEY wanted. Its the same story again. Blizzard WONT make 1:1 copy of vanilla, its going to be a remastered version with some changes. You can either just accept it or get the fuck out and play on your favorite private server (or setup one for you and your friends).
---
Blizzard lost the game when they started actually listening of the complaints and making changes based on POPULARITY of forum threads. As people saw it, everyone wanted something. After that it wasnt a blizz controlled development, it was more the people who shouted most got what they wanted. And those people we today call casuals. Theres just MORE of them, so they will start complaining, "that other guy plays more than me and gets advantage because of it, make it more fair". "its hard to find groups, giev LFG and LFR" "the raids are too hard, giev easier versions of them".
---
I say to blizzard, figure out what you NEED to do to get this thing as close as you can to the original with the changes you NEED to make and release it. And after that dont change a fucking thing. No matter how much people complain.
---
On a private server Ragnaros died within a week of Server release. It was blizzlike 1.12, well scripted and not with 1.10 items. This "Pug" just took the first 40 people who hit 60 on the server (not sure but i think there have been even some 59 and 58 in the raid) popped some fire resistance pots which they farmed on their way to 60 and killed him.  
---
Now imagine 1.10 items and this will be a walk in the park even for non hardcore players.
---
Could I skip ally mage for warlock? 
---
Dear experts. I am pretty sure I will play a mage, but there is a few problems with that: Time restraints, specifically leveling time and loot competition. Played a mage and a warlock to 60 in vanilla, so I know what to expect game-play wise, and the main reason I prefer mage is that I will probably enjoy it more than a warlock, although warlock is quite enjoyable for me as well. I am fairly confident that I could level a warlock a bit faster than a mage, but I am out of the loop when it comes to loot competition, especially in raids.   
---
Any clarification and context about ally mages/warlocks when it comes to gearing? How much less time does it take for ally warlocks to get purple as compared to mages?
---
The values assigned to both Leveling speed and Raid/Dungeon seem a bit off. Not sure, what you base them on.
---
The Raid/Dungeon values might be somewhat correct for lower level dungeons, but are far off for almost all raid bosses.
---
I hate that you can have characters on both factions on private servers
---
No. Because plenty of people did raids like that back then in Vanilla, and there will still be people doing that today. Not with you or your friends or other elitists of course, but there will be other people ok with that, and that will also clear most of the content. Slower, yes, but still clearing it.
---
So it's viable.
---
&gt;I think it makes far more sense for Blizzard to tune the content to be challenging with 1.12 gear and mechanics, and modern internet infrastructure.
---
This is where we are going wrong. Everyone knows its going to be 1.12 patch talents. Because of private servers almost all accept this. But now you are asking for changes to actual content data ? Just plain no. If you "tune" bosses, why not tune certain talents, oh and when you are doing that why not do minor talent changes to balance things out. Giev prot pallys a taunt to make them viable.
---
If you start messing with actual data, you open up the argument, well if you are changing A, why cant we change B ? And then you are on your way back to retail wow.
---
There is always a way to make content challenging. For most its not going to be IF you kill the boss, but how fast you do it.
---
For rogues it's not that huge amount of deal because you get +5 weapon skill from the talents anyways, the difference is going to be about 2-3%. 
---
Important note is that weapon skill scales non-linearly, so the difference between 310 and 305 is less impactful that 300 and 305, which is the case of warriors. 
---
According to your setup and buffs weapon skill could make 7-9% difference in DPS. But this does not mean that you are making an irreversible mistake by rolling something non-orc or human, you can get really close by certain workaround methods like 2h fury, Edgemaster's Handguards, dagger fury etc. 
---
...but she's just right for me!
---
Very - and the people who come back after not having played wow for ages will also be pretty slow and behind. It will be totally fine, and ps players are likely going to be spread out of all of the servers mostly. So I wish you a good time...
---
Completely accessible in my opinion. There’s a lot of min/max talk in here but wow is way more than that. 
---
WoW was my first and only MMO and yes there is a lot to learn but the pace of levelling in vanilla and learning new skills and talents along the way really helps people learn as they go. 
---
Once you have the basics there are so many resources that can help you improve certain aspects of your play but only if you want to.
---
of course good players will steamroll content.
---
But apart from mc there wont be a boss in classic that survives more than 2h after it is released. AQ should be ~45min and naxx just under 2 hours to clear. There is simply no place for hardcore PvE in unbuffed vanilla raids.
---
Which is going to dissapoint a lot of players. If you're not into autistic speedrunning vanilla actually has very litle to offer in terms of raids.
---
As a hunter I loved this. When PvPing near Auberdine/Astranaar you can swim away from trouble and drown those stupid enough to follow
---
Warning: Long, heavy post. Apologies in advance, I'm writing this late at night in a somewhat emotional state.
---
I have a lot to be grateful to Blizzard and WoW for.
---
I started during the early days of Burning Crusade, right before I left for college. I was coming off of the "wild" phase of my life, and moving into adulthood. My first semester of college was incredible - I got an amazing new girlfriend, I had a full scholarship, I was motivated, making good grades, and enjoying leveling my little Undead warrior in my downtime. I had so much fun and made so many friends in the time I'd put into the game. I hit max level during the Christmas break, and had even convinced my girlfriend to start playing with me.
---
My second semester of college wasn't so great. The winter months left me severely depressed and my college major (engineering) saw a difficulty spike like boss enraging in Naxx40. I lost a close family member, my grades slipped, and eventually I stopped going to class altogether. I know it wasn't healthy, but the only thing that kept me going was WoW and my friends there. My girlfriend stuck with me, but I hid the really dark parts of my life from her and she didn't know how bad it was until much later. I felt as though nothing in my life could go right.
---
But WoW was different. That puny-looking Undead warrior had become a juggernaut. I scraped and clawed my way through 5-mans in PUGs until I was geared enough to raid. I was a DAMNED good tank. I was incredible at PvP. People on my server knew and LIKED me. I was not just a heavily geared behemoth to be feared by the Alliance and raid bosses alike - I was a welcome member of my community that was besieged with whispers and offers to tank instances or shore up an arena team. The world outside my window was sullen and dark, but it was always sunny in Orgrimmar.
---
If it wasn't for WoW, I would have most definitely, **without a doubt** taken my own life. In Azeroth, I felt important, useful, and loved. That got me through the lowest valley until I could turn my life around and be happy again. Maybe that sounds pathetic, but WoW is the reason that I'm still alive today.
---
Next - my college girlfriend and I were together for 7 years, well beyond my time with WoW. But the happiest years of our relationship were our poorest, when we played WoW (we played until right after ICC came out in WOTLK - we ran the Icecrown 5mans but never killed Arthas before we quit). We ran dailies and instances together. We quested together. I crafted jewels for her with my materials, and she used hers to make sure I had top-of-the-line enchantments. I always had an intervene macro situated just for her - I wouldn't let her die as long as I drew breath. I would fly out to remote areas to kill rogues that griefed her while she was questing. She would throw in-game birthday parties for me and invite all of my WoW friends to celebrate with us. We had common goals that we strived toward together. We were an unstoppable team, and our relationship was never as good after WoW as when we played together. We loved one another, but time took its toll and we drifted apart without that common strife. But when we were in the shoes of that undead warrior and blood elf mage, we were fiercely in love. 
---
I also met the only other woman (aside from aforementioned girlfriend) that I've ever loved in my life through WoW. She was one of the first friends I ever made in the game, a female undead priest that helped me with heals at a low level. We were both in college at the time, at the same level in the game, had similar tastes in books/movies/comics, and were both really into Warcraft lore. That blossomed into a friendship that lasted for our entire time with the game at all levels, but also well beyond it. We finally met in person after we both experienced breakups around the same time,  and we fell in love. It was the beginning of a wonderful relationship. In real life, she was my most honest critic and my biggest fan. She loved me and encouraged me in everything I did - I owe so much of the man I am today to her influence and support. She passed away last year - far, far too young. And while it is sad, I am grateful for the time I had with her, and I owe every moment of it to World of Warcraft.
---
I owe my life and so many of my happiest memories to the time I put into WoW and the incredible people it brought me closer to. I'm hoping that WoW Classic will remind me of those good times just once more, and maybe give me a few more worth telling stories about.
---
I look sexy..
---
It really **doesn't** matter, honestly.  
---
No one who's going to play Classic is going to do it with a blank slate.  
---
If you pick up someone who started playing WoW just last month, they already know where to go to get all the detailed information and what to do, where to go, what to equip, how to kill bosses.  
---
Some will play Classic with a half-close eye, because they were not there at the time, but short of increasing mobs' health and damage, there's no way to make it "difficult" and "a new experience", it will be just classic wow, just like any vanilla pserver, but official.
---
Rogue and warlock  is a solid Rookie pic imo.  Dominant toolkit and not too complex
---
I wouldn't base my class decision only on experience gathered during privat realm raiding.
---
I've heard the difficulty of raid boss encounters varies a lot depending on the realm.
---
In vanilla I mained a mage, and our locks didn't get to shine untill the end. Mostly cause of the debuff limit.
---
However, by the end of vanilla we used more locks than mages in our raids, cause they simply did more DPS.
---
I was told by another guy mage is the best but i feel like only in the right hands and not a noob? 
---
Why wouldn't it be accessible to new players? The rate to which you level is all up to you. 
---
It's true if you are casual you won't ever likely see Naxx or even AQ. MC, ZG and even BWL can be done by casual guilds eventually. 
---
I'm expecting 1-10 and I'm fine with that. Beyond would be disappointing I think, even though early barrens is just 'kill all the mobs'. 
---
This is from a private server with player caps far beyond vanillas
---
If it gets too heavy they will just open a new server with free transfers. It's how they dealt with it before
---
As everyone said you are threat capped. You pulling aggro off the tank to try and top the charts in a boss fight won't be tolerated for long. Esp BWL and on ward.  A careless Warlock is worthless to the raid.
---
Reroll another class if your whole goal is to top the charts 
---
An enthusiastic newbie who's willing to listen will be cherised in any guild that's not a hardcore world-first type. You'll be fine. Also the mechanics for most classes when it comes to raiding usually aren't too difficult - it's pvp where you see the insanity that's possible for some rare people.
---
Because my previous experience of WoW when i joined and played during cata was because I didn't know the mechanics of even 5 man levelling dungeons or exactly how to play my class (mage usual then switched to hunter) to the max potential I was a newbie scrub. 
---
So my assumption is this is going to be far worse as most people will be able to do the content in their sleep. I'm fine with being wrong about this and hope it's not if I decide to commit to the game. 
---
Separate sets of gear are enough to avoid respeccing outside of 40mans usually.
---
I think you answered your own question.
---
They are both equally good. 
---
But of course non caster classes require better gear to stay competitive. Mages can generally get away with lesser gear if you are a good player. 
---
I think, population will top somewhere between 2-3 million players in the first months, most of which will quit before reaching lvl40. My prediction is somewhere around a 60% drop off within the first 3-4 weeks, then another 20% within 4-6 weeks after launch.
---
Around the 3-4 month mark (maybe even earlier) we should see a more stable population, once the remaining tourists have left.
---
And it never actually worked, because a server community quickly becomes tightly knit and impossible to untangle.
---
any hunter pve/pvp
---
How can you say getting a raiding spot as Druid is a 2? It is one of the easiest classes to get a raid spot as, in my experience. Partially because there are so few of them.
---
Anything that is not a Rogue or Warrior has a pretty easy time to get into a raiding guild.
---
I would not worry this much about the leveling speed. I would just enjoy the journy to max lvl by doing a bunch of dungeons etc. The "leveling speed" is just about how fast you can grind mobs and travel to next questing area basically.
---
If you want the "real" answer, Dwarf Priest is fast lvling with Wand spec and super easy to get dungeons and raid spots with.
---
Hard to become tightknit with super size servers. Plenty of large guilds moved so they could dominate. This is even more important for the Sceptre of the Shifting Sands
---
I mean you won't be the only one whose never done vanilla before. I wouldn't sweat it too much. Just don't be going around pulling mobs by accident in instances and nobody will care. 
---
There's plenty of guides and videos out there that you can watch.
---
Have good situational awareness and more importantly have fun!
---
What about those of us who don't care about getting new shoulders that are slightly better for the 100th time but still want to experience the content?
---
Grinding for gear isn't the main reason everyone plays. It might be for some but not everyone. 
---
I remember the first time I encountered Drek'Thar. I was Warlock and thought he was a player guarding the last place to capture, I thought Drek'Thar's building was just another bunker to capture. So I just ran in and started dotting him up and running back out to my team. Didn't quite make it that far.. auwch my face.
---
It shouldn't be hard to get in. Pick whatever class/race you like and play the game on your own pace and do not worry about rushing to max level or getting BiS gear. Just enjoy the game and do not worry about clearing content quick.
---
To be able to find a grind spot for 4 players in itself can be tough. You might aswell be doing instance grinding with 5 players. 2 players alone can clear a whole grind spot before they even respawn. 
---
I do. They only want to use it in the starting zones in the start. 
---
It doesn't matter if a massive horde of players is allowed on the server, and then they all leave the starting zones and continue questing instead of quitting! You're all assuming there will be a spike and then they'll quit. I'll admit it's likely, but it's not at all guaranteed. 
---
So what then? Well, then the entire server is gonna lag until Blizzard lowers the population limit OR shards the entire game OR opens free migration to a ton of other servers and cause a lot of wonderful chaos along the way. All 3 of these options are pretty bad, and we've just opened the door to more sharding.
---
i experienced 100% the same. started on a private server 2 weeks ago. also checked this option from the start and went over to instant excepting quests. sometimes i watched at the first part for the name of the objective to get / kill / ...
---
when classic comes out, i will still use the option, but i will force myself to calmly read every quest text. i feel like it gives you a nicer atmosphere while playing.
---
Thought i knew almost everything about vanilla WoW at this point but i never knew this. Probably because i always played a rogue and threat wasn't much of an issue due to vanish.
---
It was pretty easy to find groups while levelling but as soon as everyone hits 60 all the hybrids and offspecs respec and there's a shit load of healers available.
---
I think it's worth mentioning, that most players in Classic will probably be older, than the current average WoW gamer. Most of these will have played vanilla in some way. At least, that what I think.
---
The community back in vanilla was very open and helpful (on most servers). If you where willing to listen and learn, you could easily find people to give you advice. This should be the same in Classic, if it's mostly the same people playing again. So after the first 2-3 months, when all the tourists are gone, the community will hopefully resemble vanilla.
---
paladins might have easier time healing, but they have very little of the toolkit that makes priest such a pain in the ass.
---
rage? denied, PW:S. buffs? denied, dispel. (palas' only have a different, friendly dispel) healing? denied, mana burn/silence. and the list goes on and on...
---
also, if you're going for pvp, I'd seriously consider troll. utilized properly, hex of weakness is a ranged, low cost mini-ms/damage debuff and can fuck people over to an amazing degree, while shadowguard is a free stun with blackout. (if you're shadow/tri-spec) berserking is also a great way to quickly burn mana.
---
UD have WotF, which is nice and all, but that's about it. devouring plague is a 3 min wonder/great way to run yourself oom,  and one that about half the alliance can dispel with ease.
---
Honestly, this concerns me a fair amount. Implementing progressive item is would probably be a lot of effort, and given Blizzard's approach so far, I'm not convinced they're going to do be willing to invest the time.
---
Never thought about it. But I am now.  
---
I still plan to race my main to 60. But, I'll play my alts nice and slow, and experience the full potential of Classic.
---
I only hope, that Classic is true to the wonder and magic that was vanilla WoW.
---
Well you won’t rly be able to dominate with no class if your a complete rookie. So it makes sense to pick one that is rather forgiving for mistakes.
---
Hunter is extremely unforgiving mage is ok. If you put your eyes on those two def. go with mage. If your open to others like I said rogue and warlock imo. Most beginner friendly
---
Wasn't this because Spell damage was moved in to Intellect? So a weapon having Int gave you spell damage, meaning more int &gt; better item. Pretty straight forward?
---
fucking hell i hate this generation...
---
Yea, enjoy playing for hours on end while staring at a 5" screen. go kill yourself while youre at it. meanwhile, i'll be comfortable with actual controls and a 27" screen
---
Great vids, and a soothing voice to boot.
---
Ive actually played an expansions length in bc but its been so long i fergot a lot of shit and then i half keybind half clicked with a warlock. Thats why i put noob in the title. With that being said still go rogue?
---
I plan on rushing my first character to 60, so instant quest text is a godsend.
---
But later I intend to go back with an alt and full RP + read all the quests.
---
A LOT. At least 500g more likely 700-800g. As I said, they an item that can make any race of fury warrior at least viable. And tbh, they're bis for everyone at least until the C'thun gloves, and realistically most people will never see those.
---
Also true, but hit is still a big factor, and there are a few items that can bump rogue weapon skill, though almost all for daggers iirc.
---
The non-instant is too slow for my reading speed either way tbh, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
Stun resist is so bloody huge, don't discount it!
---
It's absolutely not for "the hard-core old timers who played back in the day and have run the content 1000's of times".
---
In fact, it's most likely some of them will bitch and moan that the "game is too easy" and such. :)
---
It's absolutely the best for new players. Especially if you joined WoW in Cata or later and haven't seen the original world. You can enjoy the wonder to the fullest. It's a casual game, even raiding (perhaps not Naxx :). You only need time but mostly not all at once. Take it slow and take everything in, it's not hard to learn.
---
Of course it depends on if it's your kind of game or not. People just like different things. But if it is, it's magical.
---
Yeah, they are unique per server, a legacy of MUDs.  
---
The people who got them, though, had to sign an NDA with Blizzard, just so that the knowledge wouldn't be spread.  
---
That's why you don't find them on databases, they cannot be data-mined.  
---
If you got lucky and it dropped for you, you would receive a [special USB drive](http://www.usbtalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/blizzard_usb_drive_3.jpg) through mail, which contained a small patch that allowed your character to use the item.  
---
Now they have been removed from the loot tables, and they cannot drop anymore, and in fact people can now talk about them, as the NDA has been terminated.  
---
Still, the items cannot be linked in game, and cannot be put on any database.  
---
There will be again a chance to drop them on Classic, so cross your fingers.
---
She looks like a night elf to me ;)
---
in the latest deep dive rogue video by tips its said that troll is minimal better, but its does not really matter much, but the stun resist is so good in pvp, that orc is prefered most of the time.
---
And why is that? Just stating a fact without providing a calculation or evidence is not helpful
---
I never had much interest in PvP, so I dont see any value in world PvP at all other than an annoying interruption in my questing.
---
If I do want to PvP, I simply turn on PvP flag or go into a battleground.
---
Especially on RP servers, the number of PvP flagged players is higher than on regular PvE servers due to the roleplay aspect. At least, that's my experience.
---
Nah that was a cata addition iirc. Princess in vanilla was just fatter than the other two piggies walking next to her. 
---
Also i was told rogues are very unforgiving if caught out of stealth, high skill cap, tough for noobs in 1v1s?? Sorry for endless replys just trying to figure this out.
---
Soupa has to be mentioned. His videos are less of an information lesson and more of an adventure. I can put his stuff on and chillax. 
---
Progressive itemization is a waste of effort and overly complicated itemization, and makes gearing unnecessarily complicated for the average player, since stats on items won’t be consistent.
---
We have 1.12 talents anyway, they may as well just rebalance the handful of endgame zones to account for the talents and itemization 
---
If the goal is to make the game as it was then, anything that deviates from that objectively takes away from the game.
---
So the thing with Blood Fury is that while the healing reduction debuff doesn't sound great, there are a lot of fights that simply don't require that much raid healing, so it's not like you're going to die anyway. This very same reason is why Berserking might be overrated, since to get most out of the 1.12 berserking you need to be under 40% health to get the full attack speed benefit, otherwise it should be only giving the 10% which isn't that crazy.  
---
That being said if you truly minmax you could do stuff like remove your gear before a raid encounter so that you start the fight with less than half hp (and you would have to talk to your healers to not heal you up) as well as maybe using a demo rune or something like that.  
---
In the end it's about preference, it's not going to make or break your performance or have a huge effect on your parses, like human has compared to the other alliance races. If anything blood fury is generally easier to use if you know when you're going to be taking damage.
---
I just cba with all the drama and shit slinging this dude seems to always be the center of.
---
I get bad stuff happens, but frankly, I come online to watch/play the game. I Don't want to watch drama.
---
Because OP specifically said "Apart from TipsOut" 
---
Interesting, hadn't really considered that raid healing might be somewhat low in fights. Used to newer content with a lot of splash raid healing going on. 
---
Yeah the human area was refined much better than the other starting areas. I seriously hate the NE leveling maps. The good news is most people won't be grinding in the NE area's because they all run to the human area lulz..
---
I did have a level 60 warlock back in the day.
---
How would you rate each class?
---
Druid pvp has a much, much higher pvp ceiling potential than those classes. 
---
A good druid can make the other team rage real hard in bg pvp.
---
Hunter's don't have any weapon upgrades from BWL until KT. Locks did trash dmg in vanilla because people didn't run 5+ locks + shadowweaving priest. I know we only ran 2 locks and no shadowweaving, like you did in the video you posted.
---
Hunters are known to be the worst pure DPS in the game, like it's common knowledge at this point. They can't outgear locks no matter what because they get no upgrades to their weapon from Chromaggus &gt; KT.
---
time for another classic woah video
---
There's nothing wrong with the guild name.
---
- A sapped girl
---
Nice projection.
---
Good answer, thanks. This is my type of game just never really had the appropriate amount of time before to put into it and possibly don't now as 35 with a nearly 2 year old. I played cata pretty solid for 6 months at launch but got frustrated at not being able to raid as was too casual and couldn't pug well enough. Since then I've dabble in other mmo' s Swtor, tera and GW2 but never really worked for me. Always wanted to get back into Wow but don't like the class talent system, or lack of one, in current retail. 
---
I think the important question here is "will warlocks have a spot in every raid tier, and how many of them each?"
---
A dead one!
---
Lmao, you clearly don't get it i'm sorry.
---
They want retail players to actually get a chance to ENJOY the game, if they like the game. What u are saying is "everyone that don't know they already like the game, shouldn't get a chance to enjoy the game" and also outside of starting zone IT WILL BE CROWDED, i don't think blizzard mind that, since the people that actually gets lvl 12+ knows they like the game already and at that point they know why it's so crowded (release). 
---
They already said they won't shard anything but starting zone so what ur saying doesn't make sense, that's not how it works. 
---
Can't say for mage, but for hunter it is quite a low level to get a proper idea of it. FD, which is one of the class main enablers for PvP due to traps, is not learnt until 30, the same for intimidation/scatter. 1-10 for a hunter is quite annoying as well.  Flare is not there, bestial wrath, frost trap... 
---
For PvP it is hard to get an idea when most of your tools aren't even there. 
---
Ok so that's not exactly 100% accurate for everybody. There are fights on progression where you definitely don't want to die and make the encounter harder on yourself, but strong guilds with fast boss kill timers and good healers won't have issues with you using Blood Fury unless something is going wrong. E.g. if your guild has good dps you won't have a problem using Blood Fury on a fight like Golemagg in MC since you will likely kill him way before you get enough stacks of his debuff to be in danger, and in that situation the blood fury won't be a detriment.  
---
That being said I'm going off min-max experience from private servers - it could be that blizzard tunes boss armor/hp pool/raid dmg mechanics and in those cases blood fury will become worse, but it's doubtful whether that happens. In the end if you want to be a 100% safe you would go troll since berserking is never actually detrimental to you, it's just varying degrees of good.
---
Yeah there are some stats for P servers and retail online if you google search. It varies between servers. Usually druid is by far the least played class. Shamans tend to show a high population count but nobody plays them in game raid as much. I've played across multiple P servers and retail and I've always had trouble finding dedicated shamans to raid. 
---
If you are trying to avoid overplayed classes we can all assume warriors/rogue/mages make up the majority of the player base.
---
Its more accessible than retail. Since everything you do on low level is somewhat "worth" doing.
---
While on retail the only thing worth doing is leveling till 120. 
---
Everyone looking for the link to the classiswow Hunter discord here is the link:

Please check out the #rules channel first thing.
---
Also dm me if the link expires.
---
I don't know man. Humans have perception, +sword skill and swords are abundant in the game. But most importantly allies have paladin pocket healers!!
---
When you have 4 people ready finnish your group quests or do dungeons for good rewards. Once you are alone again use those for faster questing.
---
I would not advise to groupquest to much because you finnish quests faster than usual opening some gaps you have to farm to catch up.
---
There is also the issue of the BiS wands that can roll absurd amounts of +healing before 1.12, but not after.
---
A 1% issue, maybe, but you'll still see the 1000 gold auctions for wands which are no longer obtainable at that level of power. Because people know that they will eventually stop showing up they can be hoarded for later, and if you wanna be as good as you can be you better be ready to pay up pal.
---
This is just an extension of (imo) the only real issue with Classic, no matter the amount of changes or lack thereof: The game is mapped out, everything is min/maxed and the optimal path from 0 to 100 is done.
---
Pocket healer paladin + free action potions.
---
You will be unstopable.
---
For once, I would want the people who are talking about 1.12, 16 slots debuffs and itemization to GO PAST Molten Core AND yop raiding guilds !
---
Who the hell cares about MC? It was designed to be the ENTRY RAID, and it was designed to be easy, no matter talents, gear, debuffs. Sure, it's HARDER with 1.1, but let's be honest here...not much harder. But, again, how about going PAST MC?
---
How about BWL? Sure, BWL is easier with 1.12 everything, but most guilds will spend months before clearing BWL anyway.
---
As for AQ40 and Naxx, most guilds will never clear them. Even after 2 years, most guilds will do not clear AQ40 and Naxx. They will be running the same Ony, MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20...which is PLENTY TO DO ANYWAY, for casual guilds, which will be the majority.
---
Top guilds will FARM Naxx, while casual guilds will get wiped in BWL. Regardless of what talents, gear, and debuffs are in place.
---
Simply because after MC, raiding is not about gear, talents and debuffs.
---
After MC, raiding is about organization, skill and experience. And 80% of guilds in Classic will NOT have enough organization, skill and experience to go past BWL.
---
The only nerfing with 1.12 is MC and partially, PARTIALLY, BWL. AQ40 and Naxx will still be off-limits for the vast majority of players.
---
To be honest, this nerfing is actually POSITIVE for Classic, because at least, some people will go past MC, as opposed to Vanilla, when most guilds were unable to beat Razorgore or Vaelstraz, even if they farmed MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20 with ease.
---
In Vanilla, most guilds were MC/ZG guilds until TBC.
---
In Classic, most guilds will still be MC/ZG guilds, but some more will actually be BWL guilds. 
---
As for AQ40/Naxx guilds, the number of guilds would be just a LITTLE more higher in Classic compared to Vanilla.But not enough to require another patch than 1.12.
---
joana lvl speed is a hoax. its from private servers with dynamic respawn, so much faster than vanilla. he doesnt do it on a fresh server where there is a lot of competition for mobs and he uses rested time to get a lower /played. no one will lvl to 60 in 4 days played. the hardcore player with tons of experience will maybe end up ~6 days played depending on their class. everyone with a guide but not tons of experience wont end up below 7 days played.
---
I have based it off the average DPS in Molten Core compared with other "DPS classes".  
---
([https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx))
---
\- Hunters got a bad reputation  
---
\- Bad DPS (compared to the other classes.  
---
\- Not many spots in a raid (Missing important raid abilities/buffs)  
---
\- And it's a popular class.
---
I agree that a well played hunter (or any other class) is always welcome.  
---
Everything you just said = bad players. 
---
When will they phase in ZG tho? On private server it's usually 5-6 months. On retail I think it was like 10 months from release date. Surely you will be 60 in 5 months?
---
You only get the pet from lvl 10 onwards.
---
Na rogue is super beginner friendly because you pick mostly your own fights due to stealth and you got a huge easy to use toolkit for when shit goes wrong to escape or reset the fight. Ofc if ur caught out of stealth and your whole toolkit is on cd ur fucked but that’s normal. Overall rogue is very straight forward in pvp.
---
Do you believe sharding will be required in classic to maintain the health of the server and for a positive launch experience? What about adjusted spawn rates based on the population of the current area/zone? 
---
I'd add that if you don't have much time, you most likely will need to find a like minded guild to raid (and have time allocated for the raids).
---
Of course with the player base (almost surely) being much older than originally with many people in your shoes, even pugging will be workable, up till a point. AQ40 and Naxx is a bit more hardcore in the time commitment needed, at least. :)
---
I did notice that too. There were about a dozen ppl in the NE and the human zone was completely packed.
---
hunters/warlocks
---
Lmao, I clearly do I'm sorry.
---
The queue doesn't discriminate based on whether you like the game already or not, so that's of no relevance at all. I don't even know why you're bringing it up.
---
Blizzard may have said they won't shard any further than the starting zone, but all of this is based on the assumption that the vast majority of the people who try the game quit it.
---
We have no reason whatsoever to believe that this is the case other than remnants of "you think you do, but you don't" pessimism, so what if they end up with servers with tens of thousands of too many players on them and people just won't leave it for another one or quit? What would you do?
---
What are the classic rogue armor sets called so i can google them and thanks for the info.
---
I mean good for you but Im sure most people are going to feel content when they got nothing significant left to chase for til Naxx. If you dont care about getting slight upgrades then you dont have to chase that. But it's quite silly to try to limit the amount of upgrades for other people just because you want to "experience the content" and dont care about gear. One of the reason I dont give a damn about higher tier raiding in retail is because you can in theory get the same gear from LFR/Warfronts/M+ so what's the point of trying to push harder content if there is nothing for you there? If you can get the same gear/equivalent from easier content then there is no reason to do difficult/time-consuming tasks.
---
LAP/FAP
---
can confirm, first thing i did when i got the archmage robe was farm mats to make it
---
&gt;auto loot
---
&gt;hp/mana regen
---
&gt;faceroll mobs

&gt;buffing yourself with stam regen all your hp
---
&gt;sluggish pet pathing
---
seems pretty disappointing so far
---
2 out of 40 spots is equal to 5%. Based on "World of Warcraft: Classic - Census" around 9% is going to roll a druid. ([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics))  
---
And it will be even harder if you're fighting for a spot against druids who play twice as much (or more). As they will get much better gear than you and be prioritized in front of you.
---
This is where we fundamentally disagree on why we are even playing games in the first place. 
---
You apparently only play to see meaningless  numbers go up. 
---
Where as I play games to experience the world via the gameplay mechanics the devs have created. 
---
Immersion is the addon that works for modern WoW. No idea if it will work for Classic.
---
Depends on how much time and patience you have. If you can't for your life imagine to level 1-60 in 2-3 months casually, then it will be very hard
---
Wow that girl on the left is really cute though.
---
No. I read a lot. Not just games like divinity or pillars of eternity, no I also read crime novels. 
---
I srsly don't want to get forced to read slow. I don't need to force immersion. I can get lost in books and video games I wouldn't even notice if a bomb goes off in my house. 
---
That's a good point. Surely Blood Fury could make life a bit difficult for leveling as well? It's negative effect has a long duration so that might make it annoying for eating/bandaging after fights where you'd really want to be using it on CD if going for the fastest leveling speed.
---
Very easy to get into. You just have to get used to reading quest texts.
---
They don't show on the mini map like in New games. 
---
The overall game isn't hardcore nor difficult. 
---
Sounds like you've raided with a decent guild on a private server. Let me tell you that a lot of guilds are not decent and MC/ZG is about as far as they get. Classic will also have a lot of newer players who don't know everything about vanilla. We want Classic because we want vanilla, not some strange variation of it. Progressive itemisation makes it closer to real vanilla, progressive talents even more so. Weaker items also makes PvP more interesting as you're not just running around one-shotting people. That usually happens at around AQ/Naxx level, but with no item progression it'll happen a lot earlier.
---
Yes that’s the one, thanks man
---
The Leveling speed values is based on "Kargoz's leveling speed by class".  
---
The Raid/Dungeon values is based on how easy it is to get a spot in a raid (based on popular raid setups and class popularity) and low level dungeons (class popularity, multiple roles, reputation etc.).
---
Okay so if you don't care about numbers then don't care?
---
As far as I see it, you shouldn't care if it's either way, and a lot of people care if it's the progressive way, thus blizzard should obviously do the progressive way.
---
The disagreement comes down to the heart of some people's frustration at retail WoW. I believe that experiencing the content is part of the reward for achieving stuff in game. If you want to experience the endgame content you have to work for it, some of that might be getting those meaningless numbers up.
---
I don't like the idea of being entitled to achievement just because you paid for subscription. I haven't played retail in a decade but from what I've heard, you can do that sort of thing over there.
---
Just google the tier sets for raids or for BiS pre raid for vanilla
---
&gt;  If you "tune" bosses, why not tune certain talents, oh and when you are doing that why not do minor talent changes to balance things out. Giev prot pallys a taunt to make them viable.
---
You are so close to an important realisation here. So, so close.
---
&gt; If you start messing with actual data, you open up the argument, well if you are changing A, why cant we change B ? 
---
Well, I suppose people could have a rational discussion, based on well-established principles of game design and what we know works or does not work from TBC and later expansions...
---
Lol, try to be more condescending
---
I mean this is kind of why I take offense to people complaining about Discovery's so-called "SJW agenda". Star Trek has always upheld progressive values. And it's not just cast choices. The Federation as a society is described to thrive on those progressive values. Money has been made obsolete because scarcity of goods no longer exists, which in turn made capitalism obsolete. It focuses on peaceful international and interplanetary cooperation and sharing of knowledge and resources, with emphasis on diplomacy. All individuals within the Federation are considered equal, with a high emphasis on anti-discrimination. Self-improvement, self-enhancement and the betterment of all people are the new "economic" drives. All within a democratic framework. It's basically a progressive utopia.
---
Prot pally can reach the def cap almost as easly than warrior. They can't push crushing blow off the table tho. I think its very useful to have one hybrid prot holy paladin because some trash packs are just much easier with a paladin but overall he will heal most of the time.
---
Don't believe what you read. It's indeed slow paced but no matter how much hours you spend a day/week, you are always growing. There are grinds of course but it's not as bad as people on the social sites make it out to be.
---
The #nochanges neckbeards are the ones arguing for ezmode Classic.
---
The people wanting raids tuned to be actually challenging are by definition #changes posters.
---
Cool thanks I'll look into these
---
So is that why no one has ever caresd about gear in retail, since stronger items come out every ~6  months? Oh...oh wait...
---
Is that an addons that shows timer between ur auto attack I'm assuming? If so that's pretty bad ass
---
Only a tiny percentage of past and present WoW players play on pirate servers.
---
The bulk of Classic subscribers will be returning players or existing retail players having a look.
---
I remember reading the Def Cap thing on here, probably shouldve looked it up myself lok my bad
---
I was trying to match the level of condecendence in the post I was replying to. I guess I fell short and will try harder next time. Thanks for the tip!
---
What specific items from alchemy skill are you thinking of?
---
Almost any modern wow addon should work. There hasn't been any really breaking UI changes since classic was forked from late legion.
---
Free action potion maybe? 
---
Im for progressive items and talents but a 1.12 private server with good scripts is still a private server with fucked up mob resistances, armor and hp as well as guesswork scripts that sometimes use wrong spells.
---
exactly this!
---
&gt;some of that might be getting those meaningless numbers up.
---
But why does it matter if it took you 10 jumps to get the numbers up instead of 30?
---
If all you care about is getting the numbers up surely there's no harm in getting them up faster. 
---
And if all I care about is doing the content surely there's no harm in getting to it faster by easier access to gear. 
---
Where's the downside?
---
People who didn't raid in vanilla won't know the difference and going by posts on this sub people who did will have the content on farm in 3 weeks anyway. 
---
It’s hard to compare the two. In vanilla we tried the boss before knowing the fight mechanics. Coming up with you guilds own strategy was common. Many times officers of guilds would share boss strategies. Even chatting in general chat with other guilds doing the instance was part of it. You can’t say chromaggus was easy if no one had any idea what to expect. That took time to figure out. 
---
Not sure if it’s still the same in retail, but I don’t think it is comparable. 
---
There is a good ranged weapon from Ouro, but overall I agree with you that it is very hard to find an upgrade in AQ/Early Naxx. But no, hunters are not the worse pure dps. I completed everything from Rag to KT in retail vanilla. Me and the other main hunter beat locks in every single encounter except a handful. 
---
I showed you a video of my retail vanilla guild taking down 4H with 2 hunters in the Top 6, what experience do you have outside of some shitty private server? No guild is going to run 5 locks + priest, you are clueless, no offense. 
---
We tried Shadow priest for a while but it is an overall dps loss instead of bringing a mage or war/rogues. 
---
&gt;  Stop blaming engineering
---
Why? The server techs at blizzard are the worst in the business. They basically did everything they could to take the MMO out of WoW and they succeeded. 
---
Definitely convenience for me, I doubt I will read many quests because if I’m honest I just don’t care for the story of each quest.
---
he's using a model changer
---
Played a human Warlock for Vanilla did plenty of raiding. Mages are a dime a dozen but for the alliance warlocks are quite rare, mostly because PvP against forsaken is rough.  Set pieces were easy to come by quickly, only things like the Mageblade might have taken additional time.  For MC and BWL I was able to have a Mage Blade and later upgraded to a Claw of Chrommagus without too much trouble.  People like locks for the utility, whether it's candy, a summon, or an Imp buff in the tank group.  As I'm sure you know the biggest drawback is loss of one bag and farming shards.
---
I thought this was r/classicwow and now r/wow   
---
    
---
Classic(best) Drek'thar dual wielded swords, not axes.
---
That's for classes that are effectively healer, tank and DPS in one like hunter and warlock. 
---
A warrior will almost certainly level equally as fast. When I alt tab leveld a warrior + shaman on a pserver with x1 bonus it took me  \~6 days to hit 60 with both at the same time. 
---
A shaman giving windfury and you never having to pause as warrior because of heals and always having aggro makes leveling sooo smooth.
---
To fix your problem, I suggest you to grow up yourself interest for the lore (try to read books etc before classic comes out, i'm reading the chronicles books and I'm enjoying them a lot) and automatically you will find yourself al lot more inmersed and reading quests when playing.
---
What annoys me more than that is when a quest becomes "low level" the exclamation mark on the NPC dissappears. I wish there was an option to show that mark even if the quest becomes low lvl (on the NPC, I'm OK not showing any exclamation mark on minimap, it forces you to wonder around the places which I like. Which I don't like is the fact that i have to check every NPC just to see if they still give quests).
---
I like to do questing even if it doesn't rewards me any exp.
---
I didn't realise they confirmed sharding. Is that in every zone? For a period of time? I need details.
---
Don’t pretend addons don’t exist
---
Lvl 20+ won't have them
---
Thrinket menu, absolute must! 
---
Lvl 20+ zones or once you hit lvl 20, you will no longer be sharded?
---
If you're playing over 40 hours in the first 48 hours you'll almost definitely be ahead of the curve either way. I mean assuming you have some vague idea of how to level after the starting zones.
---
It all depends on how Blizzard will do it. Nothing is set in stone yet, all we know is that they are considering sharding (which most likely means sharding will be a thing) but to what extent? No clue.
---
It will be very hard to get ahead of the curve if sharding is a thing in the starter zones, but you will still end up getting ahead of the swarm if you play 24h+ on launch no matter what since the vast majority will sleep, work or whatever.
---
Other than professions I don’t see how anything low level is worth more in classic.
---
Any gear is going to be ultimately replaced.
---
You're probably fine. It's more likely to be a late Summer launch than an early Summer launch.
---
With or without sharding, hitting lvl 5 should not take more than 15-20 mins.
---
Some of the pservers allowed it, some don't.
---
I did it with a paladin, rogue, warrior, druid, and mage. I would rotate and be what ever character needed the quest loot. 
---
It was usually a gimmick to get friends to play. Since it was easier to talk them back into playing a new server if they had a lv40-60 toon to start with. I never did end game content with it. Losing all your progress when a pserver  shut down would hurt, but I'm an addict.
---
Since we dont know an exact date about the release, we cant say for 100% sure.  
---
Of course not. Which is why I stipulated “how likely” 
---
Dont know why but im guessing august. Legion was launced on the 30th of august, all other expansion were in winter or autumn. It would be stupid to launch when most are away on vacation. 
---
They realized that caster gear in most cases did not increase dps in any meaningful way.  It is why melee dps sources typically topped the charts until +dmg gear became more available.
---
Quest text? No ty.
---
On horde side, Locks are threat capped in BWL but not AQ/Naxx.
---
On alliance side, Locks are never threat capped due to salvation.
---
Thanks man 
---
To be honest, you'll be stepping down to much more abilities. Classes on retail are neutered af since the past few expansions
---
Yeah even college students have their exams in June 
---
I completed almost everything in vanilla too, my guild imploded on 4H, so there's 3 fights i haven't done in vanilla. So yeah, get of your high horse.
---
And "shitty private servers" are pretty reliable. We had the same as you in Naxx, we had two locks and they did garbage damage. But people have now figured out if you run a holy priest with shadowweaving and 5+ locks so you have 100% uptime on imp shadowbolt, they become monsters, it's just math, nobody ran it like this in vanilla and all you sacrifice is a healer that gets slightly worse at healing. So sorry, you are clueless - no offense!
---
And, while i haven't done any math on it i see the Ouro gun is faster than Chromaggus crossbow, so the dmg range is actually worse, meaning it's not as much of an upgrade as one might think as it would at most buff your autoattacks, albeit i have no idea how big of a % of hunters dmg comes from autoattacks.
---
Having a higher population cap does not deserve to be compared to the filth of "actual" changes such as LFR tools and other shit.
---
So ive been set it stone for warrior for the longest time. I've just started looking into Warlock, and im currently leaning more towards it. Still there is that itch to play melee, charge in and 2 shot someone. Im planning to do alot of of everything so PvP/PvE/Professions etc. a warrior needs to play fury in raids to do good dps. but then again Arms is best for PvP, and its gonna be expensive and time consuming to switch back and forth, carrying 3 sets of gear in my bags etc. Also its a nightmare to farm gold and quest as a warrior. Warlock on the other hand? you can basically play SM/ruin in all vanilla content and do good. but warriors tho!. arggg
---
I'd reckon September
---
This is objectively wrong. 
---
Yes, stay away from them if you want to learn something.
---
All they have said is 'early zones'. The rest is speculation
---
He says it like it is. That I like. 
---
then i would say, 50% / 50%  
---
you either are screwed, or you are not :D
---
That’s not how probability works 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv-tq1lWsdA&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv-tq1lWsdA&amp;t=8s)  
---
;)
---
Indeed, a big server with mass amount of people in start areas, it will take a looong time.
---
Except for a situation with a 1000 players in the starting zone, how long would it take you to lvl to 5?
---
&gt;If you're playing over 40 hours in the first 48 hours you'll almost definitely be ahead of the curve either way.
---
Yeah, id say if you play over 20h in the first two days (assuming non-weekend launch), you are ahead of the vast majority. If you play 40h in the first 48h you should be in the top 0.01% of your class (or you suck at leveling).
---
Assuming a 100% shadow bolt spam fight, having more warlocks doesn't improve Improved Shadow Bolt uptime. The average damage buff provided by the debuff is all about the average crit chance of the warlocks in the raid. ISB only lasts until 4 shadow bolts have hit the target, so the chance of the debuff not being refreshed before it is used up is (1-CritChance)^4.
---
On fights with movement or other periods of not casting ISB might fall off before being entirely used, and having more warlocks helps with that. But even with just 2 warlocks in the raid it would take there being 7+ seconds of not casting in a 12 second period for that to happen.
---
My 60 yr old Uncle plays on a private server as a Tauren Hunter. He's never raided. Ever. And he loves the game from what I can tell. He just loves shooting beats and skinning them, fishing, and engauging in gchat. He doesn't even know how to kite. 
---
It's painful to watch him play, but it's a delight to see him enjoying his time.
---
It's fine to disagree with me but you cant deny that you can play the game your way and not care about gear while more upgrades and chase items exist for players that do care about gear. You can experience the raids and ask to not receive any more upgrades and Im sure no one will complain. Sure, you might be pulling lower numbers than the people who really care, but Im sure you could find people that are willing to take you.
---
I dont know if you know but in classic gear actually makes a big difference. Every upgrade will make the time to kill faster since stuff DOESNT scale, it's not only about "numbers". Every upgrade will make PvP easier, farming faster, raids easier. Every upgrade mattered and every upgrade made your everyday tasks easier. Who know maybe that 2% hit you earned from BWL last week was the reason you won that duel because you now are hit-capped and can get more Power on other gear? Stuff like that.
---
 I think most people will agree that they want a slow but steady progression curve that you have to put effort into. No one wants to get that one item from that one easy dungeon and then suddenly have no reason to do BWL apart from being "nice" to their guild. It would be a lot better to not receive such an item and then hope that you get the equivalent from a well earned task. The progression curve does matter to a lot of people.
---
&gt; the relative few that can genuinely complete it with ease.. 
---
I think that's the issue with your viewpoint. The content is not hard, and it is a LOT that could complete it with ease today
---
You're remembering the skill level of the average player through rose tinted lenses. Gamers are different these days, MMOs and their mechanics/expectations are known.

You have to be aware that end game raids in Vanilla this time around are going to be cleared and farmed by a LOOOTTTT more of the playerbase than the first time around and as such they have to design with that in mind.
---
This x1000. And not just for guilds, even if you're grouping with players for quests and dungeons, slip in that you're new to WoW. Most players I find are excited to help newbies learn the ropes.
---
If I could change one thing in Classic, it would be removing the IBS from the game.
---
His video style is a matter of taste - and it's more slow-paced and laid back. Overall, most people enjoy it, myself included. A big plus, is he actually has played Vanilla.
---
As for Kagorz - he does put the effort in his vids to try and make big guides etc, but it's all based off private servers. And he never touched Vanilla. So he's just another Faux-Vanilla fanboi, just like most of the Classicast. 
---
Yep, and that's where the whole idea of no changes break down, because even if you manage to perfectly reproduce the progress of the game, the fact that we know what's coming at which patch changes the game anyways.
---
Tbh, when melee takes damage, usually ALL the melee takes damage. Meaning for a while healing requirement is quite high. But for horde, you got shammys that can do mass group heal by just spamming 1 button. On alliance its FAR bigger problem ( you arent going to have a priest in melee group that could do a group heal ).
---
The dudes trying to give you a reasonable answer to an unanswerable question.
---
 /violin
---
Well no, but would you give 20 arcane bars to an axecrafter for a slight buff to the almost-as-good blue drop you have when you know something better is coming?
---
Will axesmiths farm the shit out of LBRS for the plans?
---
Will blacksmiths even spec axecraft nearly as much?
---
The knowledge changes things. It obsoletes items and skills that replacements aren't even in the game yet.
---
&gt; it could be that blizzard tunes boss armor/hp pool/raid dmg mechanics and in those cases blood fury will become worse
---
Or more likely, that private server boss armor, resistance, weapon proc etc values arent correct. And when blizzard uses the absolute 1.12 data, it might be quite different than what current private servers would suggest.
---
Idiots downvoting you, yet we've watched lots of progressive private servers evolve and seen exactly what you're saying.
---
Weapon skill does a great many things. Reduce glancing blow damage penalty, increases your chance to hit, crit etc.
---
To break it down in VERY simple terms: For a fury warrior, 5 weapon skill increases your DPS potential by approximately 5-10%. Past the first 5 skill point its a downward curve though with diminishing returns.
---
TLDR: Weapon skill is the most powerful and efficient DPS stat available for melee in terms of item budget usage. (prime example being edgemasters).
---
-or you enjoy slow play and don’t care about some level number
---
&gt; so what's the point of trying to push harder content if there is nothing for you there?
---
For fun? For the challenge? 
---
Summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on Friday 21st of June and ends on Monday 23rd of September.
---
Between these dates there are 10+31+31+23 = 95 days.  
---
You're holiday coincides with summer on the 21st to 29th of June, in total 9 days (assuming both days are included).  
---
You're likelihood of missing the WoW Classic launch date is 9/95 or 8.55%  
---
Assuming Blizzard stays true to their word of a 2019 summer launch.
---
Spell damage as int didn't come until much later, as in several major expansions later.
---
Is there any sources for the people saying lvl 20?  20 is kind of too long to shard imo.
---
&gt; One can only guess why they buffed the item in later patches,
---
Honestly from what I remember playing at the time, it was just a slow build of pressure from the playerbase who no longer was enamored by weird and imperfect (sometimes useless) stats on an item
---
I miss that though. I dont know what the gameplay solution is, but I miss having those weird, quirky, and imperfect gearing options.
---
But the rationale side of me knows I wouldn't use them at this point, I'd use what was "best". 
---
That’s a pretty good response, and I like those odds!   To the guy who said 50%, if you’re reading this, this is the reason why it’s not a 50/50
---
Sounds like Scarab Lord was where this concept ended up. Very well received overall but the reward is cosmetic.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Sounds like Blizzard when they first launched WoW in ‘04.  They were hoping for 400-500k subs.  They got that many in like a week or so.  Of course, it will be different this time around....or...will...it.
---
As much as I agree that some items added/buffed later made others obsolete, and that is bad, these examples show nothing. A much better comparison would be "bis before" &lt;-&gt; "bis after".
---
Like as mentioned below with arcanite reaper vs ice barbed spear. That is a much better example that shows clearly what is wrong with launching with strong items that were intended as catch-up to those who started late (at least I believe that was their purpose).
---
This is a completely useless ranking to base DPS off of. First, this is top players period, not raid DPS, so you can't see where anyone other than warrior/rogue fit. Second, you're doing molten core, which everyone is going to be massively over geared for.
---
MC is where hunters SHINE, thanks to their terrible gear scaling. They're usually very good DPS and can top charts when you're doing first clears on MC and no one else is geared either. It's not till later in the server life when everyone is geared that they start to fall off.
---
Actually, they havent confirmed 16 debuff slots for release of game.
---
They confirmed that they can and will limit classic debuff slots compared to unlimited slots as game design in retail. They could, in fact, do 8 debuff slots in phase I content and increase it to 16 for phase II (roughly when the change was done in vanilla, since ZG is in that phase with BWL).
---
People just assume since they mentioned the 16 slots in that conversation, that it would be 16 slots from the start. It could be, but time will tell.
---
Why will it be hard? No one else seems to agree with you. 
---
Having played a couple years in pservers, cleared all raid content. Mages and rogues are top tier through out all raid content. Warriors are in the mix in top 3 DPS class for mc/bwl. In aq40/naxx warlocks replace fury warriors as the top 3 DPS class. But I give the nod to mages and rogues because they top meters in ALL vanilla content. This is what I saw playing in multiple semi hardcore guilds.
---
You got the general idea - every tactic was new and you need to look for every thing happen during the fight.
---
Thats no more possible in vanilla, every one know all they need, skill is greatly increased through other addons, so mc bwl cleared in green items at one rading day.
---
That dude want some contest in the game, wich was explored with microscope for a years.
---
Everyone know how to stay at taddius, everyone know how to prevent taunt resist on 4knights... so it will br just a “timewalkig ez”, but it is rly created for this, for good memories, communities and new friends, not for hardcore vanilla rading lol
---
Then why are you playing 40/48 hours
---
I did lots of DM Farming as a mage in vanilla, we used to do the pack at the back door of East though not the drop down.
---
There was no instance cap back then so you just killed the pack at the back, zoned out reset, zoned back in.
---
Also used to do a lot of 3 man DME farming for the mining, they actually change the geometry of the room because of people farming it.  wall used to have a lip running the entire way around and you could just jump on it and run to where hydrospawn is without having to avoid any mobs it was great.
---
It's not just the itemization. Talents and 1.11 rage and threat changes screwed everything else as well
---
thanks for the info. 
---
a big part of the DM farm is being able to relog to get to the instance entrance. having to HS/die makes this a little harder.
---
The pvpers are gonna have arcanite reapers 4 weeks in my friend :) 
---
Yeah most good arms warriors spec imp hamstring, so a lot of the time you are going to be immobilized by hamstring
---
And talents. It seems allot of people want ez mode
---
Yep, team #nochanges is really team #iwantmyshittyprivateserverback
---
Int increased mana, spell crit % and (weapon learning speed lol) originally.
---
The best way to deal with itemization and 1.12 talents and threat changes is to do a retune. 
---
It doesn't have to be 1.1, but somewhere in the middle. 
---
Getting within 10 "weapon skill"  rating of boss level mobs 315  defense is all what really matters, anything above 305 is icing on the cake.
---
Free action potions and grenades.
---
Preferably by having a teammate, warriors are not the strongest by themselves, but become a huge threat with any type of support (stuns with rogue, snares with frost mages/druids, or heals)
---
About an hour if you're fighting to tag mobs with others. 
---
Go MD/Ruin, I'm not even joking. You can still do the succu sac move when threat isn't an issue, but you can bring out the imp when you get threat capped. The only things you lose over the DS/Ruin locks are imp corruption and imp life tap. Imp corruption is a bigger deal in pvp since when mobility doesn't matter thanks to GCD you're only losing 0.5sec, and on most fights you won't even be using corruption. Losing Imp LT is a bummer, but since it scales with gear in 1.12, you'll likely be getting mana back fast enough anyway.
---
I experimented with SL builds that kept Imp LT and dropped ruin, but it's not quite as good. Without Ruin you want to stack spell dmg, but now you're losing Imp SB uptime which is the single most important thing. If all the other locks are stacking crit to keep Imp SB up and you're just leeching off them, you're kinda a dick.
---
May I ask you what hours/days you plan on playing (EST of course)
---
It was, but you still needed a gcd to do so, son you really needed to burn a scatter shot to actually pull it off, unlike in pservers you can macro that shit to be instant and not even need scatter.
---
Hunters on the MangOS core pservers are legitimately broken.
---
You are 100% safe. SUMMER in business are the months of July, August and September (3rd quarter). However, I am in a similar situation. I will be out for vacation the last two weeks of July. So what speaks against an early summer (1st July - 15 August)?
---
* Less development time: It is clear that by not specifying a release date they wanted to give themselve some buffer to fall back on when development does not go as planned. Releasing e.g. in September would give them another 2 months time of fine tuning and bug fixing.
---
* More people on vacation: past expensions showed that Blizz likes to release new products in the winter months. The reason for it is obvious. Legion was an exception, but still they decided to release it rather late into the summer on August 30, basically when the majority of people in the US and EU is already back from vacation again. 
---
* More own employees on vacation: in order to make the launch as smooth and problem-free as possible, they probably need all employees of that (already small) team
---
I mean, its wishful thinking and you can probably find a dozen of arguments that would speak for or against a specific release date...
---
Yup! 
---
There are going to be pros and cons to every decision that is made. We can all agree on that. There will be people who pass on stuff that will be nerfed, and there will be people that don't. That sucks I agree. Thankfully not all items changed during the course of the game. My point is, buffing all of it to 1.12 changes things from the game as it was then so, why do that? 
---
It's important to have bad gear at X time and different bad gear at Y time. The balance of bad and good gear, at the different stages of the game, have massive implications for the game. Let the game run it's course, don't opt to rush it. 
---
then play live and do LFR
---
There are without question a lot of items that change overtime. Ii'd argue that some of the example in that album are cherry picked to push the point in a disingenuous way. Some of the items you listed are obtained from the 0.5 set questline bosses which are unlikely to appear before the AQ patch.
---
Some people claim that Dire Maul should be pushed back to release with BWL. In retail vanilla, most people weren't level 60 by the time DM released anyway. Its actually an issue of meta-gaming. Lots of people didn't know what the pre raid bis for their class was and therefore didn't run DM as often. However today, playing a shaman means 90% of your pre raid bis comes from DM. 
---
Overall I think I would rather have classic sooner rather than later if it meant having to wait for item changes. 
---
I do not think they are allowed to have the power of decision about such things.
---
Cost constraints come from above. Even if the engineers knew that it would impede on some parts of gameplay, they are not the ones making the horrible decision "that's bad to sacrifice it, but it's worth for the cost reduction".
---
Even simply proposing the options might or might not be a part of their job, and if it is, what is certainly not a part is to evaluate its impact on something as complex as gameplay mechanics.
---
Even with 1.12 talents some hardcore guild on horde struggled with rag during The last private server release.
---
They wiped for more than one hour on rag and they knew what they were doing.
---
This was with progressive items.
---
People saying that every casual guild will blast through mc without 1.12 items just didnt raid with those shit items.
---
When you add 3 or 5 items in their final form per player and you multiply that by 40 players, you end up with a way easier raid. It matters but ill play it whatever they do
---
I don't think anyone has ever said non progressive itemization wont make things easier.
---
But 1.12.1 talents make things easier.  Look at mages, probably one of the classes that benefits most from this.  From talents they receive 6% spell hit and 10% spell crit which they wouldn't' have if we were doing progressive talents.  They also get mage armor, which was added in a patch during MC/BWL iirc.
---
General knowledge makes things easier.  In vanilla it took my guild 3 days to figure out how to kill lucifron, another 2 weeks before we were able to down magmadar.  Every boss we went into in MC we pretty much had 0 info on what it did and how to kill it.  There is almost a 0% chance any raid in classic wont have someone in it that knows exactly what the boss does, when they do it, and what to do as a raid to beat the boss.
---
2019 Computers are going to make things easier.  When I was healing on my priest in vanilla I would try and stand in a corner and zoom my camera all the way in on my character so my FPS would be 15 instead of the 3 I would get when everyone was casting spells in a raid.
---
While some of the 1.10 items are indeed very powerful, with few exceptions they are just replacing a piece of pre-raid gear and get upgraded in MC/BWL.  IMO they will make finding groups for instances when pre-raid farming much less frustrating, a caster for example will actually want to go to UD strat for the wand/hat in classic rather then it being a healer and 4 melee who all want the cloak.
---
Even if the values are a bit wrong here and there, or even "wrong use of spells" it is still not *enough* to stop players from absolutely consuming the content if that content was *just* like it was back in Vanilla.
---
The content will cleared very quickly, and it doesn't matter where the values are unless *completely* broken either way, which they aren't on private servers.
---
You're just being shitty. Nothing the previous dude said was condescending, he didn't attack or belittle the way you enjoy games as you did to him. 
---
&gt;You apparently only play to see meaningless numbers go up.
---
Fuck off with that noise 
---
Arcanite Reaper is better for warriors then IBS anyway. Even if its only a minor upgrade, that means people will use it.
---
Also why all this talk of IBS? You know what else comes with AV? The Unstoppable Force.
---
People aren't as lazy as you think. If people are that lazy that they cant spend about 300g for weapon on a 6th month upgrade, I dont expect then to level the weaponskill for a polearm as well.
---
I'm not sure where you get June 21st from as the first day of summer. Mid-summers eve is celebrated in several countries, especially in Sweden where I'm from, and that is June 21. (In the northern hemisphere, before June 21 the days get longer, after the 21st the days get shorter and shorter which is why that date is seen as "mid" summer.)
---
Totally accessible, I introduced wow to a friend last year, we first played on a MoP server but we rushed all content in like 3 months playing "casually" and the pvp was a bit too fast paced  for him so I brought him to a well know vanilla server and he loved it, he got two 60 in a year and raided MC and BWL
---
I never understood something: why is it when an lgbt/person of color or orient/woman/any other minority is added to a cast, people demand that there's lore or storytelling reasons for it lest the writer be called an sjw/signal virtuing/political. But when a cis/white/hetero/male or any other "normal" (quotes are important because no one is abnormal) person is cast, it's fine... 
---
I'm not trying to discredit the wonderfulness that's Star Trek, and I realize this is probably way off topic for this post, but I noticed people hold minority character story writing to a much higher standard. Non minority characters can get away with shitty storywriting more often and more easily. Not saying that bad story writing goes unnoticed, but I've seen people accuse even well written minority characters as being 'shallow' and 'that's all they focus on' when clearly it's not.
---
I get what people are saying that progressive itemization is important to the feel of Vanilla and I would like to see Blizz give players and accurate representation of Vanilla progressive itemization included in full.
---
 But... 
---
Faithfully recreating progressive itemization is a *ton* of extra work that will not matter two years after launch so I foresee Blizz taking the cost effective/lazy approach of giving us items in their 1.12 iteration. 
---
I'd lean on druid. The closer the class is to each other in a multibox the easier it is. 
---
Depending on the follow set up you're pretty much going to be double ambushing/backstabbing targets with double finishers. You'll kill single targets really quick. Manning the rogue will also give you blind and evasion to pop in multiple mob pulls.  Then you can heal up for low downtime. And stealth. 
---
I actually believe that worked in vanilla as well.  Before the instance cap on my mage I made A LOT of gold farming the first pack in strat live.  For a while they were non elites but with elite drop tables (each dropped like 10-20 silver). 
---
 You can't zone back out when you zone in there, so someone in our guild had a second account with an auto accept invite mod turned on.  We would clear the pack, invite the level 1 promote them to leader and leave the party and camp.  I think the teleport to your hearth upon leaving the instance might have been added later?
---
BFA was launched August 14th...
---
tbf, most things on MangOS are broken.
---
they are NOT a good approximation of original wow.
---
Not sure, I remember farming SM for that one hidden guy, but other than that I was mostly preoccupied with wpvp and raiding. 
---
TUF costs a chunk of gold and in the pre-1.12 bullshit state of AV was actually hard to acquire. It was less time consuming to farm up 20 bars than it was to get exalted AV. For people whose only AV experience is the godawful version on private servers and you hit exalt in the first weekend, yes TUF is pretty damn gamebreaking.
---
Not to mention IBS wasn't even as bad originally since you actually had to be in a game long enough to trigger Korrak. Once they nerfed AV into shit and removed Korrak IBS became far too accessible.
---
Also, TUF doesn't obsolete 9 levels worth of blue dungeon drops the way that IBS does since you can get it at 51, where TUF requires 60.
---
I said the same thing in the BRE thread: This should be the top post on the sub.
---
In terms of PvE, lack of progressive itemization is the biggest blow to the authenticity of the experience right now. Nostalrius was the first server to implement progressive itemization and PvE progression was much more interesting there than it had been on past priv servers.
---
When you add up the stat differences on all the items for all the classes, the difference is honestly massive.
---
I asked uncle google
---
https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Ion talking about it
---
yeah there are people who unironically feel that way, i agree it's crazy
---
Its funny how everyone thinks they know better than Blizzard.
---
Most people aren't willing to go through the effort to get close to max fetal dps
---
The comment you replied to answers your exact question.
---
Great to see SivHD again after all this time. He's a good guest in that he hasn't been following Classic news as closely as the other hosts so a lot of his musings are still charged with the energy of what Classic could be. 
---
My thoughts exactly. The instant quest text has no bearing on whether I read the text or not. If I do want to read it, the scrolling text is a pain in the ass. Also worth mentioning that just about every rpg in existence has options for text speed, so there's that.
---
There's an extensive meta in the pserver community where raiding as you remember it is obsolete.  For example dual-wielding fury tanks is optimal because threat is more important than mitigation.  How much of that has to do with starting at 1.12 talents and itemization I don't know - but BWL clears in 90 minutes are typical these days even for the semi-hardcore crowd.
---
Starting with the weaker versions of items will only add another meta to classic where we'll all need to learn two BIS lists.  In a lot of cases, items from blue dungeons are close-to-BiS until C'Thun, for example.  If those items are only BiS post-buff, then people will still seek to acquire them, but they may have to wear something else in the short term.
---
I don't think that adds any value to the game whatsoever.  BWL clears might take 2 hours instead of 90 minutes.  It's really not worth the hassle.
---
Also, items suddenly changing on you doesn't feel good.  That's exactly the problem with retail that we all complain about.  Every expansion, and sometimes major content patches, classes get shuffled around and what used to be the best DPSer is now bottom tier.  That doesn't feel good.
---
You are allowed to have down to earth views on this sub apparently. Sorry for the down votes. 
---
Every time I see something like this, it makes me realize how much the company has changed in the 7 years it’s been since I stopped playing. 
---
&gt; drops from Ragnaros
---
With what frequency?  I welcome amazing weapons dropping from lower tier bosses if they're rare enough drops.  We want geared players to have a reason to run weaker content to help boost weaker players.
---
i really do not like current wow anymore so im not defending them or anything but this is on the ptr and will change according to a gm but if this stays and goes to live its really really really f*cked
---
The raids can be tuned... It's not fun watching gear in your bag get stronger just by existing. 
---
I don't think the comparison to cannibalize is needed to see how insanely overpowered that racial is.
---
People just like to blame the "SJW agenda" because it makes them feel better about themselves. Discovery is a shitty Star Trek show and the main character is an asshole, but her being black doesn't have anything to do with either of those things. Just like how TLJ's shitty script was the reason it failed, not because they happened to cast a couple of women in the sub-par roles they'd written.
---
Nope, my reddit name matches pretty closely to back when I played
---
Every time a fresh server opens the old ones take a huge pop loss. Everyone and their mom thinks they will be the first all over again. "This time I'll definitely get scarab Lord!"
---
If they do fresh realms I hope it's not for a long while. Every 6 months is way too fast. Hell, even every year is too quick IMHO.
---
To those who say, "you don't have to leave if you don't want to.":
---
If you're in the process of leveling and a fresh server pops, and the population leaves, it becomes real hard to get dungeon runs going and help with elite quests. 
---
If you're a fresh 60 you lose a majority of people willing to do the dungeons for entry gear for raiding and pvp.
---
The server just turns into a raid log server and god mode pvp.  This in turn makes people leave to go to the more populated fresh server and start over just so they have that community to actually play with.
---
Depending on the type of player you are the content will be trivial anyway (or not). If you are lets say a 10 year veteran of playing (semi) hardcore on different pservers chasing BiS, using Worldbuffs and stuff most if not all content is going to be trivial for you, progressive itemisation won't change that.
---
If you are a casual player from your average mom and pop guild content will still be challening, not having progressive itemisation won't change that either. 
---
Furthermore, will the average player even understand progressive itemisation and the impact. How does your average joe know to keep this item for 6 months because now its worthless but in 6 months is will be buffed and it will be good. I think it will be hard to implement this correctly and make sure that every plyer understands the impact, so you don't a system where the ppl "in the know" get richer and the ppl not "in the know" don't.
---
So its not even on live? Makes the whole post redundant if so  
---
&gt;Let me tell you that a lot of guilds are not decent and MC/ZG is about as far as they get. 
---
That has very little to do with the difficulty of the content, and more to do with maintaining a 40-man raiding guilde (making sure everyone is active and online) and the time commitment.
---
Seriously, caster itemization was totally trash the first few months. The tier 0 dungeon sets used to have +AGI on them and only ever granted a tiny amount of +SpellDMG via set bonuses. 
---
Looking at the linked example, an epic sword that drops fairly deep into MC; the effect on dps is negligible on just a 1% crit boost with minimal +SpellDMG in game. Some back of the envelope calculations:
---
* A frostbolt at level 60 hits for about 500 damage, with no +SpellDMG
---
* Talented, a crit hits for double, or 500 additional damage
---
* Cast Time is 2.5 seconds, so 100 casts is 250 seconds
---
* DPS from weapon slot is 500 additional damage/250 seconds = 2 DPS. That's 2 more dps than just leaving the weapon slot empty.
---
* Plus 120 Mana from intellect, which is about half a frostbolt.
---
To put that 2 dps increase in perspective, for a frost mage, that is equivalent to about +5 SpellDMG. Hypnotic Blade in 1.12, which drops in Scarlet Monastery (Library), has +9 SpellDMG and the same amount of +Int. 
---
Having good gear while leveling makes mob killing dubble as eazy. Also selling stuff on the AH was worth your time. Now the potential to gold farm is way diffrent between a max level character and a leveling one.
---
&gt;the optimal path from 0 to 100 is done.
---
But Vanilla stops at 60.
---
How impactful? 10% more DPS? 5%? 1%?
---
I think it is hard to quantify just looking at a list and not comparing these items to what would have gotten instead. It isn't like they just went in and buffed every item in the game. Some were poorly itemized to begin with and were adjusted. And in the case of the pvp gear getting a 1.10 buff, that was to help compete with naxx and aq gear.
---
It does make a difference, but not as much as talents imo. As a hunter, I would still get most of my gear from Dire Maul and grab a few pieces of blue gear to augment it, so those item changes basically don't matter at all to me.
---
You can make a frost mage set that out dps full purple MC gear and its made up of greens and blues mostly with an archmage robes.
---
nah its only just on ptr got released yesterday i think
---
Guilds will still need to have axe smiths to craft Annihilator though but I suppose thats mainly the tryhards.
---
One one hand, it is way too OP
---
On the other hand, would it really do much damage at this point?
---
Early rankers yes, but not the average player. 
---
I said legion not bfa... 
---
The 1.5 second cast wrath+moonfire combo is pretty deadly as well.  One global cd, 1500ish damage potential at least
---
Paladin destroys fields in wpl once they get spell power gear can aid like a beast 
---
If they don't add it eventually, pvp gear will get even more outshined by pve gear than it already is, so I'd rather they at least make those changes. Hell, the original blue hunter pvp set is damn near better than the epic hunter pvp set on certain items.
---
tl;dr:
---
The issue is that Blood fury AP buff is a static value. It does not matter if you just dinged lvl60 or you have full T3, the buff and the -healing will always stay the same. 
---
On the other hand, Berserking starts fairly weak but only gets better as you get good gear, world buffs and it all adds up nicely.
---
I'd assume that the breakpoint probably is late BWL/AQ stage of the game when trolls begin to pull ahead in terms of PvE performance. And Soyoen (one of the most well-known theorycrafters) recommends trolls for pure PvE min-maxing.
---
Yeah suppression room is a great place for a prot pal for example.  But you're healing on boss fights.  
---
Bloodfury is basically usable in 90% of the fights without causing too much trouble for the healers.
---
Who gives a crap about MC difficulty. It'll be piss easy no matter how much we try to tie our hands. Run it without world buffs if you're so dead set on MC being hard. 
---
But your missing the point which is that certain items like azuresong mageblade were made way too weak to begin with. Why would an epic raid drop, that is also a rare one at that since it only drops off golemagg, be on par with dungeon blues? With the original itemization casters get absolutely shit scaling compared to melee. 
---
Yup, I'm still learning hunter but I think that the basic set up of 0/21/30 is probably the best PVP spec provided you have solid gear.  Starting out in blues I might go with it as well just to stay alive longer.  
---
Beast mastery kind of feels like the AP/Pyro mage, just a 3 minute trinket +cooldown win and then you're gimped until it comes off cooldown. 
---
But it's indicative of their strategy with the Allid races: Give them OP racials to promote race changes.
---
&gt;Legion was launced on the 30th of august, **all other expansion were in winter or autumn.**
---
BFA was summer 2018...
---
It's not about the damage it does to the game. It is telling of the mindset of the company.  
---
Introduce OP racials to promote race changes. This is arguably nothing new, but it is bad game design philosophy.
---
There is nothing hoax about it, he doesn't use rested time because he did it on freshly launched blizzard servers where he was confirmed to be the first person to hit 60.
---
Also the people who do it on private servers hardly benefit from dynamic respawn because it is only enabled in starter zones. Plus once they break away from the pack there will only be a handful of other speed levelers in the 30+ zones so how would dynamic respawn help? 
---
Unfortunately, there are consequences of using the default slow-scrolling quest text.  For example, if you party is sharing quests, you will still be reading the first quest text while the party members share the other quests.  Additionally, if you are doing an escort quest or something similar, you might still be reading the quest text while the party starts the escort.  Depending on the quest chain, this may prevent you from starting the escort since you haven't yet completed the prior quest.
---
I'll be playing wow on my smartphone.  
---
although with mouse and keyboard.
---
Instant text does make it WAY too easy to just grab quests and go.
---
BUT it is kind of necessary. The range to share quests is tiny and people are always jumping around.. takes forever to try to share a quest if everyone is on slow text.
---
It is a bit of both. When I have it on I  usually try to make a point of reading the quests before I complete them but it definitely takes you out of the game a little bit.
---
So did Bradens "darkrabbito"
---
What dungeon gear is actually better than mc/bwl gear, though? I'm only familiar with hunter itemization, but I can't thik ot anything besides the blue pvp pieces (due to the 20 agility 2 piece bonus) that I'd wear over any tier 1 pieces. 
---
&gt;I guess the main thing holding me back is being a broke bitch
---
Don't worry, Activision will absolutely allow you to buy gold for real money. 
---
Insult to injury at this point.
---
Is this real? Holy shit. So, the incentive is to buy the new expansion so that you can play the OP race, or roll new toon and pay for the boost to max lvl? That is scummy as hell. 
---
You can also sometimes vanish to avoid death during a wipe.
---
Sounds like Emmy winning episode.
---
If you had enough mana to bolt all day you'd just pull agro anyway.
---
I played retail and mained a void elf, the racial isn't that overpowered it ends up being 1-2% of your overall damage on a fight iirc. 
---
i do agree though the allied races are just cash grabs i mean as soon Void elves come out i instantly race changed my monk, mage and rogue lol but i think its more cosmetic than it is "omg these are op" at least in my case.
---
Mods be gay huh
---
You clearly have more experience with playing an hunter than i. There are pros and cons on all classes. Please tell me how the list should look like.

The rating is also based around these videos:

Assume a crowded server, 4 people tagging mobs for the benefit of the whole group gets more experience than one person alone who hardly ever gets to tag a mob.
---
I know, that's why I added Troll.
---
isn't curse the guys that made discord? 
---
or am I thinking of some other app/guild? nurfed? 
---
You say that, but there are about 10x more cases of blues from easy dungeons being better than raid epics in 1.10+, rather than the other way around like you're referencing.
---
1.10+ is LITERALLY a catchup patch, of catchup gear. This would be like releasing Legion with the world quest zone that gives you ilvl 900+ gear, in preparation for the ilvl 850~ starting raid.
---
Does less weapon dps post patch.... less stabby damage on my mage
---
yep, patches bringing new items/enchants = fun
---
it also means the power curve is smoothed out a LOT. launching with 1.10+ items means people will be SO much stronger at the start of the game, and the gear progression throughout the lifespan of the game will feel much worse as a result.
---
I had this one bookmarked, can't recall where i found it.

---
It's pretty terrible because there is an xp penalty when you are grouped with more than 1 person
---
for example, say a mob gives you 100 xp if you kill it
---
if you and a friend kill it you get 100 / 2 = 50 xp each
---
but if you are with 2 friends there is a penalty of like 75%, so you get (100 x .75) / 3 = 25 xp each
---
I'm not sure if it's comparable, but it seems like the racials aren't enough to dictate which weapons are worth using, or making one weapon better than another. For instance, dwarfs have gun specialization, but the bonus is never enough to make a gun a BIS item in any tier. Trolls have bow specialization, which *happens* to be good for rkoh'delar, but it doesn't disqualify Crossbow of Smiting as a better weapon. I'm sure ranged and melee weapon skills work differently, but I've never seen someone on these forums say something like "you shouldn't be using that weapon because they're not a sword/mace/axe" etc.
---
No, it isn't. It's an error in the tooltip in (?) the PTR. Another tooltip says that the cooldown is 11,8 years.  
---
I get the "Blizzard sucks, look at this"-mentality - but it gets quite ridiculous when it's an obvious error (that isn't even in the game). 
---
The problem with Discovery is two-fold:
---
1) They think they're the first to do this.  Most of the SJW-heavy media thinks they're breaking new ground.  Which completely ignores the strides that came before.  (For example, Star Wars forgetting about Leia, Sci-Fi forgetting about Sarah Connor and Ripley).
---
2) If the show is designed with strong characters, you don't see the diversity.  I didn't see Sisko as "black" or see Janeway as "Woman".  I saw them as Commander/Captain and Captain.  They were good characters.  If the only good character trait is "not white" or "not male", then it's a problem.
---
People who hate SJW aren't anti-diversity.  They're against having diversity as the only redeemable quality of a character.
---
"enjoy"
---
I doubt that, current emulation is probably very close to the original and I doubt if there's going to be a huge difference in most regards. There's already compelling evidence of certain naxx bosses having only less than 4k armor, which is even less than the TBC bestiary uses.  Like Thaddius has verifiably 3.9k armor which you can calculate (and has been done) from an old vanilla video, since the PoV is a warrior executing you just need to account for dmg multipliers such as polarity shift and DW and account for what armor debuffs were used. If Thaddius, one of the last bosses in the game and the final boss in abom wing, had 3.9k armor one could assume that surely that must be indicative of what the ballpark was for most bosses in vanilla. For comparison on the most popular private servers almost all bosses have close to 1k more armor, with certain bosses even sitting at over 5k. This difference in armor is MASSIVE when you get the boss to 0 armor with Sunder/CoR/FF and one stack of Annihilator.  
---
Resistances - sure uncharted territory, mostly, since those are relatively unknown. Melee are however the heavy lifters in the private server scene and do most dps usually excluding ignites in the late game. If classic ends up having much higher resistances than pservers use then honestly it'll just make the game even more melee centric than it already is.  
---
Weapon procs - sort of whatever. Most endgame weapons aren't proc based and it's been a while since servers allowed items like Ironfoe to have bonkers proc rates that make it better than most weapons in the game, in fact on most private server nowadays proc weapons are usually nerfed to where they aren't better than other alternatives in aq40/naxx. I have a feeling that when classic beta rolls around we will find that some of those proc items will have broken procrates but because people were noobs back then and the items were dismissed (items like IF, UTB, ED, etc.).
---
Scarab Lord is a nice middle ground. From a game design standpoint I don't think anything should be "1 per server" in the case of something like Scarab Lord. If that 1 person quits the game then it might as well have never existed. Much better if a dozen or so people can get it in a time window.
---
&gt;y sources for the people saying lvl 20?
---
wow dude you are really off the chain here just relax and realize we both have read the same news articles and know what is happening.  
---
the itemization of 1.12, well they are not strict nerfs, they are artificial nerfs.  Really the number one thing that is changing in wow classic, if you didn't play, is the threat generated by good and bad warriors will be very high to start off compared to any other point of classic wow.  Additionally, it is not like the team in charge of the game is going through and reducing all monsters hit points by 15% and or buff all attackers and healer numbers.  There is just better stats, that people can understand exactly what they do at a glace. It is not like everyone is getting 14 pieces of high warlord from non tier gear, but a couple items will be better than when they were introduced, which is an artificial nerf not close to the levels of hyperbole you are concluding.
---
So no source... That's what I thought
---
Yea you should be good. Late august/early september is my guess.
---
What the other guy said, free action potion, but also greater frost protection potion. 
---
&gt; It is telling of the mindset of the company
---
It is also telling of the mindset of the players.
---
Every time Blizz does this crap people flock to buy it, that's why Blizz do it, it's loads of free money.
---
&gt;  it is bad game design philosophy
---
It's not game design, it's a commercial strategy that works very well considering player's attitude.
---
they both have fallen so far

Bolvar is the leader tho. There's a regency due to varian's absence.

I hope they do one or the other yeah.

I've been a Sylvanas devotee since I first played a pirated copy of warcraft 3 my uncle leant to my dad. Thrall has always been a side hoe. Dark lady watch over y'all
---
Undead scum.
---
that ain't my boy Fordragon though
---
Counter to that is, lets say you can kill 2 mobs before you eat / drink that is 200xp before you have to eat/drink...
---
your group of 3 literally kills 6 mobs in a camp in the same time you killed 2... each player gets 25 x 6 for 150xp each player but wait your only down half your mana/health... so you pull another camp of 6 kill it now you must eat and drink and everyone is up 300xp ... 
---
\- this is a conservative number 
---
the fastest leveling I did in vanilla was on a ALT - resto shaman when the pre-Naxx event was going on and there were spawns of undead. 5 man party just non stop killing, drinking and eating only for the casters, melee being topped off from my healing.
---
If you are not a frost mage, warlock, feral druid, or hunter... I would suggest grouping as much as you can.
---
These are about leveling, which I wasn't making any comments on. Watch kargoz's hunter videos, and he'll talk about how hunters are very good DPS at the start of MC/Ony and drop off due to gear scaling issues.
---
Since you made this post to talk about people with limited time, who probably won't be raiding well into AQ/Naxx, I think it's pointless to rank the classes based on how well they will do in late server environments with optimized naxx gear.
---
I can't tell you how the list should look, because you need to figure out what your goals are and how far you think you'll get in raiding, which will change the standing considerably. Not only that, I think you should be taking into account grinding ability since consumables are important and epic mounts are expensive, as well as ease of getting BiS to start raiding. There's a lot of differences that make a class ideal or preferable, and it's way more complicated than two variables on a 1-10 scale.
---
That's a fair argument. So you clear it 4 times and then what? You got no gear to get from in there. No low drop rate item you care about because you got your pre Naxx BiS from Strat. After clearing it a few times it wont be that much of a challenge anymore. You're probably raid logging at that point. Is it truly fun to do repetitive content when there is no drop of interest? I remember raiding and even when we had MC on farm and people had BWL gear, there were still a few very rare MC items people were hoping would drop while we "boosted" the newbies through MC. When raids that that long every week I feel like people need that carrot to keep themselves interested and not burn out. Even if it's only a 1% upgrade.

Orc or Undead

can't imagine why you would want to go troll melee warrior/rogue - other than just personal preference.

You assume they are even half as dedicated and passionate about this game as we are.
---
I remember how in TBC you had to get that magic 15% hit and 15% mitigation to avoid being 1 shot with a crit/crushing blow. Options were either farm dungeons for eternity to have a chance at what you need, or lose some pvp matches until you had enough money for gladiator gear which was just a little under the top tier raid gear
---
Do you like MMO's ?, do you like RPG elements ? Do you like relying on others ?
---
If you answered yes for all of the above, Classic will be for you.
---
Plan on going tauren, actually! Sylvanas is still my queen. I'll see you in redridge the moment I get travel form :)
---
That’s what everyone said during the BFA beta.
---
A lot of people are mentioning that MC/BWL are easy regardless of itemization and while that's true, it's a very limited perspective. I think the biggest issue without progressive itemization is the removal of milestones, goals and the overall feeling of character progression. Vanilla was experienced in stages, you explored the world and found the best options available through trial, error and exploration. While we can't ever recreate that, I would much rather find myself creating a new set of goals with each content release instead of logging in day 1 thinking "I'm basically going to ignore everything except DM".
---
And I'll be happy to smite your ass.
---
Partly, but the fact is that some people still find this game hard. It seems like most people on the subreddits played in a fairly decent guild, as did I, but I also found a few bad guilds and trust me, there are a lot of them. Usually it's not the bosses that wipe these guilds, it's the trash. A lot of guilds can get past Vael but just can't get even halfway through the suppression room. They often wipe on imps in MC or too many fire spawns, tanks die on giants, people tab and pulls a nearby mob etc. 
---
The difficulties of maintaining a guild really starts to show at about Huhuran and the trash after. Every raid there's a new guy who don't know the fight and the trash so you have to wipe through it. It's not pleasant. Having to explain how to pull C'thun for half an hour every single raid night is exhausting. 
---
Lastly, most of the guilds who went through Naxx in the first month practiced beforehand on their own locally grown, organic private servers. Those who didn't have access to one struggled immensely and most never got past the first bosses.
---
&gt;It's not game design, it's a commercial strategy that works very well considering players' attitude.
---
I mean, it's both really. I agree - this happens because people pay for it. But Blizzard is incenting that behavior through game design, which is my objection.
---
Relying on others for what? 
---
Even with a moderate / low amount of people around, starting zone competition slows things down a LOT.
---
Human starting zone for example. Assuming 1 kill a minute (super optimistic at launch) doing only kill quests cause collect quests are slower, it will take 61 minutes to level 5.
---
Group up to aid in tagging those mobs for the kill quests, and you're now barely 4 in that same hour.
---
&gt; Wish that was more than one in existence.
---
Yeah, that's literally why blizzard scrapped the idea. 
---
I assume you are talking about Zulu or however his name is spelled. It's because there was no reason for adding him being gay other than to add him being gay. This dude was in like what, 2 decades of tv show and no mention of him being gay, or straight for that matter. Then all of a sudden he needs to be gay. Why? It's not like his husband/boyfriend was important to the story and I highly doubt that his original character was written as gay. And the best part? He wasn't even a 'minority' character until he was made gay. When things are added for no reason to the movie it's bad story telling.
---
I have instant text on, but only because I read faster than the text scrolls.
---
Preach... Shows/movies apparently cant just be badly written anymore. There has to be some SJW agenda based reason that a show/movie is bad now...
---
It's like everyone forgot the vast majority of the stuff that comes out has always been bad. The good stuff was always rare. 
---
The people you speak of aren't arguing in good faith. That's why the logic is inconsistently applied.
---
Which is kind of oxymoronic? hypocritical? Whatever... for blizz to do that stuff. Here are some really cool items, 1 year later, we have removed said items from being acquirable in game. It’s impossible to “complete” wow with how it’s designed. Which is okay, but kind of makes you wonder why they don’t keep historical content out there permanently for those who want to feel they 100% the game.
---
&gt; but if you are with 2 friends there is a penalty of like 75%, so you get (100 x .75) / 3 = 25 xp each
---
Not quite 75% but still lackluster. Group of 3 has a 16.6% bonus so that 100xp mob is 116.6 / 3 or 39xp (61% loss)
---
he did not lvl in 4hrs on blizz servers.
---
dr is everywhere, not only in starter zones, i suggest you inform yourself before you post such things.
---
he even says himself he uses rested to get better /played times
---
....
---
WoW was not designed to be a game you can complete 100%. If every player is able to have every "thing," then nothing is special any more and there's no point in having any of it.
---
Lets see - Vael in vanilla has 3.3 million health IIRC. Lets be generous and assume all 40 members of a raid are doing DPS and none are healing. To kill Vael in 20 seconds requires \*each\* raid member to do 4125 dps.
---
A pretty well geared lvl 60 mage (unbuffed) will do about 5-600 damage per frostbolt or 6-700 per fireball. In the Vael fight (with spells being instant cast) you can put out about 400 dps unbuffed.
---
Being fully raid buffed and flasked up doesn't give you a factor of 10 increase in DPS. Not even close.
---
So if guilds are killing Vael in 20 seconds in private servers, all that tell us is that the private server doesn't seem to have a whole lot in common with vanilla WoW as it existed in 2004-2006
---
Love these type of things! Anyone have a paladin / priest one lying about in there bookmarks? would very thankful.
---
Absolutely. People love teaching receptive learners and those who don’t pretend to know things they don’t. 
---
Jesus look at the difference in color pallets 
---
&gt;  1-2% of your overall damage on a fight iirc.
---
That's a good racial, but that's not the strong one IMO
---
Weapon skill matters less for ranged weapons because there are no glancing blows (and maybe other factors too, I'm not sure. Just repeating what I heard in a madseasonshow video).
---
&gt; will they be the 'best' or most dedicated players on the servers? unclear - there is likely to be some serious hardcore players coming across from bfa and elsewhere.
---
Almost certainly they will, at least if it's an authentic vanilla experience they will be.  It's not like the most hardcore retail players are any more hardcore than the most hardcore vanilla players, they both live and breathe their respective version of the game.
---
The only difference is that one of these groups has been playing and practicing a game that's very different from what classic is going to be, and the other has basically been practicing classic.  For 12 years.
---
Ah, gotcha. That makes a lot of sense, hadn't factored in that is a static value.
---
Thanks for this!
---
You can add shadow priest to your list of efficient grinders who basically never have to stop to eat/drink due to spirit tap. 
---
Which leaves only paladins, shamans, warriors and rogues. 
---
None of these classes (or any class for that matter) should be killing mobs that force them to eat/drink after only 2 mobs. A good rule of thumb is to kill mobs 1-2 levels below you for efficient grinding as these weaker classes. After about 3-4 mobs then shamans/paladins can self heal and move on and warriors/rogues can bandage and move on. 
---
The official first day of summer is the summer solstice. Summer ends on the autumnal equinox. Yes you likely have summer like weather for the month preceding the solstice but the scientific definition of summer starts on June 21.
---
&gt; 4-5% for warrior seems to be the ballpark.
---
The big part that people don't mention enough is that 5% warrior DPS is 10% human warrior tank threat.
---
If a X geared warrior tank does 500dps, a Tauren will do 500dps and have 1000 threat - a Human will do 525dps and have 1050 threat.
---
That 50 extra threat means 50 potential extra damage from everyone in the raid. 71 extra damage with bosalv.
---
You're right, I had that completely backwards and wrong. You don't get an xp penalty you actually get an xp bonus it looks like from the sources I'm seeing on google.

My friend Randy dropped the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a red-quality item, and they delivered the USB stick to his house.

Troll warrior actually surpasses orc in Naxx gear ( by a tiny margin ), not that it's a particularly compelling argument.
---
Okay but dynamic spawns doesn't help you at all if you are ahead of the pack, you have to be in a crowded area for them to do anything. 
---
If a Warrior gets the jump on a Hunter, it can be a deal-breaker.

Honestly its whoever hits who first, and also if a stray mob happens to daze one of the two combatants, etc.

Sulu or at least his actor George Takei was of Japanese decent in an American tv show that aired only two decades after WWII. I suggest you look up what the Americans did to their Japanese citizens during the war, they were definitely minorities.
---
As to Sulu being gay. It was meant as a nod towards the decades-long activism of actor Takei who himself is gay and has promoted gay rights for a very long time now. Takei himself has said that he's delighted there's finally a gay character in Star Trek (this was before Discovery) but that he doesn't feel it fit within Gene Roddenberry's original vision of Sulu.
---
Considering this bad writing is kind of asinine however. Sulu's sexuality is revealed as gay in Star Trek Beyond, but it has no major impact on the plot or character development. It's just a subtle nod. Creators often put pop culture references and easter eggs into their movies/novels/games. This is almost never criticised as bad storytelling. But when the subject of the reference is a topic that some people have a hard time accepting it suddenly is..

Copy/pasting my comment here so you get notified too:

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769548630#post-15 I greatly recommend reading this entire post, but the most relevant part for you is this, without context:
---
&gt; However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days.
---
Also all the best weapons in the game at every point for hungers are bows or crossbows. Never guns when you are raiding 
---
Frankly, even if it doesn't, it'll probably get ported once people start making new vanilla addons.
---
Correct. it is quite strong in PvP for certain caster classes. Couple that with the other burst damage racial and it's more potent compared to racials of many of the other races which are quite underwhelming.
---
“Amazing, every word of what you just said... was wrong.
---
I love your idea for adding more racial alterations to the classes, but I would never expect blizzard to have gone that far. Making 2 racial abilities for each race of priest alone was enough work on its own for blizzard to not do it for any of the other classes, let alone unique talent trees and *removing* abilities. 
---
That among other things is a big reason i hope such a discussion grows. Pushing for this type of stuff wont happen naturally. It's difficult and requires effort to maintain, grow, and balance. People need to make the actual choice to go this route and balance it, and that is hard to come to a conclusion if the community makes no effort to show they want this complexity.

Katrana Prestor for Warchief!!

From my experience on private servers it was quite a lot easier getting into dungeon groups as a mage than as a priest, at 60. 
---
well, ive played on ps for some time and ppl are speedrunning there on a daily. im also pretty sure joana wrote something about rested in one of his guides, but im not too much into them. anyway, every casual seems to think he will make it to 60 in less than 5 days played and that wont be the case for sure. the last time i hit 60 i was 12! days played and i didnt slack a lot, aoe farmed certain spots, but i did level some professions, something thats lacking in that approach. if you have to spend 2 more days to get your professions to 280+ you didnt win a lot on new servers.

That, and feeling that strongly about a computer game. I used to get so into games as a preteen/teen and they'd be all I thought about or looked forward too. At this point, I've lived enough life just being an adult that they just don't excite me like they once did. I miss that fulfillment so much.
---
The idea is that any role that doesn't make the minority status of this character a defining trait can be equally played by a straight, white male. And this is true to an extent. Burnham doesn't have to be black, Janeway doesn't have to be female, Stamets doesn't have to be gay,.. People who complain about the SJW agenda generally don't tend to be very progressive. So whenever an entertainment medium creates an important character that falls outside of their worldview, they have a hard time connecting to these characters. And because the trait in question is not a personality keystone (read: they aren't represented in a stereotypical way) they feel like this trait is unnecessary, and thus interpret it as shitty writing put in for political reasons.
---
Either if you wanted me to feel bad, or to be funny, you made my day.
---
So you want to tell me that I should have a separate set of gear which I should macro to put on every time I fight a hunter? Do you have any pieces in mind that would be ideal for that?
---
In my experience, it's more about how capable a priest was then availability. Good priests were added to my friends list and bad priests I ignored. Note: when I say "bad priests", I mean a priest that clearly doesn't understand how to play the class and refuses to listen to advice. 
---
But it wasn't paradise. As a holy priest, the biggest challenge was finding the tank and I generally was responsible for that since the core group is really only the healer and tank and if that core was weak, wipes would occur.
---
That said, I was good enough that people would friend me and, by the time I was level 35 or so, immediately after logging in, I'd get whispers to run stuff or even direct invites (if it was a person that ran with me before). I also ended every run by telling the group to look me up if they needed heals in the future and this definitely helped my desirability. 
---
Yeah the 60s were big for their time (asian guy driving the ship and in command occasionally, black lady on the bridge and kissing the captain) but the 80s really took it to the next level with Crusher and Troi.  Dynamic characters, lots of wisdom and strength, and not just puff pieces though they were both quite good looking.  
---
I just rewatched season one and two, and Tasha was basically a nympho!  They played her up as very physically strong but she basically alluded to sex every episode.  Polaski was a strong character too but not as charismatic as Crusher,plus of course the old relationship with JLP.  
---
Seriously.. best series ever.  TNG reached heights that I've yet to see surpassed in any other TV environment.  Too bad the movies were cheap action flicks without much substance. 
---
5% drop rate according to wowhead. eye of sulfuras has a 4% droprate for comparison. 
---
That's a fair point. But once a game is out, it's very difficult to add these kind of changes. For instance, leveling a undead warlock to 60 and then finding that your favorite tree is completely changed, and that you'll have to re-roll an orc if you want to play with it again? This is something you could take into account if it was in the game to begin with, but it's a huge change to make players contend with, compared to simply adding 2 variable abilities that they can make do without. Not to mention that we're talking about a remake of an older game - it's just not on the table. That isn't to say that this isn't an interesting thing to discuss! I love all of your observations. I hope this kind of radical diversity becomes more common in a future game.
---
Yeah people like to complain about modern WoW, but ever since MoP the game has been truly gorgeous. Which is funny considering WoW was once mocked for its art design.
---
Ding ding ding ding!
---
Great, succinct way to sum up what I was about to try and articulate. 
---
Hunter and Rogue are literally the only two cases of classes which have their tier sets being better than anything else, especially with the 1.10 itemization. Healers have almost *no* MC loot that's worth it over dungeon items, especially with Dire Maul around. Casters can sometimes use their tier sets if there's a good set bonus, but something like Netherwind shoulders or helm is way worse than the boreal mantle from BRD or Spellweaver's Turban from UBRS in later patches.
---
Well, Blue posts say that this is unintented, not final and still being discussed. So, doubt it will stay that way. 
---
+Weapon skill for ranged weapons just gives +hit.
---
Since it's capped just below 9% and 9% is super easy to make for a hunter, especially with ZG enchants, weapon skills effectively don't matter. For trolls an easier hit cap with Rhok isn't the goal, berserking is.
---
it all comes down to developers and a community that shows what it wants
---
Have never seen Discovery (but definitely interested in going through it at some point) but I like your points about Sisko and Janeway.  Sure, it's obvious they are not white men, but they simply wrote the characters as good leaders, with many redeeming qualities but some things they need to work on as well.  Picard was similar, interpersonally distant and was unable to find consistent, intimate connections with his peers.   I don't recall Kirk having any "flaw" other than maybe making some rash decisions and banging every blue-skinned, big breasted blonde that popped up. 
---
Yeah, 15% of the time you are definitely fucked, that's true.
---
Honestly, that's the best way to do it:  let the series cover exploration and the movies cover action.
---
Because when the movies try to cover exploration they just stretch out an episode to 90 minutes and it sucks.
---
It's called a joke. 
---
Enjoying your day in Stormwind?
---
Kudos to doing that LOL, that seems like it'd be very tedious but I guess if the shaman is just on autofollow its not bad.  Quick alt tab to set totems and queue a big heal after the warrior starts, and then go ham.  
---
I've thought about going dual screens... So just one char on one side, both having separate key binds, and just switching over.  Thoughts?
---
Well comparing it to a mage is a bit unfair since mages are the gods of 5man dps, since the offer songle target dps, aoe and cc, which no other class brings together.
---
Nevertheless dont have any fear finding a group is 100 times easier than if you are a rogue, hunter , boomkin or whatever.
---
But the times where you would log in and get 10 whispers are over
---
Anduin was effectively the leader in Varian's absence, but he was like 10 so Fordragon governed in his name as regent (similar to how Anduin Lother acted as regent of Varian) together with the House of Nobles lead by Royal Councillor Katrina Prestor. If you compared it to a modern constitutional monarchy, Anduin would be Head of State, Fordragon Head of Government, and the House of Nobles are the (unelected) parliament (with Prestor being the Speaker or Chairman).
---
Unpopular opinion, I'm not married at all to Vanilla's art design. Never played past early WotLK, but I wouldn't mind a total graphics overhaul and/or retail art.
---
#throws phone through the window
---
Its accessible, no question. The game is waaay slower than retail and by the time you reach 60 you will have a good idea what your class can do. For the rest there is youtube...
---
You seem to have an issue with constantly comparing yourself to other people. It's fucking pathetic.
---
Also your moronic "when everyone X no one X" doesn't sound nearly as pithy and incisive as you seem to think. 
---
I enjoy not sleeping for 48 hours to play casually Kappa
---
For me improving logs has always been more entertaining than progress raiding.
---
Classic will be an extremely stale and due to the lack of content very repetitive for the veteran so I don't think it's that big of a deal.
---
Did Blizzard announce when Strat will open?
---
Mic placement could have something to do as well.  I did a lot of musical audio recording years ago, and did a lot of trial and error regarding getting high-quality vocals. 
---
I think your mic sounds fine.  If anything, perhaps turn down the mic volume and get yourself closer to it.  This can provide a better quality sound and get a better spectrum.  Your voice quality might be improved that way.

note that these are bis lists by patch, so if classic does start in diremaul, then obviously the "preraid"section bis rings for example won't actually be mason's fraternity band and painweaver, it'll be tarnished elven rings.
---
It is slower but makes quests accessible that are impossible to solo. Just make sure you bring one healer and something close to a tank (shaman, pala, hunter) if noone of you is playing warrior
---
I guess that is a good point.  I still wish they would have incorporated more of the intelligence and wit of the series into the films.   But you do raise a good point. 
---
Cant upvote a post with that name in, sorry :-(
---
Good day, citizen.
---
correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure you even need to be 60. 
---
the differences between a fresh 60 and a level 58 is just about negligible when it comes to healing, and since you don't actually have to hit stuff, as long as you can watch your aggro radius, you should be fine in easier level 60 dungeons. 
---
so when it comes to healers, gearing up for endgame and leveling up at the same time becomes a very real possibility.
---
Yup. Thx:)
---
Against a frost mage without engineering? Nothing, a good mage can kill you with rank one frostbolt...
---
Hunter is okay, get hamstring on him and taunt pet
---
There is no perfect answer for this, but in my opinion, leveling is the best time to be experimenting with specs. You can get to 60 as any spec, and you're not competing with anyone for effectiveness. And working your way down a tree level by level waiting for that one ability that'll boost your performance can be a great motivator. It'll be much different at 60, but you should level how you want.
---
If we're talking specifically in dungeons, you will have no issues whatsoever getting into groups.  Gearing up can be a bit of a challenge, as mages and the occasional warlock who shows up will roll against you on items.  Some pallies and druids who intend to heal in raids will also roll against you.  Itemization in the dungeons really didn't make it clear who most items "belonged" to, although there are some clear exceptions.  
---
In any case, you'll get a lot of trips to the dungeons in groups, and as such more shots at gear.  Back in 04-05, I ended up grinding the dungeons mercilessly for my devout set and other coveted items in DM, and never really had issues getting invites to random groups.  
---
And I'll be doing it again, so stay off my server.  :)
---
I totally agree with you. My ideal game is that exactly. Vanilla/BC WoW with the game’s current graphic design. There are some gorgeous things in the game right now. Top two that come to mind are Suramar and Zuldazar. 
---
Paladins are better
---
Dude even Takei himself said that Sulu shouldn't have been gay.
---
Yeah but tauren tanks look badass.
---
Paladins are the masterclass. It's never too late to switch.
---
There you go... even though you’re 15 you’re somewhat understanding it
---
Green Jesus is beautiful
---
Yeah same. I have a constant want for a fun game but nothing stimulates me like Old WoW or Zelda or whatever. Its basically 1game/5year that excites me these days. 
---
We already have a good idea of each spec in the game and how viable they are in leveling and in end game content.  I agree I should level how I want but my desire to maximize my effectiveness end game slightly outweighs my desire to have the best leveling experience possible.
---
don't rush through the game, especially if you're playin with friends
---
Problem is that shadow will go oom really fast, has no way of regaining mana besides consumables, mind flay has only 26y range, which is too close for some bosses to not get hit and your spell coefficients are very bad (=scale bad with spell damage)
---
Thus one shadow per raid is okay, since buffing 4-5 warlocks with 15% more damage makes up for the 300ish dps you do in naxx gear
---
Furthermore all gear will go to mages, locks first, since your gear doesnt matter because of see above
---
Will gnome 5% intelligence make a big difference? I am also thinking of playing human mage but I am worried that I will lose out on something big for not picking gnome.
---
I'm working on one for Shamans. Hesitant to drop a link because it's nowhere near done, but give me a few weeks and I'll be able to put something up.
---
What I like to do is what wonder WHY blizzard made vanilla the way they did. Love it or hate it, blizzard took elements from existing MMOs and either combined them or slightly improved them, no more, no less. If they had more time (and computers/internet infrastructure was better) then I think some of your points could have been adopted, especially exclusive racial spec trees. But, we are stuck with this foundation and I doubt they will ever dig it out and redo it the way we would like (they already had a chance to do it with cata and THAT worked SOOOO well /sarcasm).
---
My biggest beef with this game is the leveling system. In all games that adopt it, it starts fine but then ultimately gets ruined by "Dragon Ball Z syndrome". What is that? As a hero scales up, the threat must also scale up until eventually it's ridiculous and eventually, not fun to watch anymore. It's why superman movies are hard to make. Superman is only interesting when he's weakened. When he's normal, he's basically God, capable of doing almost anything and, what's the fun in watching that? But when he's weak, he's relatable, he's interesting, and there's always the threat that he might die. 
---
And so it is with WoW. I quit the game after pandaland but my wife kept chugging along. I remember watching her raid and, as a PROT warrior, doing hundreds of thousands of damage. Having millions of health. It was unreal to the point of lunacy and I remember that day clearly, since in my heart, that was the day WoW died. Blizzard lost control over the progression and the scaling and the game became, boring. And I know it's all relative, that is, having a million health is the same as having 5k if the enemies remove the same percentage of hp. But it just takes me away from it, makes me disconnect. 
---
My perfect version of WoW would be a world where nobody leveled but instead, as you gain experience, you build up your specialization tree (the one you described) and acquired stat gear. Zones would still be unique but the difficulty difference between them would be less extreme. Any expansion would simply be new zones to explore, new challenges to overcome. The game could last, if not indefinitely, but a lot longer. 
---
Or, just cap it at WotLK and end the game.. just have Arthus win ;)
---
That makes sense. Hunters and rogues have more straightforward stats that will be great no matter what build you are using, so I imagine higher level items are more likely to just be better. 
---
Are tier items any better early on for casters, though? 
---
Exactly! Well said =)
---
Before WoW I was a tortured artist type of person: that self-pity of never fitting in, social anxiety, gnawing anguish when going to college or following the normal life script. I grew up on chat rooms and ICQ, which turned to AIM and Livejournal. I was always seeking the most immersive online world possible and it just so happened I loved Blizzard games and RPGs. WoW was a dream come true. The August 2004 WoW beta stress test was the best week of my life.
---
Fast forward to 2019. ICQ is dead, AIM is dead, chat rooms are dead, Livejournal is dead, and they've all been replaced by an awful website known as Facebook, every inch of which is inspected by employers, family members, and data analytics programs. Video streaming is constant and everywhere, the content is fast-paced and soulless, and nobody really wants to hang out IRL as much. Very good games like Breath of the Wild are solo, WoW is bad and solo, and MMOs are dead.
---
On top of this the political climate is toxic, nobody seems to get along, everyone is opinionated and uncompromising about their interests and beliefs. Then there is the monotony of a desk job, which pays the bills (can't complain) but drains the soul.
---
Even though I have a stable job and relationship and so much control over anxiety, **the isolation is just as bad as when vanilla first came out.**
---
The point is I am poised for a wonderful fucking refuge into a world of dragons, fake video game clothes, and all those ridiculous things.
---
In pvp the best spell the priest has in disspell, by a pretty far margin, as it works on friends and foes.  Both specs have that, combined with PW:S and fear is a really good pvp kit.
---
After that it comes down to what you like more, dps or heal.
---
Shadow is one of the best pvp specs in the game, but healing will probably win you more BGs, as healers are sparse in random bgs.
---
Defintily cant go wrong with rolling a priest.
---
Side note: rven if you are serious about pvp you will have to run some dungeons for items, which is easier as a healer obvisouly
---
I mean, you can switch specs at 60. Unless you have a problem with that?
---
Most "leveling specs" prioritize raw grinding speed, which is important, but going with different specs that'll give you an edge in low-level pvp can be fun, too. This is what I mean by experimenting. You're maximizing your effectiveness within a different context. 
---
Most of the action-heavy episodes were 2-parters as well.
---
It’s not the time imo, it’s the lack of concrete numbers from actual blizzard db’s.
---
Blizzard wants to release a “blizzard quality” game. That wouldn’t include finding sources on the internet for item/talent revisions. Imo it’s also the reason we are getting 1.12 since that’s the only version they have the data for.
---
Really? Because I remember Priests being the go to raid healer back in the day.
---
Good for me though because I'm considering playing a paladin.
---
Which were epic episodes too though!  Best of both worlds part 1/2 could have been a movie.. Imagine that episode with a better budget and production.  Nerdgasm. 
---
On meters sure 
---
What race should I pick for mage on the alliance? 
---
I like how Human mages look but will it be a big deal if I don't play Gnome for the 5% intelligence boost? 5% seems a lot :(
---
Use a leveling spec to level and then respec at 60 if you want to raid?
---
It's really easy with todays technology. I have a logitech gaming mouse with 3 finger buttons, so my index finger and middle finger resting like normally, but my ring finger also had a button on the mouse, so I just bound alt+tab on the ring finger and could change in the fraction of a second. I tanked + healed all 5men dungeons and UBRS as warrior and shaman. 
---
I feel like perception is not really that good. The Orc stun resist is too hard to pass. 25% stun resist is very OP. Orc also look much better in armor. Especially shoulder armors. 
---
My friends haven't yet decided. They are more or less waiting for me (and they are also still deciding), because they will be more casual than me.
---
Just simply not true and if you had ever played on a private server you would know that. Talking abput delusions...
---
Are Warlocks better than Mages later on? I hear Warlock starts to scale a lot better than Mages later in Naxxaramus.
---
That's right, paladins. Honestly, paladins might be the deciding factor for me going alliance.
---
I feel like you missed the entire point. You keep talking about after Naxx, but itemization is about before that. The problem is the changes to gear made as a catch up mechanic. A catch up mechanic doesn't make sense to have at first, since no one is behind.
---
Asd an example imagine in retail if a raid with ilvl 850 gear releases, but the raid gear from the first raid of that xpac was ilvl 750. This made it hard for anyone new to get into raids so they add dailies that can award ilvl 800 gear to kickstart your progress and get on more even terms with other people.
---
This is a catch-up mechanic as it should be, but what if they released those daily quests *at the start of the xpac*. Then you have a raid with ilvl 750 but dailies gives you ilvl 800. That is essentially what this post is about. 
---
Things are different today compared to the initial games release even if no changes are made to the game itself.  I hear the raids have gotten much easier to clear now that information is much more readily available these days, so in my personal opinion, play what you love and the rest will follow. Don’t let someone else make you play something because “they ran the numbers and this way is slightly better “
---
Why is taunting pet so important? Wouldn't the pet attack me anyway?
---
I don't have a problem with respeccing, I plan on doing it quite a bit at level 60 for PvP and raids.  I just reach my pinnacle of enjoyment while in a DPS roll, and with my current decision I can maximize my effectiveness doing my favorite content at the cost of hindering my leveling experience.
---
Troll: 5% dmg bonus to beasts.
---
Pretty good vs a couple bosses
---
That is up to people, imho. Personally, I consider only the HW axe better in terms of appearance. Aside of that, everything is somewhere in between.
---
There was a big lack of healers back in the day, especially decent ones. But nowadays on privat servers there are - in my experience - too many healers for dungeons and even for raiding are easily more than enough around or at least its never hard to fill up all healer spots. 
---
One of my friends on horde says theres a lack of restoshamans. But on alliance side theres really a lot of paladins and priests. 
---
It's like that on private servers because a majority of the players are interested in end game raiding. It won't be like this in classic, there will be a lot more casual players just dicking around at 60 and a lot more casual guilds. 
---
Priests are needed, but the MT healer is often a paladin. 
---
We shall exterminate this filth together, Paladin! For justice! For the Alliance!
---
You guys shit on this, yet Tips is using human warrior with horde r14 axe &lt;3 get a grip
---
I hear you, but throughout the history of the game I have fulfilled every roll and I have discovered that I enjoy the game most when fulfilling a DPS roll.  For both PvP and PvE. Unfortunately with my current mindset I will be unable to level what I will enjoy the most, but be able to maximize my enjoyment for end game.
---
It isn't just about getting numbers up.  It is about the reward of having to work for something and seeing the work pay off.  Everyone being able to see all the content without actually having to put in effort is how you end up with retail.
---
Lok’tar, friend. What is it that you wish? 
---
That doesn’t mean that it‘s better than priests 
---
RemindMe! 48 Hours
---
Yeah it's tough. I really like Orc Warriors too. But because I played Horde back in retail vanilla WoW, I want to try Alliance this time. Will be playing a Human Warrior. I am sad I won't have the 25% stun resist.
---
right?, one thing that always bugged me was how wow would be able to get new players interested when the first initial zones all have somewhat old graphic textures, dont get me wrong i love the ”vanilla” look and personally prefer it, but i can still not see why something like a toggle for a new hd reskins of old zones hasn’t been implemented 
---
If Your go Horde and You want to heal I'd pick Shaman. Ideally, You need 8 shamans in a raid (one for every group) for buffs, but there's never enough shamans.
---
If You curious how many priest there will be, r/classicwow 2018 Survey can shed some light on class/role distribution
---
 https://youtu.be/XbK5Fkms0Z4?t=1727
---
25% of people are planning on playing role of a healer. For raids this ratio is ideal, but for 5-man content, You might be right here, odds are that you have better chance to find a group as a dps.
---
Paladins are definitely the best MT/OT healer, you want a pile of priest too though for raiding, abut priests are the best 5-man healer.
---
Warlocks and mages stay neck and neck through aq and naxx, if you have the raids ignite you will win in a,dps race as a mage, but otherwise they are very close with locks being potentially higher but often in practice lower because of how bursty aggro its with ruin . Locks struggle early because I they have no + hit, and they struggle nearly always because of threat. 
---
Play a warlock or shadow priest then. 
---
I know it is strong, but I am a noob and haven't exactly seen the OP-ness myself. Can you give a couple examples of amazing situations where it especially useful?
---
Hundreds per zone as opposed to thousands per zone..
---
Oh, not my implication. Just different. All healing classes are viable and desirable. I think you'd probably want the least of Druids out of the classes, but its not that they're bad. But both priest and pally are highly desirable healers.
---
Ah i thought you referred to the last comments, where someone pointed out that paladins are better in need. Totally agree with you!
---
People rush the content with theorycrafted Bis lists, massive benefits from 1.12 talents and having everyone learn the encounters from youtube videos. "LOL people sucked back then, this game ez". I'd love to play the content as it was...
---
they should name a server "nost"
---
Other then Renew and, flash heal you lose almost nothing dropping disk for shadow. You also gain a metric crap ton of durability. Shadow will always be the better support class in classic. Your kappa is uneducated and, unwarranted.
---
That's cool.  I have a few other questions if you don't mind =)
---
Did you have existing characters beforehand, to help get bags/a bit of startup gold or was it a total fresh start?
---
Seems like you had the clients running completely separately, so no common key binds?  Did you use any of the common multibox software to link actions to multiple clients?
---
What is the biggest weakness you see with regards to multiboxing?  IMO I feel like world pvp would be really hard as you'd become a target, but also kind of unfair if you are trying to gank people.  
---
I am thinking I might be able to figure this out on a pserver for EASY gold farming.. I have a few monster characters and could create a side account for the healbot/buffer.  
---
And while you guys are busy trying to gank at 30, ill keep levelling to be able to gank in stv as a 60
---
Anduin was heir to the throne but not old enough to rule, so Bolvar was in effectively in charge. Except for that one time that Benedictus “launched a coup” and was labled faction leader for a bit
---
BOY isn't the leader.
---
Even if everything is mapped out, who gives a shit? Raiding is such a small part of this game. At least for me, 90% of the fun of this game is interaction with other player characters. Itemization doesn't really affect that.
---
Super mountain out of molehill going on here.
---
As if you will not get ganked as well lol
---
I plan to tank my way to being geared as a fury warrior. Tanks can hand pick their team as there aren't many of them and not many good ones for that matter. Druids can't res, so they are out unless we outgear the 5/10 man. That leaves me with paladins/shamans and priests. As soon as I identify a good healer or two, they are in all of my dungeons. They can send me a tell and I will run an instance for them because I know it will go well.
---
I actually prefer Pally/Shaman depending on your faction. A good healer will keep your group alive in most situations, but they bring you so much more damage and utility with blessings and judgements or totems that don't show up on the healing meters.
---
Alternatively, tanks also love mages. You bring a LOT of utility, good steady dps, and roll on separate gear.
---
You should play what you will enjoy a lot though. My only advice is to make some tank friends. I can't wait to make some healer friends! :)
---
There will be players who are new. They will be the minority. The players who are new, will have videos on youtube, guides and addons that were never available before. The baseline level of competence will be incredibly high. You were lucky to be in a guild with 5-10 people who were competent in retail vanilla. In classic, you will be surrounded by people with access to information that will make them FAR better at the game.
---
Did we have addons in vanilla? Yes. But NOT ones that are going to be as impactful as what is available today, unless there are changes to the TOS for classic realms (I hope there will be).
---
Did we have guides? Sure. But theorycrafting was in its infancy and a lot of guides were full of debatable content.
---
Were people creating youtube vidoes? Yea... Sort of. They were highlight videos, the quality was poor and very few were applicable for training a guild.
---
Take a hunter for example. In retail vanilla you were expected to get your fire resist set and your full blue tier set (beast master) before stepping into MC. We now know, that the itemization on the BM set is FAR inferior to a set of random blues (most that are FAR easier to collect then the tier set). A hunter in retail vanilla would have been lucky to pull 100-150 DPS (if he was competent and understood how to weave his abilities - most didnt) walking into MC. We now have hunters pulling 400-500 DPS because we have a better understanding of itemization. The differentiation in item changes from patch to patch, through updated itemization, has a FAR smaller impact than the knowledge this hunter has access to that allows him to walk into week 1 with \~+350 dps.
---
Say that private servers arent accurate. Say that the content will be meaningful for the majority of the playerbase. Argue about itemization until youre blue in the face... Eventually, your casual guild will be full clearing through vanilla and getting boss kills making the entire experience seem trivial. Increasing the difficulty only serves to increase the longevity of the game. Vanilla was hard and Classic should be too. That REQUIRES some changes to difficulty.
---
Because the hunter will dance around his trap and when you taunt the pet before getting frozen (taunt lasts 3 seconds) the pet will break you out of it. Afterwards the only defensive tool the hunter has is scatter shot but at that point you still have intercept to close the gap.
---
Thats the theory, does not work every time of course, pvp is very dynamic.
---
&gt;But the times where you would log in and get 10 whispers are over
---
I thinks it's only true for private servers just because it is so much easier to find men when you have LFG (word) channel that anyone anywhere can see.
---
&gt;Takei himself has said that he's **delighted there's finally a gay character in Star Trek** (this was before Discovery) but that he **doesn't feel it fit within Gene Roddenberry's original vision** of Sulu.
---
Unlike most critics of this decision, Takei's apprehension was not with the gay nature of the Star Trek character. He felt that because Sulu was the brainchild of Gene Rodenberry, making the character gay as a nod to the actor was a misplaced homage that went against the original creator's vision. 
---
Takei then goes on to say that having a gay character in Star Trek is a good decision, but it should be a completely new character with his own history, which is what people who cite Takei's opinion on this often tend to forget. And guess what: Discovery introduced a completely new gay character and the reactions from the majority of people bashing the Sulu decision were exactly the same. I wonder why.
---
Also I like Takei, but what he forgets in this instance is that Star Trek is a 50 year old tv show. Little known fact but the original pilot of Star Trek was cancelled because of the negative reactions the focus group had about originally having a female second-in-command (and this despite the overtly sexist comments the original captain makes in this pilot). Having a gay character in the 60s (a time when even female characters outside the damsel or obsequious roles weren't accepted) was just not done, even with ST's progressive nature.
---
I indeed had both clients running. I played on some shitty laptop and so I just had my shaman on /follow. 
---
On the pserver I did this on, multiboxing with a 3rd party program was forbidden, only alttabbing was allowed. Some people did this to the extreme just getting the PWs from all mages in the guild and alttabing 20mages in Silithus nuking elites within seconds. That was pretty dumb.
---
wPvP was indeed quite difficult. What I found quite useful was using the obscure click to move, so I just tabbed to my shaman, put down earth bind, cleanse myself to get rid of a poison and click to move away from the rogue. My warrior was then peeling the shaman. 
---
Didnt work always, but in general I was good enough to fight people my level with it. 
---
Once I took on 4, popped reck and blasted them all, both my chars surviving. But such engagements were rare.
---
Doing farming in Tyrs Hand, tanking + healing strat live/UD to reserve items or just farming DM:E should be possible. I soon abandoned the server after hitting 60, because I always felt like I put myself at a disadvantage by not playing both characters at the same time, but I preferred the old school way of warrior tanking. Make a host of healer friends and find good pals. I felt less social when doing the tank + healer combo in dungeons.
---
Frost mage is really good in pvp but you will probably get blown up instantly as well since mage has the lowest hp in general.
---
Paladin offers a lot of utility and wears plate. Sure your heals wont be as big but disspell, blessing of freedom and bubble dont need gear. 
---
I'm most likely mistaken, but wasn't that the case?  I thought people had like 12 hours from the time the first person rung the gong to complete the quest.
---
As an Alliance player, I still love every moment I enter that fortress and hear the music Battle 04 playing 
---
Yes and no. Back in 2005 priest was one of the least played classes (I dont have the numbers but thats what i remember). Guilds would bring you to MC even at level 55+ since priests were really good even blue gear giving some int and spirit (in early patches there wasnt nearly as much +heal gear). Many really good items can be worn at 50 already and people leveled their priests through dungeons
---
A good raider should put more importance in the eventual raid success than his own little personnal fun. No raid could have succeeded back in the days if everyone was allowed to cry a bit and have the leisure of raiding with their favorite spec. 
---
It's a forty persons successful entreprise which is in the pot, commit or begone! 
---
Imagine a raid with 5 oomkin, 3 bears,  6 ret pallys, 4 afflictions only warlock. Ahah!
---
One of the reasons Wrath was so good is because of the re-use of Naxxramas as the opening raid.  Wrath leveling was, in my opinion, the best experience of any *expansion* (not including the base game), because it was the most diverse.  It's not like Cata through WoD where you go through linearly, or like today where you can go in any order...but still hit everything.
---
It also gave them plenty of time to work on Ulduar and ICC.
---
With that said, if you go straight to Northrend, you either need to re-use Naxx right away, or come up with a new raid, which would take development time away from Northrend or from Ulduar and ICC.
---
\---
---
What would I change, story-wise?
---
1. The pacing of Wrath.  Ulduar needed to be out for longer, TOC needed a shorter life-span.  In fact, I would have done Naxx 10, OS/EoE/VoA 25 for Tier 7, Ulduar 25 and ToC 10 for Tier 8, and then ICC 25 as Tier 9.
---
2. Firelands was too small to be a tier in and of itself, and there was supposed to be a water raid tier that was completely missed.  Deathwing needed to be more of a dragon and have less tentacles.  Probably wouldn't have killed Nozdormu yet.
---
3. Mists would have had the end-game better advertised, instead of being about "peace between the factions".  It had a great story but I didn't see it because I quit early in.
---
4. Warlords simply would not have happened.  We already have caverns of time.
---
5. Legion would not have Ysera killed as part of a solo quest chain.
---
Server clusters fix this although I don't see it as a big problem. Classic will be more popular than retail.
---
Hmm... I recall this working in later versions, but if that is the case, I still think a boar early on is nice, due to some areas not having meat vendors (alliance areas especially)
---
Priests still live the dream in my experience. I'm seeing a lot more locks, and even more paladins, mages, and warriors even though they were already popular. All alliance side. 
---
Ur dumb
---
Wait, they removed mana? LOL glad I quit in wotlk
---
&gt; Priests are needed, but the MT healer is often a paladin.
---
MT often needs multiple healers. One priest with Inspiration should at least have a bias towards keeping the buff on the tank.
---
Pallies are just a sentient HoT on the tank. :P
---
Here are a few rules-of-thumb I go by:
---
1. Play what you want, up until the point it isn't cutting it.  Then, either change your goals or change your spec.
---
2. The number of players in the raid determines how selfish you're being by playing a "meme spec".  
---
If you're solo leveling, you affect virtually no one else.  In a group of 5, it might have some effect if you're doing something you're not supposed to (i.e. healing in prot spec with strength gear), or it might give you more of a hybrid role if you go Ret instead of Holy.  If you're in a 40-man raid and your effectiveness at your role is your sole objective, it's kind of selfish to be Ret when the other 39 players would be better off if you're holy.  (And if you wanted to melee, Warrior and Rogue are both good options).
---
&gt; Blizzard is incenting that behavior through game design, which is my objection
---
Yes, but it's more subtle IMO.
---
Blizzard usually makes new races/classes OP (and nerf them after a while) to push people to buy the new expansion.
---
In this case they made it with races BUT you don't need to pay for a race change to play those OP races, *anyone* can have them, you just have to play the game.
---
You pay to skip playing and have them *immediately* and this is totally on players' side and Blizzard obviously take advantage of it.
---
You can say it's a bit shady, but honestly if people didn't pay for it every . single . time, it wouldn't happen.
---
When I was raid leading, we looked for 4 paladins (get your blessings), 2 druids (buffs and heals over time), and the rest priests. I played a holy paladin and loved it! You will always get into raids in my experience.
---
If its dynamic respawns and they are fast enough a 5 man group will out lvl everything.  But then again that requires really fast spawning 
---
Its not a game for the hardcore and it never was. Its by far the most casual friendly version of WoW. Maybe you cant experience all the content, but you can have so many experiences compared to other versions.
---
Horde pvp racials are better. But alliance have easier time doing pre made PG because of the power of a warrior and a paladin together. Easy to execute difficult to stop. If you don’t plan on doing any pre made and focus more on 1v1 I would go horde. In reality the differences aren’t really as big as people think and you can over come it. 
---
Pick what ya want so you don’t burn out 
---
All you did was quote yourself. Takei said that Sulu was straight and hinted he likes Uhura. No one said having a gay character was bad, just adding the trait on to an existing, well-defined character was.
---
My experience playing classic is that I always did better on a shadow then a disc. As you correctly stated dispel magic is pretty much the end all be all. Being able to clean that CC right off is OP as hell. Shadow I found to be far more durable and, also heals while it does damage. Between the shadow heals, shields, and dispels combining with the extra dps I put out. Rolling teams seemed way easier on my shadow priest. 
---
People really don't like to hear that though. I mean I get people thinking I'm wrong but, it seems to make people physically angry I think shadow is better then disc in the support roll.
---
ya there definitely should be limits, my opinion is its easier to add content if you make that content quite literally added on, and not replace. A outland, or northerend expansion becomes substantially bigger in this way. It pretty much fulfills what your talking about. You don't need to add excess progression if current progression is instead a addition to it. Miniscule changes to end game can be tweaked sure.
---
What your talking about, the 5k into 10k into 1 million. That is one of the side effects of what happens when content is completely replaced. Because in order to make new content viable in this matter, the numbers must be higher then all other numbers. Instead, you can make content not higher but just different attributes, more frost resist gear while still needing health and etc.
---
raided holy priest from MC-&gt;AQ40.
---
I pretty much got constantly spammed for invites to 5/10 man dungeons and PUG raids to stuff like ZG, ONY, MC, etc.
---
It seems like there are people who will just "/who 60 priest" and bug them all until they find a healer :)
---
I agree!  Which is why I chose to maximaze my end game potential!  Part of the beauty if Classic is having to make difficult decisions like this and live with the consequences!  No all-in-one situations.
---
What are you talking about everyone farms reapers asap while they are at their strongest.
---
I was thinkgen but didn't write "%", my bad.
---
To be honest, Anduin in his current state is pretty alright. Of all the development characters have gotten over the years, his I hate least
---
That's how I feel about it too. But since someone dug it up it's gonna be the trending reason to dread Classic for a few weeks, like spell batching was a month ago.
---
The real LFM for guild recruitments are shamans. Guilds are always in need of shamans.
---
If you see 3 DPS looking for tank and healer its no LFM, they are looking for a group.
---
I get where the nochangers are coming from with original graphical preservation, but personally? Toggle please.
---
I can really only talk about elemental shaman in detail. Getting mana back in Vanilla was a pain, sure you had your totem and mana pots but outside of those you had to use stones which were hard to farm. Going all out with LB I would usually run oom in about 25-30 seconds. What changed between Vanilla and BC had a lot to do with spell crit. In BC you got 40% of mana off the next 2 spells when you landed a crit. It also helped to have a spriest in your party, if not you were likely still going to have to chain chug mana pots if you wanted to use CL every 3-6 LB's.
---
Doesn't that make it straight up better for 1 point than Unbridled Wrath for 5 points?
---
In regards to which raid boss are you concerned about being rage starved?
---
Onyxia whelps should be plenty to store rage on. Additionally Onyxia wipes threat when she lands so if you nuke her when she lands she will kill you. 
---
Based on the information presented, I disagree.
---
I would've canclled any expansions and kept the game the exact same in 2007.
---
This isn't the best example to give. Barman and reaper are the strongest weapons that were out. Even compared to IBS, reaper is much stronger. Any warrior worth their salt would not be pvping with an IBS. You're not getting invited to any premades with that equipped.
---
Yea dude like naxx comes out a year or so after release just wait to play until then evolved gameplay
---
I would have liked a demon-focused raid at some time during vanilla. It's strange to me that classic is so lacking in this aspect. It could have tied in with the burning blade in orgrimmar, with the satyrs in felwood, with that weird demon cove in winterspring, with hyjal, etc. Ideally, it would have taken the place of of Ahn-qiraj between BWL and Naxx. 
---
That leads me to my next idea - the Old Gods should have had an expansion to themselves. It's pretty tiring having them constantly come up in every other expansion. They could have had the AQ event on a larger scale, with multiple old gods turning up at once and azeroth (preferably the under-utilized parts of it) into a battleground for their ancient rivalries.
---
Basically this.  All the min max talk is by guys who I’ve played classic a bunch and get the early game stuff. We were all in your shoes at one point 
---
Its not about being rage starved so much, its more about comparing it to other rage saving talents. In situations where you're being whacked by a boss you're probably getting huge amounts of rage anyway, but 1 extra every 3 seconds is still significant compared to, say, knocking 1 rage off the cost of a heroic strike.
---
Point is you'll only really feel Anger Management during the times you ARE a bit rage starved - its power is in its consistancy. Even things like slow hitting bosses, or short moments when bosses leap away or disappear, AM will provide bonus rage.
---
And regarding Onyxia, as she does wipe threat, isnt it better to have an MT who can dump 100 rage worth of threat straight into her. I wasnt talking about a Fury warrior nuking her with 100+ rage. It was more an example of how it constantly ticks when you're in combat even if you arent hitting something, not that it's specifically vital to that fight.
---
Also after a certain point a huge percent was bots. 
---
The huge down side to overcrowding was the limit resources to remove and ban bots.
---
No idea.
---
They merged with Nihilum sometime before TBC, afair.
---
For most classes, yeah.  It kind of went like this for most classes:
---
* Vanilla: Mana is really important, you need to find Intellect to do anything
---
* TBC:  Oh, we realize you might not get Intellect on everything so we'll give you some way of getting mana back
---
* Wrath:  We designed the abilities and gear sets with mana in-mind so you have to use this cooldown to keep from going OOM and you'll be fine.
---
* Cata:  You don't get mana from Int, you have a set base mana pool.  So a fresh geared toon and a BIS toon will have the same mana pool and you don't have a fresh geared toon being harder to play.
---
* Mists:  We designed our abilities better around the Cata model.
---
* WOD:  Since mana doesn't matter too much anymore and is basically infinite, we've introduced a new secondary resource (think Combo Points or Runic Power) for all specializations.
---
* Legion:  Since you're using your secondary resource, we removed mana.
---
So technically mana went away in Legion, but really it's been Cata since it's started to go away.
---
I think it's Immersion? I know there's also another addon for vanilla called Storyline, that changes the quest text window to have your character on one side and the npc talking on the other side, and cuts the text up into chunks that are way easier to read, imo. Highly recommend it, [here's an example pic](http://i.imgur.com/eJdhBwt.png)
---
ele shamans got a talent called unrelenting storm which regens mana based on intellect.  balance got dreamstate which does the same thing.  this gave them scaling in-combat mana regen.  priest was given vampiric touch for group mana regen and shadowfiend which gave personal mana as a cooldown.  i think all 3 specs still have to chug mana pots regularly in long fights, not sure about ele though.  wrath removed the priest mana battery niche and spread around the replenishment talent which helped with overall mana regen.  paladins judgements were split into 3 so you would always have judgement of wisdom on the target restoring mana 
---
enhancement got shamanistic rage which, when activated, gave your attacks a chance to regen based on attack power.  mana becomes pretty much a non-issue once you get some gear.  
---
ypaladin got spiritual attunement in tbc which gave mana to the paladin when healed by another player.  this was big for prot since they were constantly taking damage but alliance rets didn't benefit as much.  horde rets were using seal of blood which damages yourself, allowing for better mana regen in group play.  you talked about it a bit, but ret also got a talent to refund 80% of the mana cost of the judged seal.  in wrath paladins got divine plea which returned mana over time on cooldown. 
---
I hadn't thought about the effect spriests had on the other casters.  I bet they really helped melee mana-users out!
---
In BC would you fish for those procs with a lower rank and then get the full savings on a higher rank?
---
&gt; Prot Pally could tank 5 mans with ease during the leveling phase and had no issues with the pre-MC grind.
---
This is such a meme and it's only true with four other top-tier players supporting you.
---
AoE aggro is broken *so* easily and then there's no way to get aggro back except wishful-thinking BoPing. There's also no ranged pull, unless you're *only* doing the three undead dungeons.
---
So I have no idea why people keep shoving this meme out there. Prot Paladins do not tank 5-mans *with ease.*
---
Evening, probably 7:30 or 8. Days? I don’t know dude we’re like 7 months away haha 
---
I don't have the meme spec issue, but I do have a hard time deciding between Warrior (min/max) and Hunter (what I want to play, but not ideal).
---
I'm even tempted to double box, or maybe solo level the Hunter and level the warrior with my wife.... Ugh Cannot decide.
---
Remember that guild along with Infernal Affairs, Silent Resurgence, Oh Snap, Phoenix Rising, etc. Always wanted to be in one of those guilds, but didn’t have the time! 
---
I know I was just kidding haha. I knew exactly what you meant.
---
Spirit and mp5 (mana regen)gear was really important for healers in classic. More important than the total mana pool I believe. Due to talents, spirit was the primary stat for priests, probably druids too. MP5 for paladins I think. 
---
Also farming consumables was important for healers and dps casters.
---
I think we largely agree. High five!
---
Unbridled is 40% chance for 1 rage on a hit, so you need to be getting five hits every 6 seconds in order to beat it in rage generation. I think this is very difficult to achieve without two very fast dual wielding weapons and high hit rate. This doesnt take into account the rage generated when not able to attack.
---
So yes, napkin math makes 1 point of AM better than 5 points in Unbridled. I think.
---
I don't have access to a talent calc at the moment, but I thought dreamstate was in Vanilla?  Or am I thinking of a different talent?
---
Very good call regarding Paladin judgments, and also Seal of Blood. 
---
Was Shamanistic Rage in TBC or Wrath?
---
One thing about Replenishment vs. TBC was that in TBC it scaled based on the Priest's DAMAGE, where Replenishment scaled based on the affected player's mana pool.  I really like the utility abilities that are based on the caster's gear, i.e. the TBC versions of Expose Weakness and Tree of Life Aura.
---
A lot of great points in here!
---
I like the old art style more as there is more personality, the new art style is just neutral and dull. 
---
MP5 for Paladins and Shamans, Spirit for Priests and Druids.  But I think for druids in Classic, both were about on par with each other, and it wasn't until TBC where druids saw more benefit from Spirit.
---
I believe it was WotLK, maybe Cata where MP5 was removed and it all went to Spirit.
---
Mana Pool was more important in greens, as you got better gear regen was more important.  Mana pool was how many heals you can cast in succession, regen was how many heals you can cast in a fight.
---
Just take a feral druid instead then hes not gimp specced half the time trying to heal in ret.
---
Disc is a bit of a strange one imo. I mean in pve most people will invest 15-25 points in it, rest is holy unless you are speedrunning.
---
In PvP deep disc does not offer anything interesting, the important talents like stun resist, focus casting or improve stam buff are all at the top so you can go holy talents or even some shadoe talents (already one point in blackout is pretty good imo).
---
So basically i agree with you, but still if you want to heal you wont spec shadow...
---
We raided with only 1 or 2 spriests so there was never one for the melee groups, 1 for a healer party and if the casters were lucky they got one too. It was always a good night for the mages/warlocks when they had an ele shammy and a spriest in the party.
---
I personally never had to downrank my LB's in BC, I would much rather have just used a man pot than watch for the proc. Ele shammy crit chance was crazy high in BC, 11% from talents and most of our gear had some as well. 
---
That might be a bit high, but it still means you need to kill rag around 20 times to even see it, let alone win the roll on it.
---
Honestly, I'd have been much happier if Anduin was killed in Legion
---
both dreamstate and sham rage were tbc additions
---
No just all resources basically work the same as energy now.
---
Oh man those patch notes. :'( takes me back. 
---
What's a LIP?
---
To answer your question, yes and no. PVP gear is better up until like tier 2-2.5, mainly because PvE gear was so horribly itemized in Vanilla. 
---
That's not the Sylvana I know
---
[Limited Invulnebility Potion](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3387). Makes you immume for Physical dmg for 6 sec (Removes you from the threat table for 6 sec)
---
Ele sham for SP boost?  Or were there big mana savings from them as well?
---
Instant or at least like 2.5x faster.  It was too slow in 2006 and it's too slow now.
---
Yeah this talent is good but I won't be getting it as I hate stance dancing with a passion so I won't waste points there... (yes, I am THAT kind of Warrior, I know it's basically playing the class badly but this is one aspect I could never get into on a Warrior....)
---
Yeah, many classes in BFA still have mana (including Fire Mages, Frost Mages, and Shadow Priests). The mana costs of your core DPS spells is just negligible. However, utility spells (e.g. Spellsteal, Dispel Magic, etc.) still cost a hefty amount of mana.
---
Basically, it's an energy bar just for your utility spells.
---
I'll have to look at the druid tree when I get a chance to remember what I was thinking of.  I know there's a restokin spec, but that's probably a different talent (I think there were 3 key talents in restokin in TBC, dreamstate must be a new one).
---
So it was the spirit wolves in WotLK, then?
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; Are tier items any better early on for casters, though?
---
They're better compared to their dungeon counterparts. 
---
+damage/healing was extremely rare in the first patches, especially before DM, so for a lot of gear slots you'd just go for the one with the most stats (focusing on int). 
---
After a few patches, again emphasizing DM, dungeons offered a ton of great +dmg/healing pieces while t1 fell behind. 
---
Thanks for the quick reply. I think i'm going to be playing a paladin with some friends one of the only classes i've never really played... I've heard very mixed opinions on them so wish me luck!
---
Generally speaking when a game developer says "Summer" they really mean "End of Summer" because it gives them the most breathing room to fix bugs/prep for launch.
---
I don't think we'll see classic until Late August at the earliest.
---
Source: Am Game Developer.  
---
EDIT: NOT a Blizzard Game Dev, before people take my post out of context.
---
Yes, that's what I was talking about when I said Scarab Lord was a nice middleground between wanting something to be ultra-rare and exclusive while also being something multiple people could achieve.
---
Do these take the four stage content roll out and the 1.12 itemization classic uses into account? 
---
Good luck! I hope you like healing, because thats pretty much the only viable raid spec.
---
Rogue, Do NOT go Druid like someone else said unless your a masochist.
---
Tauren tanks look so bad ass. They definitely are a bit intimidating from a alliance perspective. Atleast your first few times in PvP.
---
moonglow maybe?  reduces mana host of HT/rejuv/regrowth which was taken by restokin in vanilla specs.  dreamstate was the big one for tbc restokin.  
---
spirit wolves was the bottom wotlk talent, yes.  i think maelstrom is still the more important and impactful wotlk addition to enhance.  i like how barebones the tbc version is but throwing instant cast lightning bolts gave us the closest thing to a battle mage in wow.  
---
Priest Tank Gear: 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pC0engJ0IieOAA1K1EnguvVF0RFLAFEhaf0-e7Okkxg/edit?usp=sharing
---
Welcome to Orgrimmar, have you come to serve the Horde??
---
They brought the SP totem and the 3% crit totem, and the bloodlust.
---
Most fights don't require any stance dancing. Those that do require it it is used once every thirty seconds at most. So beyond the minimum of 2/5 tactical mastery to be able to use key abilities like shield block, mocking blow, and intercept, the talent has very little value.
---
Consider the standard impale [spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Lihb0hbZcZtizoxMdVo). Getting anger management would lose 2% crit and increase heroic strike rage cost by 2. Not worth it for 99% fights. Onyxia is a rare exception where the tank is ridiculously rage starved AND has to stance dance.
---
I think Classic with No changes is important, especially if it does well, to show that the game design philosophies are still viable..ect.
---
However, once Classic lays that ground-work; then I would love to see a remastered version some day, that keeps the design principles, but updates the graphics.
---
It’s still Anduin lol
---
&gt; but would you give 20 arcane bars to an axecrafter for a slight buff to the almost-as-good blue drop you have when you know something better is coming?
---
Yes becasue its a current upgrade. The same reason I would raid MC rather than just waiting till naxx is released becasue you know naxx gear is better.
---
 &gt;Will axesmiths farm the shit out of LBRS for the plans?
---
Who knows. If they think it worth it sure. Maybe if the rest dont then the one that does it will have a niche in the market. 
---
&gt;Will blacksmiths even spec axecraft nearly as much?
---
Who knows. People do things all the time if they see a gap that needs to be filled, If that gap is automaticly filled by a catch up mechanic then no whats the point but at that point just remove MC too since some of the gear is subpar to some of the very strong blues. 
---
Yea it's probably closer to 20 minutes but my point still stands. 
---
Thanks for the insight. Didn't know this.
---
Vanilla doesn't require skill people btw LUL
---
What's the point in not giving people choice about graphics for themselves?
---
Shout at me all you want but pre-WoD models had originality and integrity. Let's face it; Humans and Orcs aren't exactly Blizzard's creation, but one thing they did right with WoW was that they at least attempted to make the races look a bit more unique. Orcs post-WoD look like Warhammer orcs. Humans on the other hand have really weird swole wrists. They look like neanderthals.
---
It's not the same on the classic forums, that post you linked is very unlike the classic forums, I would wager it was posted on the BfA forums (with responses from retail players) and moved to the Classic forums.
---
You compare hardcore players who know every detail about the game and have played it from scratch 100x over to the masses that will be on the servers come summer.
---
Mabe I am delusional, but other than you, kiddo, at least I know how to do basic arithmetics.
---
It's different for each class and spec.
---
sure, sure.
---
Because, there absolutely will be a mass of available alchemists after only 4-5 days, and everyone will have the materials, and be able to afford the cooldowns. This isn't a private server party where your friendly mod just hands favors to his buddies.
---
you know what, fuck off, and take your arrogant delusions with you :-)
---
If most people who are clever enough to find and connect to a private server are so bad that they can hardly get through BWL, then vanilla is hard enough. The top players will always storm through the vanilla content because they've done it a million times. They are not in it for the difficulty, most of them play BFA as well for the raiding difficulty.    
---
Hunters are actually really bad in vanilla and if the raids were harder I doubt you'd even have more than one for the possible tranq shot. With the current difficulty you still have room to have feral druids, retri paladins etc in your raid as long as they know what they are doing. I will 100% of the time take a good retri paladin over a bad mage. Few fights require raw numbers to beat.    
---
Increasing the difficulty might increase the longevity of the game, but the game is hard enough already for the vast majority of players. On a recent private server only a few guilds went past spider wing in Naxxramas. Not many managed to kill C'Thun, there are people STILL trying to down C'thun and working on Naxxramas almost a year after it was released.

You can't tune the game for the top 1% when they are gonna steamroll through everything anyways because they are pretty much Mythic raiders who enjoy the server first race on private servers.    
---
What you can do is have progressive item upgrades or even talents which will make MC/BWL a bit harder when they are current content without making AQ and onwards completely impossible for the vast majority of players.

**What I Need Help Understanding** 
---
* (Vanilla) Hunters 
---
   * Alliance: had the benefit of judgement of wisdom on the target as well as blessing of wisdom on themselves. 
---
      * This was enough to keep them topped off.
---
   * Horde, I don't remember having too much issue. I think an occasionally viper sting (I remember most bosses having mana) would suffice.
---
* (Vanilla) Paladins
---
   * Holy: 100% mana back from crit heals, at high gear levels didnt have much mana issues (I remember chain healing for 3-4 minutes straight on some of our first patchwerk kills)
---
   * Ret: Lol. They had autoattack, a judgement that did little damage. They had RNG burst damage with seal of command, but sustained damage was terrible.
---
   * Prot: Had issues with single target threat. No taunt. No Mana Regen.
---
* (TBC) Paladins
---
   * Holy: Dont remember much
---
   * Ret: Got actual weapon attacks and better seals for DPS
---
   * Prot: Got Taunts, Mana Regen on being healed, great for AoE threat, not so great single target.
---
* (WOTLK)
---
   * Holy: Beacon of Light added at 100%
---
   * Ret: More direct attacks added. Raw Damage was about on Par with a Arms war, with no Rage mechanic to hold them back, and the majority of damage being holy (bypassing armor).
---
   * Prot: Good for Dungeons - not the best for raids due to only having a single large mitigation cooldown.
---
      * Fights were designed for a large spike of damage every 30 seconds or so, enough for 2 tanks to taunt off each other and use a CD
---
      * Then got Ardent Defender mid Ulduar -  which was absolutely amazing in its original form for end game raiding. Best tank IMO for end game raiding at that point.
---
If you actually had a brain, you would realize that there will be a small % of hardcore morons from private servers who played nothing but vanilla wow for the last 14 years, and a lot more people who don't suffer from autism.
---
No I always have instant quest text on and I've have to make a concerted effort to NOT read quest text basically ever since I've been playing WoW. I've been actually doing practice runs to just focus on speed leveling and avoid reading stuff.
---
*glares at you, angrily*
---
Let them.
---
I am not surprised, the people posting here are from the privserver crowd, aka. autists who played the same game for 14 years, they can't imagine anything going other than the way they play.
---
Luckily for me, these idiots will crowd the US servers primarily. Which is fitting: A land ruled by an idiot with a population of morons :D
---
That's quite wrong since many guilds cleared a lot of content, even past BWL with some people doing things their way in it. Don't try to convince anyone that non-first of servers guild who cleared content early had 0 offspecs. That's naive.
---
Again that type of argumentation where the examples are either "20 offspecs or 0" are laughable. There is an inbetween, there was before and there will be again in Classic.
---
What about Jom Gabbar and Badge of the Swarmguard?
---
&gt;Imagine a raid with 5 oomkin, 3 bears, 6 ret pallys, 4 afflictions only warlock. Ahah!
---
I won't have to imagine it because I will make a guild specifically for meme specs and we're going to clear every raid. 
---
super simple answer -decide if you want to go for world first or just be part of a middle of the pack anything from casual to hardcore guild.
---
If you want the former - play a really viable spec, it is extremely open information on what is the best
---
If you want the latter - play what you want
---
simple as that
---
A paladin with a 30/21 spec can aoe tank large pack easier than any class, bring benediction of sanctuary and only miss holy shock for healing.
---
As a hunter in vanilla raids you could feign death and start drinking before ending up in combat again. 
---
You will find guilds that don't care about having 1-5 suboptimal specs in their raids. Anyone telling you otherwise is just an arse (and on this subreddit there are plenty). Don't worry. It's your choice.
---
I wouldn't risk trying to level up a class that I don't like when there is one that you actually like 100% though, since how long it is to level up something. You can always do alts later.
---
Hi, /u/AsiansFirst
---
My American groups never took her to the wall.  (And I didn't want to write the strat here.)  But he was against the wall, he took all her stone throws, all her gas, and the melee (like Rag) knew when to run out and back in.
---
Easiest and fastest fight I have ever healed.  Concentrate on the tank, toss some quick heals and and renews on the melee, and LORDY if you go with an all ranged group, easy!
---
It's a game. Either a guild accept you as you are, either they don't. You don't accept someone in your raid, to then tell him he's selfish. In a social game like wow, when entering a guild and knowing the guild members is something engaging, you will know way before raiding how is doing/willing to do what.
---
If they accept, you're not selfish. If they don't accept, you find another guild that suits you (and plenty of them exist). Exactly how you would do if you didn't like other aspects of that guild. Period.
---
It's been fine on pservers this whole time, why would it magically be a problem for Classic?
---
I'll agree with Maelstrom, but Wolves was probably just as big in some cases - damage CD and self-healing CD.
---
Yeah, Moonglow.  The other two were added in Wrath, Dreamstate and also the one that gave SP based on INT.
---
It's a shame that so many modern guilds will focus on min maxing, and others will play the roll of "island for misfit toys" and pretty much only invite "PvP spec" players, but be hobbled in raiding. A much better way to do things would be to primarily focus on min maxing, but also bring people who need the gear, if some nice "PvP spec" gear drops from an upcoming boss, invite and summon one in, just case it drops. Keep enough odd spec players around (Or form a relationship with a PvP guild) so the whole raid never has to stand there and watch as an epic item someone would've loved to have, gets turned into 15g worth of enchanting materials...
---
It'd generally strengthen your faction in PvP, and it'd probably improve guild moral. 
---
Oh yeah, forgot about BL being group-wide instead of raid-wide.
---
If a guild gets to the point where they hit a wall, one of the things they're going to look at is who is and isn't performing.  A guild that "accepted" you in earlier content might not accept you in later content if they don't see growth from you, or if they feel they've hit a point they can no longer carry you.
---
If it becomes a point of "we need to improve our numbers, here's how we can do that," and the player says "naw, I don't care about that" then yes, the player is being selfish.
---
I care

Who says not giving people the choice? I wouldn't mind a toggle for better graphics someday. However, I think the Dev's feet need to be held to the fire as far as no changes go, at least while Classic's being developed. I think it would be too tempting to start tweaking other stuff while they're making the game if the community starts conceding various different changes.
---
Now, once the game's been developed and the systems and design philosophies have been proven to still be valid; then I think something like updated graphics would be something to look into.
---
Orc for stun resist is going to beat out a short-range non-instant stun and a little bit of extra HP.
---
I'm not sure what combo you're talking about, I assume chaining a few stuns, but yeah things like that are exactly why orc stun resist is so good in pvp.
---
It's a toss up. Some who pvp constantly can't live without the orc stun resist. Others who like an equal benefit in pve and pvp pick Tauran. Those who want to be different and only really benefit in pve take Troll.
---
I've done both but I prefer Tauren.
---
Exactly. Most of them only think about rushing content, but many people won't even see this itemization thing, or barely, simply because they will not play everyday, take their time until level 60, do quest/rep instead of dungeons/raids. Some won't even begin playing in summer, maybe in winter. And then a few months after release, imagine you're doing an alt, then what? No reason to make an alt because you won't enjoy it since there is no itemization progress? Lol. Many people loved Vanilla Wow even those who were fresh end 2005-2006 players.
---
Hell EU players like me only began to play in spring 2005 because that's when the game was out. I didn't give a shit that it was already probably patch 1.8-1.10 when I was 60 or beginning to do dungeons. It's so narrow minded. You have the right to try to ask, but don't complain about it like the game would be ruined if it wasn't implemented. Majority of the players love the game while not having felt this. And no several threads on a subreddit don't prove it's a popular opinion among all the Classic population.
---
Play what you feel like. I had a moment of clarity somewhere in the wotlk expansion where I realized that I enjoyed the game less for each day I played. Not because I got bored but because I realized I took it too seriously.   
---
Let's go back to 2006. I was 12 at the time and started playing WoW for the very first time. I was amazed about the enormous world and all the races and classes it was just overwhelming. I played some race and class combinations to about 20 and started over to see which I enjoyed most. I settled for orc warrior because I enjoyed it most. And I didn't enjoy it most because it was the most viable, but because it made most sense to me because I loved that beefy armor and two-handed axes! I still remember finding a chest at the shore near ratchet in the barrens - it contained nothing but a pair of gray mail shoulders with nothing but the armor stat. I was so fucking thrilled! My first shoulder pads! And they make me look so tough! I ran around mining to build myself better armor. Life was good. I enjoyed exactly everything I did!   
---
Fast forward a few years - I read about guides to maximize your levelling strategy and how you should pick mining and skinning and just sell everything to get gold faster. In hindsight I realize this is a perfect example of what makes the game feel more of a chore than, well... a game. It's a game. Have fun.   
---
This summer I bring my girlfriend and a few friends to re-live all that; I know it's not the same when everything isn't new anymore, but I will make sure to have fun. I will play warrior again and I will build my own armor. I will not read about the best levelling strategy. I will just play.
---
The probability of seeing something with a 5% drop rate in 20 kills is actually only 87.84%, so you MAY see this item on average twice a year. That seems ok to me. 
---
Play horde then there priests are MT healers sins shaman is a better raid healer 
---
Yeah yeah BWL, AQ20, AQ40 and Naxx are totally worthless because the rest of the content. /s
---
Keep in mind that you can't inspect other players' talents in vanilla. If you're in a mid range guild then they won't always notice you aren't the right spec, depending on your role.
---
I for one hope we get sharding for the noob zones. I've been through too many FRESH launch private server that were just broke broke. Even if the server ran fine, the zones were unplayable minus running off and just grinding mobs. Don't give a rat's arse what others think of this issue and they likely aren't considering that Blizzard just admitted the newer engine they are using to rebuild Classic, actually runs like crap and can't handle character loads well (phasing and sharding have become so important to the modern Wow version that it can't even run an open game world well anymore).
---
I firmly believe Blizzard has no choice but to use sharding. The servers can't handle an old school launch even if they tried.
---
No
---
The key thing really is that warrior spec is very dependant on fight. As someone who played prot warrior a lot in the original vanilla I found 11 arms for TM vital for not wanting to rip my hair out in 5 mans for instance - the ability to Thunderclap mob packs instantly from Defensive stance, the massive rage gain throughout an instance that came from AM ticking and reducing rage loss. 
---
You could also nicely grab 8 in fury for 5% crit and 3/5 Demo Shout which reducd all mobs to zero bonus AP without CoW on. 
---
I ran impale spec for a while too - i got AM and 3% crit but dropped the imp HS and went to 3/5 Deflection as Impale spec is best when better geared. This spec was super versatile. I dont consider points in Imp HS to be particularly useful given its cost and the fact it's a rage dump anyway - you use it at points when you're getting so much rage that rage reduction talents arent worth it anyway. 
---
My impale spec would look something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxizoe0zio   with the 2/2 imp shield bash moveable into imp revenge, imp shield wall or 2/5 Anticipation depending on flavor. 
---
As an aside, Imp Taunt was one I was always hesitant to take, i guess its only useful on bosses needing a tank swap with a chance at resisting, though you still have challenging shout as a backup. It certainly was a very niche talent as if you needed to taunt more than once every 10 seconds something was up with the aggro management.
---
I'd say so the dev team focuses on the nuts and bolts first. Then after that's done bring out the graphic option toggle. 
---
It's much more often not a paladin, actually, since they don't exist in half the game 
---
"...as an epic item someone would've loved to have"
---
Or, for the more profit minded out there: "...as an epic item someone would've paid a hell of a lot more than 15g for..."
---
Warstomp is underrated. Hardiness is not, but its amazing. If I were playing in an organized pvp setting I would prefer hardiness. For solo, I would prefer warstomp. The quick uninterruptible stun is good for a quick heal or lb. It can also serve as an interrupt. Its also great for interrupting people on AB/AV flags. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I have decided my class but not my race just yet.
---
Lol what does basic arithmetic have to do with this? Why do you add an insult to the end of every reply? Does it make you feel smart?
---
By your logic, the players that have no knowledge of details of the game arent going to go after gear because it gets replaced later. So if they know nothing about the game how do they know it gets replaced later? 
---
Honestly, if someone plays enough to get lvl 60 before dire maul comes out, they arent just going to stop gearing their char and wait for Dire Maul. They are going to want to start getting MC loot asap and to do that you need to compete with other players that are gearing up.
---
G invite PLZ, this is what I am looking forward to most. 
---
....although you should join the Horde first :P
---
hardiness is the singles best racial for pvp over both alliance and horde closely followed by will of the forsaken imo. + the other orc racials are quite nice too. def orc
---
Who made that Jaina version of the meme? Seriously, that's just fucking genius.
---
Except having it based entirely on 1.12 would be how the game was when it was on patch 1.12. If they want to do the whole process properly then they need to start from how it was on launch (minus all the real bad bugs of course) and redo all the class and content changes from there on in a similar schedule to how Vanilla WoW progressed. (Want to break Poly by changing forms as a druid? Too fucking bad, that was in patch 1.4 and we’re in patch 1.2)
---
I made an orc shaman last private fresh and played some pvp and I will never ever make an orc again. Every time I get stunned I get offended and triggered ;(
---
Orcs are probably the best pvp race in the game and all but I can't take it. I'm to weak ;( In Classic I will roll a Tauren Shaman. They are cool and have stomp and that extra HP is really nice in pvp it's over 20 stamina buff and thatch really important in pvp!
---
You sure it's not 1 point of rage every 5 seconds? This would make quite a big difference if true.
---
Easy:
---
Guldan never died in WC3 so WoD never happened. 
---
Sylvanus died at the end of ICC. Garrosh was killed after SoO. 
---
Outland as originally planned in search of illidan, to team up and defeat Arthas in northrend. Kael'thas keeps his demon affiliates and successfully summons kil'jaedan through the sunwell. The eruption causes deathwing to emerge.
---
?? I guess azeroth just dies 
---
Macros, man.
---
The reason they won't do this is because they want to make the experience feel as authentic as possible, this includes the old textures. I wouldn't mind a graphical update either, but I'd rather have it be a bit goofy looking than have people claim it's "not real vanilla" because the textures don't look like shit.
---
wpvp 1v1, 1v2, 1vX shadow with eng is beast.  
---
Disc priest is a absolute monster when it comes to group. bgs...
---
I dont get the hate for this talent either. When leveling a warrior this talent makes a huge difference in how rage starved i am, and makes playing it a lot smoother.
---
Ahah well, if everyone jumps in the same boat that could be fun! :)
---
I will decide for you.....,...
---
Orc!
---
This. Also depends on class/spec. E.g. Bloodfang gloves (rogue t2) has disarm immunity iirc. Which is great for PvP. 
---
If you want money as warr just go herb alch. But if you want eng which is BiS for all classes then you will probably want some sort of alt for making money w professions. Sure mages can farm faster but profs can still make good money regardless. warrior gearing is way more fun and exciting imo, as is the gameplay in PvE at least.
---
All the crazy weapons you can get, super powerful BoEs like edgemasters and cloudkeepers, its just a blast. 2/3 legendary weapons are for warriors.
---
Slippery slope because of graphics now. Wow. Better everyday.
---
Then you should like classic.  The pvp gear that was reasonable accessible was maybe on par with the entry level raids.  There was no pvp specific stats or any of that junk so pvp gear was basically just gear with more stamina and less other stats.
---
And since most people will only have maybe a few epic pieces from honor and rest will be blues because of the way the honor system worked yes it's pretty easy to get better pve gear for pvp. 
---
2.873438%
---
I wonder what it'd do to a Moonkin's efficiency to switch to a cat and get mana back through spirit. Especially if played optimally, specced Balance/Feral, knowing to the second how long it takes to get back to full mana, and having a quality cat weapon to switch to.
---
Well few points I have to argue here.  
---
Warrior is not "by far the slowest class to level", the slowest is paladin. Warrior you can just farm dungeons, you will dps, main tank or off tank late, after level 20 you get a leveling boost with cleave and after 30 with sweeping more boost...  
---
Druid is not almost impossible to get a raidspot, you can offtank, dps when not needed to offtank, battle rez, heal (spec need). You are so flexible it is crazy.  
---
Priest is not the most needed in raids, dgs. Shamans and paladins are way more required.
---
You are absolutely right!  I really don't want to make Classic into a chore.  Thanks for the insight!
---
&gt;If a guild gets to the point where they hit a wall
---
Assuming you hit one based on the DPS of the raid (which is very unlikely due to the different situation of Classic vs Vanilla, say itemization, guides content, increased number of knowledgeable raid leader which still won't care about such details, specially since it happened very little back in Vanilla).
---
&gt;might not accept you in later content if they don't see growth from you
---
Which is true for any spec. There is no magical reason why an offspec player will play worse than a regular one.
---
&gt;If it becomes a point of "we need to improve our numbers, here's how we can do that
---
Back then it was all the time "you need to stop doing that mistake", "You shouldn't take agro over the tank". In my experience, never "guys we don't do enough dps". Probably if your goal was to clear full Naxx or last AQ40 bosses then maybe yes (never did content past mid-AQ40). But otherwise I don't get it.
---
The situation you're talking about was so rare in Vanilla, yet elitists have done a mission screaming about that. Stay in your perfect guild and leave others alone.
---
That is the only redeeming part of the last 10 years of WoW. The graphics are pretty damn stellar. 
---
Kinda looks like a child. 
---
screech and the time to get it  isnt great, even at higher ranks, a cat has way more dps to kill more mobs, = faster exp  1 by 1 mob even if u were taking two on at once with an owl, youd kill both with a cat faster.  lvl 30 get a serpent so you can pvp or keep cat for fast lvls 
---
Yeahhh... I don't understand that argument from a graphics toggle standpoint. Doesn't affect gameplay in any way. Guess it has to look like it's made of legos for the unchanged gameplay to be fun. 
---
I'm the opposite of you, I don't end-game, have 2 abandoned max-level chars and working on alts.
---
So for me the fun leveling (not min-max for speed, I mean wacky builds for fun) are what I'll be going for.
---
Same with guilds - I'll be looking for a casual/leveling guild where we can do fun dungeon runs together, not raids.
---
Not the point, the AMA is  in 2 days, this is just an announcement thread.
---
Doesn't matter that much as threat will be an issue
---
but 5-10%
---
You should name the Guild &lt;MemeSpec&gt;
---
The information we have today is a double-edged sword. On the one hand vanilla was always a very "meta" oriented moment of WoW. Class balance was generally designed around one spec, pushing a class into a certain role. Tank, healer, DPS, or utility. The reality is that certain classes/specs are far more effective than others. No tank is as effective as a warrior, no healer is as effective as a holy priest. Back when vanilla came out there was a lot of experimentation involved before people realised what the most effective setup was. But modern competitive/cooperative gaming is all about effectivity&gt;preference. Which means that with the information we have people are going to actively search for that most effective raid line-up possible, and to an extent the game demands this. Sure having a raid with a bunch of Paladin tanks, Resto druids and warrior/spriest dps will get you there eventually but you'll struggle a lot harder than raid groups with the more effective raid setup.
---
That being said the information we have about the raids today also helps mitigate this. Guilds don't go into a raid without knowing what  to expect, they know exactly which tactics they'll have to use, which makes content easier to clear. This means that there'll be room for some less orthodox tag-alongs in the raid group. Just be aware that if you're going to play as a less effective class or spec, you'll have more issues getting into raid guilds because the demand will be far lower. This is especially the case for healers and tanks.
---
MAGE!??? Pls
---
I think blizzard should really consider nerfing some of the inflation inducing gold making methods.
---
A good rule of thumb for them should be "Nerfs only, Do not Buff anything."
---
Only decrease numbers, do not increase them.
---
I was going pretty strong for Or shaman, but now I'm getting indecisive between that, tauren shaman or tauren druid.  They're all so rad 
---
Yeah even though raids are designed for 40 people, there was always a certain margin for error built in. As long as enough members in your raid group are properly geared for the encounter, you only need like 30 something players to clear the encounter now that we know the exact strategies. This leaves room for some less orthodox classes and specs that might not be as effective as their counterparts. We already see in private servers that guilds are a lot more versatile as they were back in vanilla. As long as you don't want to be part of a guild that wants to be ahead of the curve progression-wise, any class and any spec is possible. The reality is however that a lot of players will still be really elitist about their raid set-ups. And even among those that are very open about it, there will still be far less demand for a shadow priest than a holy priest, or for an arcane mage than a frost mage.
---
What are your thoughts on this guide? https://youtu.be/zyLGKxlSsns
---
There is a few discrepancies.
---
I loved it! High quality. That's where I got the spell rotations and credited it in the footnotes.
---
Troll berserking into 1 second LHW spam is pretty hilarious in pvp
---
**The post I linked is on the Classic subforum** of the BFA forums. Like I said the moderation and the attitude from Blizzard is almost disdain for this community and I'm close to giving up hope on this product. Our community leaders have either given up or refuse to criticize or challenge decisions made by Ion outside 1 minute statements in 2 hour videos, instead of videos specifically targeting things like release structure, itemization and how the content is already very nerfed with 1.12/spellbatching. They have just decided to let it be even more broken.  People that were vocal on the forums have all been banned or unjustly warned for calling out poor moderation (where mods purposely imported troll threads) or for asking real questions. No one in my  guild all of which wants to play Classic and will try it posts there anymore. They have given up after seeing people repeatedly warned or banned just for calling out the troll accounts and showing their history. I got a warning for "harassment" when I linked the post history of someone who posts there EVERY DAY who fought against Classic even being made and attacked everyone that wanted it for years. You think I am ever posting on those forums again? For what reason? The developer HATES me and sides with people who never wanted this project.
---
I don't even know who the lead is on this project. It's ridiculous that we have no communication. Is it Ion? Who thought that was a good idea? Why isn't it one of the wonderful employees who lobbied for this and who wanted to make this in the fist place? No one goes to the forum and gives any real feedback because it's a hostile place from both the community and the Developer who fails to monitor the forum and actually sides with people who don't want Classic even made. **I'm not going to post on a forum where people are attacked by the same group of people every day,  for even saying they like a product that the forum is supposed to be there for. We don't even have have a real place to give feedback.**
---
Vanilla WoW doesn't have nearly the differentiation between specs that modern does.
---
For example, take a look at feral druid.  When you spec feral, you get two on-use abilities as talents: Feral Charge and feral Faerie Fire.
---
When you're in cat form, you play exactly the same way whether you're specced feral or not.  Speccing feral simply makes you better at it.
---
So, when I group and raid, I heal.  When I am solo'ing, I am in cat form playing the exact same way as a feral druid would, I just do less damage.
---
I also sometimes DPS while specced resto.  I maintain a set of decent cat gear and I do decently.  On pservers at least, the population isn't super high and beggars can't be choosers.  If the choice is take a resto-specced cat or run with 4, the group will take the resto specced cat.  I've never been called out on the fact that my LOTP buff seems to not be there, because people just don't really seem to care.  The content just isn't hard enough that without speccing "right" you can't kill stuff.
---
The other classes are basically the same way, which is IMO the beauty of vanilla's class design.  You get only a couple of on-use abilities through talents so the gameplay doesn't drastically change, you just get *better* at DPS, tanking, or healing - you know, you become more *talented* at a certain thing.
---
The reality is that a "better" DPS paladin is never going to be good enough to be worth taking a spot *away* from a pure DPS spec - but again, people have this idea that in classic WoW, every raid group is going to have the luxury to pick whoever they want from a pool of eager players with pre-raid BIS and who are all masters of their class and don't stand in fire.  That's not going to be the case.
---
A raid leader should rather take a ret paladin who doesn't die constantly, provides useful life-saving utility like BoP and DI, but does 10% less DPS than a careless fury warrior who pulls threat 10 seconds into the boss fight and gets the raid firebreathed or stands in shit and dies.
---
You rate hunters way too low for dungeons and raids. They have the best cc in the game in dungeons and will top dps charts in mc/bwl, which you will most likely never get past with a small amount of play time.
---
Hunters had a bad reputation at launch, but I would expect a hunter to have a fd/trap macro and be able to offtank mobs with his pet when needed.
---
I signed your yearbook! 
---
Better every day? I'm guessing this is supposed to mean I'm being pedantic or something? I, personally, never played Vanilla when it was current, so I don't really have a strong emotional investment to 2004 potato graphics.
---
However, I think it's more than reasonable for people to be wary of changes, even if some do get through, as a way to make sure there's no precedent for more substantial changes to occur. Everybody, except the most hardcore of the no changes people knew there would be some form of changes (Such as the optional graphical enhancements already slated for Classic), but the point was to make it clear that they ought to be kept as minimal as possible. Personally, I would like certain changes and improvements (Like a legitimate graphical overhaul), but I'd want to be sure it doesn't come at the cost of the fundamentals of classic, as well.
---
PvE horde is playing the game on "hard mode", and most people who are into the whole RP or PvE content only side of things like their fantasy humans dwarfs and elves.
---
You'll be a super minority ultimately, most wow players don't like to do things the harder way if there is an option.
---
It has to look like its made of legos because you remember the LEGOs! You don't remember the new legos! You remember the old LEGO sets! And thus the gameplay and graphics must go hand in hand in reflecting the vanilla ice cream! We must not be dazzled with extra sweeteners!

I always found the Vale in MoP to be particularly a beautiful zone.

Erm, there is, just select "Low Level Quests" and all the exclamation marks will be back, they'll even be faded a little for those that are low level
---
I mean... Seeing as the only characters that we play as are people that have been adventuring all their lives in a medieval stylized world. Actually having medicine and knowledge of science that we do would make a difference. I mean one could wield the elements to make sure that people live as they naturally can but its been a long time since people have spent entire lifetimes swinging swords in plate armor to kill others that swing swords and axes in plate armor.

Warchiefs Blessing isnt horde only. Its a zone wide buff for all players (not just horde).

Please utilize the Moonkin sheet on the TC and Druid discord for a more comprehensive list.

&gt;If most people who are clever enough to find and connect to a private server are so bad that they can hardly get through BWL, then vanilla is hard enough. 
---
No. I see this sentiment echoed here all the time... Like connecting to a private server requires some excess level of computer know how...? Go to youtube. Type in "how to connect to private wow server". Follow instructions with video tutorial. After 3 steps you are connected. Also, no one is struggling in BWL. People are pugging BWL within about 1 month of its release. Remember that these are servers with a heightened release schedule as well, so people have FAR less time to gear before new content is release further magnifying how easy vanilla content truly is.
---
&gt; The top players will always storm through the vanilla content 
---
All players will. The base level of performance that vanilla was tuned to was INCREDIBLY low. You had room for 40 players, not using optimal specs, not using optimal gear to complete content. 
---
&gt; You can't tune the game for the top 1% 
---
You also shouldnt tune for the bottom 5-10%, which is how vanilla was tuned. Which has how modern retail is tuned.
---
&gt; What you can do is have progressive item upgrades or even talents which  will make MC/BWL a bit harder when they are current content without  making AQ and onwards completely impossible for the vast majority of  players. 
---
Or you could tune content to be challenging period. With the expectation that NOT everyone will get to complete the entire game. This gives players something to work towards AND gives the game longevity.
---
The talent is great, you're just looking at bad guides.
---
Viper sting doesn't restore the hunter's mana.
---
Not worth it. Better to heavily downrank spells to save mana instead.
---
You ask for a percentage and I give you one.
---
Most people in classic will come from retail and have therefore never experienced one spec being completely useless which actually is the better mindset when playing classic. Many PUG and not hardcore guilds will accept specs that arent optimal aslong as youre geared, motivated or even better pack some knowledge about raids/bosses. A guild leader gladly takes a ret when the player is very good instead of a rogue/warri that is a complete n00b and there will be many. If you like youre "meme spec" (even though many of them actually arent 'that' bad) dont get imitated by some private server tryhards because you probably wont play with them.
---
and takes up a debuff slot
---
How exactly do we go about "holding the dev's feet to the fire"? Why are graphical options a "concession"? Why would it be "tempting"; and for whom, to make unrelated changes?
---
Druids scale worse with spirit than priests in Vanilla unfortunately. Priest mana regen formula per tick is spirit/4 while druid formula is spirit/5. Also most priests take the talent that adds 25% of spirit to healing. Spirit is still a decent stat for druids however, and MP5 is all around a great stat for any healer.
---
You should do what makes you happiest. Bu if you play a "meme spec" don't get upset when people don't want you in a raid or dungeon.
---
[GOAT](https://imgur.com/1BQ47Nv)
---
You could do Onyxia with 5, but most other encounters requires off tanks, multiple hunters with tranq shot, or individuals to focus on something else other than dps/healing for a period of time. There were also limits on healing because mana regeration was more restrictive in vanilla. 
---
&gt; The post I linked is on the Classic subforum
---
Yes, it is NOW but it wasn't when the posters attacking him responded. The post you linked was originally posted in the General forum, NOT the classic subforum.
---
The classic forums are fine (your example is flawed as I have pointed out), the moderation is solid (They mods just don't actually post in there very often). Do you have any real examples from there of the issues you called out?
---
Specifically in reference to the Mageblade, sure. I agree they may be justified in buffing some of the caster raid drops to make them better reflect the effort involved in getting them and their rarity. 
---
But there were a bunch of other items either introduced or buffed in that patch which were 'too easy' to get given how powerful they were. One example would be the Spellweaver's Turban, which dropped off General Drakkisath and was *better* than most of the raid drops up to Nefarian. 
---
Items which are easy to get and overpowered break progression and removes a large part of the incentive for some players to play some of the end game content. It's this which I think is the problem, rather than specifically the example of buffing this particular sword. 
---
While you might be right, I'm personally refusing to get cynical before the game has even launched.
---
Eh, Warlords was only neccesary as a filler showing the finale of the Fall of Garrosh (imo, Cata/Mists/WoD form the “second act” of WoW as all three have a story that can basically be summed up as “The Rise and Fall of Garrosh Hellscream”) and the beginning of the Burning Legion Invasion in Legion. The story would have changed quite a bit (Garrosh being killed after SoO and something else either drawing the Burning Legion to Azeroth or a completely different expansion and story as a follow-up) if WoD was taken out entirely. 
---
I remember frequently getting wispers from people if i was interested in healing this dungeon or that dungeon. On another note, i had the keys to all the dungeons aswell. Many people would remember keyholders to UBRS and strat and scolo. So if you were a decent healer with the keys that would be extra desireble.
---
Use a talent calc and come up with a build, try it in live!
---
The issue I see here is that in cat form, you probably won't have much agility if you're in moonkin gear (or vice versa if you're in cat gear).  
---
Did Moonkins get mana back from meleeing in Vanilla?  Or was that added in TBC?  If it's in Vanilla, they should just melee in moonkin form.
---
You can use an addon to show your mana pool even in cat/bear form.
---
I'd rather have updated graphics than a toggle. It may sound silly but I think it's important to keep the experience of all users consistent in an mmo.  I prefer the old style but there are benefits to the new.  I just think that they should pick one and stick with it- letting everyone live in their own world is a new-wow thing, kinda a mini-sharding.
---
While there is no reason for off-spec to play worse than regular spec, there are a few reasons to look at:
---
1) It is something that can be immediately remedied.  Bad habits take time to get over, bad spec is instantly fixed if someone helps you with it.
---
2) It shows that you're working towards improvement and shows a commitment to the guild.
---
Druids didn't get Spirit -&gt; Healing until TBC.
---
I remember the Spirit formula being a lot more complicated (i.e. there was the square root of your INT as well).  Was that in TBC?
---
I'd join the Horde if the Horde didn't have undead among them.
---
What about Meme Team?
---
Fuck you Sylvannis is THE Banshee Queen. All hail Sylvannis!
---
But Thrall is my boy too.
---
The issue I have with WOD is simply that it exists - it is a different set of time travel rules than we previously have with The Caverns of Time.
---
Why is the "girlfriend" 15 years old?
---
I think you two might be different ages lmao.
---
I dig it
---
Classic is mostly 40 man raid content, with 2 20man raids.
---
You're not doing shit as a 5 man group. Unless you consider UBRS as raid content.
---
The problem is that having a toggle for have the possibility to change the graphics is not a change. It's a choice. Even better, it's a change that you can make that is completely independent from everything and everyone else. You can't affect or be affected by other people by choosing either one of the choices.
---
The problem with the slippery slope fallacy is, is that even admitting it's a pertinent thing (which it isn't, but that's not the point), in the particular case we are talking about here, the category of change/addition such as a toggle for graphics is nothing even close to any other of the changes people are fearing, say balance or social aspects like sharding, LFR etc.
---
It's come up to the point of being really ridiculous to the point where, any normal people (and also even extreme people who think everything should be changed), have arguable reasons to think that #nochanges have literally no brain whatsoever. It tends to erase the legitimacy of people claiming #nochanges when they are capable of arguing about a change/addition that has literally no link to any other for the reasons stated above.
---
Everyone complains about Naxx being reused, but I liked it.  I never did Naxx in Vanilla so it was cool to get to go into it as the first raid of WotLK.  It didn't really make sense from a lore perspective though...
---
Yeah I haven't seen much evidence that supports the idea on PS. While levelling they're ok, but at 60 any decent group would be much better off with warrior or druid. I think a lot of people's perception has been flavoured by TBC memories.
---
The mana regeneration formula was overhauled in mid TBC to be complicated and rely on both int and spirit, with spirit generally being more important unless the player had dramatically more spirit than int.
---
You can find the vanilla mana and health regen formulas on [this](https://www.classicwow.live/basic-stats) very informative page.
---
I'd imagine there's a lot of bosses and trash that you just don't ever take damage on, so it's perfect for them. If something disables it you just unequip it... Obviously in some fights with constant aoe damage you wouldn't bother, but once you get a feel for when you could use it it could be very good.
---
I cracked up when Siv was yelling about Jaina. Good ep
---
Yeah it is now but it was not in vanilla. Don't know if they will keep this feature on classic
---
Mods have banned people like Gummy52 for posts on things like spell batching and then lied about it on the forums. The moderator/community moderation was not punished for blatant defamation of character and then they hid behind being able to ban anyone for any reason (which they can). Brian Birmingham has nothing to do with the forums, seems like a good guy and is NOT the lead. Ion is apparently in charge of decisions, while not even addressing questions or concerns, because he does that for the modern game. He also blatantly misrepresented and or lied when claiming 16 debuffs was the way raids were throughout vanilla, when he 100 percent knows that isn't the case because he was a hardcore raider/officer and a healer who would be organizing groups around those 8 debuffs. 
---
&gt;I have seen people say that it was a dream-life back in Vanilla, where you'd just log on and get spammed to run dungeons. I have also seen people say that it won't be like that at all, many hybrids respec to healing and with many more people playing priests now it's actually the opposite. I have even seen people say that you'd have a better chance getting a dungeon group as a mage or a rogue nowadays since everyone and their brother is playing a class that can heal end-game content.
---
Sounds like you've been reading one of my comments.
---
Currently on the private servers finding a group while levelling was a breeze.    
---
But finding a group at 60 was a pain in the ass.
---
Private servers may not be a reflection of what Classic will be like, but with over 300,000 active accounts (logins within the past 100 days), I'd be willing to bet it's a fair representation.
---
The upside is that you rarely have competition for gear in 5 mans.
---
Though, I had a few pieces where I had terrible luck and had to run the instance 20 times before I saw it drop even once. (Then of course, once I had it, it started dropping all the time. &gt;_&gt;)
---
Also, there's less competition for set pieces in raids.    
---
At least compared to something like a mage.
---
Finding a raid slot was fairly easy too.     
---
But then again, it shouldn't be too hard for any class, because you only need to find that slot once.
---
If you'd like to try out a Priest (or any other class), I'd say go for it.    
---
No class isn't without their challenges, but that shouldn't stop you.
---
Look, it is something like this. I think I prefer orcs over humans regarding racials. They are fine in pve and arguably the best race for pvp. I don't care much about shaman totems - I prefer the paladin buff system of fire and forget. I don't think paladin buffs are that much better than shaman buffs, so I don't want to choose based on that. That is for pve tho. In pvp, paladin is the best buddy and I would love to pvp with one and that is unavailable for the horde and the obviously good choice of orcs. If one of my friends knew he were a paladin, i would no doubt play alliance, but I don't have any of that. Right now, I still consider playing an orc on horde, tho alliance seems to be the choice more or less.
---
Everyone knows Classic will be easy the second time around. So why the hell would you want to make it even easier? 
---
I'd like as much challenge as possible, and progressive content/talent/item release is the best way to do that without making straight-up balance changes.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4g\_3zLHpv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4g_3zLHpv4)

How does that not matter? Some people enjoy challenge.

---
Ah, thanks for the insight! I probably won't roll a hunter for main, but it's good to know in case I'll make an alt :) Cats are way cooler anyway!
---
&gt;Bad habits take time to get over, bad spec is instantly fixed if someone helps you with it.
---
Again, changing spec won't make you play better. And there is no proof that playing warlock like an ape will suddenly do 50% more damage than an offspec like an ape.
---
&gt;It shows that you're working towards improvement and shows a commitment to the guild.
---
In private servers good guilds probably yes. But about Vanilla you couldn't be more wrong. Back in Vanilla, those were absolutely not the ways you showed commitment. The way of doing it was behaving like a friend, helping, even when you don't have interest, and of course, simply being present on raid appointments. Specs were never argued about, ever, in any of the guilds I was in in Vanilla, even the one where I went up to some bosses in AQ40.
---
And also, nice ignoring everything else I said. Because again, that DPS wall question will probably never be brought up in any raids, excepts ones where there are more offspecs than you could expect even normal specs to be.
---
Again, my point is, as I said it in my last sentence of my last post, you have the right to think like you do. Your friends and your guild as well. But leave other people alone. Don't try to impose your view on this. Leave other people alone.
---
I was planning on doing warrior / priest with a buddy. Do you think warrior / pally is much better?
---
Then classic wow is not the game for you 
---
Since the playerbase has matured, healers overall are in less demand on private servers than they were back in the day. More people play them and I don't see why that trend would not continue for the release of Classic. Further, healing 5-mans is so easy that even off-spec hybrids can easily accomplish it. I play exclusively shadow priest in a Naxx guild currently and healing, say, a DM trib is a cakewalk. Overall, it's harder to find tanks than healers.
---
Horde side, resto shamans are in very high demand, as an optimal raid takes up to 8 of them for their totemic goodness. We can have 5 or 6 shamans in the raid and our guild leadership will still say, "I wish we had another shaman." Resto shamans do the most raid-wide healing of any class in the game. They're also gold on, say, Loetheb, as casting their totems does not get them the debuff, at least not on the server I play on.
---
A 40 man raid will take, at most, one shadow priest to buff warlock damage and keep the life taps coming with VE heals. It's debatable whether a shadow priest is really worth the spot though. Alternatively, a lot of raids run a utility priest, which is 31/0/20, just to keep shadow weaving up, be the designated dispeller (high mana pool, lower cost on instant casts), and PI a caster here and there. Usually utility priests are new priests without much gear. Otherwise, all priests will be specced 26/25/0 or 21/30/0 as pure healers.
---
Priests are very versatile and that is their biggest strength. On Rezuvious, having two good priests to do the mind controls is necessary (same with some of the spawns in ZG). There are several spots in AQ where mana drains are vital. Priests have the strongest magic dispel in the game (although paladins arguably have the best overall defensive dispel). At all times priests bring the widest healing toolkit at a reasonably mana efficient price.
---
They’re the ones making classic so their hands are already “on” it.
---
If you consider those who beat Naxx as outliers, it makes sense for most of the population.
---
I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Naxx 10/25.  My best friend and I tried to run our own 10-man guild, and it didn't go too well (plus Blizzard butchered the 10/25 split in virtually every conceptualization of the idea and should have just stuck with static raid sizes).
---
UBRS had a 15 person limit... We regularly "raided" it with level 55's and up to farm blue gear.
---
Thank god.
---
There was a saying in my guild in TBC: "it might be your $15/month, but it's the rest of the raid's $360/month."
---
It's not about "leaving other people alone" or "imposing my view."  It's about whether or not the player is committed to success.
---
Behaving like a friend and helping are how you show commitment to the players, yes.  But making sure you are playing as optimally as possible is how you show commitment to the success of the raid.
---
Eventually Classic will stagnate in its end state, but that doesn't mean we want it to hit end state immediately. Progressively releasing content adds more life to the experience, even if it's only for the first year or two. It doesn't have to last forever to be a good thing.
---
&gt;Hunters are actually really bad in vanilla
---
I'd also like to touch on this. WHAT?
---
Bad in vanilla... Your hunters WILL BE your top DPS in dungeons, MC and throughout most of your progression into BWL. Meaning that hunters are THE TOP DPS for 2/3rds of progression. They also might offer the single highest value ability in group pvp through viper sting.
---
Are they good in AQ and Naxx? Hell no. But their superiority in early stages of content MORE than makes up for it. They also boast the FASTEST leveling capacity, the best soloing, they are among the top grinders of gold and one of the few classes who can solo group content (sometmes to make gold) AND they are one of the few vanilla classes that can play a variety of builds to some success.
---
Hunters SHOULD have been massively nerfed by Blizz. I am not suggesting they should change balance now, but hunters were by NO means balanced. This is coming from a hunter main.
---
&gt; I doubt you'd even have more than one for the possible tranq shot. 
---
Realizing that many fights REQUIRE 2 tranqs due to ability timing... Also hunters have the BEST uptime with nightfall due to downranking wing clip, so if you were to min/max you would want at least 2-3 hunters at any stage in your progress. An argument can be made for dropping to 1 in Naxx and even then, competitive guilds going for server/world firsts will be rotating out players from fight to fight to change their comp on a boss to boss basis anyhow.
---
Good lord, human children had big feet in the Warcraft universe. What has Blizzard been trying to tell us all this time!?!?
---
It still shows an above average interest in vanilla WoW. Not everyone will bother with shady private servers that may or may not be full of bugs. 
---
I don't think you've tried to raid with an average guild. Let me tell you that far from everyone cruises through BWL. Most guilds will make it through yes, but it will take a lot of time. AQ40 and Naxxramas are a lot harder and most guilds will struggle through them. I see a lot of people who either haven't raided on private servers or only did so in a good guild claim that the content is too easy. Yeah it might be too easy for you, but for the vast majority of guilds it's extremely hard. I've been in hardcore guilds and I've been in casual guilds, the difference is enormous and there are a lot more of the latter.   
---
You don't need people to do max dps no, but you need everyone to be on the ball which is incredibly difficult in 40-man raid. Take the pre-twins trash in AQ40. If someone with plague fails to move out immediately the raid wipes. New people joining every raid and you have to re-explain tactics every week. If you can get the same people into the raid every week then it becomes a lot easier which is why the top-end guilds clear content so fast. 
---
The content right now is tuned for like 90% of the playerbase. MC is trivial, ZG is harder and BWL is a challenge. AQ40 is pretty hard and Naxxramas is very hard. On the last server I played on I think there were 3 guilds that cleared Naxxramas first week, about 10 guilds cleared it in the first month and after that it tapers off immediately and there were several hundreds of guilds that worked on Naxxramas but didn't get to clear it. 
---
In the end, we want vanilla. If you want challenging raid content go play BFA or create your own private server with tuned bosses. You could also seek out a casual raiding guilds and see for yourself if the content is that easy.
---
Yes. I want to play a Troll Shaman for fluff reasons, but the Orc stun resistance is seductive.
---
In his guide, he says 'With NO instant corruption:  Send Voidwalker while casting Corruption -&gt; CoA -&gt; Wand -&gt; Drain Soul right before death' but your talents don't say get instant cast corruption.
---
What's an omega penis?
---
Who cares? Everyone knows the game won't be the same. The idea is to get as close as is reasonably possible. Hypothetically people will probably loot weird items, that's really a very tiny issue in comparison to endgame balance as a whole.
---
👉😉👉
---
Can't answer for sure until we know if Classic will have old Tauren hitbox/range. If it doesn't Tauren warriors are much worse than they were in vanilla. If they do have it, they were always underrated.
---
Tauren Elemental Shaman is underrated no matter what. Why don't you know that? Cus most Elemental shamans suck and the best casters go with casters with a much better quality of life. Locks, Spriests, Mages all have easy to get blue pvp sets they can dominate with or work towards epics worth a darn. The Shaman PvP set is awful.  Mages get free water (which Ele Shaman needs almost as bad, so you better have a mage friend). All three are great 1v 1 (tauren evens that up). Only the Spriest has to also heal in raids, and spriest is one of the most faceroll PvP specs in vanilla WoW. The other two classes  are complete faceroll at PVE. They show up hit a button and get epics and can also farm gold easier for the respecs.
---
When you meet a good tauren Ele Shaman? You will know. It takes a lot of work, probably has more buttons than any class, the quality of life sucks, they have a warrior like progression where they shine later, but it can be very fun.

Grats you just watched the first GOOD Elemental Shaman PvP video and understand how the class should be played with Firenova into warstomp stun combos, into nswfitness or grenades when outnumbered or 1 v 1, sticking on casters even though you are a caster.
---
&gt;The content just isn't hard enough that without speccing "right" you can't kill stuff   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The reality is that a "better" DPS paladin is never going to be good enough to be worth taking a spot *away* from a pure DPS spec - but again, people have this idea that in classic WoW, every raid group is going to have the luxury to pick whoever they want from a pool of eager players with pre-raid BIS and who are all masters of their class and don't stand in fire. That's not going to be the case.  
---
&gt;A raid leader should rather take a ret paladin who doesn't die constantly, provides useful life-saving utility like BoP and DI, but does 10% less DPS than a careless fury warrior who pulls threat 10 seconds into the boss fight and gets the raid firebreathed or stands in shit and dies, cause you know what? If Onyxia takes 15 seconds longer to kill 'cause that memespec ain't pullin' weight, that's 15 extra seconds of time. If idiot fury warrior wipes the raid one time by getting knocked into the whelps, that can be 5+ minutes wasted.

FOR THE FORSAKEN!

Priest and paladins are both fine. Shaman and druid not so much. Paladins are amazing, because they are plate wearers and have arguably better CDs for PvP than priests. They also have a couple blessings, which are arguably better than priest buffs, such as BoF, which deals with warriors' archnemesis, frost mages. Basically, the best thing about paladins is that they are very hard to kill and can provide very valuable buffs. While priests are also fine, they are much easier to kill so you might have to pay more attention to him/her than you would have to with a palabuddy. Finally, while paladins have trully perfect buffs, all a warrior needs to have a solid chance of beating a hunter or a mage or basically anything else is really just a solid pocket healer. If your friend wants to be a priest, he is just fine.
---
Note: In Tips' chat with Monkeynews, MN mentioned that priests are the best healers for a duo. Not sure why, but it may have been because he was an orc back then and maybe forgot about paladins a bit or just didn't have the insight. I dunno. Again, priests are just fine.
---
Both are good so you can pick whatever. I prefer tauren cos warstomp gives much more playabilty, skill cap, so to speak, and potential things you can do and play with. the better the player the more gain and benefit he gets from the warstomp, and as you get better and learn you 'll find more and more ways and situations and application to use it. its short cd, you pretty much use it routinely every fight as a part of your toolkit, what can i say its great.
---
Shamans got pretty much everything, but one thing they miss is stuns. So its really nice to have a stun on top of everything else shamans got. and there are tons of combos you can make with warstomp for a shaman, both defensively and offensively. 
---
also bonus hp is amazing, since how many times you meat tank things, and rely on outsurviving it with hp, and pop that ns, or kite, or finish the heal cast. stamina is one of the most important stats for pvp, for any shaman spec you go with. so how many time you survived at 5% hp and poped that ns, or managed to get away at low hp etc. - i can tell its a lot. as an orc you'd be dead.
---
If you plan on playing a long time, you will be at max level a long time. 
---
In that case I would clearly recommend you choose the spec you like better for end game. 
---
I thought it wasn't recommended because its been broken on some pservers, not because the rage loss ooc. 
---
Indeed they work well in MC and early BWL, but in those raids you can bring a bunch of moonkins and meme specs and still hammer your way through if the players are good enough. In AQ/Naxx they fall so far behind that it's hardly worth taking them and if they are there they usually do kiting business, tranq shot or Nightfalling. Out of all the broken classes in vanilla I definitely think hunters are the most in need of a buff. Retris, ferals etc may be bad, but at least they can heal instead. Hunters only have one role and they are beat by the hybrids at their only role. 
---
Nice again ignoring everything the guy you argue with said. And downvoting him in the meantime.
---
Have fun in your elite world.
---
My rogue killed dps meters in vanilla. I was usually top of the chart on every boss fights Vanish drops all your threat so you can go hard af so it’s hard to beat imo.

Dungeon limits were changed in [Patch 1.10.0](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0). UBRS is now a 10man.

But yeah, it's technically a raid but I've never really counted it as raid content.
---
The nochangers have not an intelligent bone in their body. It almost makes me wonder if any of them ever played vanilla back in the day, or if they're all the pserver people who think that playing on a private server today will give them the same experiences we had many years ago.

Eh, the hunched orcs with tusks are much more reminiscent of Warhammer than post-WoD. Warhammer orcs have much longer and more rounded faces, hunched backs and pretty large tusks.

---
Hunters in the know enchanted gear with MP/5 and had feign/drink macros so they wouldn’t OOM a fight. 
---
A lot of fights in all content as a healer you don’t take any damage. It would be amazing in basically all 5 man dungeons and a handful of bosses in MC, BWL. It’s not an item you would use every right it’s more of a BiS in some situations

I (shamefully) had this ring on a mage. The shield coming off wasn't really an issue, I took the ring off when it was on cooldown, and if I knew I would be taking AoE damage in a fight I took it off beforehand. Switching items around is pretty normal in vanilla raiding.

---
&gt;  but in those raids you can bring a bunch of moonkins and meme specs and  still hammer your way through if the players are good enough 
---
So we can both agree the content needs to be tuned and made more difficult and arguing semantics about itemization is silly with how trivial the content is?
---
I want to be clear when I say that I'm not referring to the optional graphical update currently set for Classic. I'm, personally, pretty ambivalent towards it, although I have heard a few legitimate complaints about how it can negate certain tactical advantages the original water offered (Which I guess goes to show how even the most minute change could have unintended consequences) but that's an argument for people more in the know than I am.
---
What I'm more or less referring to is a complete overhaul in the same vein as the recent Crash Bandicoot or Spyro Remasters, in which case, I think there would be significant changes to a lot of the geometry of objects (by necessity, of course) and all the different things that would go with creating new models and/or updating the old ones, and we've definitely seen from the WoD model updates that things definitely do get lost in translation between old an new, and there's definitely going to be some invariable differences between what the old world and the new world would be like, and there's definitely an argument to be made that there would likely be unforeseen consequences with how people play.
---
There's definitely a time and place for something like what was mentioned above; but I think it would be better off as its own designated server-type. I say there needs to be a place for the 2004 version of the game, warts and all, to live on its own and for people who want to play the game exactly (or as close as Blizzard can make it) as it was during Vanilla. The Remastered version can live on its own as well, and the different tweaks which may or may not cause a butterfly effect can live on there.
---
Yeah seems like the old gods have become a cop out tbh. Anytime they need to explain some evil motivation or twists its all because of muh old gods.
---
I think they're actually really cool, just do them proper justice instead of treating them like sprinkles.

Anyone got an arms warrior one?

&gt;they're all the pserver people who think that playing on a private server today will give them the same experiences we had many years ago.
---
Probably this.
---
Why don't you just level the spec you want and then respec at level 60? Obviously race/class are of some concern, since you can't change those. Seems like you are mostly asking about talent spec though.

This is why I don't like the way they're doing progressive release.
---
Either make everything progressive or none of it. 
---
If we get naxx patch items and naxx patch talents, then they may as well let us raid naxxramas instead of gating it, because by design it will be the only difficult, and thereby enjoyable, raid.
---
Thank you. I'll be here all night.
---
Doh my bad, didn't notice this thread was in classicwow instead of wow subreddit!
---
Really? When it came out in 2004, it was widely praised for having great art Direction, the cartoon style made up for relatively low resolution graphics and low poly count models which allowed the game to run on very basic computers.
---
Here I made a troll shaman...
---
Corpse run? You've got a pocket healer don't you?
---
I have a court ruling that obligates me to pick up this talent...

Banish for MC is needed too makes Garr easy mode

who would be trump in your scenario tho, tell me, this is important

How did raid lockouts work in vanilla? If UBRS had a week long lockout then it's a raid, if it didnt have any lockout then it's a dungeon 
---
To add to his comments having hunters for kiting mobs on major domi / Razorgore / BWL trash is amazing utility. Also tranq shot requirement for raids. Hunters are needed and good ones are respected
---
Appreciate you taking the time to write that. I feel like we won't know what we are gonna roll until launch day. Could end up completely changing our minds. Warrior / Pally does sound awesome. So much survivability...
---
Man I can't wait for launch
---
&gt;  One priest with Inspiration should at least have a bias towards keeping the buff on the tank.
---
What we used to do is just have one Priest spam rank 1 heal on the MT to ensure the buff stays up at all times and that's all they would do during fights, so the Priest who has to keep the buff up might not end up doing any significant healing.
---
At the start of the raid all healing Priests used to /roll who gets to  be the Inspiration slave for that nights' raid.
---
Yes, my point is though that I'm not stating my own opinion here. I'm asking for people's opinion on what will happen if the fear/rumors turn out to be true and Retail really is dying this time :)
---
What I'm more or less referring to is a complete overhaul in the same vein as the Spyro or Crash Bandicoot Remasters. Things could be redesigned as similarly as possible, but there's inevitably going to be things lost in translation and the actual world-spaces between someone using the 2004 graphics and someone using remastered graphics will be different enough that it would cause unforeseen consequences. Leaving the whole slippery-slope thing for aside, there's still the distinct possibility that totally updated graphics might change the way things are played and is something some people don't want.
---
A totally remastered version of Classic would be awesome, even if there are differences between how it and the original game play, but it's something I think would be better off on separate servers than ones with the 2004 graphics.
---
Understandable. I personally like fewer quests. I'm a completionist and I can feel overwhelmed in games with a ton of quests.
---
Never is absolutely wrong tbh. My class lead and i constantly had to ease because of threat, and our tanks were great and geared tf out. 
---
Idk how horde warlocks can even play the game since it was so frustrating for us, even with salv.
---
Alliance warriors are always better not only because of the paladins support, but because you wont need to fight paladins on the other side.
---
You get on the target, you hamstringed it - it runs away on a freedom given by paladin - have fun. you get on it again it got boped, nothing you can do - have fun. you are mad finally get on a paladin, he bubbled - have fun... its horrendous. and paladins are everywhere.
---
I'm rolling a gnome fury warrior in Classic.  
---
Gnome is bad for both fury and tank. I of course want to be a gnome for PVP reasons.  
---
I know that I will suffer for this decision, but I cannot get myself to play a human warrior. It's just not possible for me. I can't even imagine how disappointed I would be in myself if I was a human.  
---
In order to make up for this choice, I will be the guy who is fully consumed every raid, including non-progression raids.  
---
I have a lot of free time to play this game every day, so money will not be an issue. One of my first investments will be edgemaster's.  
---
I expect that I will be denied application to a guild for being a gnome instead of a human, but I hope guilds that I apply to see the length I'm willing to go to make up the gap.

Around 9:32 he does say get instant corruption if that's what you're referring to. I disagree with this because of the [global cooldown](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=61304/global-cooldown) (GCD) of 1.5 seconds which he mentions you can wand sooner which is valid. Instant cast also enables you to cast it while moving which I think IS mandatory in PVP which I plan on avoiding as much as possible while leveling.
---
I'm now noticing his rotation is based on the instant cast. I should update it with more testing or might just get instant cast anyway if it's too annoying without.
---
Does that sound right or am I misunderstanding something?
---
The specs doesn't really matter much as long as the players are good enough and most of them are not. 
---
Take a mid-level guild and form a 100% optimal raid setup and they still won't get far into AQ40. 
---
Take a top-level guild and stack it full of meme specs and they could probably clear AQ40 as long as they are geared enough, but not Naxxramas. Naxx requires the raid to drop the meme specs and stack as many "proper" classes and specs as possible. IMO this is kinda sad because one of the innovative ideas of vanilla is the existence of support classes and raids where you can carry less optimal specs. You don't have to go all hardcore min-maxing. If that's what you want then go play BFA.
---
The hunter sucks in PvE post BWL, that's just a fact. An unfortunate fact.
---
I say it will be different, because MMO is no longer the new  hotness, it is a rather tired genre that has had no  good games in a very long time. Moreover, I can see games like Ashes of Creation and Crowfall being more popular than Classic WOW if they turn out any good. I love Vanilla, but if I could choose between that and a new good MMO, I would pick the latter. If all of the new MMOs suck, I could see it Classic being more popular.
---
I think Tauren is the better choice. I'm not saying the stun resist aint the nuts but, frankly. Who's match up is that really gonna change? Resisting 30% of a rogues stuns should still have you losing to the rogue. War stomp on the other hand. Lets you get that AOE stun. With exactly enough time to launch a chain lightning at someones grill. All that being said. Pick either one they are both amazing.
---
One of the things I like doing the most is banging hoors.
---
I was debating whether or not to go Herb/Alch for neat potions, or Herb/Skin for money. Your post convinced me to stick with Alch. I really want to make potions and be helpful.
---
&gt; I'm now noticing his rotation is based on the instant cast. 
---
Yes, that's what I was trying to point out.
---
&gt; I should update it with more testing or might just get instant cast anyway if it's too annoying without.
---
IMO, you  don't need instant cast corruption but then your rotation should be different than what your guide has. Also, instant cast corruption feels really fun and the other talents in place of it aren't that good. I'm currently doing a trial leveling right now. Shooting for his 22/8/21 build.
---
 Lockouts were all over the place in vanilla. Some reset on Tuesdays like you're used to, some reset on other days, and IIRC there were some that actually reset twice in a week.
---
More to your point, UBRS was a part of the BRS dungeon, and therefore had no "lockout" except for the /hour maximum.
---
That and the quest xp being so low.  Nothing like turning in 5 quests for like 10% of a level.  Makes you realize why solo grinding mobs is the fastest way.
---

---
The 1st couple of raids on 1.12 talents will be easy enough for 30 people in leveling gear to clear. You can have some people go try hard and still have a few meme specs. The problem is if you level up to 60 quickly, most of the people raiding will be try-harding and want to min/max so unless you know a guild or you want to put forth the effort, I wouldn't go meme spec unless you  are fine with waiting until most raids are on farm.
---
I'd never turn the PC into "The Totally Biggest and Bestest Hero of Azeroth." By all means recognize our accomplishments, but don't forget the other 4-39 other adventurers who were just as impactful.
---
Quests should be for capable adventurers/minor heroes, dungeons and raids require so much more. The story should note that and not make the PC the focus of the story.
---
Don't make me a Commander, make me an important piece in a much larger puzzle.
---
There's always one... You are the red headed step child. You have so much to offer but, this family will never accept you. lol
---
Would disturb me though. Part of Vanilla was that everyone looked like hobos unless they did the tough things.
---
If you want to raid hardcore? Minmax.
---
If you want to just raid casually and clear content? Play whatever you like.
---
But doesn't the LFD/LFR summon people to instance? 
---
Eh, every good warrior player takes that talent. 
---
Also, it gives 1 rage every 3 seconds when you're above 0 rage, doesn't depend if you're in combat or not.
---
When I played during actual vanilla I firmly remember every prot warrior running 31/5/15 build all the way through naxx and going deeper into prot tree being considered a bit of a joke.
---
Is going full prot like in your build the prot warrior meta now and what is the reasoning behind it?
---
What instant 60 server do you play on?
---
BOLVAAAAR!!!!
---
The only way AQ is nerfed would be threat, but you could argue it doesn't matter at that point because DPS will be so high that you have tanks in dps gear for speedruns and stuff.
---
ZG had more debuffs if I remember right, but ZG was supposed to be a catch up that had good players carry mediocre players by putting some nice loot in there for them to. To be honest ZG was probably way too hard as a catch up or first introduction to raiding. 
---
I would say ZG is fine. AQ is fine. Naxx is still good. BWL/MC are the big problems. MC will be so easy people will raid with the bare minimum and gear twice as fast which is a major problem. 1.12 talents and no delay on heals on tank won't break it for most guilds. Wrong itemization, debuffs will. With old itemization the good guilds will PROBABLY have to bring a full raid (they will probably sell 10 carry slots for bad tier sets like mage).
---
It's not as bad as you think IF they do itemization right and release content right (delay DM). Spread it out to at least 6 content patches, have interns fill in the right stats between content patches and everything should be fine.
---
Which version of Vanilla will Classic emulate?
---
Classic development is starting with Patch 1.12: Drums of War (One of the final content patches before The Burning Crusade) as the foundation, with a debuff limit of 16. Classic will run on modern WoW's architecture (or backbone).
---

---
It is not going to be the exact same API that we had back then. Blizzard has removed a lot of features since that time, concluding that some features were too powerful in terms of automating the game.
---
It is going to be similar the current API but stripped down to features that are applicable to Classic.
---
night elf ghost cat is coolest vanilla pet ;) plus easy grinding from 13-20 north auberdine

I mean, lets not be too generous
---
I hope you're right.
---
&gt;All 8 classes
---
*sigh*
---
I think at least before Shield Slam appeared (and it was instead the weird "Shield Specialisation") there wasnt much need to go higher than you needed for Defiance and 1 in Shield Block.
---
The main thing about 31/5/15 was that it let you PvP as an arms warrior and do okay damage as an offtank, plus solo effectively. It's was truly the best all-round spec and going full prot really wasnt much need.
---
I think also, One Handed spec used to be 5% damage. I THINK that in 1.12 a full Prot build with Shield Slam and 1h Spec should outdamage and out threat a 31/5/15 build easily, but by that point the Warriors were likely comfy with their hybrid build.
---
it's still like this on female blood elves on retail, when seathed small when in hand big. Changed it many times so might be the case 
---
I’m not seeing the problem. I didn’t discover talent points until level 33 or so. Didn’t stop me from doing any of the early dungeons. Then I levelled to 60 as arcane(no pom pyro btw) and even did all pre raid dungeons as arcane. Casting arcane missiles for days. I eventually learned better.
---
99% sure it's 1 every 3. I remember doing napkin math at the time and being stunned at how BAD Unbridled Wrath was in comparison.
---
Your post is very contradictory.
---
You say classic is new game plus, but then you say the game is missing precisely what would qualify it as new game plus.
---
You say that the game is not only a nostalgia run because of features (old quest, old mechanics, old everything) that make it a nostalgia run.
---
&gt; But doesn't the LFD/LFR summon people to instance?
---
Yes. But that's only normal and heroic dungeons which you don't need to do, mythic drops much better gear. 
---
