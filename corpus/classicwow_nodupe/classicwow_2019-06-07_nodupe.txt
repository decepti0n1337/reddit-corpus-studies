To add to this, you also benefit from the Improved Shadow Bolt talents of warlocks in your raid, or the shadow priest talent for shadow damage.

I literally said the stealth thing could be considered stream sniping further up.
---

---
We’re discussing stream sniping, not if you consider that or something else as being toxic assholes. This chain of comments is talking about stream sniping and how hard/easy it is to determine if someone is doing that, bot what you find toxic.
---
In Classic, only the extremely casual people will probably farm it. The newest meta is completely avoiding the set and farming devilsaur etc. so raiding guilds don't consider it to be BiS.
---
[removed]
---
&gt; I can't tell if it's because I know I won't be able to commit enough time to the game with a family and full time job, or not knowing what's going to happen after phase 6. Classic TBC(?) Forced?  
---
You don't have to commit to the game, and yet you complain about post Phase 6.  
---
&gt; decided to not play because you feel like layering ruins the game that bad  
---
Do you know what it's like to have thousands of players spread across 6 starting zones, competing to kill or loot the same mobs? FUCKING HORRIBLE.  
---
&gt; hate 1.12, don't like how they are handling 'catch up items'?  
---
What cat up items? Heirlooms weren't introduced until WotLK.
---
It'll be fun watching you eat it on retail. Just cry more, failure.
---
Everyone talking about dual monitors: don’t they need to be hooked up to their own video card? That sounds more expensive than just getting an extra screen.
---
Ha.... ha-ha....
---
But they need to realize that they bring repercussions that impact the experience of others.
---
Tbh it would be good, cause first of all if you took for example herbalism and mining you would have the problem that  you can only track either herbs or ores on the map. But if you take mining and skinning you can track the ores and because of skinning there would be no need to track it cause you skin wild creatures.
---
Their should be a big demand for both of them cause first of all some lazy player will definitely buy your stuff and second player that as example only got blacksmith + mining will be in need of the leather and engineer too as far as i know. So if you want to make some fast and lazy gold you should definitely pick them. 
---
Also i would recommend you to watch a recent video from Madseasonshow on youtube. He has covered that topic for you as good as possible with arguments for and against some professions.
---
&gt; I literally said the stealth thing could be considered stream sniping further up.
---
GReat. So why do you keep saying you can't tell if someone is sniping when we have already established a scenario where you can?
---
&gt;We’re discussing stream sniping, not if you consider that or something else as being toxic assholes.
---
No, we're discussing toxic stream snipers, as per the video linked in this topic. The worst of the worst. Not any old stream sniper.

The books great but they sprayed mine with some funky smell, I think everyone’s has the smell really off putting lol
---
There’s no such thing as being unable to progress on a pvp server.  There’s always another zone you can go to and other quests you can do if some idiot is camping you.
---
Pve server is safe mode, no risk and no reward.  Levelling on a pvp server actually means something specifically because it’s harder and danger lurks at every corner.
---
No. He’s already trying to dictate how everyone else is allowed to play the game but not applying his suggested rule to hisself.
---
*Insert class* in Classic vs. BfA
---
Answer: the two are **completely** different.
---
The second best option is your second tank :)
---
You don't pay anyone else's either, simpleton. Go back to your mother's basement.
---
Ok, but this is vanilla we are talking about.  
---
If a well geared streamer is killing some mobs, or perhaps about to heal up... almost any class can do a quick burst of damage out of no where to finish them.   Not to mention he wont be in AQ40 gear anytime soon lol... he wont have much defensive stats to fall back on, so being caught off guard can easily kill people. 
---
I remember being a MC/BWL geared arms warriors back in vanilla who would duel naxx40 geared warriors for fun (no one really cared back then), and while he won most duels, I still had lucky crits and had the potential to 3 shot him, just like he could 2-3 shot me.  
---
Point being that no one is invincible in vanilla, especially if you aren't full hp to begin with.
---
Twitch streams are not game code or software, and are also CLEARLY authorized by Blizzard hence the Beta streamers.  Changing gameplay and functionality is like removing game files to get to C'thun faster or make herb nodes really big to see them from far away.  Your interpretation would have everyone that watches Twitch and plays at the same time get banned, which is not only unenforceable, but also impossible to prove.  Just to reiterate, regardless of interpretation, Twitch isn't software.  We'd be banning people for using google chrome.
---
The other is ganking on a PvP server isn't griefing, though could lead to griefing potentially but they're not synonymous.
---
I'm totally unconvinced.  Frowned upon, sure whatever.  But, against ToS, I don't see it.
---
Joe Rogan is gonna play a male orc shaman and play it on stream while talking about space travel.
---
don't listen to that guy. Ele is strictly pvp and is most definitely a caster spec. Just because 4% of the private server community play a weird hybrid melee/caster spec doesn't make it the "caster" spec for shamans. Enh is very viable for pvp
---
In other words, 'put my desires above your desires!'
---
Also, lol at implying that hybrid specs have 'one' suboptimal route instead of two.
---
If this were the old Blizzard following the old rules, cross faction collusion would actually get you punished if they found out.  
---
Doubt Blizzard will have the balls to do it to a big streamer now though :\
---
Could be UI scale / resolution related I'm assuming?
---
Fake, no alts. Thats impossible especially as paladin where leveling can get boring at times!
---
Ah its a bit of tricky one this one. Re read, i dont think he was saying whatchu think he was sayin. its all a waste of time
---
I guess that can be the case indeed. However, if I start on day 1 and remain near areas most “average” peolple will also be, not sure if pvp server is going to be great. Super curious though, I can’t wait personally to start after launch to get safer quest areas
---
Ohno, that's adorable. I made friends in WotLK who are still friends with me to this day. The two of them always hung out together and they finally started dating this past year.
---
Based Orkus
---
We definitely had a KOS list full of ninja looters, griefers, and players that just generally pissed us off.
---
There was never a set population cap in Vanilla. It was dynamic, and the most the hardware could support at the time was 4k. So from a technical and performance standpoint, the true cap during vanilla was 4k.
---
What a pathetic counterargument to a valid point he made. Streamsnipers are the lowest of the low of any game community. People whose main drive is to ruin the experience of a streamer and their viewers just to get their ''moment of fame'' is the most worthless, despicable attitude thinkable in gaming. These sorts of people SHOULD be blacklisted, there is absolutely no reason to defend them.
---
Yeah.
---
You're\*
---
I can't be bothered to give a shit one way or the other.
---
You can’t bubble hearth at stv levels, bubble doesn’t last long enough
---
With mage is aoe grinding in DM too
---
I'm afraid your shadowform will be shortlived.
---
Damn, ret paladin at 60.. You were lucky to get a raid spot as ret!
---
This is why they need to just announce what server they are playing on as soon as they find out.. just so I can avoid him and the cesspool known as his streamer friends.  
---
Their little list will only work if his streamer buddies cross faction and their followers force it to work.  I would like to steer clear of this crap.
---
My favourite zone, I have many hours spent there fishing stonescale eels and essences of water.
---
what's weird is at 12 I was taught writing in cursive, this guy still writing at 1st grade level o_o
---
I said you can’t tell in a majority of the cases. And the stealth/WSG scenario was pretty selective of you
---
 Toxic stream snipers are people stream sniping and using it to do toxic things. It’s about stream sniping. You’re tredding water so hard now.
---
Camping someone for hours is griefing.
---
Ok. Feel free to respond to this comment when world first kill has some sub level 60 dps and people are in greens.
---
Youtube is dead when it comes to gaming. Why would they sacrifice their booming Twitch streams to start uploading something on Youtube that a much smaller amount of people would watch?
---
Is it listed as working on will it classic?
---
Devs should take a hands off approach to stream snipers in every fucking game, they **SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED**. If you want to stream and don't want to use some kind of overlay disguising your location, your problem.
---
I still do that when I'm stuck on something. 30 years old.
---
Players are questing in the zone. SM isn't stopping anything.
---
https://github.com/ElvUI-Vanilla/ElvUI
---
This doesn't even surprise me. I couldn't stand this man-baby since his arenas with Reckful back in the day. He's always been like this.
---
haHAA
---
&gt; I've yet to hear any decent arguments against gearscore
---
Did you hear one, "it barely says anything about how good you will perform, yet everyone should meet the GS expectations of the raidleader to be accepted to the raid, which leads to suboptimal itemization being almost a necessity, and lowers the chances of many good players to get a spot over some shitter who has random items with good GS but can't even stop pressing Serpent Sting"?
---
Then they need to accept that they are going to have their shenanigans countered at every turn and accept that part of the reason they get paid so much is because people enjoy watching them fail.
---
100%, it'd be even harder to keep it up while your leveling in that scenario too
---
&gt; Toxic stream snipers are people stream sniping and using it to do toxic things
---
Which is what Sodapoppin is talking about. Again, did youi watch the videio? He very specifically mentions the more toxic stream snipers who are doing the worst things to you to be a complete dick head.
---
Someone who ganks you here and there doesn't fall into that category.
---
Blizzard capped the servers at 3k.  That is when you would have been in a queue to get on.
---
Because at this moment, it seems only streamers and podcasters got invites to the beta. Streamers are constantly showing the game and if you watch any of them you can see how quickly they can put together a decent sized group.
---
Now, I'm sure some of us normies got in as well, but there is no way for us to gauge their play experience. 
---
So you've got a vocal minority of people who really want to play the game only getting to see people they probably do not agree with getting seemingly special privilege for being entertaining. Now the quality of the entertainment is pretty wildly varying and the ones with the most viewers seem the most dramatic.
---
For pvp Thunderfury would probably be better in the hands of a hunter lol. They could apply the debuff every time someone gets in melee range of them, whereas for a warrior to use it they’d have to forego being arms.
---
So he is mostly a warrior who wears bis mail but has some hunter aspects to him
---
Get a load of this guy and his Epic mount!
---
The big streamers seem to be going PVP (soda for sure), asmon probably going pvp (unless he gets ganked too much and re-rolls, might happen), esfand is pvp for sure, tips/staysafe pvp too I believe.  Venruki/cdew/sonii i assume will also be pvp.
---
Have a nice day =]
---
I don’t like “Mac plebs”, I like the term “Immune to alt+F4”
---
Yes because it's so fun to support people pathetic enough to just want to waste a streamer's time to get their ''moment of fame''.
---
Most regular beta testers are questing normally. Streamers weren’t invited to test anyway, they are there for promotional reasons.
---
"Pouring one out" is a saying that refers to pouring a drink onto the ground for a fallen friend. Ink cartridges are very expensive and this picture likely used a lot of ink so he is basically saying rest in piece the expensive ink cartridge.
---
Well now every server has a toggle. Its as easy as going to your faction capital and turning off PvP mode.
---
No that's not his job
---
I think soda and asmon will be on pve so they avoid the stream snipe ganking.
---
There are videos of feral druids being top 3 dps doing a constant switch to cat form with improved shred, furor, wolf Shead helm spec, it’s a learned rotation but high dmg when done correctly. I can’t link the video right now but look up on YouTube feral cat dps rotation and you’ll find it
---
No, streamers are doing it so they don't have to worry about getting corpse camped.
---
Trying to figure out quests? LOL.
---
I don’t understand this. 
---
What kind of retarded logic is this? 
---
Disliking streamers and the toxic cults they generate = “well they’re just jealous”
---
5.4%, 4yo sub.  
---
I guess it doesn't matter too much if the sub is old or new...
---
Almost the entire population revolves around them. When they are on, 2k more people are on, when they aren't it's dead. Trying to get scarab lord? Good luck getting one whenever the streamer is going to have the majority of the server helping him. Accidently kill him in world pvp? Spam hate. Chat is going to be filled with twitch memes and overall cancer. Potential faction imbalance. Without another streamer on the opposite faction, the opposite faction cannot organize as many forces in as quick as time in World PvP so the streamers are going to have their army of spergs rolling through capital cities. Overall and general not chill, toxic environment fostered by the streamer's personality. An overall un-vanilla like experience. Reputations of nameless people will be less likely to form as all of the attention is going to be around the streamer and how much those people help them. A couple of reasons, to name a few.
---
Ah, guess you realised it
---
wow looks awesome
---
I hope bfa improves and classic keeps the steamers busy, sick and tired of this twitch drama bullshit.
---
I really liked this :)  You put a lot of thought in to it.
---
Damn. Somehow I recalled this being more AQ20/ZG level. It was powerful but I was excited to get my AQ40 set gear because it had so much stamina.
---
You think or you know?
---
It's not harmless, it's taking the subreddit in a direction that it wasn't made for, and it isn't focusing on the original purpose, which is enjoying and talking about vanilla world of warcraft.
---
No, people who give streamers free items and gold are the lowest. Streamers are 2nd lowest. And then Stream snipers are above that
---
Lol shut up
---
Because that much power corrupts a person, and in this case, that person corrupts the server.
---
I don't want to see people blacklisted because they defended themselves from a streamer gank.
---
I thought the 3 mage, lock, priest combo venruki was running was pretty interesting.  I wonder if that type of aoe will be doable without bis 30 gear
---
I mean, thats like, you're opinion man. Or someone else's you just wrote your name on, but whatever.
---
What's your vision of an MMORPG then?
---
But it fundamentally is different. That one rogue is just some dude he runs into, but a streamsniper is someone who actively watches his stream to find his location and then uses that to his advantage to gank him. That's not fun, fair combat, it's just a blatant use of an advantage.
---
The issue is that he is talking about cross faction blacklisting...  There is a pretty huge difference there.
---
No need, your boy asmongold already got world firsts in everything that mattered
---
I disagree with this, in order to get a more fulfilling and authentic experience rolling on a server away from the streamers and their disadvantages is essential.
---
Horde cant get  [Harlown Darkweave](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?npc=6731): herbalist gloves 18s
---
They have said it in the past but it may have changed since beta launched and they are playing with streamers that are going to be on pvp.
---
Can I get a temp ban pls
---
I am currently watching a streamer who is questing. Best part no face cam, and talks about the game with no annoying screeching or over reacting.
---
I don't mind breadcrumbs about future expansions and I even had a Guild story slowly building up for the Cata expac paired with in-game events and the like, but my character is going to look at you funny then slowly walk away if you tell them space goats and worgen will join the Alliance.
---
If it aint Goldshire Inn I dont want to hear about it
---
Asmongold just showed your video to 30k viewers on his stream :D   
---
  
---
well done mate. :)
---
I can't wait for classic to release. Ganking some streamer is gonna make my day.
---
Grand Marshal’s Claymore
---
All I want
---
All I need
---
What would be so awful about randomly mixing two different games? *thinking*
---
No no it's okay because he is an asshole and admits it. Therefore he shouldn't be blacklisted
---
I wonder what rep i have to grind to get this in bfa
---
Always been a sub guy myself
---
Be a known healer on my server.
---
oh yah? was it like an episode of pawn stars and he brought you down to $9,238?
---
And you can’t tell if they’re stream sniping in most cases. My point is still that Soda and Asmongold will cry stream sniping after getting camped for 5 hours, but for all we know, these people could just be regular gankers enjoying camping people, thus not being stream snipers.
---
I will join this guild with pleasure
---
I love when boomers call computers CPUs
---
Worth it
---
Progression pulls baby
---
He literally went to a pserver and cried to feenix gms to ban people who griefed him. They complied because they were getting money from all his followers donating to the server. The dude is soft.
---
And? Just like people telling him to stop streaming or roll PvE if he doesn't want to get sniped, you can choose to not snipe him if you don't want to get blacklisted. Actions have consequences. Either both are okay things to do, or neither is.
---
That would just cause pissed off streamers who get killed to say "theyre streamsniping, blacklist em" to anyone who might run past em and kill em. they might not even know who they are, and even if they do its not streamsniping, and its no different from killing and camping anyone else. should just agree to blacklist any streamer that actually goes through with this.
---
i remember that also , was playing as a dwarf-warrior , after seeing the great dun morogh , the next was  no less beautiful loch modan , that was amazing
---
They were tested like 15 years ago, it's speed run time now
---
I think Classic might finally be Soda's wake up call.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He thinks of himself as royalty.  Azeroth is about to treat him like Caesar
---
What hardware specs do you think classic will require? I haven't had a gaming PC since, well, wrath of the Lich King.
---
lol you are clearly a normie 🤢
---
I hope they all get stream sniped relentlessly
---
Okay so you made 3 arguments. 1) it's inaccurate and 2) it doesn't say anything about skill and 3) high GS requirements
---
For the first point, yes it is inaccurate at least how it's was done on retail. It doesn't have to be inaccurate though, there are plenty of dps simulators out there which could give your gear a score based on how well you would do in a dps simulation. That's what retail raiders apparently use. Either way, it will still be a lot more accurate than some raid leader trying to inspect your gear not knowing your class or for you to sprew some random number like how much healing power you have. 
---
For argument 2 yes of course it can't tell you how good a player is, is there any inspection that can? No there's not. 
---
3) Yes some RL will put a way too high requirement. This is not limited to GS at all, pugging is hard and people play like shit. Best way to increase your groups chance of succeeding is to up the requirements to join.
---
not the isle
---
You realize 98% of the people who got invited to the beta aren't streamers/content creators?
---
I expected more drawings.
---
Yikes, you take yourself too seriously. What He said would not even affect you Or any normal player at all unless spend hours a day streamsniping streamers
---
Care to explain your view? People who give streamers free items and gold don't waste a lot of time, they aren't slowing the streamers down. Stream snipers are just assholes who want a moment of fame at the expense of slowing down a streamer and annoying them. Seems like your view is just some emotional dislike towards streamers, probably stemming from jealousy.
---
I hope you feel better =]
---
Cold Blood/Prep hemo, or relentless/imp backstab/prep are the main ones. You can do seal fate daggers or combat sword/fist with good gear but they're generally considered a step down in most aspects.
---
Please. I want my cool names.
---
Get well soon =]
---
Great. What a productive and intuitive discussion we mutually participated in then.
---
you mean self-imposed disadvantage? like a literal scrub?
---
"There was never a cap except for the 4k Cap"
---
Completely agree. Classic has the potential to shift the upcoming retail content in a major way, especially if the active players on Classic outnumber the ones on retail. That would mean doubling their active player count though so here's hoping Classic is as successful as we want it to be. I know a lot of people who are resubbing this August, some for their first time since Cata.
---
You must use your judgment before you even start, watch them fight trash outside or the first few pulls inside and decide if it’s worth it to commit
---
12? This looks like a 7 year old wrote it
---
And they do fail, even without the influence of some random attention seeking dumbass. That isn't a ''fun'' kind of failure, that's just an obvious attempt by someone to just be annoying and using an advantage to kill the streamer.
---
Was it Lost Chapter? I remember that as the guild with just about every R14 on alliance.
---
Sodapoppin makes 8 figures
---
Google. Research for yourself, you'll be a better player. It'll help for school or the workplace too.
---
I'm all for streamers and content creators but trying to basically ban people for interfering with his day is just nuts.
---
When they get bonuses from their fans that's fine but when something negative comes their way it's suddenly punishable?
---
Except I never admitted to doing that. I'm agreeing with OP in the hypocrisy because soda literally says in the video that hes "going to start a blacklist, and then going to go off stream and camp level 15s because I'm an asshole"
---
Yes, raids tend to run 2 prot-specced main tanks so they can switch on the main target.
---
You must really look up to streamers, huh?
---
I’m choosing Rogue over Hunter, Warrior and Warlock. Try to change my mind.
---
Because if I run a dungeon with a streamer and outroll need on an item he WANTS i dont want to be KoS for 80000 people
---
Sheep need a shepherd, if the steamer wills it so, you best believe one of his many writhing fanboys will do it.
---
Mass report, gank, camp, spam, if it involves a lot of people doing the bidding of one person it will probably be done by one of our e cult leaders out there.
---
I also said Average wow raider so, not really sure what you are debating here.
---
Most of the streamers fans aren't in the beta.
---
Why does everyone keep thinking streamers are in the vast majority of players?
---
I want to play on an RP server.  but I guess I am rolling on whatever server Soda is ;\]
---
The huge amount of downvotes say we might be in the minority.
---
"Southshore would constantly attack the Horde at Tarren Mill"
---
Nice revisionist history there Orkus
---
Underrated comment
---
he is why we got a varian retcon, no more thrall as warchief, etc. hell, garrosh was basically just a green varian, hot headed and constantly antagonizing everyone because writing is hard. not to mention sylvanas... metzen orchestrated the whole fake conflict between the factions because “thats what players want!”, and then proceeded to make the horde dumb generic villains while the alliance became flawless generic heroes.
---
so yeah, i’d say he did sufficient damage not only to the storyline but to the game as a whole.
---
What an idiot "I don't want any of the upsides and the downsides of being a streamer" well don't stream the fucking game and don't tell anyone on your character who you are.
---
A friend from work got in. He had an account from 2004 (so do I btw) but his was active. Got in like 10 days ago. I'd say he a normie
---
Tanaris/Winterspring for how the environment looks/feels regarding pvp. The level ranges for these zones and their varying metas are fun imo.  
---
Also iirc there were dust/snow storms in these zones so I am excited to see the weather effects with the upgraded graphics within classic.
---
The same as bfa, check its requirements
---
I know blue has said some of the more powerful world drops that were added later will come in at a later phase and won't be available at the start, but I haven't seen anything specific about quests like this.
---
Wouldn't they just roll on a normal 10-character server instead, if they wanted more than 1 character?
---
I never admitted to corpse camping. I'm agreeing with OPs point in the hypocrisy. Soda literally says in that video he wants to start a black list of campers and then hes going to go off stream and do it himself to level 15s because he considers himself an asshole.
---
You can literally move to a different zone to not be camped. That's not griefing, it's part of the damn game. I really don't think a pvp realm is for you. If I want to spend my Saturday afternoon camping everyone I see in stv over and over, I'm going to do it. There are pve realms.
---
&gt; It's not really difficult to get, just time-consuming
---
I think it's fair that those playing 8-12 hours a day get better crap than those raidlogging for 8-12 hours a week.
---
C'mon you're not going to beat a BiS geared premade, doesn't matter if some of them additionally have access to 1.12 rank gear or not.
---
That’s what Ninja did on Fortnite. Anyone who outplayed him got banned depending on how salty Ninja was.
---
I feel the same way. I don't care that much but I cared enough to make this post I guess..
---
I hope you're right. I'd love to see these messages again, get your screenshots ready!
---
I plan on mainly hunting stream snipers. Hunting the hunters so to speak. There are levels to this.
---
Dude the whole point is that soda admitted to corpse camping and that he wants to do it in vanilla, but at the same time he wants to start a blacklist to people who do it to streamers.
---
Warrior is fine. There will be tons of people dungeon grinding/pugging raids if you think you'll hit 60 late, or a guild willing to bring you up to speed if you can commit to raid hours.
---
Classic isn't out yet? So no he didn't?
---
Back in the day it wouldnt load character portraits until you were close enough to the character. So it would be the stock image for every race/sex
---
Considering I would bet on the fact that I have done all content either before you, or at a higher level than you, I don't really see why you think your opinion is more valid than mine. Anyone who thinks Vanilla raiding will be even close to the same as current retail raiding is either naive, trolling, or trying to pretend that they are better than current players because they played in Vanilla. I have done both at the highest levels and it isn't close, there isn't even an argument for it to be honest. No point in really debating it because we will have proof here soon enough. I say this as someone who likes Vanilla more than retail by a mile as well, so not some retail casual fanboy.
---
What an insecure and dumb POS. You broadcast yourself, oh well. Of course it's going to happen you dipshit.
---
The only thing he's going to accomplish is creating a massive group of people who are going to aim to snipe him while he's on stream.
---
I don't even watch streams hardly ever but this just makes me want to roll on his server to play just for this reason.
---
the only way this makes sense is if he's planning all this intentionally to gain a lot of publicity and press, which it's obviously starting to work, so that he gets more people watching him.
---
Appreciate the level headed opinion. The video OP posted shows soda admitting to wanting to corpse camp when hes off stream but then wants to start a blacklist against people who do it to streamers while they're streaming.
---
Guild Masters might be elected amongst the guild, as a ruling force to guide the guild in hard times which may threaten to split the guild through politics.
---
Guilds can be formed by however the guild wants.  It's an elected position of power.
---
Streamers are not elected positions of power.  Nice attempt at making me look dumb.  I guess you just showed how little you understand of the issue :\]
---
&gt; My point is still that Soda and Asmongold will cry stream sniping after getting camped for 5 hours
---
And if someone gets camped for 5 hours, then it doesn't actually matter if they're stream sniping or not. They deserve to be on the list regardless.
---
I don't recommend tanking if you're not going to be available all the time to tank.  No one wants to help gear a tank that then can't show up to raids.  Kinda have to no life imo.  Dps is fine though
---
Dude paladins are the shit in classic. You won't top a dps meter or tank a raid. Besides that, they are great in anything.
---
People shitting on their damage forget how valuable heals and utility are in a gamestate in which most classes have no ability to heal themselves at all.
---
Paladins get a lot of unjustified hate because a lot of theur6power doesn't translate well to damage meters. But a Ret with improved seal of might and judging seal of light on a boss adds so much damage and healing to the whole raid it's absurd.
---
Hunters get like the best tier sets throughout vanilla as far as graphics and viability IMO.
---
So a lot of that is purely hysteria with some jealousy sprinkled in. Streamers won't stop you from being scarab lord, guilds will. Your going to have guilds pushing for one person sometimes even multiple guilds. Streamers have no affect on this, that is just you listening too hard to conspiracy theories.

    }
---
you're the worst kind of toxic.
---
Streamers are an absolute blight on video gaming.
---
The Light gave you a sign
---
Its interesting how you combined something I said with something I didn't say to prove me wrong. Instead you just showed you can't read and comprehend.
---
It will probably be the highest pop server so theres a very high chance that is true.
---
I usually like soda but everything he said in that videos is just stupid. Just don't stream if you don't want to be ganked. Playing on server with a lot of streamers gonna suck.
---
He calls it all of his streams dude, come on, be happy for him!
---
The dungeon sets tend to be a pretty good place to start for PvP gear.
---
bullshit unless you play 12 hours a day every day
---
&gt; Did anyone else’s guild have a KOS list in vanilla?
---
One of the things I did before they added honor was keeping a macro with my K/D and a handy list of KOS players. I'd coordinate with friends whenever someone camped them after ganking and put them on the list. I felt like such a badass assassin as a rogue hunting down targets on my list.
---
Should do it for all classes.
---
I doubt there will be a time when guilds just stop recruiting / forming. Maybe you won't get into one that's formed on day one, but that doesn't mean a great guild won't form six months in.
---
::secretly optimistic due to being a slow leveler::

Tbh i think streaming is bad for communities of any game. Basically it is just a living ad (actually makes me think of one of those south park episodes, lol). I hate advertisms. When I go on a webpage and I'm pushed an ad into my face I straight away close a website (same happens to reddit when I see promoted content popping up). Ads are just wasting the scarse time you have in life. Anyways, WoW in particular gets broken due to streamers. We will get server inbalance, a wreckingball of players following a streamer and probably bans if people are streamsniping. All it does is taking the things out of this game that made in fun. With all this pretalk about streamers here and there I actually start to doubt whether I even want to play classic cus I really dont want to play with streamers.
---
Loool
---
What part of “....people who wish they had fans” isn’t implying envy?
---
Just because you didn’t say it explicitly doesn’t mean it isn’t what you meant.
---
Yeah cause I’m crying over here.
---
I don’t care what you think they deserve. My point is still, as this thread is about, that you can’t most likely prove they’re stream sniping in a scenario like that, but they will be considered doing it, because the judge are the ones with feelings involved, the streamer and most people watching.
---
I'm not sure but I'm guessing that he means the items being in their updated versions from the beginning. It makes a handful of items noticeable more powerful than other things you can get in Phase 1.
---
And you aren’t getting banned dumbass. Lol. A social blacklist is opt in. It’s not blizzard deleting your account.
---
The timing of the two couldn't have been better. Epic fantasy movies peaked and stopped with LotR; MMO peaked and will stop with WoW.
---
&gt; So a lot of that is purely hysteria with some jealousy sprinkled in.
---
okay, so you explained one of my points, which, by the way the biggest guilds which are comprised of most of the servers are going to be the streamers guilds. You still haven't addressed any of the other issues other than pulling "So a lot of that is purely hysteria with some jealousy sprinkled in." . Telling me the emotions I feel is not a strong argument. I have no jealousy for streamers, and I want nothing to do with them. fucking kek
---
Pirates of the Pancreas!
---
What an insightful comment, Mr. Centrist.
---
&gt;Jesus christ if you don't want to get stream sniped just don't stream.
---
jesus christ if you don't want to get blacklisted just don't stream snipe.
---
If Soda abuses the list and puts people on it who clearly don't stream snipe or just called him a name, then by all means, rip him to shreds, but don't try to justify being a piece of garbage. There is a difference between running up on someone and camping them, and actually following them (without being able to see them in-game) across multiple zones and trying to be a little grief baby that thinks they are cool for trolling someone "famous".
---
Either both are okay or neither is. Both are purposefully malicious acts where you can avoid the consequences by not doing them, but shit on the streamer because you don't like him. We may have Vanilla WoW back in Classic, but we have a much shittier and toxic community, so it won't be the same at all.
---
I was lvling in shimmering last night and there was like 60 ppl, theyre def gdtting tested
---
&gt; it's part of the damn game
---
You can say that about literally anything.
---
&gt;  If I want to spend my Saturday afternoon camping everyone I see in stv over and over, I'm going to do it.
---
Yeah that's pretty pathetic. Go find people your own level. Killing lowbies over and over literally only serves the purpose of griefing them.
---
If you're grinding mobs to skin them and killing the competition that's fine. If you swoop in every once in a while and kill some on on the other faction fine.
---
But if you're camping graveyards just to grief people and not let them play the game, you are pathetic scum.
---
I played classic from launch til TBC came out, then quit immediately. I started again during wrath, then quit immediately when cata hit.
---
I know nothing of retail wow, not even the names of the expansions after cata
---
&gt; How is this possible though? 
---
Lots of people are into the groupie life and are content with a shout out on stream. That's cool for them, but its not my style.
---
&gt; What is the solution? 
---
Nothing. They have every right to play and stream. If you're not interested in that, you avoid them. Roll on a different server. It's really that simple...
---
Is it not? Are you saying that TBC, LK, Cata, MoP, or any other expansion has the same size world? And are you gonna show me how I am wrong?
---
That soda can person stream comments enraged me. That entitled prick is looking for a safe space in wow. It's called a PVE server if you're looking for that. IF MR soda can rolls PVP hes going to get wrecked. We will make BLACKLISTS GREAT AGAIN as we mop the wow verse with the bodies of dead streamer toons. Their bodies will line the entrances to every dungeon and raid. Every flight path will be painted in the blood of their pathetic toons as they try to level. 
---
DOWN WITH THE STREAMER (toons)!
---
Count me in, I'll rally to your banner and we will beat these train wrecks streamers senseless.
---
In Asmongold's response he said blacklists only matter if everyone adhere's to them. If no one cares about Soda throwing a tantrum then nothing will come of being blacklisted.
---
Import? You are joking right? No. 
---
SM/Ruin lock is main spec for raids. No debuff slots for affliction. 
---
Search "Classic phases" for release schedule.
---
He replied to a post that said the servers were capped at 2.5k, and said "more or less".  Just because the servers could handle 4k, doesn't mean they ever actually allowed that to happen. You're generally not going to max out your hardware.
---
The servers were essentially capped at 3k.
---
God forbid. Poor guy has to deal with that and get paid more money than most people make in years just to play video games. What a hard life he has
---
Streaming a game like wow is essentially going to general chat of both factions and announcing your location at all times. You get what you ask for. 
---
If people are going to be banned for stream sniping, then streamers need to be banned in game by the TOS for offensive language. (Because it could hurt the reputation of the game)
---
Like most, I didn't know what I was doing at the time. I did a few questions in Westfall and hated because it reminded me of Kansas, Loch Modan, the green grass, and trees was a welcoming sight. Plus the trip of  *getting* here was so exciting too.
---
People who spend all of their time sniping streams to stalk streamers are pathetic and desperate for attention. Very few people will want to play with that type of person anyway. So they will automatically blacklist themselves by being social rejects.
---
I'm thinking of creating a guild called Streamer Death Squad that's only mission is to camp these fuckers to the ground.
---
Lol? The guy is literally broadcasting where he is via streaming. That’s not cheating.
---
yeah man lets keep posting more about this and keep the cycle going : - )
---
Because I’m right? Yeah I know, my bad.
---
that's literally what the conversation is about.
---
streamers and their sperg armies vs the average joes.  the average guys who can't play 16 hours a day, and can't come close to actually competing with streamers' ability to grind.
---
But on a PvP server, we can affect their ability to grind.  By ganking them as a community, over and over and over.   WoW community is bigger than Stream community, at least... that is how the line is drawn in the sand right now.
---
this is weird politics for streamers.  Mellow streamers like Esfand will not enjoy the drama, or enjoy effectively declaring war on the non-twitch viewing wow community.
---
it's like a rival gang coming to town and trying to control the whole drug trade in the city.  The Old Gang, the WoW community, will not let these people just come into their territory and start making social laws about stream sniping.
---
That is a fundamental problem with his whole philosophy. Hes not special and he gets no special treatment but wants to able to yell "Stream Sniper!", "Stream Sniper!" and have the wow police come save his ass.
---
Is that a Fist of Omokk?
---
Anyone advocating for hybrid dps at this point is kind of silly.  We know almost exactly what is coming, so roll the class that fits the role you want to play.  It was ok in actual vanilla because no one knew jack shit, so if you wanted to ranged dps and you were a druid, ok you were stuck as boomkin.  Or if you wanted to dps as a Pally, ok you were stuck as ret.  With everything we know now, if you actually star off in classic day 1 and roll a boomkin or a ret to raid, you are just selfish, why would you gimp yourself like that?
---
Lol. Oh man oh man. You are in for a rude awakening if you roll on a pvp realm.
---
It sounds very unenjoyable but I understand the appeal
---
Why can't you tell us?  What are you hiding?
---
Meanwhile, I had to coax my bf into playing Classic with me.
---
Because the difference between 10'59'' and 11'00'' is 1 second in real life, but on this stupid graph it's 0.41. This means that the bars as they're presented are imprecise because he's inflating every 60th integer step by .40. If you actually look closely on the graph you can see this effect in action, as very similar datapoints are on different sides of this huge step.
---
The real question is why would you ever spend one second watching someone else play a video game
---
I'd be fine without the rewards. Things like great father winter were fun and low impact. Just silly stuff to do, even if no worthwhile reward.
---
&gt;hat you can’t most likely prove they’re stream sniping in a scenario like that, but they will be considered doing it,
---
And in the situation you have listed, it doesn't actuallt matter if you can prove it or not because they deserve to be black listed REGARDLESS if they're sniping or not.
---
Yeah ''literal scrub'' for doing their job. The literal scrubs are the ones pathetic enough to try to leech off of the streamer's fame for a minute or two.
---
More like medium compared to being a gm.
---
Tbh I think most of streamsniping is not because those poeple are attention seeking but because they simply hate streamers with all their consequences. If they are ruining my gameplay, why shouldnt I be allowed to ruin theirs as it at least compensates a little of the fun I miss due to them? It feels like they are allowed to punch me in the face, but I'm not allowed to even touch them.
---
But it’s not...
---
Have you heard of Angwe? Dude is literally famous for camping Wetlands. There were specific people he camped too, even back in Vanilla.
---
Really? Because I’m going to play and streamers are not going to impact me unless I let them.
---
The others are what’s causing the problem, not the streamers.
---
I've played on a pvp realm and hit 60. The vast majority of people don't grief. The incidental pvp is fun and I enjoy it. I gank people myself.
---
Camping lowbies is a completely different thing from all of that.
---
&gt;Imagine going in to Subway and deliberately stopping people from making sandwiches for hours and then getting mad when you get banned.
---
So what are you saying here? I don't understand.
---
&gt; stuck in the same guild together
---
No, not really.
---
My plan is to level tailoring first so I can get the truefaith vestments. after that drop tailoring and get whatever you want
---
But we're talking about people who purposely seek out to watch their stream, locate them, and kill them just to get attention in front of like 20 000 viewers. That would be a dick move in any context, why should just blatantly annoying behavior be accepted?
---
Agreed. If we're allowed to, I intend to reserve a name on three separate servers just in case. Your whole experience will be different if you and up on a big streamers server.
---
Insanely good write up. Very small minor change, paladin can interrupt as well with hammer of justice and priest can with psychic scream.
---
i will personally roll whatever side he isn’t on whatever server he is and repeatedly kill him only while he streams
---
I was a gladiator during s3 and s4, and i might be older now, but world pvp is wild. I’m gonna name my character something like KillSoda or SodaDies and roll a rogue. He will never be safe.
---
Ok. So the preraid BiS list is worst to best. The BiS list is best to worst?
---
You're right this is pretty confusing.
---
Horde.
---
But we don't want him. Alliance can have him.
---
Lol how deep down your throat is his dick?
---
That's exactly where I think that gray area comes into play.  Soda wanting to corpse camp people off or on stream is 110% fine.  That's what happens and what's going to happen on PvP servers, and there's nothing wrong with it.  Streamers having this happen to them is also 110% fine and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
---
The issue comes into play is when it isn't natural.  When you have player A load up sodas stream, sees that he's leveling in the Barrens, and then goes out of his way to go to the Barrens just to kill and camp sodas corpse because he's streaming and it's funny.  That's the issue, I think.  The gray area is proving that player A stream sniped, and I have no idea how you do that besides just reporting the player and having Blizzard look into the path player A took to reach and kill player B.
---
Who is this guy anyways? He doesnt feel important to me.
---
No u
---
Fair points. But I still think good ol' inspect/chat is cooler. Promotes knowledgeable RLs and social interaction :)
---
&gt; Streamer servers aren't a thing.
---
If a large Twitch streamer like Asmon, Tips, Soda, Esfan, etc. are playing on a specific server, that server is a streamer server. I don't get how that's not self-explanatory.
---
Because on these realms all of Europe can play and understand the game/each other. ^^
---
Also probably because the game is originally in English, so that language would be considered the norm.
---
32 year old me has the same handwriting... I'm so glad I have keyboards in the work place.
---
How exactly does Soda have "entitled beliefs"? Stream sniping and just camping some random player are two totally different things. The ultimate goal of a stream sniper is to grief. If you're camping a random player just for PvP, that's part of the game. How does blacklisting stream snipers have an impact on you? It just cuts down on griefing.
---
I believe Truefaith Vestements are BIS until BWL, and the pattern is BOP so you need tailoring if you want that. You can then choose to swap to Alchemy or something else after you craft it.
---
Nope
---
There are a few reasons that you probably haven’t thought of:
---
1. Server queues will be atrocious. Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine just half of his followers trying to get into the game with him.
---
2. [Streamer ran blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bx4iac/sodapoppins_streamer_privileged_paradise_server/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) - they use their influence to destroy your reputation for camping them.
---
3. Getting death threats, spam, reports, etc. for camping and killing a streamer.
---
4. Scarab lord event is already determined.
---
5. GMs taking their side if an altercation happens due to them bringing in thousands of players, while you are just one player.
---
6. If they leave the server, expect your population to dwindle if people are there for the streamer.
---
There are multiple other reasons.
---
I play FFXIV too and I'm also quitting for WoW classic. TBH though, you might want to wait until Shadowbringers launches to make a decision, MMOs always get dull right before an expansion launches. I LOVED classic WoW so it was an easy choice for me but that might be something for you to consider. You'll have almost two full months to make a decision so no rush! 
---
You won't be able to import characters to classic. These are going to be new, completely separate servers. Everyone will be starting from level 1. 
---
And the bug raid you're thinking about was AQ/Ahn'Qiraj.
---
Druid does not need a lot of gear to be viable.
---
Reee
---
Sorry I had to do it. Have a nice day
---
you should google what scrub originally meant. 
---
it means someone dumb enough to play with a self imposed handicap.
---
streaming without delay is scrub stuff. "stream sniping" in a PvP context is totally fair game.
---
Yep when you are doing 50% of the damage of a rogue, mage, or warrior and and adding maybe 15-20% damage (class depending). You aren't a boon to the raid. Still, you need to have the perfect raid groups to get that much
---
Get a fucking life. Streamsnipers are cancer kids that has nothing important in life that more or less cheat to be able to kill some1 so they can feel that small satisfaction of atention.
---
90% of the big streamers will get nothing first. even with all the handouts they get. They simply dont have enough game knowledge because they just started playing classic beta for twitch views. 
---
Veteran players and random no namers will get them
---
I remember reading the manual for wow for about 2 weeks. I can't remember why I couldn't put it on my pcs parents before then. But I read every single word of that thing front to back like 10 times. 
---
It was right when I got into gaming. Had a ps2 for a year or 2 before that but this was the first I've ever heard of a game that had classes and professions. 
---
I remember debating for hours and hours upon which professions and class id choose. Looking up thottbot for all profession skills and seeing which sounded the coolest and most fun. 
---
Something I will never experience again in my life sadly
---
Solution would be for the community to blacklist them on certain servers. It’ll be organic, but there are a good amount of people that will be avoiding streamers.
---
Why do you make it seem like the person getting ganked is helpless?
---
You've ignored the point I've made that, the person getting ganked, can leave.
---
They can also get help, there is a guild chat, a zone chat, even a world chat, the player can recruit people to help fight the zone. 
---
This is part of pvp, lowbie ganking is fun, it also often escalates to even bigger, more fun battles. 
---
If I get ganked over and over by the same person, more power to them. I accept it and enjoy that it's part of the game. I can either move, or try and get people to help kill them. I like that aspect of the game, it's part of what makes pvp, pvp.
---
How do streamers ''ruin'' your gameplay? It's not like they follow you around, interfering with your questing. It's like saying some celebrities you don't like are ''ruining'' your day by happening to be on tv at some point. They haven't made any effort to affect your life in a negative way, in what way is it justified to directly want to ''punch them in the face''?
---
This isn't going to be like original vanilla, tons of guilds crush naxx on the private servers, some within hours of release, others within a few weeks.  And naxx on those servers might even be harder than what classic naxx is actually going to be.  Tons of people are going to clear naxx in classic, it is going to be way different.
---
I wonder if the tribute in the barens is still there
---
He just made things 10x worse for himself by saying this lol.
---
Let me demonstrate
---
I don’t care if they’ll get on some blacklist for something else. This thread is specifically about people stream sniping, which is what I covered, by stating the problems of having streamers/viewers being the judges and how hard it is, in most scenarios, to determine if someone is stream sniping or not.
---
Dude it's part of any game streamers play. Look at ninja and where his streamer power got him.
---
First of all you can't really prove that they are streaming and not just ganking.
---
Second streamers already get so much benefits from their fans it's just fair/fun to have a negative side as well. To be honest they get content from the stream snipers.
---
The dwarf at the start! Oh my god, I laughed so hard.
---
Never played warlock in classic so my first question is: is the amount of health you get from drain life increased by your gear. 
---
If yes then drain life isn't a 1 for 1 trade of mana for health.
---
Serious pvp hunters are not rocking devilsaur unless they are undergeared. Some of that 8/8 set will be BIS for pvp phases 1 and 2.
---
I think this is being misrepresented. 
---
He is saying this in the context of having a server that is known for streamers playing on and only that server to have those rules.
---
This is in my mind fine because if you don't want to be wrongly banned for trolling a streamer then you just don't play on that server. 
---
It also solves all of the other inherent issues that come along with playing on a server that has a streamer on it.
---
If streamers reside in their own server with their own fan base I don't see why they shouldn't be able to make specific rules that only affect them?
---
By playing on their server as a fan or a troll you are making the choice to play a completely different experience to vanilla anyway.
---
Personally I would love for streamers to have their own server so that I makes it easier for me to not play on their server.
---
And so we should just take some random definition and apply it to a situation that is entirely different from that definition's original purpose without paying any mind to the context? That ''self imposed handicap'' involves doing their job and entertaining thousands of people. It's like saying that harassing a celebrity in real life is ''fair game'' because they are existing with the ''self imposed handicap'' of being recognizable.
---
Like 50% of the comments in this thread you just sound extremely jealous and petty.
---
Yeah, every class is so much more appealing in vanilla. In BfA, it was a matter of which class did I hate least.
---
i understand that stream sniping is unnecessary and lame, and that it's a threat to streamers' livelihood, and that there is a legitimate argument to be made for institutional support for streamers because the exposure and hype from streaming is good for the game community at large
---
that being said.....there's already a clean, easy solution to this problem: streamers should play on PvE servers. everybody wins, nobody loses. i don't see how there is any debate at all beyond this
---
How can anyone even stream snipe a streamer when they have an army behind them?
---
It’s just wierd tho cus arms is so much fun and so insanely powerful and plays pretty similar to fury. And if ur plan is to get a thunderfury asap that’s a pretty big ask.
---
I mean if they can store a creature/player’s soul in a gem, I imagine they could drain lieforce(health) from them as well. Unless you feel the same way about soulshards?
---
&gt;by stating the problems of having streamers/viewers being the judges and how hard it is,
---
It's not actually a problem though. Because in the scenario we are discussing, the person deserves the black list regardless. So it doesn't matter if someone is unfairly deemed a stream sniper. If they are a toxic asshole then their place on the black list is deserved all the same.
---
I love them both. Hunter wins out for the secondary fun of going out in the world and taming rare pets.
---
The world is fucking huge in vanilla compared to all of those. The odds of even seeing a streamer is pretty low, but keep focusing on it, maybe your jealousy will stop showing.
---
^^ If anything this is just added another level of social excitement to the game.
---
Is the pricing info out? Is it $7.5 per name?
---
If he doesn't like it.
---
DON'T PLAY WOW AT WORK LIKE THE REST OF US
---
I didn't ever noticed BoMs, how come it's not considered a raid DPS increase in this melee-heavy world?
---
Only 3 slots tho ;/
---
Its not about shaman vs pally in pvp lol pally is just easier to have around as a whole, the biggest thing is the threat reduction you get (30% I think) for raiding , since locks have no innate threat reduction, this is huge for them since they're always threat capped as is. 
---
Plus a pally has like 900 lives all the time , whereas shaman can rek you with good rng. Other classes can rek you as is so I don't see that as a meaningful argument.
---
If only your character's name was Goldmember.
---
I dont play wow but are you saying you can pay for higher level players to protect uou?
---
We do. OP was just posting for the sake of making the photo work. I think if you pay for a full year it drops to 12.99 USD (haven't been subbed in awhile so I may be off).
---
Right?
---
Stream or not, he's likely going to have a big target on his back if he succeeds in being the top of his realm. So at a certain point it's not even about streaming but just about him not wanting to be camped.
---
Or play on a PVE server. He's so arrogant and ignorant.
---
Wait, you guys are taking this rant seriously? as if Blizzard is going to do ANYTHING?
---
If he wants to make a blacklist and get his friends to avoid players, thats 100% allowed and not breaking rules. 
---
This is all speculative and a wishlist for his best case scenario to enjoy classic.
---
So with all that out of the way, everyone is just upset because hes not being nice?
---
Where do you get skillIds from? I'll do it for rogue
---
😂😂😂 I love you! (No homo)
---
https://youtu.be/pXvfaPPtbpM.        Sure is
---
Not learning eagle eye?  how will you Astral project across the land?
---
He said bubble, not bubble hearth.
---
Yeah it’s not but ok. You move around it slower but the land mass in each expansion has grown. Sure jealous.  Still waiting to be proven wrong by the way.
---
&gt; People have already tested in the classic beta and shadow oil benefits from ISB without consuming a charge.
---
Not consuming is likely a bug... but I don't mind getting the buff and peeving off a warlock stealing one of his stacks... :P
---
But yeah, there's a ton of shit that buffs us. Curse of Elements, Curse of Shadows, Nightfall, sunder armor, shadow weaving, etc. Everything benefits spelladins.
---
Kinda funny you say this. The guild that I’m creating for classic has a similar ideology to this. Our sole purpose will be to grief the opposite faction(Horde). The focus will not be on raiding, or premise pvp, but just making the game hell for Horde players. We plan to roll on a med pop realm, preferably not a streamer realm, but if any streamer decides to roll horde on our server, they will be camped until they either reroll faction(yes delete all toons on x realm, to come to alliance) or reroll server. As Horde will not be welcome there. 
---
If anyone is interested in this please send me a private message on Reddit. I know this comment will he downvoted to shit, but at least there won’t be any scum Horde on the realm I play on :)
---
random definition? that is the original meaning of the term scrub.
---
PvPing someone isn't harassment. it's core gameplay. if they choose to wear no gear, or give away their position, they deserve to have that disadvantage used against them. 
---
equating it with real life harassment is pretty shockingly absurd, to be frank.
---
Because you can't pull an entire fucking zone like in BfA.  If you are in an area with tight mob spawns, you have to pay attention, or you will get fucked with a few mobs. That is harder.
---
I will fix that, thank you!
---
20k+ viewers versus a handful of rogues, don't hype it up too much
---
Yes, a Kara raid would be great and finally make Atiesh's portal useful.
---
Did you report it?
---
You can pretty easily prove whether people are streamsniping or not. I agree if there's streamers that are exposed to abuse the system and call people streamsnipers who actually aren't (like Ninja did) they themselves should go on the blacklist. And that will happen if someone should abuse their power, with these things happening live in front thousands of people, if a streamer is blatantly blaming someone innocent, it will be evident.
---
Stream snipers aren't fun content, because everyone knows it's just some loser trying to get attention. It's doesn't offer the fun of seeing a fair fight because the sniper obviously has an advantage, it slows the streamer down and stops them from doing what they were doing so it's an annoyance if the streamer had some activities planned out.
---
Sodapoppin is an entitled adult baby.  I don't know how people watch him, he is insufferable.  Whiny brat.
---
Ahh okays. Then we're all in agreeance lol
---
Hunters seeing a spellpower staff thinking "damn, that spellpower will be amazing for my arcane shot. Better use all my DKP on it."
---
it's just the generic healing priest, can either be something like 31 0 20 (so others odnt need to spec spirit buff but most would probably anyway), 26 5 20 or something like 0 33 18. It's better than a shadow but makes your solo life much harder since youd prefer disc holy for solo farming, pvp, 5man pve. Then again with good gear in 5man pve etc this spec will work anyway.
---
...somebody say and my bow so I can say
---
AND MY HANDS
---
one more little thing. to get a soul shard you need to kill mobs that give xp. that means on a pvp server your always at risk at level cap because you cant get shards from safe low level mobs
---
Hey buddy. The earth got a lot smaller once we were able to fly. 
---
The earth got even smaller once we were able to travel to outter space. 
---
I didn’t think I’d have to explain common sense to you but you want to take this video game a little too literal.
---
There's a fine line between normal ganking and pvp, and the losers that go out of their way to stream snipe. Just play the fucking game and you won't need to worry about whatever blacklist shit they do. 
---
Or just keep crying for attention and being an annoying troll. It's whatever to them in the end I'm sure.
---
The issue is that he blatantly says he is going to blacklist people on the other faction WITH the help of other streamers (his friends) on said faction.  
---
I don't understand how this is getting over some people's heads.  Blizzard use to ban people for crap like this... curious to see if they will still enforce it in classic with these streamers.
---
ahahahahaha
---
Maybe soda should play on a pve server lmao
---
They don't in vanilla though.  There is literally no reason to bring an enh or ele shaman, or a ret pally if all pally buffs are covered by healers.  People bring one shadow priest, and maybe one feral druid.  They got exclusive buffs to bring and a general buff to their numbers in later expansions.  Hybrid dps is just garbage in vanilla any way you look at it, excluding warriors of course, who technically count as hybrid dps I guess, but are really just vanilla gods lol.  With everything we know 15 years later and what we are about to get into, anyone planning to raid a hybrid dps is just flat out making a poor choice before classic even launches.  If your class can heal, that is what you are going to be asked to do in raids, enjoy your dps specs in pvp and maybe 5 mans and farming, but trying to raid as that stuff is kind of selfish at this point.
---
Well, it's an occupation choice they lucked out on and should continue to take advantage of. PvE servers however, are the clear answer to their issue that they for some reason are ignoring. And I don't understand why. PvE servers were very popular and they still will be.
---
The earth stayed the same size. We were able to traverse it quicker. Didn’t think people were this dumb but here we are.
---
PvPing is core gameplay, but using an out-of-game source of information to gain an advantage is not fair game in the slightest. It may not be as bad as real life harassment but it's not acceptable behavior in any way.
---
It's terrible
---
Yes. I played on Shattered Hand and we had KOS list. Typically it was guild based and not so much player specific.
---
I think you can import your char from any x15 Classic private server, also from retail (it auto scales down to lvl 60 but you get ilvl 200 starter blues as a compensation).
---
Burning out in games is all about seeing when to take a break. If you do that, you will play as long as you like it, and not stop because of a burnout.
---
Then again feenix gms would do just about anything for donaters, was never known to be good LOL.
---
We don't need them to regulate themselves. We will regulate them by identifying their server, making it public and playing elsewhere. It's really that simple.
---
It does matter, because this thread is about people getting blacklisted for stream sniping. And there can be a difference between stream sniping and being an toxic asshole. One is perfectly clear if you’re doing it or not, and the other is a term used for many different things, which many people have different opinions about. 
---
You went from discussing the topic of the thread to “LOL who cares, in the end in both scenarios you end up on the blacklist”
---
Talk about treading water.
---
This is one of those moments you had to be there for. I just remember how crowded things were on the vanilla side lol.
---
he says this while playing in tournaments while abusing gear that give him 50% increased attackspeed on use that he was only able to farm thanks to streamsnipers (still lost btw)
---
this is what the body of the post form is for
---
Your posts scream it.  It's okay.
---
I've been warning about streamer entitlement for [over a year and a half now](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7cnw9o/when_should_classic_be_released/dpr9dlo/?context=3), even though in the original case it was obviously under a different context.
---
You CANNOT cater to people who want to hamstring your hobby to the benefit of their pocketbooks.  They are selfish by nature.
---
Yep. Here we are haha.
---
Tailoring makes cloth gear which is the only gear warlock can use. Based on my research with tailoring you can get the bloodvine set which is best in slot until T5. And the bloodvine items are bind on pickup so you have to actually have tailoring to get them.
---
Devs aren't going to care about people ganking/camping others on a PvP server... if you didn't want that, then you can play on PvE.  PvE still has all the other PvP aspects of the game (town/city raiding, NPC camping, occasional PvP fights in random places), but without the thing soda is whining about... being ganked randomly.
---
im staying away from whatever server this guy ends up playing on. his fans and he himself seem like cancer
---
If you’re still paying attention to sodapoppin, I have no fucking idea why.
---
All I can say is I'm glad I'm a PvE player. Us and Euro's will not have to deal with this shit.
---
Fishing/cooking/first aid are secondary professions. Anyone can have those along with 2 primary professions.
---
I can't wait to terrorize the lowbie alliance on my server with my rogue. I will be in the shadows, always, young grasshoppers.
---
Shame that reading tooltips is considered so difficult so often.
---
It’s true 
---
I remember going to see these movies with my dad 
---
Such an epic trilogy , sad that it was the last good  trilogy since being released in 2001 
---
Peter Jackson translated Tolkien’s work beautifully to the Silver Screen and the cast and crew helped bring it to life 
---
We’ll never see anything like it again
---
Fuck SM, and spells used in SM, or the gear used in those runs, those don't need to be tested.
---
You gonna prove me wrong yet?
---
:)
---
the only thing that isn't acceptable is people complaining about an optional, self imposed disadvantage. 
---
it's not like they are forced to play wow...
---
I guess you could. In the end, it’s a service in exchange for money, if someone is willing to protect you for payment then sure. 
---
What I meant was, especially in wow, streamers are constantly showered with items and in game money from viewers just for a chance to be near them and be seen on stream. And if someone is killing a streamer, the viewers will almost always flock to their aid en masse.
---
No. He was feared outside the duel area causing him to forfeit after using all his cds. Also he never wanted someone to lose because of those trolls, and it was his friend which was getting fucked over. It was seren vs cdew where that happened and seren is sodas friend.
---
Top ten pick up lines
---
I’ve really only been watching Esfand and Asmon, but only because I’m hyped as shit for August. I don’t watch twitch ever. 
---
Love Esfand though, used to whisper him on pserver. He’s just a genuine guy having fun.
---
No, he clearly said anyone who ganks/camps him in the video lol... he knows he can't prove stream sniping, but then proceeds to insult people who choose to gank others against their will... yet scoffs at the person who suggests going to a PvE server.  
---
Then at the end he even says he will be doing it himself off camera a ton because he knows he is a dick.. but the rules wont apply to him, right?

&gt; random zip file
---
Nope I’m out
---
I'm embarrassed to say I've played this game for 13 years and I'm a little confused as to what is going on. So sniping is is killing the player in the game? If he doesn't want to be killed, why is he flagged? If he's flagged, and his entourage is flagged, how is he getting killed?
---
Sorry I don't watch streamers so this is like a totally different game to me.
---
What sucks is people that are rolling with old guilds. We’ll pick a server and hope and pray that the streamer doesn’t pick the same one. No way can I talk 30 other people into re-rolling.
---
&gt;Even if Blizzard started enforcing such a stupid rule
---
You're an idiot, watch the video again and listen to what he's saying, he never said *Blizzard* would do anything, it's about making a community driven 'blacklist'.
---
It's a trade-off for being a paid streamer imo. If you cash them checks, you gotta deal with the snipers.
---
I unfortunately stumbled upon this dude on twitch (I don't tend to watch streams but I wanted to see classic). Maybe it was me but I thought the guy seemed like an entitled prick. If I saw this dude on a server, I'd camp him and listen to him whine. I personally do not like this time of gaming with all these streamers. I just don't get it :/
---
Paid server transfers ruin that though.
---
Wish they weren't an option.
---
Suddenly entire guilds appear or disappear from or on servers and communities are going to be hard to form.
---
I agree
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
It was Horde holding the funeral btw, the Alliance crashed it.
---
which is not even remotely what soda implied. pls use more than 2 brain cells if youre gonna tag me
---
Yeah, I don’t think I’m ready to tank a raid. I should probably just try getting into them first. Lmao
---
This would make sense if you ignore Imp. Life Tap and all talents that improve Drain Life. You have at least 10% + 10% increase in that build. And Nightfall.
---
Wooosh
---
I don't even remember when they bumped up the pet slots. I lived with 3 slots before and I can live with it again. My planned 3rd slot pet won't be released until ZG, anyway.
---
&gt; because this thread is about people getting blacklisted for stream sniping.
---
Nope. We already went over this numerous times. It's not about stream snipers. It's about toxic stream snipers. Absolute dick head stream snipers.
---
Again, you are creating a strawman.
---
It’s the issue of streamers not announcing their servers before release. It’ll be a crapshoot to not be on the same server as them.
---
Tldw; stunted man child complains about getting ganked when he is broadcasting his exact location. How about he stops streaming? That seems like a good solution.
---
I’ll give you a rub n tug if we can get this for rogue
---
Well that and they were all gotten some 13 years ago.
---
And I love YOU random redditor ! 👉🏻
---
why the fuck do you guys care so much about what these streamers do and say?  stop feeding into it.
---
I can't think of a comparison that does not make my argument look like a stretch but a in game punishment for ganking someone is not reasonable.
---
You're basically punishing someone for ganking. I'm sure there are non streamers who get grave camped or ganked by someone over and over. Should he get the privilege to give a in game account punishment for ganking a random?
---
If someone dislikes a streamer and plays on the same PVP server they should have the freedom of ganking him. And if they are mad about stream sniping you can put delay or roll on PVE.
---
Oh, I got a video for you!

Streaming is something that wasnt around during vanilla..  its definitely going the change the communities drastically.
---
I generally go tailoring and herbalism, while saving all my herbs as I level. Craft truefaith vestments, then drop tailoring, pick up alch and level it with the herbs I saved.
---
That sucks, but if you guys are serious about playing, I'd at least try to have the conversation. I know some people dont think it'd be a big deal, but my friends and I disagree. I'm rolling with ~5 friends and we're prepared to be behind the curve a little if it means avoiding them.

also i totally forgot about the poison trainer even though i had 2 60 rogues in vanilla, so i will have to go check that out.

That's Reddit in a nut shell.
---
Toxic stream snipers are still stream sniping and stream sniping is still hard to prove in most scenarios. A toxic stream sniper is not someone camping you for 5 hours because they just like camping you. So yes, you’re still talking about something unrelated to this thread, which you talk about getting blacklisted for camping someone for many hours.
---
Qwertsfgzxc as well as shift/ctrl and shift a/d 
---
Move with double click mouse.
---
But if the money doesn't matter, he can just shut off the stream, or even play with a 30 minute delay.
---
Shit like this is just to make his stream more popular because here we all are talking about it lol if you really don't like it then don't even talk about it, don't tune in, just focus on ganking him :)
---
2 weeks of otherwise worthless sub time = about $7.5
---
I don't get the point of this post. How is a streamer gonna dictate you? He can be salty all he want, but he doesn't have any power over other players.
---
You want to create a guild that fights against a problem that doesn't exist?
---
What does this accomplish? I’m confused.
---
Blizzlike, you can also attack through the boxes in dalaran arena etc. (wotlk)
---
What does this have to do with classic?
---
That just means that everyone will have to download the add-on that shows an overlay of the map and where they are on it
---
That's what it was. Either way the "hosts" of that tourney should have had some redo's for that kind of shit because it doesn't show any level of skill to get feared off a cliff and the totem thing.
---
just make sure you have a dedicated healer ezpz
---
Posted this elsewhere. It will impact you.
---
1.	⁠Server queues will be atrocious. Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine just half of his followers trying to get into the game with him.
---
2.	⁠Streamer ran blacklist - they use their influence to destroy your reputation for camping them.
---
3.	⁠Getting death threats, spam, reports, etc. for camping and killing a streamer.
---
4.	⁠Scarab lord event is already determined.
---
5.	⁠GMs taking their side if an altercation happens due to them bringing in thousands of players, while you are just one player.
---
6.	⁠If they leave the server, expect your population to dwindle if people are there for the streamer.
---
Alright so has Wpvp really gotten that bad? I dont remember much pvp during Legion but Im pretty sure there was some...nothing worth remembering but I think there was some.
---
It depends on whether you plan on being a dagger or a sword rogue.
---
You are providing a buff or support its not part of your damage. I mean a warrior on horde side that is "fishing" WF proccs with hamstring would not do more damage, you would.
---
Faster groups, higher skilled players, more people to duel/interact with around major cities and else where in the world.
---
Theres trade offs and down sides as well but I'd take a high pop server over a low pop server any day.
---
Maybe he should get gud
---
&gt;  A toxic stream sniper is not someone camping you for 5 hours
---
A toxic stream sniper can be someone camping you for 5 hours. A toxic stream sniper will also making camping you for 5 hours MUCH harder to avoid than an organic player playing the game. This is how you can tell the difference between an organic player and a stream sniper. Because the stream sniuper acts on information ONLY THE SNIPER CAN HAVE, and how that player acts on that information makes it obvious hes a sniper BECAUASE ONLY HE CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION LOL
---
I checked out the video on the duel and you couldn't be more wrong. "Piss raving mad"? I'm not sure you have ever seen anyone actually be mad before. Was he frustrated? Yeah but who wouldn't be. 
---
For your second point, the non-shaman player is his good friend Serendepitys, so was most likely in jest. I understand it's easy to hate streamers, but at least use evidence that is in context or accurate.
---
As for the main thread, his idea is unrealistic and will only increase sniping and he's gonna get camped, but should lead to some fun world PvP.
---
Can't imagine I'd want to be in a guild that makes rules based on what some random streamer thinks.
---
This is another dumb post of the day award
---
Ah, I assumed there would be a separate fee to reserve a name in addition to the sub time. If it's really only $7.5, that's totally worth it to me. That's the cost of lunch to ensure I get the name I want for the next two years? Yes please.
---
I mean if they removed the map and it's backend then an addon would have no way of knowing where you are.
---
nope.  
---
Here's another question.  Can you go a day without twitch memes escaping your mouth like verbal diarrhea?  Here's hoping
---
What a shortsighted moron;  You just make your account not the name of your twitch account and this is next to impossible to do anything but guess about.
---
COULD YOU GUYS... just PLZ.... stop giving your money to idiots?
---
Maybe but it would take too long. It sucks but they did their best imo
---
"huh says I need to kill 14 scorpions...what could that possibly mean?"
---
I'd rather just mash the "Train" button, personally
---
I don't even understand what OP is saying? Someone is a huntard for getting a complete gear set?
---
Young quantifiable part of this comes down to how personable you are and how friendly you are and how social you are. Making friends with other guild he's makes it far more likely you will be raiding with them. Or baseball metaphor, two people run to first base, one has perfect form and the other has horrible form but they have the same time, who do you pick? You pick the one with horrible form because if you teach them good form they win.
---
Remove the map?  As a feature in a new classic wow expansion?
---
Never heard such a bad idea in my life. How am I not surprised asmon thought of this, the man feeds himself coffee cakes all day, his brain runs on dopamine, and his body runs on sugar and he looks like he's already a stage 3 cancer patient.
---
To the point about complaining about after phase 6, it's more about spending hundreds of hours on a toon with a tight schedule. I probably won't hit 60 till after phase 6, will the servers be up still?
---
The words are literally in the term. toxic ‘stream sniper’. It’s about stream sniping. You ganking some streamer for 5 hours doesn’t automatically make you a stream sniper.
---
Damn. I don't even know or care who the guy is, but if you stream, it's **100% on your own head** what happens to you because of how you stream. So tired of streamers feeling so entitled.
---
All mount related..... Actually getting a purchased Epic mount before BC this time around. I kept rerolling on Vanilla, but I did get the AV wolf on my Tauren Hunter. I want to get the Frossaber mount on my main, then get saber mounts or anything that's not a mechastriders for my Gnomes.
---
Wait, they do? I've been trying to find confirmation for this all over and I had been assuming that they had no scaling, are there any vanilla videos or anything that demonstrate that Lifestealing scales?
---
It really boils down to the fact that Streamers,while fun now,are an Anathema to the original design of Vanilla. A game entirely built around socialization and community progress per server. Every social interaction,every person has meaning.
---
If you roll on a server with a big streamer or two..you can say goodbye to your server economy,you can say goodbye to a competitive PvE environment with regards to farming for raids and world firsts.
---
Instead of 10 guilds on a server slowly evolving into one super guild over time,you will instead have a Streamer and an army of peons =)
---
It removes an aspect of Vanilla that is super important..the uphill battle in a server wide sense.
---
Even more so,it removes server identity and drama (drama can be fun in Vanilla! it can be community defining even).
---
If a popular streamer rolls on your server,like Asmon,he's gonna get Scarab Lord =) his fellow streamers are going to get Atiesh and Corrupted Ashbringer,they're gonna get Sulfuras and Thunderfury.
---
The whole lot =) simple as lol And its going to absolutely fucking destroy the true Vanilla experience for anyone who is unfortunate enough to be on a server with them =)
---
I agree but tbf the fear off the cliff thing was a bug, the totem guy shoulda been camped, and the fight shoulda been redone
---
5 min delay fixes all of this.
---
No, arguing on the classic WoW subreddit makes you a nerd. I’m cool with being a nerd, idk about you tho. Only person trying to get anyone to conform to anything is you bro lol
---
Gotta cut one out. I'm getting a cat for solo/world pvp, wolf for instances, then ZG bat for BGs.
---
One level 60 and no alts is the most surprising thing about this post
---
It is pretty easy to understand that some people really enjoy watching particular streams and get entertainment value out of them, so they choose to donate in a way to give back and support that streamer. I dont donate, but that is mostly because I'm struggling to stay afloat myself. If I was comfortable I see no problem in dropping $10 once a month for someone who gives me entertainment.
---
You dont value that, and its okay, but some people like to support the entertainers they value.
---
Resto shamans are very shitty in AB/WSG.  Elemental shamans are A+.
---
yep!
---
Dont get me wrong but i think the best part of the classic experience is having those dumbass abilities that you literally remember when a random thing happens. Like checking the flag room with that shaman sight ability, 300 warlock curses and that tame demon stuff. They make the game way real, an adventurer isn't a fully effectie economist
---
Isn't a tank pet useful for solo gold farming dungeons?
---
Well in my recent experience, most commonly I will just pass by people from the other faction and they'll do the same, no one really wants to attack anyone, unless its for like a quest. But some people say it has been good for them so yea! 
---
I do have some other videos, but I guess not as many Classic centred :D Would love to do more in future!
---
To be honest I would rather be arms because I don't really like tanking but, I can't really take ashkandi and TF. So I'm trying to make due with what I got.
---
Fishing is a secondary profession. 
---
If you’re taking alchemy, you’ll need herbalism.
---
i have never seen this, why would you have 5/5 drain life with Affl/Destro ? You wont be draining life that much, only when you have to and when you do, if its buffed or not does not matter.  
---
If you are a "life drain specc" you usually have soul link.
---
&gt; Nah if you can turn it off it doesn't work because you can't attack anyone you come across.
---
Being able to get the initiation hit makes it easier for you on a PvP server than if you were PvP flagged on a PvE server.  Maybe that's too hard for you though, or maybe you just like ganking people who don't see you coming.  Either way I think you're going to have an easier time on a PvP server.
---
This might have what you’re looking for:

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7ou6l/wow_leveling_quest_list/
---
Well, that is why there are different types of guilds. 
---
Just be aware that barely killing bosses in MC wont really allow for much BWL clearing.  I was in a couple semi casual guilds in vanilla that both let a lot of hybrids in because it was mostly a social experience for them.
---
It was painstaking to kill a lot of the bosses, especially domo and rag lol... In both guilds it took us 5-6 months to down MC (both were new at the time). 
---
If progression doesn't matter to you, then yea, bring whatever.  If it does, then guilds need to make sacrifices.
---
&gt; The words are literally in the term. toxic ‘stream sniper’.
---
Yes it is. A stream sniper is a broad term that encompasses many different things. It's why he specifically outlined the type of sniper he was talking about black listing.
---
&gt;You ganking some streamer for 5 hours doesn’t automatically make you a stream sniper.
---
No one said it does
---
&gt;But the streamer will most likely blacklist you for stream sniping anyway.
---
You don't know this. You can't know this. So it's a completely irrelevant point and useless topic of conversation.
---
People aren’t obsessed about streamers, rather are obsessed about not interacting with the followers. I like to watch streamers, but I will be avoiding them like the plague:
---
2.	⁠[Streamer ran blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bx4iac/sodapoppins_streamer_privileged_paradise_server/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) - they use their influence to destroy your reputation for camping them.
---
The names of your character and the guy in your party are so vanilla I love it.
---
Pick your poison.
---
This isn't true for Soda, he consistently reads his chat and responds to individuals quite frequently. This might diminish if he is doing a dungeon or something that takes more attention, sure, but to say he only reads donations or anything attached with a monetary value is disingenuous.
---
Truth! Streamers aren’t willing to pop adderall for 6 days strait to get realm first, no names are.
---
And that's completely normal and natural.
---
Yes lol

It really isn't that big of a deal.

I raided as feral most of the time back when classic was out and my guild cleared Naxx.  (guild was Dread on Korgath if you don't believe me).
---
I didn't DPS or tank the vast majority of the time but I had 30 points in Feral and still healed or did my job of being the de poison or de curse bot just fine. 
---
As for gear the rogues didn't want any of the gear that feral druids do in a lot of cases.  For the most part I would either take it for minimum dkp or it would get disenchanted.
---
Exactly.  Ret pallys, boomkins, arcane mages, cats... they weren't far above the MT a lot of the time (cats being a bit better than the rest to be fair). 
---
There is a massive difference.
---
Ya banned for honking to much at streamers, ffs.
---
Streamers have absolutely helped. As someone who played Vanilla and was already hyped for Classic, watching streamers has only gotten me more excited to play.
---
GNOMEN
---
I don’t know what to tell you man. We’re waiting for a game that we all played 14 years ago that has nothing new and cutting edge. We have around three more months of waiting for it to be released....what else would you like to talk about?
---
I'm stuck between druid and warlock. My warlock on retail has been my main since vanilla, he's been through faction and race changes, but he's still the same too me. I liked vanilla warlock and I love the demons. 
---
But the druid was a close second back then. I never viewed my druid as weak in pvp. I actually had decent success with mine as a feral. People keep saying "other classes can do what druids do, but better" and I just never saw it that way. I was ran my talents as a "hybrid" with some for bear and others for cat. I was constantly switching forms. Bear to take big hits and cat too deal damage. Base form for utility and some heals. 
---
I honestly can't decide because i'm looking for the fun factor and I can't decide which is more fun.
---
Those are some good points, but sometimes a bit much when you just want to do some content, having a fast way of saying "this is my gear" isn't the devil that most people make it out to be.
---
BWL is the first benchmark.  A guild that brings too many hybrids with crap DPS isn't going to get past the second boss.
---
What I’m going to do on my mage: pick up mining at 6, skinning at 10. Send all the mining stuff to an alt. Vendor or otherwise sell all the skinning stuff. At 60, I’ll switch skinning with tailoring to get the BoP robes. You can keep mining while gathering stuff to level tailoring and while the 5 million warriors and ref paladins are farming arcanite crystals and sell them the ones you find, other than the ones you might need later for engineering recipes.

Once you have tailoring up you can see if it’s worth it to switch to engineering or if you want to keep mining for longer. Keep in mind that engineering is good for PvE but really becomes more useful in phase 2 and 3 with more PvP activity.
---
It’s an open game like you said. He has just as much right to blacklist streamsnipers as stream snipers have to snipe him.
---
They should make the sound when using the emote, don't need to be in a party.
---
Nothing wrong with Swifty, he had a huge part in WoW on Twitch and the community.
---
this entire subreddit is just reposts of the same question 20x a day. not that theres much new to talk about, but we dont need to have the same shit posted every hour on the hour lol
---
You don’t own the server jackass!
---
That’s not how any of this works.
---
Source?
---
LOL why even make the post if you are just going to flip it around to make it Irrelevant in the last sentence LOL
---
Not to mention a rabid fanbase to give them handouts and carry them thru content they're too shit for
---
At least with streamers we’re discussing things that will impact Classic that have never happened in the past. 
---
“If a streamer rolls on my server, how will it impact me?” Gets translated to “Death to all streamers and their first horns.”
---
Bloodvine items are not bind on pickup, however you do need 300tailoring to get the set bonus.
---
Either way, you can get people to make cloth gear for you if you absolutely need it, and bloodvine isn't in the game before ZG which is phase 4. I would recommend something else to go along with engineering until the time for ZG comes. Like herbalism for example.
---
&gt; verbal diarrhea
---
Logorrhea

interesting word.
---
Stop with the jealousy and let the man do his god damn job. He is an entertainer, let him entertain. This is pretty much like heckling a stand-up comedian who is just trying to entertain their audience. Instead, some idiot from the crowd, who can't stand not being the center of attention has to ruin it for everyone else involved.
---
Some people can't play classic for whatever reason, so they watch streamers instead. This is what you would ruin by doing this. Accusing the streamers of ruining your classic experience? You're doing exactly the same to him and his audience. Grow up
---
On my server back in the day, there were ganksquads, with the whole purpose of counter-ganking. They would protect you while you farmed and kill opposing farmers
---
They are a tiny part of a huge server. They definitely won't own or have an impact on the server. You've been has by conspiracies man.
---
Damn hunters! Always have an answer for everything.
---
Most players aren't streamers and not just doing SM. Stuff is getting tested.
---
Maybe he wants to stream because he actually has a community around the game that he also likes interacting with. 25,000 people watch him daily for a reason, because it's entertaining to them, some people just like to chat, some people just like to listen to him in the background, and some genuinely like watching him play WoW. As he clearly said in the video, if he could stream the game without any impact on his game, that'd be ideal, no benefits and no streamsniping.
---
If he only cared about money he'd run a bunch of ads, he wouldn't mute or hide his on-screen donations. He even stopped doing his most profitable day, where people donated videos, because he felt it made his community shitty. He obviously doesn't care about money anymore.
---
Which is discussing items that will impact Classic?
---
Streamers WILL HEAVILY impact your gameplay whether you’re ignorant of that fact or not.
---
All a map is is a collection of coordinates put together by multiple users contributing data to the same project. Doesn't sound too difficult.
---
No, not at all asking for them to take it out
---
&gt; Eventually these MTX games will get legislated away. It’ll be the best thing for gamers in years.
---
not every MTX is a loot box
---
I got more death threats in about 2-3 hours of Path of Exile than I've got in any other game.
---
It was really fun!
---
Yeah, well they may as well not play any online games at all then huh. Seems reasonable, let's encourage the losers in their basements trying to be in the limelight for 30 seconds instead of the people giving a game a lot of attention and entertaining thousands of people.
---
You are correct, that's why dot and wand is the superior playstyle.
---
No one gives a f***. LOL.
---
This dude is gonna get farmed so hard
---
Yeah you're not wrong. He did great earlier on in wow's life. Just don't think he will be able to keep up with everyone else that's out there now.
---
that's how I organize my keybinds
---
keep all my modifiers organized together
---
actually can't stand seeing people bars with random modifiers all over the place
---
The streamers guilds lol. That has never and will never be the case. You can't even begin to back that idea up. Why would top dedicated players join a guild because of streamers.... that's omegalul status.
---
/click ExtraActionButton1
---
Oh look another poster who thinks the world revolves around streamers.
---
After reading this I feel annoyed now. We only get 3 chars per ACCOUNT, so what, if there’s like 3-4 PVP realms and me and my friends make chars on some realm, are we going to end up regretting that due to low pop and whatnot? I don’t want to make the same exact character on multiple servers :/ wanna reserve my alts and stuff. Plus it seems weird letting us only have 3, what about opposite faction toons?
---
They should have a few preset chat options then atleast.. with 1 that everyone uses as the universal "fuck you", as it should be.
---
What? I'm not trying to stream snipe anyone. Don't be so quick to reduce a nuanced situation to us-vs-them.
---
1) It's not always going to be easy to tell a sniper from someone who just ganks a streamer, perhaps without even knowing who they are. It's obviously problematic to blacklist the latter with the backup of a big fan base.
---
2) Snipers come with the job. People get ganked in WoW. If you broadcast your gameplay you're going to get ganked more, simple as. Nobody should be blacklisted for ganking. There _are_ consequences for ganking and that is rivalry.
---
3) It's hypocritical. Soda says in the video he ganks and camps but it's "different" when it's done to him. 
---
4) It's not quite a group of people deciding not to play with a sniper. They wouldn't anyway because they sniper has to be the other faction than the streamer. The blacklist suggested would be cross-faction, which is obviously dumb because there is _supposed_ to be faction conflict.
---
Returning to be a mage again :T
---
This should have way more upvotes
---
He doesn't care that they are filling up his Reddit page. Because he could very easily solved that by putting everyone of those people on block or ignore. He cares that they are filling up everybody else's Reddit page. Which again, is a funny thing to care about.
---
Yes go get a map a good old paper one and ask it where you are.  The game has to tell the map where you are if it doesn't so that it doesn't know.
---
1.	⁠⁠Server queues will be atrocious. Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine just half of his followers trying to get into the game with him.
---
There is going to be queues regardless, a streamer playing or not will not change that
---
2.	⁠⁠Streamer Ran Blacklist  - they use their influence to destroy your reputation for camping them.
---
They are also being watched by thousands of people with the ability to process valid reasoning, any over-zealous use of said blacklist would tarnish their reputation and affect their livelihood.
---
3.	⁠⁠Getting death threats, spam, reports, etc. for camping and killing a streamer.
---
This rarely happens, and you can get much worse for killing a player a part of a very aggressive PvP guild as well on your server so this point is moot.
---
4.	⁠⁠Scarab lord event is already determined.
---
The average WoW player will not have the time to grind this anyway so anybody with common sense will not care. Even I love Classic I’ve played it for nearly a decade now but I’d never justify dumping that much time into the game for the mount.
---
5.	⁠⁠GMs taking their side if an altercation happens due to them bringing in thousands of players, while you are just one player.
---
You must not watch OWL.
---
6.	⁠⁠If they leave the server, expect your population to dwindle if people are there for the streamer.
---
Also not true, most of your points are circumstantial with no real proof, sure a lot of them COULD happen, but most people like myself who already plan on rolling on these servers know these things and I would imagine they’ll be prepared.
---
Whose to say everybody won’t leave those non-streamer servers because they won’t have the population numbers to generate people’s interests? A million hypotheticals can be formed and they’re only problems if you choose to make them into problems.
---
The gcd would just mean you are still in caster after. For what he asked, there would be a gcd after HT only. He never said he wanted to re-enter form
---
Funny you say that because I'm going to take much delight in being a gnome rogue that relentlessly ganks horde chumps. I will be in the trees. In the bushes. Along the roads. Outside of towns. Outside of raids. Inside your cities. I will be inside of you.
---
Ganking is a funny thing, it's great fun with a bud and you ambush some unlucky turd just millin about, mindin his own business.... 
---
But the second I get ganked? Never happy over that, Haha. 
---
Its relatively easy to avoid, low pop zones or having a partner with you can pretty much fix it. Unless there is some turd lvl 60 out and about if you're a low level. But that is part of the magic of classic wow, you can get into a fight... anywhere.... at any time.
---
It's the one that points down.
---
You’re honestly playing stupid at this point, if you don’t there’s an issue with the guy getting ganked, being the judge determining what the guy ganking is doing and why he should be blacklisted. Have you never seen Soda, Asmongold or Esfand being salty before? Literally when they were leveling to 30 Asmongold and Esfand were saying people were sniping them, when they got ganked once it twice in PvP zones questing.
---
Rogue and hunter are ok. I think everyone else's is bad.
---
I think people value it. The difference is that others and I wouldn't give our money away to millionaires willingly. Doesn't 99% of the world's wealth belong to like the top 1%? Let's not help it progress any further than that
---
Camping is in no way similar to stream sniping, especially when you experience the latter in its extremes. Snipers can spend hours chasing streamers around the game, through multiple zones, intentionally interfering with someone because they either want to show off in front of thousands, or because they hold animosity against a particular streamer (or streamers as a whole). 
---
Who the fuck cares if he blacklists them? He can take several precautions against stream snipers (stream delay, PvE server) that are a detriment to his personal fun and stream, or he can fight back in other ways. Like a blacklist. Snipers are literal children and deserve it.
---
Don’t frame the original, it will yellow from the light very quickly. Make a copy or use special glass to preserve the paper

---
One of the old school streamers, started on xfire. Came from wow arena, always played druid. He's not one of the most successful streamers there are. He pivoted to being a variety streamer over the last several years as WoW has gotten worse. Always been a vocal supporter of vanilla and private servers. One of the ones that pushed the movement hardest during the Nostalrius times. He's been waiting for Classic all this time like us
---
Rolling on a server with a streamer will not be authentic.
---
No, you can't import characters from anywhere into classic
---
This is fricking amazing.
---
Yeah I stopped watching him years ago but he achieved a lot for the community nonetheless.
---
Pretty sure Ninja does this or use to just report random people that killed him for stream sniping even if he had absolutely no evidence
---
I feel like even with all the advantages he has as a streamer - donations etc - he still would not be top - there are some real big players out there
---
This is blizzlike, along with the **inability** to use abilities through objects as well.
---
I can't believe people even pay attention to these quasi quasi quasi celebrity "streamers". 
---
If I found this dude in game i'd camp him relentlessly.
---
But they aren't caused by Blizzard and there's nothing you can do about them other than the obvious, avoid them. Not really any reason to talk about it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-leveling-classic-wow WoWHead has a few leveling guides that include suggested spells to take. You could look at those. 
---
May I also suggest a feature that notifies you when you level up and new worthwhile spells become available. So if I level up and all the new abilities I could learn are skippable, it tells me that I don't need to go back to the class trainer.
---
I'll consider this. Thanks.
---
&gt;So tired of streamers feeling so entitled.
---
How the hell is he acting entitled? He's literally asking for no special treatment, to just play the game like every other person but with a stream on. Obviously that is impossible because going by this post even asking for fair treatment is too much.
---
I always did the westfall river run! Super efficient and looks super remote and pretty
---
Should of made them stare at each other for a second, then run past each other. Or just fly past each other on flying mounts
---
IOTA is the only name for a gnome
---
There was no charge bash into cat form macro with one button press. Most druids that powershifted in classic would either use a cast sequence or a multiinput mod/add-on.
---
Top players aren't going to roll on the same servers as streamers, and you still haven't addressed my other points. Top fucking kek
---
Ganking is fine. But ganking successfully because of information that someone gained from an out-of-game source is not okay. It's pretty easy to tell when someone is using that sort of information, and at that point they should be blacklisted because they're clearly being a dishonorable attention-seeking asshole. Like I said, if someone hates a streamer and wants to gank them, go nuts - but do it in a fair way, not using outside sources to gain an advantage.
---
Those are some crappy friends
---
This is fricking amazing. This will save me a ton of room on my other monitor =D
---
Truuuuuu
---
I really dont know how reddit works :/
---
I used to play CSGO quite a bit a few years ago and one thing that still keeps me coming back to this day is the voice chat. I remember playing community servers every day and talking to the same people all the time. It was super neat to play with and talk with a community of people. I made tons of friends on the servers I played on and I've made very few friends on other games that I play today. Having an excellent social experience in a game can easily add thousands of hours to its lifespan for many people. In my opinion an absolute necessity is a community of players who are actually willing to interact with each other, but that might be tough. Overall, for me some of the best parts of games are the social moments, whether it be bunnyhopping and chillin with the boys in CSGO or raiding and cooperating as a guild ... and cracking jokes between wipes in WoW. Its always sure to be a fun time.
---
I love these smaller addons. They're not full suite addons with 90% crap you don't want. Someone wrote this addon for a very specific purpose and it's absolutely perfect.  
---
Thank you OP. I will deposit dollar bills into your pocket region if you know how to do another addon I'm looking for.
---
Just divorce her
---
What is wrong with that? Assuming that the people blacklisted are legitimate stream snipers that are harassing streamers and that proper responsibility is shown when adding someone to said list (I.E. repeat offenders or extreme cases, not just one dude that killed you and you suspect he sniped). Who cares? If you dont like it, dont stream snipe.
---
Nightelf rogue? Didnt he also make 1 or 2 decent pvp Videos? That Name sounds so familiar...
---
&gt; Being annoying/obstructive just for the sake of getting attention/a rise out of other people. Corpse camping on the other hand is intended and fair.
---
Without irony, this was typed.  My sides.
---
On a more serious note, if you’re in this situation:
---
Things always get better even if you put at least a passive effort towards moving in the direction you want.  I don’t know your circumstances, but hang in there and take it one day at a time!  I hope you’re able to find the joy you deserve in life.  :)
---
See you (maybe) in Classic!
---
u dont
---
I'm going to have a pocket prot warrior.
---
Lulz
---
It's also difficult for them to add as they've stated clickable objects in that fashion didn't exist until after 1.12, but I agree I think it has to come eventually. It's way too convenient and has almost no impact on a actual gameplay so I pray they do it.
---
No.
---
But paladins are fucking great
---
This is midly confusing to me. So I just want to clarify your statement. I think you said your not looking for them to take it out. Is this correct?
---
What do you mean?
---
I like to think of it as something akin to Netflix or Hulu, except its not mandatory.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who did that
---
He’s streaming with 1600 viewers rn dude not sure he was only relevant for 3 seconds...that’s good enough to make a decent living
---
What do you mean no? It only makes sense
---
A main reason that Soda wanted him banned is cos “Thousands of people are watching” which to me is no fucking reason at all - he is not running a social service for the wow community. He is monetised and earns shit loads.
---
Had many arguments he could have made but he largely chose an entitled stance and well i hope his comments draw him some grief cos its down right spasticated
---
Okay, I don’t agree with really any of your points, but let’s keep going;
---
1. Trade chat will be twitch chat
---
2. Servers will be heavily one sided for major streamers
---
3. Massive followings of players surrounding the streamer in major cities
---
4. Server population increases and dwindles as the streamer logs on and off for the day
---
5. The server will have more elite players because it gets recognition from that streamer - I’ll get murdered as a casual
---
6. Stream sniping can get me banned, right? How do I prove I wasn’t stream sniping?
---
Post your rebuttal. Give me 5 more min and I can post some more. Too many what-ifs to make me believe I’ll have an authentic wow experience.
---
Don’t forget to transfer your rank 14 gear and ashkandi
---
Yeah how do I do it though ?
---
You first give it to the Nigerian prince who will hold it in his savings account for you help you avoid getting banned
---
Well they need to go suck eggs then.  YOU WANNA BOOMY DAWG?  YOU GO FOR IT
---
I hope this is the response Blizzard gives him, if any.
---
The troll is strong with this one.
---
Can you email me so I can’t get the info?
---
Umm if no one gave them money they wouldn’t be able to stream ? How do you think they got rich is the first place? And now that they’ve made it you think they should be doing it for free? How is that logic not stupid?
---
you’ve gotta be joking, surely
---
Cease this charade.
---
Try actively discussing it then rather than trying to prove points that aren't there and participating in the streamer discussion.
---
&gt;if you don’t there’s an issue with the guy getting ganked, being the judge determining what the guy ganking is doing and why he should be blacklisted, especially when you’re sitting on thousands of viewers
---
Can you say this again? This time in English please?
---
&gt;Have you never seen Soda, Asmongold or Esfand being salty before?
---
Ya. What does salty have to do with black listening people who grief you? Again, stream sniping covers a wide variety of behavior. Soda is talking about people who are abusing it to be completely assholes. 
---
&gt;Literally when they were leveling to 30 Asmongold and Esfand were saying people were sniping them
---
Ok? What is your point? 
---
&gt;when they got ganked maybe once or twice, by the same people, in PvP zones, questing.
---
So ganked once or twice vs getting griefed. Two completely different types of behavior.
---
My first toon was a warrior in 2007 a few months before TBC. Niar's videos are what made me drop the warrior in my mid 30s to roll a rogue. Him and Grim were my biggest inspirations. I can't wait to reroll my NE rogue.
---
Imagine wanting to ruin someone’s fun/job and then bitching about them not wanting to deal with that.
---
You can get by healing at 30/0/21 and have good PvE and PvP. At least until the really hard stuff.
---
I don’t see how it would be an issue tbh
---
They were already in classic.
---
With fire mages it depends on how many mages you have in a raid i think at 5-6+ mages the crit hardly helps fire at all. Frost it always helps like 6% more damage per mage in the group but even so more like ~20%. 
---
Ruin locks it helps the same amount as frost mage so thats nice.
---
This isn't to mention that Boomkins actually do scale rather well and can do damage (better than most hybrids), issue being mana and even with pots and runes cannot keep up (so they have to downrank losing dps).
---
Feral is even less increased damage (but generally more useful as off tank.)
---
Ret is never needed. 
---
Enh is never needed (but still useful in that ~1 shaman per group is helpful, between WF, the reduced threat totem, stat totems, and resist totems they are useful.... 2-3 pallies pretty much do the work of 7 shamans; slight hyperbole.)
---
And the entire Nightfall weapon thing is good, but hunters are good with this and shamans aren't awful.
---
Hybrids are better than most think , but there are other issues. Shamans totems have to be kept up , that means even less dps. If dps in the group dies this means the shaman/druid now are effectively doing less raid damage. You need perfect groups, not 1 too many locks or mages, not 1 too many warriors etc. And for 5-10-20 man content they are even more worse off.
---
I’m glad I was able to find at least one sensible person here, I can’t believe this post is being taken seriously.
---
your trolling didn’t work, move along
---
I have posted this elsewhere. They will impact you.
---
2.	⁠⁠Streamer ran blacklist - they use their influence to destroy your reputation for camping them.
---
You shouldn't mention the dreaded (private) word. Mods are insanely trigger happy with that for some reason. My post which I only briefly mentioned it was deleted.
---
Did he play retail vanilla wow? I feel like there's no way he can have this opinion and have played back then. It's hilarious to think anyone would give a shit if he got ganked repeatedly for any significant amount of time. That's the state of the game on PvP servers. You play knowing this. The solution would be to leveling in groups since there is safety in numbers in WoW, but that could just lead to more attention and more opposing players so it'll be interesting to see how people like this dude handle it. Because people may care about social status, but many will embrace the troll/camper title and wear it with pride.
---
this made me laugh hard. Reminds me of when Ninja started reporting anyone who killed him.
---
My Grand Marshal Ret Paladin will be waiting for you.
---
Lol
---
From a population standpoint alone, if Asmon really does have 40k+ followers like people have said and only a measly 2% of them chose to roll on his server and his faction, the Alliance could have an extra ~800 people on one faction.    
---
Assuming normal servers settle at ~4k, and we're lucky enough to get a 1:1 ratio, you're looking at a healthy 2k on each side. The presence of a streamer would severely imbalance one faction. 
---
Furthermore, can you imagine trying to farm something like Furlbog rep at the same time as Asmon -- on the opposite faction? You'd get destroyed while he tags mobs and let's his fans now them down for him.
---
I'm not hating on streamers. Good on them for getting paid to play video games, but I want no part of it.
---
Loving in Dayton I’ll have to ask Dave if I run into him. He stops through my work about once a month so there’s a chance.
---
Came to this sub for advise, this is rather unwelcoming
---
But its true. That duel tournament was a form of entertainment. Know why RP realms have rules that protect RP? To avoid shitheads like that tauren guy. Why should we care if streamers monetize entertaining content? That's their job. Don't have to be jealous over it. If you don't enjoy it, don't watch it. But don't go thinking streamers deserve bad shit to them just because their successful at doing their job of entertaining people.
---
I think you’re exactly right. A lot of people aren’t prepared for what is about to come. Probably not even Blizzard. This will be the most massive launch in any MMO game to date. Everyone will want to play it: veterans, retail players, people that follow streamers on twitch, and people that get into it on hype alone. 
---
Servers are gonna be a mess the first week lol. I can’t freaking wait.
---
Is that not available in classic?
---
While I cannot say 100% it's going to remain up, it's absolutely  financially stupid for Blizzard to close their servers post 1.12.  
---
They will do 3 possible things:  
---
1. Release TBC.  
---
2. Create a new server with TBC progression, while leaving 1.12 alone.  
---
3. Create post 1.12 content.
---
15g/hr minimum wage or bust!
---
How does one distinguish a streamsnipe gank vs a gank?
---
you know you can’t transfer anything over to Classic. that would be absurdly unfair to everyone who can’t do the same. it’d also just be broken in general and would ruin the point of the game.
---
Just as easily as people could stream snipe him, he could get body guards
---
This is quality content. Thank you OP
---
"Wanna group up for Deadmines?"
---
"Hold on, give me every party member's name and let me check the blacklist"
---
LOL
---
I think not. I don't want to wait many hours for bg.
---
"Streamsniping" is looking at the live feed of a person who's livestreaming, finding their exact location and then going there in-game with the deliberate intent to kill them. Basically if they weren't streaming you wouldn't know where they were located, but because of a 3rd party service (Twitch) you had that information.
---
Soda (Guy in the video) loves world PvP, he likes running into people, ganking them, or being ganked. As long as it's genuine. 
---
He's complaining that because he's streaming with minimal delay (To interact with the chat), people will repeatedly streamsnipe him, ruining any chance for real PvP experiences.
---
The issue, is people are purposefully using his stream to hunt down his location. And it’s not just unique to this situation. It’s in every game. Now, while I don’t really care if he’s just leveling, or messing around, but say there’s a BG tournament, or some kind of event, where competitors would be given an advantage by looking at streamers screens. I think that’s where the line should be drawn.
---
And so beings the Streisand effect.
---
Putting it in that phrase, being able to “hunt you” is.....idk creepy?
---
Couldn’t come up with a different way of putting it?
---
Not this again... no one wants 3 hour queues or a dead pvp system like what happens with every pserver when one faction takes over and the other stops queuing
---
I just gagged at the thought of giving TF or hungering cold to a paladin.
---
How! I couldn’t use it till 70 anyways
---
Where can i sign up?
---
I was in the group he ninjad treants bane off
---
The same part the rest of the people down voting you are I imagine.
---
Nelf Hunters and Human Warriors were specifically memes during Vanilla/TBC because they really did seem to be in a class of their own in terms of not wanting them any where near you group unless you already knew them.
---
Add to that, the survival tree and can you really blames new players for thinking that they were melle/ranged/caster class?
---
True dat.
---
Weird, you're effectively telling to me quit his job. Cool story bro.
---
He could still stream, just institute a significant delay. Sure that kills the instant feedback and some community involvement, but you can't have it all, man.
---
I'm gonna have an alt rogue called billybob
---
Grievous’ solo Orgrimmar pvp videos were insane. Saw his name on the classic site that’s been going around; maybe we’ll get some new content from an old god.
---
Asmon averages 25k+ views playing beta, how would you not know him...
---
First 4 in mc? They didnt get rag first. Also obligatory...take that, mediocrity!
---
Seems like a good way to get people to gank you on sight even if they're not "stream sniping". As soon as you declare you should be immune to ganking you're target #1 to be ganked.
---
That's just straight bollocks. There was one clip that blew up of him calling a guy dancing on him a stream sniper, it blew up because the guy cried on social media for sympathy (Ninja reported him). It, perhaps unsurprisingly, turned out he was in fact stream sniping. And even still, Epic still didn't ban him.
---
Bruh you talk like German isn’t the best part of EU servers.
---
Because a lot of the people they claim are sniping just arnt. Random world pvp and ganking somone you recognize isnt stream sniping yet they claim most people who gank them are sniping.
---
Soda himself says he camps ppl, when someone camps him it &gt;What is wrong with that? Assuming that the people blacklisted are legitimate stream snipers that are harassing streamers and that proper responsibility is shown when adding someone to said list (I.E. repeat offenders or extreme cases, not just one dude that killed you and you suspect he sniped). Who cares? If you dont like it, dont stream snipe.

&gt;What is wrong with that? Assuming that the people blacklisted are legitimate stream snipers that are harassing streamers and that proper responsibility is shown when adding someone to said list (I.E. repeat offenders or extreme cases, not just one dude that killed you and you suspect he sniped). Who cares? If you dont like it, dont stream snipe.
---
doesnt make it sniping
---
Medivh for PvE - first to open AQ
---
Thugthol for PvP - big name players like Maydie or Mute
---
&gt; I have missed the "its a hunter weapon" memes. Good on you, sir.
---
This isn't a meme. Ashkandi should go to Hunters. It's a PvP weapon.
---
I've already addressed this issue in the video \^\^

Racing to kill bosses that each have like 1 mechanic each like a 10 minute curse or some shit doesn’t seem that joyful but whatever.

Gear score, earliest I recall was WotLK. In this and also TBC, each tier of gear was a significant increase over the former. The values are a lot easier to determine when there is such a large difference. In classic, the gap is much smaller and some people's best in slot gear is a low item level. Badge of Justice is great for a long time, for example. 
---
Also, people did gear check in the past. I recall people requiring others to have T1 or higher gear equipped and line up for inspections. There is always be people gatekeeping.
---
I really doubt Blizzard will ever give a shit about ganking. It's a pvp server, that's what happens. I think he knows that, which is why he already jumped to "social bans" instead. Which no one is going to enforce.
---
Dumb mentality plain and simple. Don't wanna get ganked, play on PvE. 
---
Dudes a "famous" personality who makes a living off how well known he is on the Internet. Your in a game where people can kill each other, thus people will kill each other. No different than when people attack streamers in retail, only difference now is the combat math.
---
If you watch the video, you'll hear my response on that issue :)
---
I like this a lot. Why the super fast weapon? How do we make this a pvp spec?
---
I'm waiting... bring the lotion.
---
I knew this was coming. Absolutely called it this morning. Sodapoppin's rhetoric is dangerous to himself.
---
He wanted to live by the sword, and now he's gonna die by the sword.
---
1. Asmongold has been on Kelthuzad for like 7+ years and he had zero impact on the servers population.
---
2. Soda literally said he would blacklist people who streamsnipe, not just kill him multiple times.
---
3. If you never have received threats from camping somebody than you have never actually camped someone.
---
4. Oh? If all these streamers are on the same server, you think they are all going to give it to the most popular streamer? All 100+ people keep pushing? Don't act like you even have a chance at it anyways.
---
5.What even is this logic? They have banned Swifty, Soda, and even PERMABANNED Reckful.
---
6. Again, streamers have been on retail for MANY expansions and have zero impact on the server population. Sodapoppin used to switch servers and faction almost every month, I didn't see any post about their servers dying when he left.
---
Keep giving your reasons, Ill keep shutting them down,
---
&gt; Barb is significantly better, from AQ. 2 less stam, but 41 agi instead of 86 AP.
---
I'm not sure how AGI into Melee AP works, but I think 41 agi = 41 AP or it might actually be 0.
---
if you melee people you're probably going to prefer the 86AP.
---
Ich... well here is hoping there will be more than one PVE server. Gotta find whichever they are going on and pick the other one. I have no desire to be in the middle of their pissing match.
---
Yeah sorry MC.  I know they didn't get rag first
---
&gt; And 41 agi is 41 ap (82 rap)
---
Do we even get melee AP from Agility? I'm actually unsure.
---
that's exactly what he wants-random encounters.  now if that person kills him every single day it becomes obvious.
---
As a fury war I'm still shocked people care about it, outside of pvp it gets beaten by untamed blade, on multiple private servers at least, horde side in overall dps.
---
Yeah pvp it's great. I'd still take bonereavers in bgs though, less chance of 1v1 kiting allowing you to get those stacks much easier and literally shredding everything like its butter.
---
Didnt do much pvp though so take that with a big fat grain of salt. The stam is really ridiculous but if you're hardcore pvping you're probably flasking and already have a great burst buffer.
---
That is a private interest though. I mentioned he could have used different reasoning but he didnt. 
---
Why should Blizzard be interfering over private interest is the point I am making. Used to be it was against tos to monetise any blizzard content etc.
---
Have people honestly gotten THIS bored?
---
On the flip side, you'll have people that root for you for doing it too.
---
As I said, the entire concept of the list is that the streamers and their following would be the majority of the server, while 'blacklisted' players would be few and far between, so your scenario is unlikely.
---
Also if they want to take it very seriously, they could just make an addon that has the entire list dynamically updated.
---
I want to know the name of the idiot that decided to change Southshore/Tarren Mill. It's dead now.
---
Wow, folks.  Just... wow.  Some of y'all with your entitled beliefs that you can act awful just because it's a PVP server and escape any consequences for it.
---
Newsflash:  You tried that kind of stuff in old school WoW, you'd end up on a "blacklist."  Targeting people and killing them over and over is a good way to piss people off.
---
That's what "stream sniping" is.  Just targeting a guy because he's a streamer, using the stream to find out where he is, and harassing him.  Which, by the way, doesn't just harm the streamer.  It harms the people watching the stream.  They're there for entertainment, to watch someone progress in the game.  If you're targeting the streamer just because he's a streamer, you're doing it just to troll those people as well.
---
A "blacklist" only works if everyone's on board.  So the only people who'd have to fear it are people planning to be so awful that their side of the server would actually be 100% on board with locking them out of playing the game.  So are you planning to be that level of awful?  If you aren't, no worries.  If you are, then goodness, I don't care who your targets are, I hope you get blacklisted into oblivion.
---
A PVP server isn't an open invitation to be an awful human being.  It's like saying that a "free speech zone" is open invitation to say the worst things you can to someone.  Sure, you're allowed to do it, but it still makes you awful.
---
I don't believe for a second it'd be something that'd be abused, or even could be abused.  It's a voluntary thing, requires complete buy-in.  The only way it wouldn't be is if servers treat Alliance and Horde as two unions where there's no opting out.  I mean, yeah, people want unions in gaming, so I guess they could get that to happen.  But I seriously doubt it, by the nature of the game.
---
I mean, heck, I don't even get how someone would lose much of anything by being blacklisted.  If you have time to seek out a streamer and keep killing him just to troll him and his viewers, you're clearly not someone who's going to be working that hard to get the best gear and get in top shape for raiding.  You're also probably not the kind of person who'd be much use in a battleground, as you want to be a rogue operative.
---
It's funny you claim this isn't about "witch hunting" when that's exactly what it is.  You call someone out by name, and encourage people to rip him and similar people.  You also want people to "refrain from any name calling" but in your post you call someone an "asshole."  So maybe look at your own double standards before attack others for theirs?
---
And FFS... it's not like such an idea would be limited to streamers.  If you're having issues with someone being a jackass to you in the game, it's likely you'll know someone on the opposing side that you can talk to and ask them to do something about that person.  Same concept.  The people who disagree with their behavior will shun them.  The people who want to encourage such behavior (WHY?!?) will welcome them.
---
But really, this all comes down to people wanting to be able to be awful in the game without consequences.  They talk so much about "the consequences of streaming" but don't want to consider the consequences of antisocial behavior in a social game, even though one of the points hammered home so often about Classic is that it's so social.  As it was pointed out in a Madseasonshow video, one of the big deals in WoW Classic will be minding your reputation.  If you want to do bad things, expect a bad reputation.  That won't be any streamer's fault, it'll be on you.
---
Can you answer my question or not?
---
What are they gonna do besides stream snipe you if they cant do end game content anymore because of stream sniping? Pretty well guaranteeing people that will be 100% dedicated to fucking up your gaming.
---
put it on the neutral AH with the goblins.
---
I don’t think it’s tradeable like that, will the ah be linked in classic and retail?
---
I never imagined this is how the Soda wars would begin..
---
&gt;Can you say this again? This time in English please?
---
You know exactly what I meant. Another showcase of you treading water and just trying to divert the discussion.
---
There's obviously a problem when the guy getting ganked, is the guy putting people on the black list. Obvious reasons like being a salty bitch, after getting ganked a few times, which we've seen some streamers, including Soda and Asmongold have been.
---
&gt; Ya. What does salty have to do with black listening people who grief  you? Again, stream sniping covers a wide variety of behavior. Soda is  talking about people who are abusing it to grief him. 
---
Being salty and mad is obviously going to affect some people and cause them to say they're 'griefing', when it could be just a few ganks. Like you pointing out my somewhat broken English in a sentence, acting like you didn't understand it, because you're mad.
---
&gt; Ok? People stream sniped them. They didn't get griefed and  they didn't  put them on a black list as a result. What exactly is your point again? 
---
You don't know if they stream sniped them. My point is that they considered it stream sniping after a few ganks, when they have no proof of them being stream sniping. 
---
&gt; So ganked once or twice vs getting griefed. Two completely different types of behavior. 
---
If they act like this getting ganked once or twice when being salty. How are they going to act when they're getting camped for hours?
---
The idea of social consequences for killing the opposite faction is ridiculous.  If he complains about getting killed by snipers then that's on him.  If a streamer tries to "blacklist" someone, I'll just be more inclined to group with them.
---
Ok, your very first thing to do when leveling any Paladin, should be to get Consecration from the Holy tree.
---
Gnomercy
---
The most sought after gnome name
---
warlock pvp spec is also often heavily demonology and warlock pets get extra 5% from orc as well. as someone who played an alliance warlock in vanilla on a pvp server ill tell you straight up orcs have another hidden racial passive - not having to face WOTF every fight is almost as good as stun resist haha
---
1 copper offer here.... what? I just bought my mount man!!
---
You can't streamsnipe in an MMORPG.
---
Yes.
---
Yes please. Massive zone scale fights of strimmerboi armies vs the guild dedicated to hunting said strimmerbois and their armies.
---
Can you link some source?
---
By monetize, they are just streaming it. There is no rule in the ToS against streaming the game. Private interest? So is RPing with your buddies when some trolls interfere. Blizzard steps in for those examples of griefing, what's so different about this, other than it being on a much larger scale? Who cares if streamers feel entitled. That doesn't mean they deserve any less than anybody else. Hate streamers all you want, they provide content and entertainment to thousands. Let them do their job without interruption or griefing. You can always just ignore them completely.
---
And if you're sniping a streamer purposefully then you accept the consequences.
---
No they aren't.
---
You should just buy it from the in-game item shop. You can buy all the Vanilla items with real money.
---
Nobody cares about your “unique” opinion that’s been said 40xs already
---
this is why i dont feel bad for streamers getting sniped. you have a small army at beckon call. use it, or dont stream your position and then qq.
---
Read the helpful notes on loading screens.
---
I agree.  I wonder if we will know in advance with the big 2, the rest I'm not too concerned about, except for staysafe/esfand and a couple others going to the same server.
---
i played a lock on a vanilla pvp server. i cant remember anytimes i was feared to death... stuns killed me thousands of time. wotf offers very little to a ranged caster.
---
All of the things your posting, again, are circumstantial at best, you’re letting your view of what you think the world will be crowd your actual thought of what will happen.
---
1.	⁠Trade chat will be twitch chat
---
It already will be, to think twitch emotes aren’t apart of gamer culture is incredibly naive and stupid.
---
2.	⁠Servers will be heavily one sided for major 
---
streamers
---
False, the “biggest streamers” will split evenly to each faction as they’ve already stated, and even if it wasn’t, if this thread filled with salt and envy towards streamers is anything to go by the opposing factions shouldn’t have to worry about imbalance.
---
3.	⁠Massive followings of players surrounding the streamer in major cities
---
This already happens with GMs decked out in full raid gear.
---
4.	⁠Server population increases and dwindles as the streamer logs on and off for the day
---
Also false, streamers are going to play with their friends and other streamers *mostly*, they already do as you can see in the beta, so average players won’t be affected and they will play on their own schedules. You need to get the line of thinking that Asmongold has 50,000 viewers so there will be 50,000 people online when he’s online, there’s a ton of people thinking the exact same thing in this thread, and it’s not true at all, because all of you who sit in here chiming in on everything streamers have to say definitely count as a viewer as well, and all of you that are “anti-streamer”, who need to reassure themselves they’re making the right choice by not rolling on a streamer server seem to lack in understanding.
---
5.	⁠The server will have more elite players because it gets recognition from that streamer - I’ll get murdered as a casual
---
Idk what you want me to say about this, bad players will be bad regardless of their server, player skill in a lot of ways is tied to time spent playing so of course streamers will have an advantage.
---
6.	⁠Stream sniping can get me banned, right? How do I prove I wasn’t stream sniping?
---
It cannot get you banned, player grieving can, and obnoxious corpse camping has gotten people banned before.
---
Oh and your point is from.....nothing. What game is your point from? Beta level 30? LOL
---
Oh thank god! I was worried blizzard would now down to the hardcore minority and not have a cash shop in classic
---
The patterns were changed to BoE late in the game.
---
And the word shadow or cat somehow in their name.
---
Because streamer's have a massive, rabid fanbase that do whatever their streamer told them to do. Sodapoppin is talking about blacklisting people for stream-sniping, not something like ninja-looting. Who cares if a streamer gets killed a few times, their fanbase will run to their rescue anyways. Why ruin people's reputations because they want to fuck with streamers, streamers should expect trolls, it comes with the job.
---
There's many more options. He literally presented one here. Another is to roll with bodyguards, which would be a lot easier.
---
Don't pick a Warrior. The amount of farming you need for consumables, crafted gear, enchants, etc. to be competitive is going to outpace your ability to invest time into the game.
---
I'm not a streamer and I don't have nearly as much time now as I did when I was a kid and played. Because of this I will be on a PVE server. I know I will miss the world pvp interactions but I will also avoid the Stranglethorn deathtrap as a priest These streamers could always roll on a PVE server and mitigate most of the problems with being sniped.
---
Yeah tbh for PvE progression, it’s best in a hunters hands if they weave in Melee attacks. Fury warriors have so many better options. But I like weapons like ashkandi and hand of rag. Just juicy weapons for pure looks, clout, and fun. Honestly ashkandi is nice, but as a hunter as long as I get my ashjethul bow of smiting, I’m a happy boy that can 1 shot clothies
---
What a wanker, maybe he should just play on a PvE server.
---
&gt; I would kiss you if I could.
---
I'm good, thanks :p
---
Did you by any chance use Firefox and update it recently? I thiiiink this might be when the lag started for me
---
Griefing like that is actually against Blizzard's TOS though, so people could actually get suspended/banned.
---
Just killing somebody who's broadcasting their position to the world isn't against any rules.
---
Nah they’re not really like that!
---
"They'll be more popular in Classic than they were in Vanilla, so queue times will be shorter"
---
is not a valid argument.
---
Fast = more SoR procs, which scale with spell power = more other procs, which scale with spell power.
---
PVP is still hybrid + holy reck
---
I've been pushing Cutting Edge content for a while and I gotta say, streamers like Soda &amp; Asmon are mostly ridiculed, while other streamers like joshpriest etc are more respected.
---
I don't imagine cdew or venruki or any of the method guys enforcing a blacklist and I don't think top end classic raiders will care much about asmon or Soda either. 
---
And honestly I don't see asmongold agreeing to this either.
---
This is some Swifty tier cringe.
---
Lmfao i know exactly what you mean, i popped into this one dudes stream awhile back and he was playing pubg. He gets killed by some random dude while he was chilling in a house and screams stream sniper... and this person has less than 5 viewers
---
I'm a big fan of interrupts on Scroll Wheel up
---
Hate to break this to you, but streaming, if you're doing it to a level you make money (especially a lot of money), *is* a job.  Basically self-employment.  You provide a service for people who expect you to provide that service a certain amount of hours per week, or they withdraw the money.  I would never be a streamer (or even YouTube video gamer) because I don't want video games to become my job.  If I don't feel like playing WoW for eight or more hours in a day, I don't want to be forced to do it.
---
&gt; Yes we get it you're a big streamer and make millions from playing computer games and big celebrity okok. Do you think the top raiding guilds on the other faction give a shit? Lolno. 
---
Actually they do, if you think he didn’t get carried on private servers for those same reasons then you’re just being naive.
---
Those “top guilds” all have people that are friends with him because believe it or not, Soda is a “top player”.
---
You know what? Screw it. You have to first make a Blood Elf on the Alliance. Play through a secret quest chain that begins in Pandaria, and ends in Outland. You'll be given a key that unlocks a secret door in Icecrown Citadel. In here is the Secret Bank, which lets you access all of your banks from all of your characters, whether they're in retail or classic.
---
An individual (or in subways case a corporation) has decided to blacklist (or in subways case ban) you. You acted in a way inhibited them so they inflict punishment as a deterrent.
---
Thanks Peter
---
Streamers already have their safe spaces. They’re called PVE servers.
---
Ancient hakkari manslayer is a decent weapon off hakkar with a life stealing proc that most melee dps will not want if they have bis weapons from bwl. It's a cool weapon for solo pvp that would work with SoR +spell damage gear.
---
680 dps in that video is pretty damn good for blue pre bis gear that no other class wants. It's still a meme spec.
---
Really? Since when do people think clicking is better than binding spells?
---
Yes this is what I was talking about. They made a blue post about a month or two ago. Some items will be BiS at launch and won't get replaced till post 2.5
---
&gt;guild wars
---
We've come full circle lol
---
I might stream for my friends to try and lure them into Classic, but really you should just glance at Twitch when Classic launches and pick a low pop stream.
---
It’s not that. They want to play the game without being stream sniped 24/7.  It’s just the spergs looking for their 2 minutes of fame on stream.
---
It's also a great plan to keep retail players subscribed during content gaps.
---
If they are in the middle of the 8 month gap between expansions they can play classic for a few months instead of unsubscribing and waiting.
---
I find it funny that none of them sept for maybe Asmongold straight out refuse to roll PvE
---
No one has said they want a ToS that stops people from ganking other players.
---
&gt; This will happen on every server in Classic and is what happened in Vanilla, if you were known as a douche, many people would avoid playing with you.
---
People forget about that, which is so weird, considering how much people are talking up how good it'll be for the game to be more social again.  Being more social comes with people who are antisocial getting shunned as well.  If you do things that get you a bad rep, you find it hard to do anything.
---
If people don't want to deal with that and want to kill without consequence, they can stick to current WoW and just queue for BGs.
---
My points are that it’s not an authentic Classic experience.
---
It works in retail because retail isn’t a community driven experience. You pretty much say hi to someone, then go on your fucking way to slay a dragon. You don’t really need anyone’s help to do anything. However, in Classic you are driven IMMENSELY by your community. The decisions you make impact those around you and will impact the overall health of your server. My Vanilla server was a close knit community with people showing their worth in game, not being carried through the game because they have a ton of followers. Essentially, that goes right there against a classic authentic experience.
---
You can try to refute it all you want, but there will be a difference from vanilla.
---
yeah but they don't want those safe spaces, all the fun is on PVP servers so they need safe spaces over here
---
&gt; I saw the crossbow drop only once in like 30 BWL runs and another hunter got it.
---
My guild didn't see any drop for 6 months, then in the span of 5 weeks 4 hunters had it.
---
Huh? Did you type that wrong, you mean you can only transfer from PVP to PVP? You said that same thing he did
---
Nice!  Thanks so much, i'll be sure to credit you.
---
Server transfers did happen late in vanilla but you couldn't switch from pve to pvp. I guess its considered a competitive advantage so it wasn't allowed.
---
Thats never gonna happen. Like it’s clear that he wants to gank but doesnt want to get ganked. Just a crybaby as always
---
Quin apparently has but he's a retard that won't play more than 2 weeks of classic so why anyone would listen to him is beyond me
---
So...... 
---
Step 1: roll on a pve server
---
Step 2: ????
---
Step 3: Don’t get ganked or streamsniped 
---
I mean, it seems like an easy solution to me.
---
People got camped 24/7 without stream sniping, its not hard to find some one in-game, this absurd notion that stream sniping is bad, is beyond me. Stream sniping will always be a thing its a part of streaming, get used to it.
---
Streamers should just be locked so pve servers since they can summon hundreds of people to gang people
---
This sounds like fake news
---
That's worse. Imagine bailing on a group as soon as you get in, before or just after the first boss
---
I just want to be able to corpse camp people and not worry about some dingus on the other side telling all his pals and pals pals and pals pals pals to blacklist me from my Uldaman runs :(
---
Quin just suggested it on his stream
---
What does
---
This video gave me autism. 10/10.
---
"Being an asshole is okay because the game allows it!"
---
It's an undead male mixed with a female night elf
---
Based on previous history and some Private server trends we have an idea of the "ideal" raid comp. Not every raid will be the same but I believe each guild will strive for those numbers as a benchmark.
---
As you stated Main tank or off tank is out of the question. Same goes for any other key roles that the raid usually has few of including hunters (tranq shot), warlocks for utility, and druids for innervate. 
---
Chances are the guild will focus on gearing out the core raiders first so if you don't mind waiting you could roll of of those.
---
The second group is the main DPS (warriors, rogues, mages) and healers (Paladins, Priests, Shamans) you would actually have 5+ of each and you can just be one of the masses.
---
You don't have to play it forever you know. The zeal on this Reddit is kind of insane. What happens after 1.12 is still 3+ years away. Hell I will probably burn out before Naxx is even released. That's fine though.
---
No he doesn't. He's literally reported one person for stream sniping ever. Literally one. Then the guy cried on social media for sympathy claiming to be scared for his account. Although, it turned out the guy literally was stream sniping. Although, unlike the sympathy posts, that didn't quite get so much attention.
---
Come on though, any big streamer is going to have special treatment. First dibs on loot, a personal escort everywhere they go, legions of players that can be hailed at a moments notice, any gold or items they want from their guild etc etc. There are pros and cons to turning that stream on. If what people are doing is within in the ToS then there shouldn’t be an issue. If it’s not within ToS I’m sure Blizzard will take action and no blacklist will even be needed. For the record, I think stream sniping is lame and don’t think people should do it.
---
no.
---
It doesn't matter how much you claim they're claiming it, it only matters if other people believe it, which would require something like repeated behavior, the kind which would get you frowned on even if it wasn't a streamer.  If other people didn't believe it was really an issue, it wouldn't matter and the person would still find plenty of people to do stuff with.
---
So it only matters for people planning to be jerks.  In that case, doesn't matter who your target is, you're going to have trouble.
---
Are you the same Grim as the guy who made Path of Blood way back in the day? It's a long shot but I figure how many "Grims" making WoW movies can there be?
---
It's amusing you'd talk shit about him when you clearly don't even understand the situation.
---
Nah because reddit is a terribly designed website to have a civil and balanced discussion about anything, I’m just bored out on a business trip and need to entertain myself somehow.
---
Holy shit I was thinking to avoid streamer servers, but if this happens it may be fun to join one.
---
Barb is still better overall pve right? That would be my only hesitancy about arguing for an ashkandi. It's literally better for hunters than anyone else, pve wise, but if it's also replaced by a pole arm that literally no one else wants from a frankly pretty easy AQ boss I'd feel a little bad taking it from the pvp dudes in my guild.
---
Mila Kunis
---
I just came
---
I'm going to stream snipe, too bad.
---
Play PvE if you don't want to PvP.
---
I think I can get away with just Rank 1 of Resurrection but no way am I passing up Shadow Protection, Mind Soothe or Mind Vision to save a gold or two!
---
&gt; Pretty much every other online game takes the approach that if you stream, you’re knowingly giving your enemies an advantage and the consequences are on you.
---
Is that really true? I thought there was a trend toward games banning stream snipers. I don't follow all that many games though, so It's mostly second hand info.
---
*no changes*
---
It’s still there but it’s different to be sure. You were in the Clergy of the Holy Light, right?
---
Future barrens block
---
The solution is to either stop streaming while playing or to roll on a PvE server. You can't expect to be a famous streamer AND be left alone and not have your stream being used against you, that's just ridiculously naïve.
---
If they don't want to be stream sniped they can turn the streams off like everyone else. Not our fault you're exposing yourself. Streamers in general suck as people IRL
---
Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master Back once again for the renegade master
---
I was a *well known* grand overlord and this streamer made a vid, forum post etc, about how I camped and harassed them. I had no idea this person who wasn’t even max rank got *camped* after charging me on repeat
---
\#nochanges cuts both ways.
---
You don't have to rush in. The good thing about classic is you don't have time limits. There is a defined end. No more "I got the best gear ever, time to replace it with greens in 4 weeks". You go on later, you don't deal with the phasing, you get a forever open classic experience. You can spend the next 5 years making 8 different characters, on again off again. None of us need to rush, we're just anxious.
---
&gt; People got camped 24/7 without stream sniping
---
And the people who’ve done this to other people have gotten banned for it.
---
/yawn
---
It’s also super easy to roll on a PvE server from the start.
---
lol well obviously it’s never going to happen
---
He's said before actual pvp he doesn't mind but when soda is stealthed and they know his exact location then they are definitely looking at his stream hunting him.
---
&gt; The decisions you make impact those around you and will impact the overall health of your server.
---
Holy shit that's cringe af.
---
&gt;not being carried through the game because they have a ton of followers. 
---
Ok and there it is, youre upset because they are gonna have an easier time than you.
---
&gt;You can try to refute it all you want, but there will be a difference from vanilla.
---
I mean, you said my points from retail don't count, so why would yours count when your vanilla experience didn't have streamers? You don't know how this effects classic, at all. The only reference you have is level 30 beta where everyone is on one server.
---
It everyone was questing simultaneously there were be no chance of actually doing those quests
---
And you wonder why we don’t want to roll on servers with streamers. Fuck that shit! A blacklist ran by a streamer is RIP to that server.
---
It's literally a video game where the whole plot of the game is your faction vs the other faction. I'm seriously dumbfounded. Have you ever played wow?
---
Blatantly lying to sound cool on reddit doesn't make you look good.
---
In a stream a few days ago he said he would stream snipe asmongold if asmon played on a pvp server
---
Camping is consider griefing which actually against the tos. So those that actually do it will get some sort of punishment.
---
Saw a wow classic clip -with a streamer(no clue who he is whatsoever) -well he got go’ed by Pikaboo -one of those high ranked pvpers.. no logic -he just yelled “f*** streamsnipers!”   ..my wow gang would go whoever we stumble upon from the opposite faction.. some just love pvp.. pretty sure pikaboo is likewise.
---
I'm assuming you can transfer pvp-&gt;pvp but I dont remember
---
Streaming is his job. Yeah, he could stream other games with 1/10 of the viewers he'd have on Classic WoW but we all know he isn't going to do that. All in all PvE server would be best solution for Soda if the sniping gets bad.
---
Good luck proving its camping
---
No one has to believe it if theyre making the list and making all the guilds follow it
---
Horde ftw, down vote.
---
First of all, I hate to be that person but this is hardly going to effect the game. 
---
Let's first look at when the ranking system comes out: ***PHASE 2.*** When do WSG/AV come out? ***PHASE 3 (Same phase as BWL)***, not only are those ranks incredibly time consuming to get, there won't even be ***premades for battlegrounds*** until BWL is released, yes that means ranks are only gained from ***world pvp.***
---
 Yes, if the sets are in their later versions they will technically be stronger in many cases, but it's not in anyway game breaking considering how little people are going to get them ***during phase 2.***
---
Progression will not be effected majorly by this, and as stated in some comments under this thread, any hardcore guild that will have \~5 members with r14 and others close to it, are not going to have any issue clearing content in the first place. 
---
So where's the problem?
---
What makes you think they’ll be more popular? Servers with double the population of vanilla couldnt keep them going
---
Aww no :(
---
You lied to us?!?!
---
!remindme 81 days
---
I cannot wait to snipe all these motherfuckers.
---
I mean it's fairly obvious they were talking about people seriously harassing them because they're public-to-a-degree people. He used examples of someone doing that in game.
---
This seems to be taking an example of someone saying "okay, you're toxic and grief me, you're going on a list so people know you suck" which is the exact kind of social power a game with other people where you're willingly being awful being put into action.
---
&gt;Because streamer's have a massive, rabid fanbase that do whatever their streamer told them to do.
---
That massive fanbase has to actually play on the server and be large enough to have an impact, which is exactly the same as any other guild with random people.
---
&gt;Sodapoppin is talking about blacklisting people for stream-sniping, not something like ninja-looting.
---
Stream sniping is just as bad as ninja looting, it's intentionally griefing to ruin the gameplay experience for other players. You think it's different because you're never going to impacted by streamsniping, but that's hardly relevant.
---
&gt;Who cares if a streamer gets killed a few times
---
The streamer obviously cares. I don't watch any streamers but I don't see why there seems to be this expectation around here that they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the game.
---
&gt;Why ruin people's reputations because they want to fuck with streamers
---
Why should people reputation be ruined when they ninja loot? Because the community decides that's shitty behavior, this is no different.
---
&gt;streamers should expect trolls, it comes with the job.
---
This is simple the attitude of jealous people, because they make money they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy things. I don't think anyone just trying to play the game should have their experience ruined, streamer or otherwise. 
---
And trolls are expected because people accept that trolls exist, so trolls continue to exist, and because trolls exist people say trolls should just be accepted, on and on... Being a troll is just being a shitty person, and if there were actually consequences to these shitty people, *like a blacklist*, there'd be less of them.
---
I know fuck me read - I said used to.  Your reading comprehension is not great.
---
I said that he used a poor argument - one that me and my rp buddies obviously could not use “thousands are watching this”.
---
I said he could be punished but his best argument was that and it is entitled; plenty of valid reasons to punish but he chose that.
---
I have nothing against streamers who dont try and influence how others play the game and no fear I will be avoiding any stream servers
---
It’s not that hard to prove? Constantly killing someone over and over again when they get back to there body is easy for them to see.
---
Classic is good because there are no arbitrary game systems telling players how to have fun.
---
Anyone advocating for ToS/GM intervention is a moron.
---
Thank being said WoW is also a social game so if they want to try blacklists they can, but most people won't give a single fuck.
---
Iant excessive camping considered griefing and as such a suspendable offence anyway?
---
Dude, you don’t have to agree with me. We just agree to disagree. I’m sure one of us will be correct when it rolls out, but I’ll be staying away like the plague.
---
I’m not salty about them having an easier time, it’s just that authentic Vanilla wasn’t a popularity contest. You put in the work and got the best gear.
---
Kick ftw
---
I will have at least something for all classes before I release it.  Depending on the breaks, I may have it fully configurable.  Or not, who the hell knows
---
Yeah true it just depends. I guess it’s a matter over being selfless or not. While it is GOOD the DW weps from ZG are better for PvE. It just depends if the dps warriors in the guild put in as much effort  as the hunters or if they even pvp in general. A hunter in a PvE spec can still wreck shit in PvP, but a fury warrior is kinda ass in PvP (from what I know). But if a dps puts in the effort and loves to wreck peeps in PvP, I think they should get it
---
...I believe this is called 'humor'
---
I hated that eyesore. Just imagine a giant white cow wearing *that* set.
---
&gt; I want to know the name of the idiot that decided to change Southshore/Tarren Mill. It's dead now. It used to be daily pvp.
---
It's called Battlegrounds.
---
Seriously, apart from pre planned PvP, those huge battles weren't a thing past leveling or the first patches.

You don’t have to learn have the skills for rogue lol
---
I've heard druids benefit more from spirit in the beta than on pservers so ironically it may be more viable if that's the case.
---
This is bullcrap lol. If you can't handle PvP, there are carebear PvE servers for you.
---
Actual issue is that premades can face non premades.
---
Classic
---
I honestly hope this is a thing!
---
Why is that stupid?
---
Do you think I can just buy a skip in the cash shop?
---
That's a good idea, I'll look into that.
---
i see both sides of this, its similar to how celebrities get noticed out in public and get their pictures taken by paparazzi and whatever which a lot of them don't want and find very annoying, this changes how they have to go about their life in various ways. having people following you, tagging mobs before you, killing you and whatever else it may be causes you to drastically change how you go about playing (and in his case streaming) the game and he just wants to enjoy the game normally as he did years ago.  I don't blame him for thinking this when he is constantly annoyed by a bunch of immature people who want 5 seconds of "fame" for having their character on his stream, it's ridiculous. I do think a blacklist is harsh and blocking people from doing content (which takes a while to get to) would suck and just ruin that one players experience which I don't think someone deserves just for being an immature child and harassing one player. of course he can still play the game of stream, but a streamer of his size will still have griefers (a lot less) off stream too from people who just /who his characters name. All in all, going out of your way to ruin any ones experience of classic just isn't deserved streamer or not.
---
Ahhhhhh well thanks man that's actually awesome news.lol shows how much I know.
---
Just a bit of self-deprecating humor. I really appreciate that Blizzard is one of the few companies who make Mac clients for their games. Most titles I have to play on console now since I left my PC back home after moving for school.
---
Magtheridon (US) - Home to the og multi-boxer Xzin (1 priest followed by 4 mages)
---
 
---
&gt;**2. Why did you pick four mages and a priest?**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Mages for the AoE and burst damage, which I realized early on was going to be key to what I wanted to do - PvP. I (correctly) reasoned before I even started that I was not going to survive very long (in PvP or PvE) without the ability to heal - and priests are the only class that have the ability to cast AoE heals. Melee classes were going to be too difficult to keep in melee range and while I contemplated warlocks, I eventually settled on mages given everything I knew about WoW PvP mechanics. Since all of them needed to be Undead (for Will of the Forsaken) this further narrowed my choices down and I pretty much decided right away on 4 mages and 1 priest. Who can deny the power of 4x instant cast, 3 minute cooldown, Presence of Minded Pyroblasts from 41 yards away? Almost nobody survives those.

&gt; If you are thinking of rolling a new set of 2 or more characters, consider joining us on Magtheridon, US. No queues for Horde, a stable, full server - and a more tolerant/informed Horde side. PvP server, but leveling is easy with little interruptions if you do instances, and much of the server is 80 so spawns are rarely contested until then. If things really get hairy, help is just a call away. 
---
 [This forum post](https://www.dual-boxing.com/archive/index.php/t-292.html) from back in the day is still viewable
---
Interesting idea. I personally won't use it, but that's a great addon for lots of people
---
Apparently they don’t. Y’all see dmg numbers and that’s it.
---
Don't forget to be a friend to your brother yourself. He'll appreciate it forever. :)
---
Huh... who would have thought streamers were whining self entitled dbags.
---
The question isn’t whether non subs should be allowed to do it, it’s why it has to be two weeks before release.
---
Haha that's good news thanks for letting me know!
---
You still train them after level 40, doing stuff like this is just to ensure you get can afford your mount as early as possible.
---
Exactly. I'm gonna be on a crackers and cheese whizz diet until lvl 40 saving for my mount.
---
That's the idea.  They'll be curious.  Avante Garde advertising works.  It's why Old spice commercials make zero sense.
---
Can he not deal with stream snipers the way everyone else deals with gankers?  Either out pvp them or get some friends together and return the favour.  
---
Enough with the fucking crying.
---
How popular Classic is has nothing to do with BG queues. It doesn't matter if there's 50K people playing Classic or 10 million, either way each realm will have 2-4k players and will have the exact same problems vanilla had with queues - not enough players during off peak times and imbalanced factions.
---
They say this stuff so people will talk about them, that is the only reason. I’d say it’s working pretty well.
---
Real talk.
---
I am going to switch the scenario around. For whatever reason you do something to piss off some Top Guild master on the server and he has friends on opposite faction and not only he blackballs you on the realm forums but every time you log on he tells opposite faction your location. You get ganged and camped unable to play the game. Should there be TOS against that? Ganking is not the same as targeted continuous harassment.
---
You make a post and complain. Questions: do you think everyone will call you a cry baby and say you should be locked to PVE server? 
---
I really don't understand the animosity towards streamers, youtubers, other groups of players. 
---
You don't have to roll on the same server as them only to complain about how much you hate them.
---
I watched Asmon earlier.  He said that people play pvp servers because they want the option for world pvp, but do not want to be forced into it.
---
That's a pve server.
---
Fwiw, I don't know why pve servers have such a bad reputation.
---
&gt; he hunter didn't turn off cheetah for the whole duel :(
---
Dude we had AQ/Naxx hunters that still had -PACK- ( daze for the whole party yay ) during our raids.
---
That's what I've settled on. Dwarf priest as an alt.
---
That's a Twitch rule though, not Blizzard, and Twitch is notorious for being _incredibly_ inconsistent with its bans. I'm not saying this was or wasn't justified, just that Twitch bans aren't the best evidence.
---
&gt; As a result I suggest we create a super guild, "The Blacklist" with the explicit purpose of pushing content as efficiently as possible, with the goal of hunting those who wish to abuse their streamer privilege to dictate what others may do. Any and all shall be welcome, and those who we blacklist shall be hunted relentlessly. 
---
I don't think I've ever cringed so hard in my life
---
I find it funny that Sodipoppin was actually stream sniping    
---
perplexitycya an noted how fun it was to stream snipe and how he can't even be mad at it anymore.
---
Wow, sounds like a troll to me
---
Not knowing how to spell rogue is the most classic thing I can imagine.
---
A big portion of the rank system is built on that premise
---
I don't believe you but I appreciate your sincerity. Enjoy classic!
---
Pretty sure this is considered targeted harassment and is against the ToS of both Twitch and WoW. I would love to see him try ;p
---
I'm rolling rogue + druid dualbox.
---
Double stealth is gonna be amazingggg.
---
Bingo it is all about advertising.
---
If there’s a PvP solution to a PvP situation, it’s not actionable.
---
It’s only punishable if there’s no way for a player to take recourse into their own hands (griefing someone on your own faction).
---
But that is harder to do. Before it was fixed, a popular one was for a mage to constantly sheep anything you were fighting so it’d heal up. Stuff like that.
---
It’s because you think you’re right. That’s what you toxic.
---
It's for the best. I don't have the free time that I used to and the only way it works is to be absolutely dedicated. There will be plenty in my place though.
---
For certain!  I also had a personal KOS list.  I'm also pretty sure I was on some lists others had.  It was the nature of the game then.
---
Because it is more fun to play than retail, even if you’re limited to half the levels.
---
Another popular option in Vanilla was Tailoring/Enchanting from 1 to 60 and no change at 60. These were the types of priests that were guild leaders / officers who helped out the lowbies and managed guild banks with the bags.
---
I like your attitude
---
I love stories like these lol.
---
Eye of beast not recommended?!? I'd role hunter just for that spell
---
I don't see how having dual-spec is negative in any way. Are people looking fondly as sinking massive amounts of golds in respeccing for pvp/ solo/ raiding or feeling comfortable having a split built that isn't optimal in either?   
---
But I seem to be in the minority among the changes in that I'm just excited to play with old friends again in this setting. Things like barber shop, dual spec, or things that can minimize gold loss or travel time while out actually "playing" the game seem non-issue to me, but they seem of great issue to others because of the "whataboutisms" of snowballing and such--as if Blizzard would repeat all grievances again.
---
I hate when streamers put thenselves above the rest of players and i hate it even more when the devs do it too
---
They each have their pros and cons but I'll take crossrealm queues anyday.
---
We’ll see when you are getting corpse camped how you feel. 
---
The people that do it will get banned just like other have before. The people that do it will also get a bad rep on their server and eventually give up once people won’t group with them and people start out gearing them.
---
I regret commenting, there's no saving you. Good luck.
---
&gt; You know exactly what I meant. Another showcase of you treading water and just trying to divert the discussion
---
No , I honestly had no idea. It was really fucking hard to comprehend what you were trying to say. Legit.
---
&gt;There's obviously a problem when the guy getting ganked, is the guy with thousands of viewers, putting people on the blacklist.
---
What is the problem? If he has evidence that they are stream sniping  and griefing him with it, then there is no problem. You seem to think there is a problem because he will abuse his power but you have no evidence of this. It's baseless speculation.
---
&gt;Obvious reasons like being a salty bitch, after getting ganked a few times
---
Literally everyone gets salty after getting ganked. You are baselessly assuming that he is going to start blacklisting people for this. Again, this is a completely pointless discussion because you are trying to predict the future. No reasonable discussion can be had on this topic. The criteria he laid out of the black list does not match "getting ganked a few times". He specifically laid out the kind of behavior that would warrant a black list. You are creating a strawman. 
---
&gt;You don't know if they stream sniped them.
---
In this scenario it doesn't actually matter because no one was put on a black list, so who cares if he thinks they are or not? Completely irrelevant point.
---
&gt;If they act like this getting ganked once or twice
---
You mean getting annoyed? 99% of the player base gets annoyed when they get ganked. Why are you acting as if this is some unusual behavior lol
---
Making a blacklist for people who kill streamers is also considered targeted harassment.
---
Well you didn't even answer his question.
---
I mean yea in general most of it is on lock. But relative to everything else in vanilla feral has improved hugely based on recent theorycrafting.
---
They should honestly make a streamer server at this point.
---
Got a source of that? Sounds like an interesting situation that needs more highlight.
---
I’d rather wait and not waste ~15 days of sub and accidentily make a character on a low population server.
---
At level 40 you can dark pact pet for mana.  The Imp has extremely high mana regen.
---
The other thing is that you want to be pulling mana mobs at once.  Dots have excellent damage per cast time, but once you have applied your dots you are no longer making great use of your time.  So, you then apply your dots to the second mob, then the 3rd etc.  You end up taking a lot of hits and actually need drain life to sustain your health.
---
&gt; The alliance leveling guide has you go from Elwynn to Darkshore if you're human. Loch Modan and Westfall dont work well right when you finish Elwynn at level 11.
---
That can't be right. Grinding level 11s is probably faster than running all the way to Darkshore.
---
You finish level 11 somewhere around Eastvale, meaning you'd need to run all the way back to Stormwind, hop on the Tram, run out of Ironforge, die all the way to Menethil Harbor, take the boat to Darkshore and start there.
---
Meanwhile I grinded 100 mobs and I'm ready for Westfall.
---
Although bugs can be a terrific source of protein in dire situations, I'm pretty sure he meant bags. Just in case there was any confusion
---
Drain life is often worse than wanding while leveling.
---
Jaina's Firestarter (Level 37 Wand): 39.4 dps
---
Drain Life Rank 4 (Level 38): 41 dps
---
This rank of drain life directly costs 185 mana. Effectively regain 246 mana from using it and converting the mana to hp with life tap (41x5x1.2 from improved life tapping). Looks good so far right? Problem is using drain life, like any other spell that costs mana, prevents mana regen for 5 seconds. And a warlock with some spirit gear on will easily regen for 20+ mana per second at this level. So if you spam it every five seconds and prevent mana regen, drain life actually wastes mana while not doing much more dps.
---
Well... I’m going I be rolling a rogue.
---
I don't have an answer to his question but not knowing how to spell rogue is a meme.
---
Because world PVP creates a completely different layer to the game that is incredibly fun.
---
&gt;  why would i give my money to some dude who has more money and plays video games all day while i work my ass off.
---
Because they're entertaining you. I can understand not wanting to donate to the ones who have already made it big and are obviously raking that shit in though, like Sodapoppin for example.
---
These guys just want to be able to gank/outnumber the other side and call it stream sniping whenever they get ganked/outnumbered.
---
I'm playing on a PvE server because I don't want to be interrupted by PvP all the time and that's what you're *supposed to get* when you roll on a PvP server.
---
It’s completely expected that a declaration of war against stream snipers would be met in kind. Soda needs to be a little less entitled and a little more intelligent. It’d serve him well.
---
I love Rowgs
---
I think it just comes down to one simple thing -
---
Playing a meme spec is fine. 
---
Pretending your meme spec isn’t a meme...not fine. 
---
What usually happens is this - 
---
Ret paladin wants to go to the raid. 
---
They get asked to heal. They say no they would rather stay ret.  Now in most progression cases this is what happens - the guild tells them no, they would prefer an actually useful spec. 
---
The ret paladin then bitches about elitists etc. 
---
Or they get told okay - they can come - but they are dead ducking last on loot priority behind actually useful specs. 
---
The ret paladin then bitches about elitists. Etc. 
---
My entire point is - play a meme spec if you’d like - but don’t be surprised if you’re treated like you’re a fucking meme ya know?
---
For corpse camping? When?
---
Wait. You mean pvp might happen on a pvp server?!?!?
---
Excuse me, I need to find some pearls to clutch.
---
Blizzard has said countless times ganking and corpse camping are not in violation of the TOS on pvp servers.
---
lol I was the scrub in vanilla who would help cross faction players complete quests, rather than ganking them.
---
"You can kill me, but I'm not going to help you kill these Raptors anymore."
---
Ah interesting, well then they'll just have to get their viewers to help which probably would already happen.
---
Your responses have as many what-ifs as mine.
---
I’ll just stray away from the streamer server to get my authentic feel. You go have fun.

Imagine If stream sniping became something you could right-click report for. Idiots like this who deny any responsibility for themselves yet carry weight as an “influencer” with blizzard have the potential to be dangerous. Doesn’t bother me personally, I’ll be rolling pve server but it could seriously hurt world pvp if no one wants to attack him for fear of being put on some arbitrary black list. 
---
Do you think the community will actually pay attention to such a list? If anything the opposing faction will boost them to keep pissing him off.
---
Generally because streamers tend to be followed by rabid fandoms which can and will be disruptive to both the streamer and those around them.  Plus as previously mentioned, some make a point of targeting anybody who defeats them as a stream sniper, which only furthers the issues caused by said fandoms.
---
Not hard to argue that the streamers themselves aren't responsible for those fandoms, but they are responsible for the impact that they cause - they sure as shit wouldn't be there in that manner if it wasn't for their messiah streamer.
---
Dynamic mobs are easy mode IMO. You want mobs for your level you go find them, same goes for higher/lower mobs. Explore Azeroth with your higher level buddy who now must protect you in order for you to get that sweet high level mob EXP.
---
&gt; I'll still make good time, but there's really no point in worrying about "being behind"
---
If you intend to be competitive of course there is. First to 60 gets to be ahead of the curve, meaning easier ranking, getting your hands on the fat recipes first, farming Devilsaur leather and so on.
---
Having a headstart means you become rich and stay rich for the duration of the game.
---
I don't think we can see that.
---
Camping =/= Stream sniping  
---
I don't think any of these streamers are against organic encounters with assholes, they know it's bound to happen. It's a risk we all take on PvP servers.   
---
However if people want to go out of their way to pull up their stream just to shit on their experience, then I have no issue with Blacklisting/bans. The size and the relevance of the streamer doesn't matter, they could have 10 viewers or 10,000, it's still a shitty move.
---
It is impossible for me to validate your claims that they are accusing most people who gank them as stream snipers. I agree that it can be challenging to tell who truly is a stream sniper. None of that matters yet because no one has been blacklisted. If in Classic they blacklist anyone for the littlest reason, then I can see complaints being warranted. If they blacklist people who are clearly streamsniping, both Alliance and those on their own faction who attempt to grief, I dont see a problem. Of course, it can easily be abused, so we'll have to see how it turns out.
---
In a perfect world, where people who are clearly and consistently sniping streamers are identified, I dont mind a blacklist. It is just another way to combat them as opposed to taking hits to personal enjoyment of the game. I.E. playing on a PvE server, stream delays, etc.
---
It's not hard to go through a list of thousands of names with a computer.  You just press CRTL+F and type the name.
---
I have absolutely no sympathy for someone who makes millions of dollars a year, mostly just bitching about shit on stream. He has a few choices.
---
1. Play on a PvE server and stop crying.
---
2. Play offline and keep his identity secret.
---
3. Try to convince some of his fanboys to help him out.
---
To elaborate on something a few have mentioned, it's common practice to create a bank alt and post him beside a mailbox in any major city
---
It absolutely is griefing, but griefing absolutely is not against the ToS. Blizzard staff will take no steps to prevent griefing, and they never have (excepting real life harassment like doxxing, which is a fair deal more egregious than corpse camping to say the least).
---
WHICH HALF
---
wait what? i saw soda streamsniping mitchjones for almost 2 hours, even waiting infront the instance to kill him and mindcrolling him so he can't go in the instance anymore. 
---
I mean it was funny as hell, but that's... kinda wierd if he wants to get other streamsnipers banned.
---
sucks for you that you have to play on a pvp server. Remind me! 140 days - check in
---
I wouldn't be surprised if someone makes an addon with a database of "blacklisted" players and you can just search for a specific player.
---
Tell that to the people who got banned for it then.
---
Yes. Once you get some crit gear for a Holy Paladin they are the best maintank healers in the game.
---
How did you get a screenshot to look this bad lol not hating just confused.
---
Shhhhh dont tell people I need to feel original with a name that a lot of people have probably thought of already
---
It's 41 ap for melee yes, but taking a weapon exclusively because it gives you more melee attack power on a hunter seems foolish to me, even for PvP.
---
Weird that you have no names to contact via discord and the link you have is expired.
---
If you're cool with the possibility of immense frustration.
---
For surviving a rogue gank in particular paladin&gt;&gt;&gt;druid&gt;shaman,priest
---
vs other classes idk tbh
---
I camped anyone I felt like and never once had any action taken against me by blizzard and I'm gonna camp people on classic. If blizzard wants to ban me I'll just not play the game.
---
Feral Druid = bleeds is a TBC + thing. I'm not sure it even would be a dps increase if they could use bleeds in vanilla raids. It certainly wouldn't be a large increase.
---
While true, the robes are BOP so you still need tailoring to craft.
---
Are you me?
---
Tbh the guy still is really shady. The first duel tourney he ever hosted, the prize pool was increased by a donation and he agreed to it live and never payed up. I asked him on his discord hey is this true and will you be paying up with the clip of him saying he would. He said he would and then immediatey perma banning me. In the end he did not pay out the full amount.
---
Show me definitive proof this happened. Not anecdotal evidence. It is *explicitly* written in the TOS that it is not against the TOS.
---
I'm 99% sure one of these two communities is going to get themselves banned, just based on what I remember about Blizzard's TOS.
---
is it? thats actually amazing, what a time we live in...
---
Why? Because giving praise to a dude whose earned the right to play video games for a living using his influential powers for good when society loves to shame people like him nearly instantly for doing something bad?
---
Nah, I’m definitely in the right, and if not letting a dumb system like upvote/downvote determine whether I’m right or wrong makes me toxic, than I am.
---
But then they camp your mobs lol. And thats what he wants to avoid getting griefed not getting ganked
---
F this guy. Anyone who thinks they are entitled to anything because they are a streamer can go suck a fat one. They are getting paid to play video games.. can go play on pve if he's worried about it.
---
That is what peak performance looks like
---
And then when you go to a pve server they steal all your mobs genius. Its complaining against griefers not gankers
---
&gt; The amount of farming you need for consumables, crafted gear, enchants, etc. to be competitive is going to outpace your ability to invest time into the game.
---
Is that true for a DPS warrior as well as a tank?  I thought they did above average regardless of gear level.
---
Imagine not being a piece of shit by not abusing the fact that your enemy streams. Imagine being decent.
---
Please find me one instance of a corpse camper being banned. I'd love to see it. [Blizzard does not recognize griefing, and especially PvP griefing, as an actionable offense.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Griefing).
---
Sometimes I am not sure...
---
No other doesn't, quests in classic largely keep you in the same spot for a long time.  It's trivial to just walk around or watch his stream and see where he's going
---
Imagine thinking he shouldn't be allowed to play a pvp server just because he's streaming and then complaining when he does. Y'all are hypocrites
---
I tried LoL, one or two matches.  Yeah, not touching that again, some people are legit assholes on there.
---
HERE COMES THE TUG
---
How so? If more people are keen on participating in BGs then that increases the odds of a queue popping quicker. Especially when they're first released. I'm not completely opposed to crossrealm bgs, I do believe they should be there but not at the start as it brought a unique experience.
---
[No, it's not even remotely against the ToS.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Griefing)
---
Fair enough. I only experienced the WoTLK version of LFG/LFR. I kinda disliked how it made the game, though, so I quit playing at the end of that expansion.  
---
The most fun I had with it was forming 2/3 overgeared guys just to goof around doing exactly those things - but we always played within our skillset and (usually) never wiped the group. Usually turned out to be a fun way to powergear people we didn't even know.  
---
My favorite was a Ret Paladin friend of mine who would que as healer. I would take either a DK or my warrior, spec'd for DPS or PvP, and que as the tank. Then we typically would have one other guy we knew, and we'd just go ham on the instance. The Ret pally was full-on ridiculous. He would pull multiple groups in rooms we weren't even in yet. Then he'd BoP the tank and AoE the mobs down just so he could top the dps meters while healing the group and holding aggro. He even helped me gear up a few alts that way. Good times!
---
I remember when BG where not crossrealm, a lot of wintrading and long queuetime. No screw that, Crossrealm BG were really a good thing added to the game
---
not sure this comment was meant for me. I wasnt speaking on who was invited. I was explaining why the streamers got invited.
---
That’s because you’re a fucking casual who probably camped some dude for 20 minutes and thought you were badass.

&gt;Ongoing Harassment
---
&gt;Characters have the ability to address their conflicts through combat and GMs will only involve themselves in extreme circumstances.
---
They did redo the duel, problem is that his opponent got a 15 min cooldown back by the last duel and Soda lost two (three?) key cooldowns, one being 1 hour long. Can't really do anything except be frustrated in that situation, especially when you had a good chance of winning the entire tournament if that didn't happen.
---
The mage/warlock/priest 4 piece set bonuses are cool. Chance when struck by melee to either freeze the attacker for 2 seconds or fear for two seconds and the priests is a sheild. Not amazing but cool concepts
---
IDK, I haven't watched Soda do jack shit, and I don't care to stream snipe because I don't give a fuck about what a streamer does, but if you don't want to be sniped don't cater to an audience that would likely stream snipe you.
---
&gt; but taking a weapon exclusively because it gives you more melee attack power on a hunter seems foolish to me, even for PvP.
---
That's not why you take it. It's just part of the equation. Against some classes like Frost Mage you're not going to pull off a lot of shots, and that 1K raptor strike crit might win the fight for you. Ashkandi has higher weapon damage, and the extra melee AP just bridges the gap even more.
---
In regards to the Scarab Lord, do not underestimate the ability of random no-lifers to surpass a streamer who actually plays on a schedule. Especially if said no-lifers actually want to see the streamers on their server get pissed about someone else getting it. I like watching streamers too but sometimes it's nice to see them lose to a nobody. The salt must flow.
---
That's a pretty sweeping assumption to make. Plenty of Americans play video games for the sake of playing video games. Plenty of Europeans watch twitch. It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Just because you see people who play video games decking themselves in merchandise and worshipping their favorite streamers doesn't mean it represents the entire population.
---
“Using his influential powers for good”
---
Wow. What a red pill statement. If you can’t see how wrong you are, you are beyond talking to right now. This is hilarious.
---
LOL...did you play Vanilla WoW?  I've camped and been camped for multiple hours.  It was part of the game.  (Sure 10 hours would be a joke, but 1 to 2 hours straight, yeah it happened.)
---
even at 30% if it makes that rogue or pally think twice about stunning you vs that undead guy next to you that its proved its worth
---

---
Server merging can solve the faction imbalance issue.
---
Only if you're in a streamer server, which most of us will definitely be avoiding. It's the same as retail.
---
Yeah especially for the hybrid classes. The offer a pretty wide range of states that could work for the off specs. The dungeon tier 2 sets are almost equal to the blue pvp sets
---
I didn't know that thanks for the info.
---
Okay let's use Hearthstone as an example. When someone is streaming the game, they are broadcasting their hand for the world to see. Yet, anyone with a brain understands that is blatant cheating if you open up their stream to look at their hand. 
---
It's the same thing with stream sniping in WoW...the advantage gained may be much less but it's the same idea.
---
People are crying over this blacklisting thing when it was 100% present in vanilla and TBC.
---
I agree it's underrated if used right it's a good tool to have.
---
&gt; because if they were thought to be stream sniping, they would’ve been put on the blacklist. 
---
Do you suffer from a learning disability? Sodapoppin laid out the criteria for getting on the black list. It wasn't "getting ganked once or twice by a stream sniper"
---
Between Mage, Warrior and Rogue for me.
---
Druids - Never really been a fan of the forms, plus I don't want to be forced into a healer role
---
Paladins - Similar to above
---
Warlock &amp; Hunter - Not a fan of pet classes
---
Shaman - Not available on alliance but they'd be a contender if they were
---
Priest - Maybe one day in the future, but I don't want to be a healer right now
---
Not a fan of his and def am not one now. I imagine he will come to regret saying this, and it's something that blizzard would never do anyway so no real reason to get triggered.
---
I want everyone I know to play classic
---
I would have my pup play if I could
---
Soda has a fucking god complex.
---
Frankly, I will be the absolute first to check my servers easily accessible and entirely accurate social blacklist to make one hundred percent sure that anyone I invite to my groups has not serial ganked a streamer and made them cry.  I just can't believe someone would do this to a person that willingly chose to stream their gameplay without delays on an active pvp server.  I think you all need to leave Sodapoppin alone because he is important, and he is going to be the cornerstone of classic wow.  I don't want you all to make Sodapoppin cry anymore because he is a good person who just isn't sure how to deal with the added stress of having his location broadcast to thousands of people while he's logged in and just trying to play the game and pvp the way HE wants to pvp.
---
At some point I think there were free realm transfers to move people off the more populated servers. The paid transfers came later.
---
My friend just said "that's why I'm going PvP server, I hope the streamers all go PvE servers."
---
His keybinds are doing my head in
---
I think I met that guy as well :D
---
Nah man you got it wrong I was a highschool dropout I played wow 16 hours a day and I've spent entire days with a few friends camping people and the graveyard so they couldn't spirit res.  I've had gms teleport victims away from me but they've never done anything to me.
---
My staff as a mage was number 1 action too ... for that metering action after I nova them in place.
---
I'd likely still be playing Hearthstone if I could talk to the other player. as it stands now, for all I know I'm playing against a computer opponent. Literally impossible to tell otherwise.
---
That still means they went and reported the person which is more trouble than adding them to a blacklist they run
---
Except this post is about streamers and stream sniping in general, with Soda’s clip sparking the discussion.  Read OP’s post as well, instead of telling me to watch the video.
---
I see you finally ran out popular questions from Reddit to list as problems and gave up, its fine.
---
As someone whose played Classic for the last decade, it’s a shame you’ve made such a popular thread that had so much potential to extrapolate the social system that streaming introduces to Classic WoW and instead you chose the angle of acting like the cool kid who is gonna be the outsider and roll on a server that is probably going to have thousands of streamers on it anyway and you’ll just stew in anger as you can’t get away from it.
---
You have fun too pal.
---
Can you still opt in to world pvp at places like tarren mill as an example or is there no pvp outside of bgs?
---
Tailoring is virtually required for any new Raiding cloth class as they have their version of BOP chest piece that really helps to start you off. https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18458/robe-of-the-void 
---
You don't have to, but most of the cloth wearers do it. Enchanting is good if you are going to raid a lot, You can DE gear you got upgrades for. Most of the crafting professions will have rep grinding to get some of the best patterns.
---
Preparation is really the key talent in almost every build that is primarily oriented for pvp. Pretty much all the other talents besides the minimum 21 in subtlety are flexible.
---
That is not to say there are not well defined "cookie cutter" specs, but all the other talents besides those used to get prep are arguably flex that ultimately gets decided by whatever the best weapon you can get your hands on is.
---
he doesnt need to broadcast his location to everyone. he does because he wants money, he doesnt deserve the anonymity that normal players get if he wants to continue to make money off of playing the game.
---
&gt; 2 weeks of otherwise worthless sub time = about $7.5
---
Just play Retail for 2 weeks, if you're already subbed. You'll either absolutely hate it and that will make you appreciate Vanilla more, or you'll like it and then it's not wasted anymore.
---
But he will mention Quake 10 times per hour while doing it
---
Pallys were great single target healers. They only weren't the primary healer because they lacked Priest's diversity (e.g. group heals, shields, HoTs, etc). But most raids would still have a handful for single target, buff spam, and group auras.   
---
They're pretty tough in PvP. You really had to hope most of their cooldowns weren't up to kill one, but while they were hard to kill, they likely couldn't pin you down or kill you either.
---
he also has healing abilities
---
sounds like a win/win to me
---
Fair enough, the casual part was banter but yeah nowadays something would probably happen since everyone can record everything.
---
Behavior
---
Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Yeah, thats why 2 million played it.
---
what a asshat, who watches this moron?
---
You refuse to see utility outside if a buff lol. Play the class to open your eyes or please don’t further push this hybrid toxic mindset.
---
The main issue pre-1.12 was unbalanced servers. 50/50 servers with high pops didn't wait too long for BGs, at least during "on-hours", but skewed pop servers were brutal. If Blizzard had an external system to enforce or at least promote balanced populations, I don't think they'd need cross-realm BGs. But that's a more difficult task than reimplementing an existing tech that was present in Vanilla 1.12, so 🤷‍♂️
---
Lol no? That place was always kicking off throughout every patch of vanilla.
---
The Poppin Effect.
---
&gt; xcept this post is about streamers and stream sniping in general
---
Not this discussion we're having though. You want to talk about treading water now? LOL Nice attempt and moving the goalposts bud, it's not going to work though.
---
We have literally been discussing nothing but soda and his black list this entire time.
---
Streamers impact the community in many negative ways. I'll be avoiding streamer servers at all costs.
---
Ooga gang!
---
mate you sound like a pve player. youre too soft for pvp because you whine, once you whine youre a carebear.  
---
 If you get ganked for hours, either logoff or ress sickness and play in another area.
---
He literally says he's fine with being ganked, specifically because he enjoys ganking himself. 
---
*He doesn't want to get streamsniped*, do you understand the difference?
---
I love how vague it is so Blizzard can just do what ever the fuck they want.
---
&gt;calls me wrong 
---
&gt;proceeds to not tell me why
---
You’ve baited another response, congrats. You’ll have to work for the next one though.
---
Asmongold is a VERY large streamer, it's quite possible that Twitch staff were watching and did it of their own volition. I don't know Asmongold at all, never watched him, but that sort of thing has happened in the past. Like I said, Twitch is horrible with ban consistency.
---
How so? If your forming a guild to ruin somebody else's experience that is griefing and targeted harassment. Why would high end guilds want to play with somebody that is immature and griefs?
---
it would never work, but makes sense to me
---
if you harass someone because they're a streamer, then be prepared to get harassed because they're a streamer
---
I think your argument is totally flawed. 
---
He has said before that he gets that he will get camped by people and not be able to play, he'd be pissed at the time but look back at it and laugh. If it's done without sniping that's just part of the game. 
---
His argument is against stream snipers which is a totally different issue. If you wanna pvp and camp each other that's one thing. Watching a person's stream to target them and stop any counterplay is totally different.
---
There must be some mental gymnastics going on as they also seem to think that the few dozen streamers take the spots from the thousands of 04-06 players.
---
God who cares? I hope game streaming culture blows over one day.
---
My thought process was just, "well Alliance races suck, ok Undead it is." I've been Undead since the day I started playing

Explicitly states that corpse camping and killing low level players on *PVP* servers will not be handled by game masters. Pvp solution on pvp servers.
---
As a question, why do you want to use daggers with hemo? Since hemo is based on your weapon damage.
---
Blizzard did it a couple of times during vanilla. I was on Alleria (PvE) and they allowed xfers off the server to Dalvengyr. Was the best move I ever made!!!
---
Legit the first time I played, was a human. Realized I made a mistake then rolled Undead. Every first time Horde member makes that mistake
---
I can hear it in my head.
---
I mean, they specifically mention the word griefing.
---
To me, it's open and shut. Kill the guy once or twice, fair game. Make a concerted effort to find his stream every time he's on just to kill him, targeted harassment. 
---
As a player, it's funny for a couple of kills. As a streamer, it's a complete waste of time after 5 minutes.
---
Not yet, I'll put it up tomorrow
---
yeah I've got no idea who is
---
It's more than just 'hardcore' vs 'casual'.  It's a different game entirely, and sure, if BFA was good it could probably retain those more interested in classic, but BFA is absolute garbage and vanilla is not.  I'm not certain but i'd bet many dollars quality will win over 'casual'ness in this case.
---
Better profession combo for what? Do you have time to run around and gather your own mats after you hit level 60? If you are planning to be a hardcore raider you may be the guild designated person in a particular profession so any rare patterns that drop during the raid would be yours to make money off. If you are super lazy you can go alchemy and sell your once a day transmutes.
---
Lol i remember having to take a dump midway through BRD so i booted up my laptop and brang it to the shitter so i didn't slow the group down Rofl!!
---
What? Thousands of players have gotten banned for player grieving...I don’t know what kind of evidence you expect me to show you of that for you to just straight up call me wrong after I show a source to something I said.
---
It's a nelf so it's Légõlàz
---
That post makes mention of War Mode, which is clearly not available on Classic.
---
Is that not the strat? I feel like that's what I remember my guild doing well into farm. But we were a bunch of idiots so it would make sense.
---
Worth a shot. Might want to mess around in the Arena first. I hear you can get a free Quest Skip Token there.
---
Yeah pretty much this.
---
Yeah I dunno what the fuck this dude was doing during the entirety of vanilla because once a place gets a reputation for being gank central it stays that way. Hillsbrad and STV were always busy as fuck.
---
I remember seeing a video of a mage paying Kungen like 100g so he can teleport him somewhere.
---
No, Sigil. I think we might have another couple of R14, but that was latter in Vanilla, when we were tying for #1 or #2 Alliance guild at the end of A'Q through Naxx. Just to double check my memory, I found [Ming's warcraftrealms history](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/606177).
---
Why is it griefing to single out a player in world PvP? Happens all the time to players who aren't streamers but have built up a reputation on their server. Seems to me like that's part of the experience of playing an MMORPG and making a name for yourself. If a streamer wants to not be corpse camped then they'll have to turn off their stream. That or they should just roll on a PvE server.
---
Lol.  
---
You can't be serious.
---
Imagine trying to get an advantage on a player by watching their every move on their stream because youre that bad.
---
I’ve mentioned other streamers as well and their ways of behaving, throughout this chain of comments, because this post is about Black listing in general. Funny how you pick up on this only just now. Talking about moving the goalpost. You do what you want, so it can fit your narrative.
---
Super schattig (super cute)
---
The official Bliz stance. (Or the 'latest', I guess. Since this could change..)
---
&gt; "...*we cannot enforce any ‘fair play’ policies if a user chooses to provide their opponent an advantage*. If someone in-game chooses to tell their opponent every move they’re making, thereby informing them how to counter it, we cannot conclude that any violation has taken place. Even if this could be considered a violation, we simply cannot micro-manage every streamed match to ensure the opponent was not looking at it, or using it to their advantage. It goes far beyond the scope of what we’re able to enforce. *It’s advisable for those streaming to take precautions, including delaying their streams by a significant amount of time, to avoid any potential advantage they may be providing their opponent.*"

Not true on multiple servers I played on. Tarren Mill was under attack multiple times a day by players, and it was fun. People often came from major cities on their mains for the fun.
---
Same with Crossroads. This was  shortly before TBC release.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that pvp situations call for pvp solutions. It’s been that way since the damn game launched.

*AGAIN*

Give us one definitive situation where someone was banned for corpse camping someone else on a pvp server.

I updated it this morning, I believe, but I want to say it was giving me trouble before that, yesterday evening.

I suppose this might be the impetus I need to finally reinstall Brave and see if it's gotten any better since I tried it a year or two back. I just hate to lose my addons.

Tbh the guy still is really shady. The first duel tourney he ever hosted, the prize pool was increased by a donation and he agreed to it live and never payed up. I asked him on his discord hey is this true and will you be paying up with the clip of him saying he would. He said he would and then immediatley perma banning me. In the end he did not pay out the full amount.
---
Yeah because witch hunts are always a good thing...
---
I remember watching the episode of the screen savers the day both WoW and Half Life 2 came out. They were getting everyone to Westfall to try and crash the server.
---
Meh, a lot of streamers agree with his opinion. Stream sniping is lame as fuck.
---
Don't stream if you're PvPing. Done.
---
Ya, streamers that pull constant 1K-2K viewers usually do just fine, and have sub counts sometimes 3x their average viewers which would be about $3K a month just from subs. Not too bad tbh.
---
This dipshit Quin is suggesting Blizzard implement a system that tracks people when they're around streamers and if they're consistently around them ganking them, they get banned.
---
I don’t know how you can ask for evidence for something then link something from gamepedia to counter my source from the actual WoW website all at the same time ask me for proof from private records at Blizzard HQ as to why they banned certain players for what...
---
Try again.

Is this the new version of calling everyone a hacker?
---
Scholomance gets my vote.
---
&gt;I’ve mentioned other streamers as well
---
You mentioned Asmongold and Efand ONCE after like 15 comments into this discussion.
---
And it still changes nothing.
---
You have no evidence that the black list will be a problem other than "they get salty when they get ganked" as if that is unusual behavior lol
---
&gt;Streamers did nothing to build the classic wow movement
---
You're so incredibly wrong. If streamers didn't care about classic and blizzard didn't expect streamers to come back to it, blizzard never would have even bothered with classic.
---
People still hve the raid or die mentality stuck in them from retail.
---
It really bugged me that all the goblins made golems. I never saw anyone else complain about it either, thought just maybe I was crazy.
---
Have fun getting 1000 death threats from a streamers fans
---
I love how good Holy Pally is at both not dying and making other people not die.
---
Asmongold called what Soda said a great idea on his stream today.
---
"Oh look hes leveling in the shimmer flats" so you go to the shimmering flats
---
I'm out of the loop, what is this refreshing thing about this subreddit?
---
Fully talented Drain life has 70% resist against spell casting push back (a huge thing in Vanilla), you get health in exchange for mana, which you can trade back into mana (life tap) or use dark pact if you want to keep the health, and you get a chance at nightfall proc. Works for leveling without a proper blueberry tank.
---
If someone has a dedicated stream sniper guild, I'm down.
---
Hey man nothing beats healing in a raid setting, it’s so great. I would lean towards priest from personal preference, but maybe I’ll try something new.
---
Your comment doesn't fit this thread's narrative. I'm sorry, but we'll have to downvote you.
---
I'm not saying something won't happen now because I have no idea what they'll do but it wasn't a lack of proof that prevented them from banning me before.  I'd actively be camping some dude while the gm talked to me about it.  I always said the same shit we're at war I'm just protecting my horde family from a violent intruder in our lands whatever roleplaying bs felt right.
---
utility in raid setting is a joke. Just be a healer and youd bring just as much utility and less of an anchor
---
This is not true, because I did it in classic.
---
He’s not wrong but a lil too angry
---
Lol this guy is really stupid. I personally dont watch streams but him complaining about this makes me want to stream snipe him.... this could be just that a ploy to get more viewers, but really dumb nonetheless.
---
Blacklisting isn't a blizzard thing, it was very mich present in vanilla and TBC
---
Trading nearly 1% crit on melee and ranged attacks for 16 more damage on melee attacks only just doesn't seem like it would ever be worth it.
---
You're grasping at straws. The policy *explicitly condones* the behavior you're saying is not allowed.
---
He said some dumb shit yeah but on the other hand I feel like people who take the time to stream snipe are massive losers. So I don't really care either way.
---
You are trying too hard, dumbass.
---
I knew it wouldn't even take the game being released yet before streamers were whining for special privileges.
---
You're lame af if you actively stream snipe
---
I don't think corpse camping is a reportable offense.
---
Could I be convinced that intentionally logging on to someone's stream to find out where they are and then kill them repeatedly is targeted harassment? Wouldn't take much of an argument.
---
I feel like Warcraft 3 should release like, one month before Classic WoW. It's the perfect lead-in for the lore of Vanilla.
---
First thought: Golden rule.  
---
Second thought: ...must...kill...opposite...faction!!!  
---
Third thought: ...who was that???  
---
Fourth thought: ...should I camp?  
---
Fifth thought: ...nah, not unless he camps first  
---
\[General 1\] Noobtard: OMG WHY IS SODA CAMPING ME  
---
Final thought: \*pitches tent, builds fire, breaks out fishing pole\* It's time for some CAMPING!!!   &gt;: )
---
WoW classic wouldn't exist without streamers to advertise it. Blizzard  doesn't give a fuck about the .00000001% of WoW players who also played Nostalrius.
---
😂🥴
---
I suppose I should also ask, how hard do you think it would be to level as holy? Solo questing that is.
---
Yeah true. Took down ony with &lt;40 all druids back in the day.
---
If there's an actual strategy that doesn't involve 6 tanks lining up for sacrifice, we never found it. We found a way that worked consistently and stuck with it.
---
Can't make opposite faction alts on PvP servers
---
Launch servers were split equally between Frankfurt and Paris. It's still Blizzard EU's main locations AFAIK.
---
Whenever I play something I do my research and try to find and choose the best class, best gun etc. In those days, paladins felt like justice bringers to me. They seemed like cool heroes who would do the right thing. I didn't know which class was the best dmg dealer, best healer. Kind of roleplaying I guess but yeah little me thought Alliance must be the good guys and paladins were so damn cool. I kinda lost this feeling and competetiveness got the better of me, except maybe in singleplayer games.
---
As some people mentioned https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154/truefaith-vestments
---
forces you to go tailoring as the item is BOP so can only be worn by the one who makes it. If you plan to raid hardcore and will fight for the guild enchanter position, enchanting can get you good easy gold since you will have some of the strongest enchants. If you are more casual alchemy will give you a once a day transmute you can sell for doing nothing.
---
Thankfully, when it comes to having actual clout with Blizzard’s decisions regarding classic, Soda is about as influential as some random guy outside their HQ with a cardboard sign.
---
Stream snipers of the world unite!
---
I don't remember the exact cost but its relatively cheap like 10g I think and then you need 10 people to sign your charter and that's it. 
---
Someone correct me if it was different in earlier vanilla i started midway through but I think this is right.
---
I believe you just need people to sign a charter and some gold and you’re all set. They’ll definitely be some fun more casual meme guilds around.
---
You linked me the exact same article I linked you, what you’re not understanding is that these rules are broad for a reason and if a player is truly being detrimental to the experience of another player then they will get banned for it and Blizzard has banned people, these rules can be bent by Blizzard however they see fit and there’s nothing anyone will be able to do about it because they are a private company.
---
I had these and saved them for the longest time. First time I got drunk on vodka me and my friends ran out of chasers so we used these....
---
I loved classic but I also loved arenas. I’m going to miss 2’s and 3’s.
---
Yeah red knight... real cool...
---
Nah I am serious. Bitchpoppin can stream and get ganked all day or he can turn the stream off, make less money, and play the game like a regular human
---
Fear Ward and bleed cleanse incoming! Great choice btw
---
There was no blacklist for ganking.
---
If I was an Alliance gm and some Horde made a trial acct lvl 1 to cry that a guildies was camping him and to gkick him...you think I should do it?
---
Naw, I would screenshot that and put it on the forums to mock him
---
Fine difference with just ganking and camping. Stream sniping is a real issue and it provides literally no benefit to anyone other than making someone want to not stream the game.
---
The argument that it's a PvP server, sure. Ganking is fine. But when it's 5 people on a deathwatch camping a guy, I think it falls under griefing honestly. Same shit if some max level would kill lowbies over and over and over again. It's pathetic. They're doing it out of pure spite, it serves no real benefit, wastes EVERYONES time and is just downright sad.
---
Ganking is fine, intentionally going out of your way to fuck with someone repeatedly is not.
---
"Just roll a PvE toon"
---
Then comes the people who snipe and tag every mob, or kill quest givers etc etc. If that falls under griefing, then stream sniping for literally no purpose other than "DURRR I KILL SODA XDDD" falls under it too.
---
Yeah I just don’t really get this. I mean fucking with people in pvp is kind of what I remember being so much fun about vanilla, but they’re making it easier by broadcasting their loc.  This shit makes me feel so old I don’t know why anyone would watch someone else play....?
---
&gt; Because on these realms all of Europe can play and understand the game/each other.
---
It's not « all of Europe » if you cut all the biggest cultures/nations out (France, Germany, Russia).
---
This has been a thing ever since streaming inception back in the day.
---
Starcraft 2 didn't really have this problem, as mechanical skill was very important. It was a problem, but not a huge one.
---
League of Legends has had this problem forever, Hearthstone, ect.
---
But most streamers (and Soda should really know this for streaming for so long) understand that this is the price they pay for earning a ton of money for playing video games online. Especially when you are as large as Sodapoppin. 
---
If something like this is actually annoying him, perhaps he should look into a plan to see how much money he needs to make, invest to never work again the rest of his life, then he can choose exactly if he wants to stream or not, and what he wants to stream. Kinda like Reckful, the dude just boots up his stream whenever the fuck he feels like it.
---
This is awesome.  Good work!
---
Stream sniping? What the fuck?
---
I'm tired of these streamers getting special treatment and being treated like their content is anything else than their own third party business. If Blizz ends up banning people because they allegedly ruined some third party content by simply playing the game, they are heading down a dangerous road...
---
Fair a lass imo
---
I'm just saying the expectations some people have have changed over the years. Not saying LFG or Gearscore was a thing that far back.
---
The dude is actually delusional, lol. I'm quite literally the biggest asshole in my friend group and I wouldn't even camp people for hours, maybe a few minutes but HOURS? No. The fact that he can't get how fucking braindead he is being tells me he severely lacks certain social skills.
---
&gt;&gt; You do realise that's not actually an insult right?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Saying you lack the ability to attract, form meaningful relationships, or even remotely trusting relationships with women is an insult.  
---
You have no idea what I look like and what my relationships have been like so trying to insult me based on them is just lame.
---
It would be the same as me laughing at you for not being able to dunk. I have no idea how tall you are or if you can jump or of you've ever even seen a basketball but haha you can't dunk you need. 
---
&gt;&gt; You can't think of a counter to my argument about streamers over acting badly so you pretend that you have sex with women and say that I don't.
---
&gt;Oh, streamers do tend to overact.  But this didn't appear to be an example.  If I'd gotten an epic off a random cheetah, I'd be pretty excited too.  I'm assuming you're just butt hurt because you didn't get beta access and you're upset about "streamer privilege".  That fact that would make you made lends me to think you're a certain kind of person.
---
I'm not "butt hurt" I just made a simple statement explaining why I don't like streamers and you've exaggerated probably assuming I'm acting like a streamer.
---
&gt;&gt; (Note that I'm only assuming that you're pretending that you have sex because I haven't heard anyone older than about 16 talk like that)
---
&gt;I mean, most people tend to not get butthurt about 15 year old videogames or people enjoying them.
---
Again. Not butt hurt, I'm not sure where you got that idea from. 
---
&gt;&gt; I guess you win.
---
&gt;I "won" the moment you first posted whining because somebody was enjoying a game that you couldn't.
---
I didn't whine and didn't complain that they were playing a game I can't. I simple stating that I don't like the over acting. You're the one inferring things that didn't happen.
---
And your counter point at best is “everybody gets annoyed, so what’s the problem?” Acting as if we’ve never seen what someone brigading viewers can do, in online games or forums.
---
There’s a difference between the guy not streaming going apeshit on you for ganking him and Soda getting annoyed to the point where he could be putting people on the list over nothing.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxoozb/streamers_wanting_blacklists_new_tos_against/eq8rmb4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Just to keep in mind there is NO benefit from just having a guild, there is no % of gold, they don't level, no guild bank, no perks of any kind. Guilds are just in game Discord servers with chat only option. 
---
I would not be surprise if raids will just happen via discords and guilds will exist the same way.
---
Cross faction collusion is a big no no. It is one thing for someone to end up on a black list for ninja looting or stealing from the guild or something like that. It is completely different to end up on a list because you happened to kill a streamer a few times or camped a streamer.
---
Mostly just during the leveling process, when people forego talents that aren’t necessary in order to save for a mount and such.
---
Alliance just needs a guild called &lt;Stream Snipers&gt;.
---
That actually does sound pretty familiar.
---
To be fair, constantly camping somebody is pretty lame, sure ill camp a spawnpoint like nobodys fucking business. (world champion at spawn camping here), But going out of your way to just camp a specific person for an hour or so is kind of a  dick move.
---
For some reason, my favorite zone in all of WoW's history was Zangarmarsh. It just looked so purely alien compared to all of the other stuff that you get used to leading up until that point.
---
This.
---
Creating the Guild requires like 1g or so and 10 signatures. 
---
It does however cost like 10g to design a Guild Tabard.
---
Streamers should welcome stream sniping.  It could lead to some epic encounters than would increase views.
---
usually you end up paying ppl to sign the charter as well.
---
If that’s true that’s actually a pretty interesting story, however I feel as if another trollgodx came around during classic blizzard would ban him and nobody would really care at the end of the day, PvP will probably be off limits though.
---
UBRS is 10 Man
---
AQ 20 and ZG were 20 man raids.
---
Literally the only thing preventing me form being horde is the fact that my favorite horde race (orcs) couldn't be mages. I tried rolling a troll mage but I hate the way they talk and couldn't stand reading their quest text.
---
I killed asmond at the end of his stream tonight for the third time this week. None of those times did I have his stream open. 
---
It's a pvp server, shit happens
---
I think the guild ledger is 10 silver, hard part is getting signatures.
---
But he will melt faces in PvP.
---
The 10g is to design the guild tabard, making the guild is way cheaper
---
I don't have the time to be competitive. Even if I did, I wouldn't want to, I'd level alts instead. 
---
If I wanted to be competitive, I'd play retail, where the difficulty ceiling is higher and therefore more rewarding.
---
Even so, vanilla isn't about being competitive (unless you find speedrunning fun), the raids are already known and figured out.. and PvP isn't ranked.
---
You do realize that a lot of these streamers happen to also be some of the best players in the game's history, right?  I'll be shocked if most world/server firsts aren't done by streamers.
---
What is this sub's obsession with bashing streamers to make themselves feel special?
---
I want to know where Blizzard has banned people in response to something they declare a valid tactic. If they didn't ban *Angwe* of all people, I'm not expecting them to act as personal agents of Sodapoppin when he gets camped.
---
What to play!!!! It’s taking months just to think of what class and race to play.. 
---
who are you playing
---
&gt; And your counter point at best and it not being a problem, is “everybody gets annoyed, so what’s the problem?” 
---
No, my counter point is that everyone gets annoyed while being ganked. You are paiting their annoyed reaction as some anamolgy and irrational response that will result in them black listing people unjustly. When in reality, all they're doing is reacting how literally any person getting ganked reacts.
---
I thought the best looking gear was paladin's tier 2 judgement set. I've always dreamed myself getting it but never did. I tried to farm some raids in new expansions for transmogs but couldn't complete the full set. That's why I might roll paladin just to achieve that once and for all but probably as an alt. Still haven't decided, got few months to make my mind though.
---
It's pretty obvious that he's talking about people blatantly harassing him. I played vanilla. I was camped it times. Sometimes by huge groups. Yet, it doesn't even compare in any way to the experience of a popular streamer. 
---
People act like streamers are such a cancer but yet want Blizzard to add to classic, retail, etc.
---
That shit takes money and anyone with a brain should be able to understand streamers roles in that..
---
I wish I was that hunter
---
Getting ganked sometimes is different than getting buttblasted by people every time you take a step.
---
I don't know how much soda has gotten sniped, but as someone who got camped on a private server in tanaris for a week by 4 different people who were doing literally nothing but killing the hub and players - I understand.
---
Paladins do amazing single target heals, they cannot be CC'ed and they are as tanky as well tanks.
---
Yes they are as good as you remember.
---
Haha that's probably it. Looks cool though :)
---
can we just get the streamers all on one server so that I can avoid their pointless drama?
---
I remember Niar’s PvP movie(s)!
---
This. the whole point of alliance vs horde is not knowing where the fuck they are.
---
I do believe making a guild is 19 Silver + 10 Signatures from players.
---
You get used to it. Me understand now.
---
lmao
---
Big name Streamers chose to dungeon grind because of the hate culture towards them. For some reason ppl want their 15 min a fame, they do anything to get on TV.
---
only reason for me to play on a server with a streamer is to grief em honestly
---
Gonna suck having to reroll when I find out one of these retard streamers is on the realm I chose.
---
i dont like ninja and thought it was retarded when he was trying to get stream snipers banned. i do like soda and now think its retarded that he is trying to get stream snipers banned.
---
I was all in for the nostalgic classic experience, but after hearing this entitled prick, my entire meta has changed. My purpose in playing classic will be to fuck over soda and any other streamer that gets too big for their britches. As soon as he started talking about a blacklist, I thought that I wanted nothing more than to be on it. Sign me up for The Blacklist. I take it we going Alliance then....
---
If you don't like getting sniped turn off the stream...
---
Or can't he live without people watching him.
---
The fucking lowkey burn here is brilliant. Props
---
Except you being annoyed doesn’t put people on a list exposed to thousands of people, arguably a hefty amount playing on that exact server.
---
Pure hell. If you had a pocket DPS or tank, you definitely can, but as solo killing stuff will take an absolute eternity and I'd not recommend it. Keep in mind off specs can heal 5 mans during leveling just fine.   
---
Have you seen this video?   
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BPATSVpRg
---
Spoken like a true wrath baby.
---
I've been to Berlin once so maybe I shod play on German server
---
Lmao the logic of a streamer rolling on a pvp server and then calling out stream snipers
---
There are such things as PvE servers Soda you fucking donut
---
Yeah idk how I feel about griefing like that.  Anyone I'm camping can fight back or get help and many have, a lot of people I camp eventually call friends and get to camp me then I call friends and a lot of camping turns into fairly large skirmishes but you can't stop a level 1 from being an asshole so it's a bit different.
---
Yeah wish I could get all my screenshots back. This print is probably one of the few old things I keep to this day.
---
&gt; Except you being annoyed doesn’t put people on a list
---
Them being annoyed doesn't either.
---
Oh man yeah that place is definitely one of the best of all time. I always made it a point to do every available quest in that zone because I liked it so much. Same with nagrand.
---
Honestly the only reason I vividly remember this is because of how fucking scared I would get every time i’d land a crucial sap and see an auto attack number at the same time.
---
That will never work, classic wow players can recognize a zone immediately. Once they find what server he's on that's that.
---
With the exception of Swifty, there's not many streamers that are "The best players in the games history" or I remember from Vanilla having a name for themselves.
---
Even Swifty isn't that good compared to other players out there that aren't streamers but still create guides or lurk in Discords.
---
If you're going to be shocked that world/server firsts aren't done by streamers then prepare to be shocked.
---
You underestimate the pettyness of people. It's not about getting a reaction, it's about "me kill soda haha!" If he were stone faced and didn't react at all, people would STILL kill him non-stop.
---
"Like true bitchboys" what do you mean by that? How are they bitchboys if they don't find corpserunning every 20 minutes funny?
---
Either he had a gaming mouse with the f keys bound or he played wow like a pipe organist.
---
This is still one of my favorite questlines that they added in the Cata overhaul. It is honestly so pure.
---
Notice that I said cats can pull 550-600 dps, 700 if you're really nuts... keep in mind that's an average across the entire instance, in a raid where all melee tend to fall off a little bit simply because there are mechanics that cause them to have to interrupt their damage rotation, so the top end for a kitty doing an average 500 dps will still be higher. But the average is very close to what I was saying. Yes, they're about 300 behind BIS rogues and 400 behind BIS warriors on average. This is what I would expect. They're not meant to be the best, just more than viable.
---
How so?
---
Could very well result in that. You’re talking about everybody getting annoyed, but you think streamers are immune to doing stupid shit in the heat of the moment?
---
Twitch ToS
---
Sorry no :( i don't think I followed the scene at all but afterall I have a horrible memory.
---
I first got clued in because multiple forum posts anywhere from 06 to 2017 said so - neretzek the blood drinker axe has a lifesteal proc and several people said those procs werent nerfed to 0% coefficient until after vanilla. A couple of people claimed they used some of those weapons into wotlk because they scaled so ridiculously well.
---
I tested it on PVP henhouse recently and I found that the life drain proc on those sort of weapons did scale 1:1 with spellpower, but lifestealing enchant did not, nor did procs like fireballs similar to sulfuras. The life drain weapons also appeared to scale with shadow damage debuffs like from warlocks. Shadow oil did not scale with spell power on that server.
---
That being said - I didn't try paladin, but trying shaman with different permutations of frostbrand, flametongue, shadow oil, life drain weapons, crowd pummeler, normal caster weapons, even hand of Edward the odd etc. With about t2 level gear, I didn't consistently break 300 dps on a level 63 dummy, and went OOM quite quickly (ele/enhance hybrid melee spec with shocks, chain lightning on Hand of Edward procs). The damage was pretty high in streaks, 600+, but the average quite bad.
---
This all being said, take with salt, because private servers != Classic, and many private servers are different from each other anyway so YMMV
---
Am I the only one who doesn't give a fuck? WoW PvP servers are left to the community to govern. Like it or not, streamers have a lot of power within that community. If you streamsnipe them just to try to grief them, they're gonna use that power against you.
---
This won't matter as the vast majority of players arent spergs trying to get their 15 minutes of fame on someone's twitch channel, but if the possibility of being held accountable for being a speg really bothers you, just play on a different server as them.
---
Probably along the lines of some of the top streamers saying that creating a social blacklist addons for people who stream snipe is a good idea.  
---
Imagine being a public figure and whining and crying when someone criticizes you.  Oh wait, are you Carlos Maza?
---
Streamers REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I mean yeah, he never hit rank 14 and he back peddles in his old videos.
---
I wonder how high level you can get in two weeks. I haven't seen the world after Cata hit, so it would be interesting to see what's changed.
---
Try to optimize cat form dps on a druid. If you can do that you will be literally unstoppable
---
I mean most of them aren't really known for PvE so I'm not sure why they would be pushing the world firsts, a few of them might be. They're going to be insane in PvP and do fine in PvE but there are always bigger PvE autists out there than arena players.
---
How does Sodapoppin know that someone is stream sniping him, and not simply ganking him out of coincidence, or found him by searching for his location on the server?
---
But bro it’s “fair and balanced” he’s “broadcasting his position so it’s his *fault* !”
---
Sometimes I like to look at the post history of the people who make comments like that and it just makes complete sense after you see it.
---
If you don't want to play with the streamers don't play on the server they play how is that hard?   
---
If you are a retard sperg on either side and want to give free stuff to streamers or want to try and disrupt what they are doing 24/7 then go ahead but don't go all REEEEEEE when your experience is ruined.
---
My first two toons will be a Gnome Rogue and a Human Warlock. Beyond that I'd like to do a Dwarf Warrior and a Dwarf Hunter and name them as brothers.
---
Haha thank you!
---
Found the stream sniper.
---
I just want a funny guildtag under my name to be honest. How early could you reasonably set one up? I have a friend or 2 intending to play classic.  Im getting different answers here tho lol, 1 gold 10 silver 10 gold.
---
Paladins are the second best Healers in the game behind priests. Paladins are the  Best tank Healers in classic.
---
Damn I was hoping for some casual Angwe
---
Report normal behavior?
---
&gt;but you think streamers are immune to doing stupid shit in the heat of the moment?
---
So we should never implement any kind of punishment because it could be abused?
---
That's your argument?
---
Sinister Strike
---
Eviscrate
---
Ambush
---
Ignore everything else.
---
That's because they're high profile zones. The giant 50+ vs 50+ pvp battles stopped existing after battlegrounds.
---
Battlegrounds didn't kill WPVP--they specifically killed Southshore vs Tarren Mill (and "honour farm groups" / pvp kill teams)
---
What a load of bullcrap. If I will perma gank him, he will bitch that I am stream sniping him 24/7
---
I love Soda. He is just a cry baby. 
---
Him saying stuff like that is no different than Ninja bitching about stream snipers. 
---
But blizzard has a much better head on them as far as that aspect goes compared to epic. 
---
So regardless of what he says I doubt anything will come of it.
---
no it isnt
---
Lmao what an entitled asshole.
---
Was legit wondering how far I’d have to scroll to find this lol. Logged on a couple of years ago and it’s a ghost town now :(
---
As someone who was a fan, this is rediculous and gives streamers a bad name. I stream dead by daylight, and you know what i do when someone snipes? I laugh it off, because if your going to advertise to the world that your playing a game, you better expect some people to take advantage...
---
His response is especially terrible because there are a plethora of options available to him, and instead hes asking for everyone to bend to his will of suffer the consequences
---
There’s also tons of post relating to the same streamer crap over and over
---
I've heard streamers say it's a job and others say it's not. It's even a self deprecating joke among some streamers. If it's even up for debate I'm going to guess it's not really a job.
---
I agree that telling everyone where you are on a pvp server and then being mad when you get ganked is stupidity at it's finest. 
---
But the thing is, people won't even need to stream snipe in WoW to find big named players. If someone said in guild chat "OMG (insert big name streamer) is in X zone right now!" a bunch of people will pile on a boat to go gank them. When you have guilds of players spread across the world someone is bound to run into them and will tell the rest of the guild,  who will in turn tell their friends, who will then tell THEIR guilds. And the next thing you know there's a raid group forming to go gank the streamer and all his friends. But I'm sure they'll still cry stream sniping and demand people get banned or blacklisted because pvp happened in a way that they don't want.  
---
The simple solution (and the solution available since day 1) is they don't play on a pvp server if you don't want pvp to happen at any and all times. Especially if their name is well known because people WILL tell everyone else when they see them and they WILL be a target. This is doubly true if he's corpse camping people because "i'm an asshole". I hate to break it to that guy, 90% of the people who roll on a pvp server are assholes and most of them don't care about a threat to be blacklisted for killing anyone who's name is in red.  And even if people did get blacklisted for it, look at Serenity Now. Do you think those people were afraid of being blacklisted? Heck no, they crashed an actual funeral. People like that aren't going to be respectful of someone's stream or care about "being blacklisted" because they're already in an entire guild of people on board for thing like that. Like, does this guy not get what he's getting into or the kind of people he's dealing with on a these servers?
---
I'm pretty surprised that I kept this. Feelings couldn't let me throw this one away I guess. Im glad I didn't.
---
Oh snap
---
Ah yes I remember this. Aeothegreat on Silvermoon, everyone hated you.
---
BC is closer to retail than historically than vanilla.
---
I remember as soon as BC came out I missed vanilla.
---
It won't change.
---
&gt;Play on a PVE server
---
Or 
---
&gt; Switch Character
---
The best way to handle this is to ignore it and move on, if you’re angry then stop watching him and don’t start controversy that gets him views.
---
Godspeed brother!
---
People have done this to him during beta and he hasn't called them stream snipers. The only time he does is when there's like 20 people that show up on top of his corpse being super blatant about it.
---
Servers will be announced weeks in advance, probably even before the pre-launch character creation period. Pretty sure this is confirmed. I have no reason to believe that the big streamers would hide what server they’re all going to play on.
---
What are prot paladins good at that makes them better then enhance or boomkin?
---
&gt; And if someone camps a person for 5 hours, then it doesn't actually matter if they're stream sniping or not. They deserve to be on the list regardless.
---
At what point do they deserve to be on the list though? After how long? Is 5 hours the minimum or is 1 hour enough? 30 mins? We'll need some clear rules. I'm not one to camp for long myself, I might kill them a few times if they attacked me unfairly (low hp and in combat) or I might kill them a bunch of times extra if they camped me, but this blacklisting thing for pvp seems like a slippery slope to me.
---
I'm curious though if being camped for hours on end is long enough for a GM to intervene. It might be considered harassment at some point. I can't recall ever calling a GM for help in vanilla because I was being camped, but it's been a while of course.
---
Soda said himself in the video that he camps people too when he's not streaming, so does that mean Soda should be blacklisted himself? Or is he exempt from his own list.
---
So I don't think Soda would agree with you here that they should be blacklisted for camping. It's specifically about streamsniping for him, and imo it has to be obvious sniping, like if he's stealthed in a bush in the middle of nowhere and someone manages to find him.
---
If someone is in the same zone as Soda and runs into Soda 10 times, and kills Soda everytime, would Soda think that's streamsniping? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe his mood plays a factor. That'd suck for the person who was simply pvping but hey you're blacklisted now, sucks to be you.
---
But I doubt any of this matters because it seems unrealistic, it would need the support of the vast majority of the players on the server or it wouldn't work. Most people won't care that much about streamers that's why I don't think it'll happen. A blacklist for scammers  / ninjalooters seems more plausible, those people affect everyone.
---
This is what makes WoW well WoW part of the fun of a pvp server is ganking and being ganked. If he doesnt want to be ganked, he needs to play a PvE server
---
I mean, fuck streamers in general amiright?
---
On high pop it’s shit for $
---
No it's very obvious when there is a stream sniper. You can be in stealth and they turn back and aoe right at you. He gets killed a good bit normally and is fine with that. It could be abused by others though for sure.
---
And if a streamer starts corpse camping like soda admitted to doing in that video, then what? It's funny?
---
if stream snipers get blacklisted, which apparently means they won't raid or do anything else, then guess what they'll have plenty of time for ;)
---
Undoubtedly you will have moments of intense frustration, but you will also have moments of undeniable fun when you dish out some pain to the other factions dudes you run across.
---
Yo this ain’t it cause oberyn is one of the best characters in anything ever, and bfa has always been garbage lol.
---
That sounds groundbreaking for bear tanking! Would it be something like this?:  
---
/cancelform /use major healing potion /cast dire bear form
---
What do people get out of trolling/ sniping/killing streamers?
---
That's the joke.
---
How I would do this:  
---
I'm assuming there is absolutely no "main" in this scenario and you will be focusing on warlock and paladin at a 50% split. If this is untrue by even a single %, then you automatically pair up the highest "mained" character with the mage and get to 60.  
---
If 50/50 is true:  
---
Ret / mage to 60. Use ret as your leader and use the mage to constantly cast frost bolts. Use righteous fury to keep agro on your paladin. If frost bolt runs out, switch to wand. You can spec wand on the mage if you want, it's up to you (I would) and avoid spending too much time drinking on the mage.  
---
Warlock voidwalker has proven to be pretty bad threat on the beta (compared to private servers), but you should still consider your warlock to be a high tier leveler. Much faster than your paladin would be alone. Of course use your mage to create portals/food and finish impossible-to-solo quests.  
---
Feed gear, enchants, etc.  
---
Every 10 days, consider grinding out the rested experience on your warlock, but if level 60 is an extreme priority, then ignore that advice.
---
&gt; I wonder how high level you can get in two weeks.
---
You can get max level in any WoW time period in 2 weeks.
---
Vanilla took me 7 days ( ish ) of /played time. Obviously that's a lot of no lifing, but it's doable in 14 days. And you can do it in 5-6 days with a good guide and if you don't waste time.
---
As for Retail, let me pull some stats. I had heirlooms for all of those, and on some I used XP potions.
---
**My Troll Paladin ( 120 )** has 3 days 23 hours 34 minutes, out of which 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes at lvl 120.
---
I'm pretty sure I RPed/AFKed on him, but that's roughly **2 days 18 h ours to get to lvl 120.**
---
**My Mag'har Warrior ( lvl 110 )** has 4 days 6 hours 25 min, out of which 16 hours 56 minutes at lvl 110. That's... actually kinda crazy, it was one damn slow leveling it seems.
---
**My Tauren Monk ( lvl 100 )** has 1 day 22 hours, 6 hours 20 minutes at lvl 100, so about 1 day 16 hours to get to lvl 100. ( I probably RPed on him quite a bit so I'd lower that to 1 day 10 hours ).
---
But yeah you can hit max level in 2 weeks for sure.
---
Back in the day GMs didn’t stop players from corpse camping for hours or a player slaughtering tons of booty bay npcs and argent dawn npcs. I doubt blizz gives a fuck.
---
Horde or alliance. I played alliance, I think gear looks better on Nelf and Human.  
---
In retail I’ve been playing horde with my guild for 3 years and they will be rolling horde in classic. I like them and definitely want to play with them still but I feel like I will regret playing horde especially if they quit.
---
Soda and a lot of people he played with were top parsing mythic raiders in addition to being R1s. Counting them out of world firsts is pretty foolish.
---
It being abused or used in the heat of the moment by streamers with thousands of viewers, is worse than how much it’s going to help people, is my opinion.
---
Doesn't help that they (and other streamers) are saying they're going to hide what server they roll on when making a character. So you either need to take a shot in the dark and accidentally roll the same server, or you need to not join on release day and hope others can triangulate their server location later.
---
From the patch archives guilds were added in 0.6 and here is the full description
---
Guild System: Edit
---
Guild creation is now in the game as intended, and here is how it works:
---
Find a Guildmaster NPC in any of the major cities.
---
Acquire a Guild Charter from the Guildmaster
---
Add 9 other people to the Guild Charter
---
Return the Guild Charter to any Guildmaster.
---
You have a guild!
---
I also found an item https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5863/guild-charter 
---
as per very first highly rated comment you can see the actual price is 30 silver and can be obtained from any major city.
---
I did not see any level requirements. 
---
Good luck
---
&gt;Top players aren't going to roll on the same servers as streamers
---
This type of comment is where you lose all your credibility. Good players aren't afraid of a streamer. There isn't any reason to make your choice of server based on where a streamer plays. Top players would know this. Where are you getting your info from? It looks pretty made up.
---
People here who want to play WoW classic are so starved and frustrated they just sit in this subreddit and spam refresh to see if there is any new posts.
---
Man, I hate how people keep complaining about things...
---
I know, I'll complain about it!
---
If people complaining about streamers bothers you just don't read the posts ;)
---
/r/woosh
---
I hope that prepared guy comes back. I was on kil jaeden in cata and mop. Joined the server for the notorious world pvp they had. They had a guild named ruinois that just non stop like 3 guilds deep sat in horse serve. I joined horde with some friends. We countered them. Then that guy multiboxed 40 chars on alliance and all shit got crazy. That guy should just stream camp people in vanilla.
---
HWL Akal and I used to camp darkshire.  I was suspended for a few days for refusing to leave when a GM asked me.
---
&gt; If I wanted to be competitive, I'd play retail, where the difficulty ceiling is higher
---
I'm a cutting edge player and I'm telling you most of my guild would have more pulls on the Rhok'delar demons for the Hunter questline in Vanilla than we had on Jaina.
---
''The Blacklist'' World first naxx guild, and when we farm for materials we also streamsnipe/gank. I  am from the EU but I will create a rogue on the US realms so I can join this best guild in the world. Down with the qq streamers.
---
World PvP and camping has always been a part of the game. Stream sniping is cheating no matter who it affects.
---
You guys obviously didn’t watch the entire stream and are nitpicking. He mentions he only wants people who camp for hours upon hours upon hours to get punishment. Wouldn’t anyone?
---
Thanks to his attitude, grimmmz isn't--nor will he ever be--as successful as his peers. Don't get me wrong, he's got great muscle memory but really blew an opportunity if you ask me. He's whined so much in the public eye its kind of embarrassing lol. Also I really don't know if 1600 viewers is relevant considering he's passed his peak now, but good luck to the kid regardless
---
If i was a streamer i would make lobbies just for streamsnipers and put a bounty on my head. I'll even make a ranking for the snipers xD
---
That seems to be completely irrelevant to what he said, and he's right.
---
The vast majority of the people PUBG banned were actual streamsnipers.  They would queue and requeue over and over until they got in a game with the streamer and then go run straight at them.  
---
idc about people streamsniping in WoW but in a game like PUBG it's pretty shitty.
---
since you missed it the first time
---
&gt;Again, this is a completely pointless discussion because you are trying to predict the future. No reasonable discussion can be had on this topic. The criteria he laid out of the black list does not match "getting ganked a few times". He specifically laid out the kind of behavior that would warrant a black list and it is not "getting ganked a few times"
---
Operation babies blanket.
---
The big satisfaction and adrenaline you get from world pvp encounters, and the thrill of winning and the fight, are only so satisfying because there is someone on the receiving end who could very well be you. Without the frustration there'd be no value.
---
See, this is where I draw the line. Every one of those people who actively did this should absolutely be banned, that is the literal definition of griefing someone. 
---
Just because someone streams doesn’t mean they’re immediately open to that behavior. There’s a pretty clear line where someone is either sniping with malicious intent, or just passing through, and the malicious ones should be punished. 
---
Most, if not all, people that complain about streamers whining over snipers are always just jealous little shitbags. That’s exactly why they go with the “JuSt DoNt StREaM It DeN!” Or something about money.
---
Boi what
---
i hope to avoid streamers, not much else to be said about that
---
Some of my best memories come from shooting the shit while waiting for other party members after a wipe.
---
This guy is a tool. Is anyone surprised?
---
It's just name my friend made it up for me around 2004-2005 i think. We were playing on a unofficial private server actually and I was an elf, he told me that it was a good elf name lol. I think every language pronounce it differently and I can't really correct them because it's not in any language but I googled the name years ago and some Iranian names popped out, I think.
---
Or you can just not give a fuck about who they are and live your life like they don't exist.  I don't know who the fuck those losers are and I'm fine and don't give a shit about what server I end up on.
---
If we can’t discuss the future we can’t discuss anything here. All of this haven’t been made yet. I’m taking the stance that a streamer is a normal person who can fuck up, and your response is ‘LOL assumptions’.
---
there were whole guilds in vanilla where they camped low lvl areas and killed everyone.  for hours.  before BGs existed.
---
I’m so tired of hearing streamers qq and blame stream sniping every time they lose
---
Classic problems require classic solutions.
---
Great addon. If possible I'd really like a version that could be quickly customized in game.
---
As shown a few posts up, corpse camping is allowed and is not punishable.
---
Seal fate daggers as a gnome rogue man with 5/8 nightslayer and vigor. It requires good gear but if you chug thistle tea you can seriously delete people.
---
Hmm interesting idea.
---
If that's what you're into. At this point I'm just too old and have too little free time to waste on that kind of thing.
---
I feel sorry for anyone who accidentally picks their server
---
I assume by 2.5 you mean... phase 2.5? Which is actually a fairly small window. BWL is phase 3. It’s not insane to have items from MC or particularly strong items from 5mans to last until then.
---
It’s the (very few) items that are absurdly strong well into AQ40 and Naxx. But it’s not as if every class has 5 or 5 such items. It’s like 1 maybe 2 depending on spec. The most egregious being Lionheart Helm for dps warriors.
---
I agree. In a perfect world every server would be 50/50 and everyone would queue all the time. The problem is many servers will slant and people will stop queuing. Some servers will just get left behind
---
By level 10 (which is about couple of hours of game play) their secret server will be no longer secret and even if, by some stroke of luck you end on that server, you can just reroll, two hours of leveling is nothing.
---
The problem is, he won't be able to tell the difference from Mr. Stabby Stabby rogue rolling up and ganking/camping him to a stream sniper Stabby McStabFace ganking/camping him.  He'll label them both the same.  
---
In other words, he'll take it personal and call out the person as a stream sniper, even when it's just some random ganker that out plays him.
---
Toxic mindset?  lol, Vanilla has been out for 15 years and theorycrafted to death, if your class can heal, you are a healer in vanilla raiding, it's pretty much that simple, there is zero point to rolling a class that we know is bad at dps to play dps in raids, the people who are planning to do that in classic are actually the toxic ones.  There is no excuse with what we know to be planning to raid in classic as a ret or boomkin or whatever, it just isn't a thing.  I just would never do something that I know is holding the other players back in a game where you rely on other people.
---
If people make blacklists it will be my goal to be on all of them.   No thanks mage I don't need your water I have a steady supply of pleb tears.
---
People in this thread are just too shitty to understand
---
But the timing becomes more forgiving; you don’t have to farm it yourself while you have tailoring, etc.
---
&gt; Trading nearly 1% crit on melee and ranged attacks for 16 more damage on melee attacks only just doesn't seem like it would ever be worth it.
---
I think it was 52 agi for 1% crit. Something with 2 digits and a 5.
---
Anyhow, Ashkandi comes earlier. I'm still not sure if Barb is better, and it will be unavailable for a lot of guilds, anyway.
---
The frothing at the mouth jealousy of this subreddit is what's getting out of hand.
---
Both Soda and Asmon talked about two things, banning players for intentional sustained griefing, this is already against tos and always has been. This doesn't include PvP camping, but rather stuff like a player of your faction constantly following you around instantly tagging all mobs around you for hours, a mage polymorphing mobs you're fighting to heal them up, standing on a mailbox or NPC with a mount to block the hitbox, etc.
---
And the other thing they talked about didn't involve Blizzard at all, but a community driven 'Blacklist' for people who excessively harass streamers. Since most streamers are planning on playing on the same server, and on both factions, they'd represent a large part of the servers community. So they'd make an out-of-game list which keeps track of players streamsniping on both factions, those players would be ignored/shut out by the all the streamers, their guilds and friends on the server, effectively making group content difficult.
---
This isn't any different from guilds or individuals that were known for being idiots back in the day, and were shunned by the rest of the server as a result.
---
And what Quin was talking about was retarded, but he's an idiot so.
---
I have no idea how many followers streamers have but its silly to assume even 2% would follow him to a server. But lets go with this hypothetical 800 additional accounts on a server. I doubt 800 max out or even play enough to make a difference. Your ignoring the group of players that want their fame for camping streamers. That is going to be a dedicated group that will weigh heavily against his "followers"
---
Warriors exist though
---
The issue isn’t playing with or encountering a streamer, that has no affect on most of us. It’s the people who groupie around the streamers and hang from their balls. Then, you encounter said group and get ganked or are unable to do any questing because their mobbing everything around them.
---
100% agree, most of the streamers would want to be on the same server for content purposes, so its not like you gonna have 50 serves and 49 of them will have a major streamer on it.
---
&gt;just merge the servers instead of allowing cross realm bgs LOL
---
idiot
---
This is such a pathetic post. The entire anti-streamer fanaticism is at least as bad if not worse than streamer entitlement.
---
There is so much wasted energy in this thread. It is beyond pathetic to focus your energy into hating other people that literally have 0 effect on your life.
---
If you don't want to be affected by streamers then don't play with them it's as simple as that. Roll on a server that doesn't have streamers. Anything beyond that is just a childish temper tantrum. 
---
I mean really creating an entire community to ruin other people's time is something you actually want to be a part of? What is the end game? It is beyond pathetic to want to ruin other people's experiences simply because you don't agree with their lifestyle.
---
The anti streamer fanaticism has just turned into a toxic sess pool that honestly deserves to be ostracized. The anti-streamer crowd is without a doubt the most toxic group of players that world of warcraft has ever seen and honestly classic would be better without them. 
---
If you don't like how someone is playing the game then don't play it with them. It's really as simple as that. Anyone trying to create some mob mentality against streamers just looks pathetic to anyone not in on the circle jerk. 
---
People that join this anti-streamer mob just look like salty cry babies that are mad because either they didn't get the beta they feel like they deserved or just upset about the entire dynamic of success and the perks that come with it. 
---
This is the most pathetic post that's ever been made on this sub. 
---
Let people play the game.
---
Yeah they definitely would. These things happened on PvP servers all the time. It spawned wars and it was glorious.
---
&gt; I’m taking the stance that a streamer is a normal person who can fuck up
---
Ya, he can. 
---
You know who can also fuck up? The justice system. I guess we should just let everyone run around shooting each other and raping each other because the justice system isn't absoultely perfect.
---
There is no satisfaction either way for me. Now that I'm in my 30s adrenaline just makes me feel sick - I avoid it in gaming. Staying tensed while gaming literally makes my body hurt after an hour or two.
---
Swifty is probably in the bottom half of wow streamers in terms of skill. Also classic wow was probably as much of a time sink as it was a test of skill. World firsts are gonna go to the best players who can dedicate their lives to a game and streamers make up a large portion of that demographic.
---
This has literally never happened.
---
You either hate streamers because
---
A) you're jealous
---
B) you didn't get a beta invite
---
Who is those guy?  Should I care?  Looks like he was sucking on his mama's titties when some of us were raiding MC....
---
I hope streamers go on one server and fuck off from ruining other people’s experience. I’m here to play this game cause I’m passionate about vanilla, not because I’m making money off of it, or because I wanna become an e-celeb.
---
That's fine, people who have more fun than frustration should play on pvp servers, and vice versa.
---
I just don't think that people should be looked down on for preferring pve servers.  I think that there are many people who would prefer the mechanics of a pve server but don't play on them because of the carebear reputation.
---
I've played mostly on pvp servers because my friends did, but for me personally there is no fun in it.  I will not explain why here as I'm not trying to convince people that one is better than the other.
---
better than not being involved at all, that's just being an empty husk.
---
Why is that? Cant they sign it and just leave the guild?
---
From the Classic WoW Beta:  
---
**Purchase a Guild Charter:** 10 Silver  
---
**Create a guild crest:** 10 Gold  
---
**Purchase an individual tabard:** 1 Gold
---
oh lordy, some kid who has no idea what he's talking about chiming in. lol.
---
Soda be like:
---
Etu Brutus
---
Shocked! Just shocked!
---
Who would have guessed that a streamers viewer count would go down once the game is released and we are actually playing it, instead of watching a closed beta.
---
Shocked I say! How did this 'anon' user ever figure out such a complex theory?
---
Streamers are a scourge on the authenticity of the classic experience and should they themselves be blacklisted.
---
Vanilla isn't some super hard game that only good vanilla players will be good at lol.  Most people didn't make a name for themselves in vanilla because streaming wasn't really a thing and making videos was more niche.  Top players like cdew will continue to be top players in classic they have the time skill and dedication to achieve whatever goals they want in classic.
---
If he keeps this up, he will be camped for months
---
rofl.
---
Look at his stream uptimes.
---
Look how many people watch him.
---
Reflect this on yourself.
---
Then look how Nick pays his rent (and how that happened)
---
Then watch why Ryan thinks Chance is stupid/silly.
---
If you still think he deserves less than anybody else, go somewhere outside of a big city, (e.g. between big grass fields) and take a walk in the sun.  
---
Everybody deserves the same.  
---
He's not evil. He's the opposite.  
---
You don't seem to realize what you are saying.
---
Those are very restrictive and while they might work if you only want to grind mobs, in many cases you'll want more utility skills for group play.
---
enjoy my 30% stun resist little gnome, ZUG ZUG
---
*crickets*
---
I wouldn't know, I started when cata came out. But seeing as gaming culture has shifted and the industry with it, we'll see what measures are taken, if any, against griefers..
---
I mean yeah I get soda is pissed but a blacklist seems a bit overboard. I wish people weren't such assholes either way to not spark this kind of reaction in the first place, as it provides little content for the stream and is a hit for the game itself as soda is most likely one of the top influencers and free advertisiment for the game.
---
Seeing him unhappy or bored when playing won't do much good, and some people's view on vanilla will shift with it. I could see myself completely burned out if I got camped whenever I would stream, no amount of money would make me enjoy it.
---
PVP REALM? You are fair game. For better or worse.
---
I like what you did here.
---
Corpse camping is allowed to a certain point, all of Blizzards tos has a *, it's ultimately up to Blizzards discretion, extreme cases of ganking have been punished before.
---
Camp fucking mojache. Best fucking name
---
Do you mind if I borrow this pasta
---
You forgot the part where they don’t care because they made bank playing a video game we all pay to play.
---
&gt; This was shortly before TBC release.
---
And there's your answer, progression didn't matter much anymore.
---
On L H those battles weren't a thing past the first few weeks. They happen when people level and gank each other until it spirals out of control. When everyone has a lvl 60 main and you'd rather farm gold for the impending Naxxramas wipefest, not so much.
---
Lol this is the weakest rebuttal.
---
The average feral dps for the top 30 runs across Nax taken from those logs is \~380. Only two made it over 550 and none made it to 600. The average Rogue, top 30, was \~780 and the average Warrior was \~850. 400 behind Rogues, 450 behind Warriors is really significant when you're only doing 380.
---
You might be theory crafting on dummies but these are real logs taken from real raiders raiding the top end content they have available.
---
You can run whatever class/spec you want. The argument I'm making is that some classes/specs are not pulling their weight. I played Vanilla as a Rogue and my 3-night raiding guild had so many people wanting less optimal specs that it was a real burden. Even the mages/locks/rogues/etc that showed up often still had their PVP spec, etc. This was so annoying to me, I was burning 100g per week switching specs to come to the raids. Players that sacrifice a lot to progress aren't going to want others dragging them back.
---
Sorry - you're saying it's better to go through what it puts my body through than to play on a PVE server?
---
I would pick Aubrey plaza over wow tbh
---
I like how not a single person has any evidence that you can get banned for corpse camping. Then when this article gets linked they just never respond.
---
STV gonna be a real shit show for these streamers.
---
It's actually just one, I kept it folded and while taking the picture with my phone, light was on the left side.
---
&gt; Hillsbrad and STV were always busy as fuck.
---
You're never getting a spontaneous 100 man brawl in STV past the leveling wave. Sure, you might get some 20 people fighting, but that's not 50 v 50.
---
Why the fuck do you guys even want to play on the same realm as them?
---
he did not even play vanilla properly, never had a high pvp rank. he is an arena noobie from later xpansions
---
Good thing Blizzard influenced by the opinions of manchildren.
---
This
---
Or a guild for hunting down these entitled folks
---
&gt;Stream sniping is a real issue and it provides literally no benefit to anyone other than making someone want to not stream the game.
---
Go to a pve server. I would argue that chasing away a streamer and his cult of followers is beneficial for all. Especially if it eliminates or reduces logging in queues
---
I miss him. Hopefully they never touch the 5 touchdown all-star sal bundy
---
Fuckin' Bruce Springsteen reference.
---
The shiny gold domes of righteousness look cool though.
---
If you're a Holy Paladin you can get geared quick in raids. 
---
If you PvP as Holy all you have to do is find a Warrior and heal him.
---
Then run around spamming a /tar macro.
---
i watched him ONE TIME and he died and threw a tantrum about how that guy was CLEARLY streamsniping. Lol'd and turned it off. 
---
I like people like shroud. If he gets stream sniped he's like 'fucking stream snipers' and reques. no tantrum, no long tangent about them, nothing. just "this is what i expect when i straem'
---
It was a one in a million to pull off LotR as they did. the cast, the score, timing the adaption when the technology was sufficiently developed (the trilogy would've been bad without the pioneering work of digitally creating large armies), Peter Jackson being in his prime, everything was just perfect. The Hobbit was utter fail, that new Amazon LotR spin-off series might be better, but the LotR trilogy was capturing lightning in a bottle. And then the original WoW team being as insightful as they were by learning from better works that they've seen (LotR), and making it their own in WoW. For example that epic scenery when you're dead in WoW, literally was inspired by LotR when Frodo puts on the Ring. And same here dude. Going to the theaters as a kid with my family to watch the trilogy is one of my fondest memories.
---
Same. I want to focus on the PvE, leveling, dungeons, and raids, but I'm an adult now and I don't have all the time in the world. Don't really look forward to the prospect of my only hour of questing on a given day halted by ganking.
---
When you consider the bodyguards that the streamers will likely have then Pvp servers are the only viable option.
---
There will be no pvp solution on pve servers. Streamers will generate players on both factions to fight for them. On a pve server they would be helpless to pve griefers.
---
I don't know, people were just doing their thing and here you come along with your request and 100 others just like you  "sign my charter". I don't remember what happens if the same person signed several and later joined another guild before you had a chance to hand it in. Bottom line I remember getting like 50S for me to sign. And that was the going rate in Crossroads at the time.
---
I see, thanks for the info!
---
Which streamer wants to ruin the game lol
---
Just like before, I really enjoy these guides. Really practical ways to get your foot in the dungeon door.
---
For once in my life, I 100% agree with these streamers. Not that I will play on a pvp realm anyway. But if pvp realms were the only option, this would have my vote.
---
\&gt; Sodapoppin claims that he himself camps players but that this is because he is simply an asshole     
---
    
---
Wow, he sounds like a cool, nice dude.
---
This comment is laden with jealousy.
---
While I didn't get banned, I did have a GM tell me enough was enough.  I guess ganking a lowbie griefer (he corpse camped my level 30 ish guy for 30 minutes) with my main for 2+hours was enough to get reported and have a GM talk to me.  
---
Maybe that player knew the GM get an intervention.  Now add streamer influence on game monetization and streamers sense of entitlement.  I see a lot of GM actions that will favor the streamers and hurt normal players that gank the streamers.  Regardless if the ganker was stream sniping or not.
---
Drain life deals damage and heals at the same time making it do a lot of threat.
---
&gt; I don't know why pve servers have such a bad reputation.
---
They're for bad players.
---
Yeah I would quit the game and I’d imagine ANY new player would too if they were camped for a sustained period of time.
---
their plan currently is to play together on opposite factions (asmon+soda) on a pvp
---
Not if i'm levelling a warrior. I'm already on an uphill struggle, I don't want to be climbing mount everest instead.
---
The proc can trigger sword spec and back and forth btw, had one on my warrior in vanilla and one shot people with chain procs.
---
Not streamers or their followers, or their politics, or their drama. 
---
Let’s talk about Warcraft instead.
---
in naxx gear tankier than any warrior due to avoidance cap, but no defense cooldown. highest threat, if fight requires no tank swap they are the best tank no question asked and they are by far the best thunderfury user.
---
Ofc they are hard to make work, their gearing is difficult and only works once ZG is there, they require a retpala in their group (preferred due to sanc aura and better judge, a debuff slot gone for aggro) and they require inhumane amounts of consume farm.
---
Otherwise, protpalas dominate 5man tanking. dungeons are easy for them, they are great farmers. Strat with protpalas is a breeze.
---
For the second part of your post

You can make an account there, put in your username and server you were on and you can see other people that may have done the same!
---
I mean some people say every job is not a job to them. Some people do jobs because they love them and it doesn't feel like a job to them. So by your logic every job ever is up to debate so every job ever is not a job. You try to entertain 20,000 people 8 hours a day 5 days a week and tell me its not hard. Many streamers plan out their days, script content, and force themselves to play something when they really don't want to.
---
He's advertising his location for the world to see, and crying when players on the opposing faction take advantage of that knowledge.
---
I watched a pokestreamer complain about stream sniping for online battles, except there was only like 30 people in the channel and the plays his opponent was making were all pretty obvious reads. 
---
It really boiled down to him not being nearly as skilled as he thought he was, and blaming the failure of his horrifically bad sets and strategies on "sniping."
---
That wasn't allowed back then
---
maybe try rp-pvp so theres less tryhards. i really think playing pve servers misses out on a lot of the fun of classic but to each their own really
---
I was referring to the fact that all the numbers in that chart are an average taken from the entire instance, and I was comparing the upper third feral dps to the upper third rogue and warrior. I was doing that in order to emphasize the Druid's potential, what they're capable of. Just because most are doing that doesn't mean it's not possible.  
---
Though if I end up in a raid having the trouble that you just described (or had the fortune of running a raid and encountered that problem), I would not be opposed to us simply switching to what was more optimal for our respective classes in order that we could actually progress.  
---
I'm not yet ready to give up on druid dps, though. Nor other sub-optimal specs, especially when the thresholds for dps are low enough. When you say real burden, what do you mean specifically? Frequent wipes? Hour longer in the instance even without wipes?
---
Okay that’s stupid. Why would any real company waste valuable resources figuring out how to write code that specifically does just that? And I mean figuring out because I’ve never heard of another game that has this policy so they would be creating their own code entirely to do so.
---
Getting camped for hours happened.
---
You're assuming you are in these pvp situations 24/7 which is strictly false, the game is slow paced.
---
It's better to play pvp yes, you are missing out on what truly forged communities.
---
Barring a very few *super special events* it hasn’t had a crippling affect on any economy or server stability. Only instance I can think of this happening was when Swifty (I think) did some sort of event that crashed a server, and was banned for it (he ban was lifted shortly after). 
---
People act as if the streamers will be running around with 20k players on their heels 24/7 or will be crashing markets to benefit the streamer. They are immediately going to the extremes of what could possibly go wrong, and it’s just silly. By precedent, Asmon and Soda aren’t regularly crashing servers and ruining the playability of the game. There might be a large chunk of asshats that cause trouble on the launch, but people actually getting their own access to the game and streamers keeping their servers secret will alleviate this greatly.
---
Will it have an impact, yes. Denying that would be silly. But it won’t be near as troublesome in the long run as you may think.

A game can do both.  I don't think vanilla raiding was intentionally easy, in fact it was a massive struggle for most people at the time.  Most of vanilla was essentially just a first draft they tried stuff some worked some didn't and over time the game changed to what they thought was better in both cases.
---
Uh... eagle eye is essential for use in Crossroads towers. Essential
---
Certainly liveable, but he pulled a lot more viewers in the early days of pubg. He was basically the shroud of the time, in that if you wanted to watch an elite player you went to grimmmz. But his attitude really rubbed people the wrong way so he eventually lost a large amount of his viewers.
---
The game was only out for about 2 years before TBC...
---
Also, Hillsbrad/Tarren Mill was constantly full of pvp from all levels, often times 60s. Maybe you played on a low pop server/PVE server? I didn't even notice that stuff back when I first started, and I'm pretty sure I just got thrown onto a PVP server full of Australians and New Zealanders (I'm near LA). It was actually awesome, I miss those kiwis.
---
yours mentions throwing and feeding...
---
Explain. I’d like to hear about efficiency.
---
Christ why don't you people just ignore it? They are famous, not smart. Grow up, all of you. In addition to that, I can feel them sometimes. Maybe it actually isn't fun when you are getting stalked 24/7 ingame. I would be mad aswell and yes ofc they can just turn off the stream or stream with delay. Don't get why you are all offended by "celebrities" talking shit. It's like you guys think their word is law and Blizzard does what Streamers want. Lol.
---
This is the cringiest comment in this entire thread.
---
I’m pretty sure I didn’t say that...
---
The justice system, at least in my country, is made of what is supposed to be unbiased people. If you somehow are connected to the guy going through the justice system, you can’t by law be part of it. Whether or not you believe this rule is being enforced can be argued, but the point still stands; it’s there for a reason, a good one. You can make bad decisions when you’re biased and when your decision is law to thousands of people, it’s worse than the random dude getting mad.
---
One of the main arguments of going to a 25 man raid was so the mechanics can be made more challenging. Original encounters were actually designed with 25 players in mind and not 40. Now imagine getting 40 people to do a Mythic raid that as designed with all 40 player in mind. New definition of hardcore? 
---
I hope that answers your question.
---
I’ve never played WoW, but I’m gonna be playing for the first time with some friends when classic starts. I played Everquest for 20 years, and during that time I’ve played just about every class. Here are what I’m looking for:
---
-Able to accomplish a decent amount solo. I’m not looking to solo til max level, as I’ll have friends to play with, but I want to be able to be productive in some way if they’re not on. 
---
-Able to make mistakes in a raid setting without wiping the raid. I don’t mind a complex class, but because I’m brand new to WoW, if I raid I don’t want my entire raid to collapse if I mess up. For this reason I don’t think it would be a good idea for me to be a main tank or a main healer, for example. 
---
-I want to be fairly consistent in whatever I do. In Everquest I played a wizard(single target burst DPS) for awhile, but hated it because I would do tons of DPS for one fight, and then be useless for the next several fights while I waited for my mana to regen. Whatever I play, I want to be able to consistently contribute to a group. 
---
Does anybody have any suggestions? I believe I’m going to be playing Horde. In Everquest my favorite classes were Paladin (Offtank class with self heals and single target stubs to keep myself alive) and Necromancer (Pet class with sustained DoT DPS. Very strong soloing but more of a utility role in groups pulling and doing a little bit of crowd control.) Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
---
xP
---
This is a great video, a bit different from the usual gearing/misc guide videos I'm used to seeing, the slower pace is a nice change.
---
I'd highly suggest if you're a warrior to give this a watch. 
---
Thanks, keep up the good work. Looking forward to seeing more.
---
I'm not sure if you are really trying to understand the point I'm making.
---
You can cherrypick a tough quest chain, but in the end the mage is going to spend hours spamming frostbolts for many, many hours. 
---
Retail is generally just more challenging, and that's OK. Vanilla is sometimes not-easy as long as you have some experience, but generally it's mechanically easier than retail.
---
And in the end, duels involving 2 players has less to track than arenas with 4-10 and BGs with 20+. And being rated, you can always expose yourself to the highest caliber of players with more complex rotations.
---
No, I mean Destiny for example has literally said streaming is so easy compared to his previous jobs that it shouldn't be considered a job, he didn't say "I love streaming, it's my passion, and if you do what you love you never work a day in your life."
---
So no, not by my logic. I love my job too but I don't know anyone who says their salaried job isn't a real job.
---
Anyone else play from 2006-2010 and have no idea the names of their characters let alone anyone they met in game?
---
Rank 13 gear but Lightforge shoulders? I’m confused.
---
Alright guys help me out:  
---
Warrior, Mage or Hunter.  
---
Was thinking Hunter to facilitate the warrior main. Could get mining/skinning and assist in gearing my warrior once I had him levelled. Been thinking about my playtime restrictions - and whether I will be able to play a warrior to its potential (im quite competitive so would be hoping to push raids). Also very interested in PVP - so thought that mage might be more suited as its an easier levelling experience and still very viable end game PVE and a god at PVP.  
---
Also cant decide on Human vs Orc. If I was to go warrior - how much better is the 25% SR and the improved axes (surely is best considering crit talents) compared to +mace and swords with perception? Warriors do good against rogues as is so i figure orc is probably the best?
---
R/ Eve is leaking
---
&gt; what is supposed to be unbiased people
---
And I can tell you there is no such thing as an unbiased person.
---
I guarantee every person complaining here has never been affected by streamers in the slightest.
---
corpse camping in original vanilla was punishable when they saw it as harassment.
---
ive known of people who camped a guy at a spirit res spot for 7 hours and got a 24hour and a email way back in vanilla
---
As long as the blacklist is created by social action and not imposed by Blizzard, I don't see a problem.  That's the kind of dynamic social interactions and culture that made Vanilla so good.
---
He's crazier than a road lizard.
---
Lost all respect for him. Clown
---
This is a hilarious but awesome idea
---
Yeah the CGI armies was Huge , I remember being in Awe seeing the Battle of Helms Deep and later Minas Tirith in theaters
---
Every time following those films whenever a big scale battle is about to unfold I literally have flashbacks from those films , most recent was Endgame in the final battle scene 
---
I couldn’t help but remember the battle of the Pelenor Fields when that was unfolding and the scale of it all 
---
Peter Jackson was great but it’s hard to capture lightning in a bottle twice and it didn’t help they decided to make 1 book into three separate films which was unnecessary and asked too much of him to improvise and create filler and go off the page which took a toll on him 
---
I have high hopes for the series but at best I’m cautiously optimistic because idk who will be in it or directing it
---
Lol no, they are not some of the worlds best in the games history. A lot of them aren’t even old enough.
---
You can take that care bear bs to the PVE servers.  What do you think CAMPing means?  It's not killing someone 3 times.  It means you set up camp cause you're going to be there for a while.
---
I dont think 2% is a lofty assumption -- if anything I would expect significantly more. And even only a quarter of those 2% make it to 60, that's upwards of ~200 cronies running around helping them on a whim. Sure, stream snipe guilds will be a thing, but once again that's not a good thing. I dont want to see or get involved in streamer fanboy vs sweaty stream sniper fights over farming locations or world bosses. I just want a normal mid pop server where I can play classic in peace. 
---
Regardless of the size, they will have an impact on the economy and playerbase. 
---
And if that's what you're after, more power to you. I hope they all roll on one server so you can get your fill but I and a bunch of other people would rather avoid those servers entirely.
---
I mean, Soda would likely fuck you up in all likelihood, so good luck with that. I'm not a fan of his, but he's objectively one of the best PvPers around.
---
Depends on skill level. A mage is very good solo but if you're shit it's less good.  Locks and hunters are braindead easy
---
r/whoosh
---
She plays wow. Didn't you see the old World of Warcraft commercial she was in?
---
Yeah information did not flow the way it does today. People would literally visit other guilds forums and discuss strats. Discord did not exist.
---
it happened before streaming though. i can think of so many times someone tries to kill me while leveling so i kill them back over and over every time they res.
---
not to mention camping a famous name on your server just because its funny
---
This was actually a thing in original classic. I'm pretty sure there were two guys that wrote a comic, and they would have a bunch of rogues that protected them. Can't remember the specifics, but it was pretty awesome to hear about.
---
Me and my duo partner shit all over him and Anthony once in a  match.  We didn't even realize it at the time until watching the replay later.  Sadly their reaction in stream wasn't very interesting, but it still made my week.
---
It’s actually a good set on a fresh server with no dire maul! At least till you get truestrike, devilsaur set, and mask of the unforgiven, but those pieces aren’t needed outside of raid zones.
---
Hahahahaha, this is why im looking forward to playing classic wow, you will be able to tell the people who played in Vanilla who havent. The Nostalgia is real
---
Except in World PvP, you didn't traditionally have cross-faction collusion to the max by having common player blacklists, rejecting them from all forms of group content in the game as well as siccing the other faction's "Streamer Military" on a single or handful of players (provided people all listen to the blacklist, be it via coercion from their guild leadership to support it or via some other reason). 
---
Create a hitlist on your faction if you want and deploy the Twitch chat or whoever else wants to make some money to go and kill/camp this guy. That's fine. You can't play a PvP server and then get mad about being ganked or camped whether or not you are well known. His popularity is irrelevant when it comes to determining if him getting spawn camped is unfair, and if he disagrees, he needs to go to a PvE server. That is literally what he wants in terms of protections.
---
He could hire bodyguards that just follow him as best they can, getting paid hourly (with all those streamer benefits, it should be fine). They can help guarantee that he won't be spawncamped. He's trying to choose the privileged way out, and it's apparent. Hell, he could ask his guild to come and help him get free of campers, I'd do that for a guildmate.
---
There is still the gap between skill level. I doubt the average reddit druid player has a chance vs sodapoppin
---
RIP Orkus. A true legend.
---
The next person who clogs up my feed is getting a BIG complaining to.
---
I know you say anecdotes don't count but I assure you I have seen several players forced to stop such activities back in the day. It def didn't happen all the time but it did happen.
---
Leveling sure but the skill required to play at a high level in pvp is pretty high and the rotation is unforgiving in pve if you don’t know what you’re doing
---
The problem is proving they are using the stream as a means to target them
---
Arena noobie? He's multiple season gladiator afaik. 
---
He has a lot of private server experience which is where most of the popular streamers got the majority of vanilla experience from. I doubt many players 26 years or younger can claim many achievements from retail vanilla.
---
True, the player created stories are what made classic and to me, BC, great. 
---
Seeing the same people and just having a connected game was really something unique. But its still a gray area with this streamer stuff. I guess in the end its not much different than a famous guild member or whatever, just hope it doesnt get to be too much.
---
I might personally play on PvE for these reasons though, I just don't have the time anymore to endlessly gank and countergank when I wanna get stuff done or play peacefully.
---
Each member is a black bald human male
---
Thank you for giving me this list. I’ve been dead set on mage for months and just started considering lock. Really helped me come back to my senses.
---
Cry more
---
On PvP server, I'd probably rank it hunter, rogue, mage, lock, then everything else. The other players are the more difficult enemies.
---
keybinding professions lmao
---
I honestly had no idea. I only started watching him recently and he definitely seems more positive
---
Try telling the other 30 guys in my guild that we’ll be re-rolling.
---
if Sodapoppin is actually a communist, I support his blacklist scheme.
---
No, DPS Warriors are the most gear/consumable dependent class in the game.
---
whos crying, faggot?
---
oh for sure it did. people just got on with their life's back then.
---
You’re out of your mind if you think the difference between bad players who allow meme specs and a min/max guild is 30 minutes in a raid.
---
PVE server: Hunter, Warlock, Druid, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Paladin, Shaman, Warrior
---
PVP server: Druid, Hunter, Mage, Rogue, Priest, Warlock, Shaman, Paladin, Warrior.
---
&gt;And if that's what you're after, more power to you. I hope they all roll on one server so you can get your fill but I and a bunch of other people would rather avoid those servers entirely.
---
No one I know even cares what server they are on. Good players aren't afraid of 2 bit players and a couple of fans.
---
Lololol oh god it's happening in wow now.
---
You broadcast yourself on the internet playing a game where people can literally camp your corpse. You asked for this.
---
Just because you broadcast your tears too doesn't mean people will get banned.
---
I played Vanilla when I was a teenager and used PVP to get my adrenaline fix for years: so I would appreciate you not try to sell me a false bill of goods on something I have first hand experience with. You spend level 20-60 looking over your shoulder when questing. I know because I've done it. 
---
So you enjoy it - I will not physically suffer for this or any video game for what you consider what constitutes a "true community". I, and everyone else coming back that isn't overloaded with enough free time to suffer unnecessary corpse runs, will be on PVE servers.
---
Nah him and Nick are rotten pieces of shit. Look what they did to sodas old video editor.
---
Bitchpoppin can turn off the stream or he can get camped and everyone will laugh at him for thinking a blacklist will work.
---
 - Hunter (BM but any)    
---
 - Warlock (Demo but any)     
---
 - Druid / Shaman    
---
 - Mage / Priest   
---
 - Pally / Rogue     
---
 - Warrior    
---
The top two for pets (and CC/FD). Then "tough" classes with a lot of utility (slows/escapes) and self-heals (but still good kill speed, sorry Pallys). Mage and Priest (because strong pew pew in both cases, and heals/defensive spells/CC, but they're both glass canons which means can be overwhelmed). Pally is slow but will kill things eventually, Rogue kills fast but struggles when things go south (particularly if Vanish isn't an option), and Warrior is just too vulnerable without a healer/lacks utility/escape/etc.
---
He's a young guy so I have no doubt he could change as he matures a bit
---
You are technically right when you say that 40 man raids don't have a huge threshold for dps but that's a very theoretical way of looking at it. In practice, a raid has 40 individuals. It has all sorts of dynamics. Some people are RL friends with the GM/Officers. Some are girls on chat that people crush over. Some are just likeable. If this guild is not one of the top few guilds on the server it's going to have a decent share of 'bad' players. People that die early, people that show up without consumables, people who need a repair after their second death, people that haven't even made an attempt at BiS but still want to raid, etc. The list goes on.
---
This causes the content to be difficult. Guild drama causes factions to form, wipes demotivate people so they try even less, etc.
---
I'd honestly take a 'good' feral because good players are always in demand. The problem is that there are just as many bad ferals proportionally as there are other classes. I'd have no way of knowing so I'd just rather take a safer pick. If you play feral and get your foot in the door with a guild and show them you're a dedicated raider who shows up well prepared, and actively contributes then you'll get a spot in raids.
---
Or dwarfs with that crazy face.
---
I agree with this. You're also lame af if you are streaming and whine about stream sniping.
---
Great addon. I couldn't do it though. I have small panic moments knowing I have untrained abilities. I wish I wasn't that way, but I am.
---
You dinging the hunter on no stealth for class ability?
---
&gt; What is this sub's obsession with bashing streamers to make themselves feel special?
---
bitterness because theyre losers irl while constantly faced with the fact theyre not even good enough at the one thing they do(play video games) to make a living off it
---
Some are more than others, usually by being involved. The point still stands. The rule is there exactly because limiting hoe biased people can be is a good thing.
---
Stream snipping sucks for sure because for the streamer and the viewer it can't be annoying but that's the risk you run with streaming. It's not harmful in anyway to anyone just a bother.
---
Who cares. Being annoying isn’t against the rules, no one was banned for ninja looting in vanilla.. You’re not entitled to be left alone just because you’re a streamer.
---
My guess the server info will be available much sooner so it will not be that difficult to avoid that one or two servers. 
---
I understand the frustration.
---
Gotta get those Hunter or Tank names reserved for your Rouge and priest somehow
---
Did they confirm RP-PVP?
---
imagine thinking "stream sniping" is a thing and even something to be frowned upon.
---
I did a spreadsheet of all mage abilities, with the gold cost for each spell and found out that you can really buy everything until lvl20 with very little impact. The spells start to get noticeably spendy around mid 20s and that's where you really need to be careful.

---
I don't know anything you guys don't, but the impression I get from that post is that you can pre-reserve 3 characters/names prior to release. I'm sure you can probably create more characters one servers are live, but I'm sure it's to prevent people from hoarding up every possible decent character name before the game even releases
---
Thats cool man, honestly. If that what you're in to, enjoy. But take a look through the comments and the other posts. Plenty of people do care. 
---
Everyone can get what they want so I don't see what the big deal is. You get your streamers and we don't Win win.
---
That’s crazy. I thought shroud was always as big as he is now tbh. Grimmz has never been toxic when I’ve watched him but it’s only been recently
---
Angwe has nothing on the Redidge gankers on LH. Since day 1 they've been in RR 24.7 ganking non-fucking-stop. They made it impossible for alliance to go to RR. It's so glorious.
---
I remember being flamed for using the moonglow spec as a resto druid because I "wasn't even a resto druid".  People just didn't know shit back then my server had like 2 guilds that cleared everything.  Tons of guilds struggled with bwl and aq40.  Anyone from arthas remember when TG stole rtzs's nef because rtzs couldn't kill him?  Big drama
---
Cool, thanks!!
---
Regarding your BRD "no tank neck" comment:  
---
https://itemization.info/item/11755
---
Sycophant. Getting ganked on a pvp server is part of the game. He’ll have to deal with it.
---
It is when it's targeted. I see no difference between some dude pulling a raid or dungeon just to wipe the group for "fun" and some dude explicitly targeting one guy by tagging all the mobs or killing questgivers. They're both griefing. And because he's a streamer, people are probably doing it in groups which is even more petty. 
---
I mean what would you do if your mobs get tagged or questgivers killed wherever you go? The only option here is him playing offstream and uploading it to YouTube - which sucks out 80% of the entertainment. I know I would get burned out really quick.
---
Him quitting wouldn't be beneficial for the health of the game. Many games stay alive and relevant due to streamers, and spark conversation. So many people have not played vanilla, me included, so watching streamers is literally the only way I can see what it's like. If all I see is campers and trolls, fuck that. I'm not interested. Classic or vanilla has already a stigma of elitism around it, do we really need griefing and camping aswell?
---
Oh myyy you can't get to 120 in under 3 days played on retail?? no wonder everyone complains lol. That's dumb af
---
Complete lack of reading comprehension? Are you 8?
---
Hunters have a poor disengage unlike druids who are amazing at running away from anyone.
---
This is what I’m mostly afraid of. I randomly kill a popular streamer to have my whispers filled with death threats, multiple reports, etc. I don’t need that crap in my life.
---
I will be making rogues just for this on both factions (hopefully each faction of streamers play on different servers)
---
holy shit I'm down to be in The Blacklist that would be crazy
---
Well, honestly, that makes sense. At that point, though I have to say that, even if there's a greater margin for error with less time focus-intensive specs, I'd take a good feral over a careless mage any day. So at that point (even if it's hard to tell at first glance whether they're good or not) you're still talking about privileging the skill of the player more than the spec. But I agree that it's easier to contribute with an optimal spec, if you're bad. That's a very good point.
---
Is there no fast travel in classic?  Will mages teleports finally be useful again?
---
I got banned for that like less than an hour after I purchased the game.
---
You are correct
---
ON AN OPEN FIELD
---
Reading comprehension
---
Can Druids use one spec and fill all roles? My biggest issue is that I know I will respec like crazy as a Druid if I can’t stick to one spec to cover all content. I heard feral/resto might be an option?
---

---
This video was literally the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
---
I would say feral is actually the only hybrid DPS spec that can compete. Also with some combination of 30 points feral, and 15+ points resto you can easily either tank or heal.
---
He was a top ranked arena player 12 years ago when he was 15, in the era of win trading for ranks
---
you realize this black list system is governed by many people right. It's not just soda poppin.
---
Yep, it fucking sucks. Deco not rolling pvp this time, none of my old friends play anymore really
---
I do.
---
This may be unpopular opinion but,
---
The servers should be community driven. If someone has the power to black list, then why shouldn’t they be able to? Conversely you will be able to create this rebel faction just as much.
---
My solution will be to NOT roll on a popular streamer server. I however do think it’s a interesting community feature to witness on these streamer servers. A King type role embedded within the community.
---
My point is that blizzard should take no action on whatever side. Let the servers be.
---
People should make a guild where only players may join if they can link a clip of them killing a streamer. A guild full of rank 14 players with HK's from killing streamers. I would join a guild like this.
---
Yes and I play on a Pserver. Socialization is kinda needed for elite Q's. As for people having chit chat? Doubtful. If it's not related to a Q or LFG people don't give a shit.
---
Such a simple idea that you've executed flawlessly. Very nice!
---
Yes go Priest.
---
There's already too many Warrior Tanks I'll have to compete with
---
I stand corrected! I wonder how I missed that. Thanks for pointing it out!
---
I had a heated argument with a guy just today trying to explain the whole min/maxing and the amount of misinformation back in Vanilla. 95% of players did not know their head from their .... and it was not their fault either.
---
Cool thanks for the tip. All the things I’ve read online don’t seem to grab those talents even though they seem pretty helpful to me
---
Way to put a target on your back. People are legendary assholes for no reason but now you've basically given them a reason cause they can see your salt first hand on a short delay
---
report it
---
The issue is how do you price stream sniping? If I run into a popular streamer multiple times and shit on him, do I get a ban for stream sniping even though I had no clue how big of a streamer he is?
---
Could I just stream with no one watching and ask for someone to be banned for continuously killing me?
---
It’s nonsense and Blizzard should do nothing. If they don’t want to be killed, summon their lings to protect them.
---
Smh
---
Woosh indeed
---
This resonated with me in a big way, sign me up
---
Same here.
---
Warlock Their 2 on an Undead somehow wins it for me though, and I don't even play clothies I just think that one nails the coolness factor.
---
The wording of this confuses me. Dont you mean that ALL of them except for Asmon refuse to roll PVE?
---
this is what's going to happen. soda's scare will probably work for a handful of people but people who want to be dicks are still going to be dicks and camp his ass 24/7
---
in retail it's almost impossible to snipe because of all the phasing, but in classic... oh boy... get ready for all the streamers on pvp servers demanding blizzard to help them from snipers
---
You are overthinking this. Most mobs will not even reach melee range with 2 casters nuking them.
---
Sign me up fam
---
That’s not what OP said.
---
So the system can be run in the same way. There is no reason to believe that everyone will just blindly adhere to his black list if they see its unreasonable LOL
---
&gt;If streamers didn't care about classic and blizzard didn't expect streamers to come back to it, blizzard never would have even bothered with classic.
---
Citation fucking needed on that one bud. It *surely* couldn't have been the unceasing demands on forums and at Blizzcon year in and year out stretching back to a time before streaming was even a real thing. It *couldn't* have been the massive popularity of numerous classic private servers, again for years. And then it *certainly* couldn't have been the backlash and outcry when many of those servers were shut down, culminating with insider talks between their creators and blizzard. And it definitely had *nothing* to do with passionate developers inside Blizzard **finally** finding a way to make it feasible.
---
Instead it must have been a quick grab at the attention of streamers, who themselves played little to no part in the mountain of shit listed above. Most of whom only hoped aboard the bandwagon after the classic announcement or during beta.
---
You complete donut.
---
Guess he should put a long ass delay on his stream or stfu.
---
I hate it when people complain about people complaining about people. Not that i'm complaining though
---
Go in a twitch chat. There's your reason
---
Solution: force all big streamers onto 1 server where all their cultists follow them so theres a 10 hour que time to log on. Cant get stream sniped if you cant log into your server.
---
I was wondering why I was seeing posts for people inquiring about the BiS gear for LVL 30 Beta. Confused the shit out of me, now I get it. They saw some streamer do it.
---
Because you’re going out of your way to be a selfish prick? “I want to purposely bring less damage to the raid, so I can be a weirdo, little hipster and feel special.” You’re causing the raid to take longer because you just have to feel unique. That’s about as abhorrent as it gets.
---
I bet you they’ll reserve them for the top streamers
---
a 1/4000 drop chance. Nice.
---
And Blizzard will just link them the EULA:
---
&gt; C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race.
---
&gt;This isn’t any different from guilds or individuals that were known for being idiots back in the day.
---
The issue here is those idiots would find themselves on the blacklist because they didn’t have a big enough following to back them. Now imagine if those idiots had 10k followers backing them even though they are completely in the wrong. A blacklist ran by streamers is moronic.
---
yep. don't think soda has heard of the streisand effect. want people to do something on the internet? tell them NOT to do it
---
Spelladin is pretty new. Whilst not suddenly making rets god's it certainly bumps up their DPS to 'Not absolute trash tier'
---
Yeah I can’t wait to see those backpedalers and people begging for that shiny epic thunderstrike/shadowstrike
---
Streamers should really just stick to one server. I can see them completely ruining the game
---
Then either delay the stream by 15 minutes so people can't accurately snipe you, or roll on a PvE server. These seem like really trivial problems and I'm surprised he can't think of a solution.
---
No. I don’t agree with that. Chances are, in my opinion, people will adhere more to him, because of his ‘celebrity’ status.
---
Just because some people knew about it ten years ago doesn't mean that everyone is aware of it now. Not everyone played back then either and stuff like this isn't even necessary any more in retail wow.
---
There was DBM, Detailed Guides, Videos and Min-Max data sites all in Vanilla.
---
&gt; $3K a month just from subs.
---
I don't think that's enough if you consider his resume is going to be empty, unless he can leverage his twitch "fame" that's not enough money to invest or live off of for an extended amount of time.
---
They are all scared right now that they will get relentlessly stream sniped and calling for blizzard to ban anyone that ganks and camps them
---
Thanks for the update! I guess I didn't explicitly mention it, but I -only- got to play the stress test (and even then only did most of Dwarf &amp; NElf zones) and so didn't get to see any kind of spillover. Is it the 25% factionwide spillover or is it discrete bonus amounts for more than one faction? Either way, good news for us seeking another race's mount.
---
That work sounds meticulous, bordering on tedious, but very relevant to a large subset of players. Are you in contact with WoWhead or anything to try and get your stuff more out in the open?
---
yeah put them all on the same server with all of the twitch shit and have people who arent twitch verified pay extra to roll on it, keeping the worst population in gaming out of the majority of classic while sustaining it with their wallets lol. 
---
if they pay $5 for someone to say their name they'll for sure pay $5 extra a month to play on the server where their streamer cant avoid them
---
&gt;listening to pepe posters
---
I joined around the same time and I remember running around 1k needles and being so immersed, good times
---
Hypothetically, do you think cross-layer BGs should be possible?
---
you mean vendorstrike haha. i wonder if they will bring back Class leaders for guilds again.
---
theyre black balled is the joke
---
The monetisation/streamer argument just dilutes the point.  People shouldn't go down that rabbit hole.  Its nothing to do with 'content' or getting paid.
---
Its about playing hide and seek while constantly yelling where you are and being mad when you get found.
---
The idea that stream sniping is some big crime is the most self entitled bullshit in gaming today.
---
But they're all celebrities....
---
Yup. Talk about harassment galore if a streamer has a problem with you.
---
PvP on a pvp server.  If you don’t like it go to a pve server
---
Hard to take you seriously with "with the goal of hunting those who wish to abuse their streamer privilege to dictate what others may do."
---
Just fukin stream snipe him. Don't try to make this some sort of proletariat vs the bourgeoisie bullshit
---
Please tell me I'm wooshing?
---
I'm pretty sure that's an oxymoron, at least when it comes to MMOs.
---
&gt;Everyone can get what they want though, so I don't see what the big deal is. You get your streamers and we don't. Win win.
---
I won't even know if I do. I wouldn't even notice them.
---
i'll take my job over theirs any day
---
Yeah when I was younger I would WPvP and BG for days on end but I’ve found I just don’t enjoy it as much anymore personally. Shit happens and everyone should just enjoy themselves
---
If Soda wants to cry about streamsniping (which will happen to him and many other streamers), he can roll a PvE server where it was designed to cater to his wishes.
---
However, he WANTS to do WPvP, and this camping comes with it. As far as I'm concerned, he knows by streaming Classic on a PvP server that he will be targeted in some way. By playing the PvP servers, you waive the right to any special protection from PvP, and creating a cross-faction blacklist on any player you think is streamsniping you is **toxic and childish**. 
---
You can certainly create a "hitlist" for your faction where you pay people to find and kill this guy for money, but getting them blacklisted just for killing and camping you on stream, whether or not they are actually streamsniping, is bullshit.
---
Here are his options:
---
- Create a hitlist, post a bounty on specific Alliance players and have them spawncamped for 50g, 100g, whatever amount he's going to be able to pay.
---
- Hire bodyguards. For example, 20s-1g/h to follow him and avoid killing quest mobs. He gets ganked and camped, these guys can converge and help get him uncamped. They don't even have to be his level, just high enough to make campers have an issue tagging him down.
---
- Play a PvE server. The protections he wants are provided by this server. He of course loses the ability to do WPvP, but this seems the best way to solve his problems in one go, trading those problems with the problem of no WPvP.
---
- (A far-fetched option, because I doubt he'd even consider the other person worth talking to) Go to the server Discord (there WILL be server discords) and try to get in contact with the player or someone who knows them, and set up a conversation **off stream**. Ask them to stop **nicely**. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. Use a throwaway Discord account if you need to. This is a problem if there are a lot of people spawn camping you as there's a lot of people to talk to, but it may be worth it. *(Even though this is a lot of communication with the other faction, the end result is not something I think is that serious. It's certainly not a serious as a cross-faction blacklist, and it is going to happen anyway with Discord being so prevalent.)*
---
He's looking for a privileged way out of the "problem". The issues with his cross-faction blacklist are antithetical to Vanilla's community in that it colludes with the enemy faction to a degree that is mind boggling to me (a little conversation like talking in Discord while dueling or in PvP is fine in this day and age IMO) and it means through his law alone, or other streamers on the server, they can declare someone, anyone, even you reading this right now, as a streamsniper who corpse camps to get on stream if they want to and keep you from playing the game, potentially forcing you to reroll characters or go to another server entirely, even if you just started camping that dumb Druid who keeps taking your quest mobs. *Yes, there are people who exist who do not care who you are or what your Twitch metrics are each month. There are people who don't know you, however small you think that number is.*
---
It's an authoritarian and heavy-handed way of dealing with a problem he is knowingly walking into and doing the least he can to help it (the easiest being rolling a PvE server). Screw a cross-faction blacklist, fuck that noise.
---
Game designers I used to work with who loved their job said it. Plus as I said some streamers act, write scripts, and play games they don't really want to play. You say you'd rather play video games instead of working but that's not what streaming is. Try playing a game in front friend and make it entertaining for them for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. Not to mention playing something you like in your free time is not even comparable to someone playing a game because its their job. Take soda for example Saturdays are "shitshow Saturdays" he literally plays the worst games ever and has to turn that into entertainment. Just because something is an easier than something else doesn't mean it isn't a job. There are people who literally pull a single lever thousands of times a day on a manufacturing line. Pulling a lever is literally the easiest thing someone could do its still a job. Streaming is a more difficult than a lot of jobs and not as difficult as others. Roofing is hard physically acting is hard emotionally and being a college professor is hard intellectually which is not a job. A job as to be soul crushing or not enjoyable to do to in order for it to be a job?
---
I'd argue Druid &gt; Paladin because the Druid can just root / kite with travel form.
---
I do not believe where was a way to read the exact spec of a person to see the talents. Plus if a person is benefiting from 2, 3, 4 buffs it would be very difficult if not impossible to determine how much each buff actually provided in raw DPS.
---
And it is more of a personal perspective that determines if you feel as if you got screwed or benefited from the changes.  I was quoting /u/Stridshorn where he mentioned that people felt negatively about  the changes.  I have heard almost every class/spec complain about how the transition from classic to BC, or any xpac to xpac, screwed their class over.
---
From experience, I know mages complained about being shafted in BC.  In classic, they were a strong ranged DPS that could bring a variety of specs to the raid.  However, in BC, they said they were the scorch bot most of the time while Warlocks and Hunters were the primary ranged DPS.
---
K continue to just not rebut any of my other shit. Top players aren't "afraid" of streamers, but they don't want to put up with the bullshit and unfun effects that they bring along, such as swinging populations, and all the other fucking reasons that I mentioned above that you have yet to address. At this point I'm starting to think that you're trying to troll me
---
This blacklist is not blocking people from doing the content.  It is blocking them from doing the content with streamers that are particpating in this.  Stream snipers will be able to do raids or premades with their own guilds and friends.  I dont get the point that the streamers are preventing snipers from playing.  Is this concept weird and potentially over the line? Sure.  But its just a step up from the blacklists made in vanilla of nina looters.
---
Both arent griefing. 
---
Kick him out of the raid. Ohh no you wiped once. Boo hoo.
---
Tag mobs better. Dishonorable kills discourages npc killing. If they werent supposed to be killed they wouldnt be kill able.
---
The issue here is that some of them plan on keeping the server a secret. To those of us with existing guilds that plan on rolling like 30 deep on the same server, it’s going to be excruciating hard to tell all 30 people we are re-rolling.
---
The way I learned keybinds is do one button at a time until I know it, then add another one and don't let myself click it no matter how bad I want to.  I'll be honest with you.  Your layout doesn't look very intuitive.  
---
If I had to give a tip the first thing I would do to get started is rebind the Strafe keys (Q,E) to (A,D)  You don't ever need the keyboard turn keys for anything ever, so that frees up two keys.  
---
Then since you have the E key Free Next thing I would do is put charge and hamstring together when in battle stance.  You can only charge in battle stance, and you can only charge at range and you can always only ever do one or the other.  An in Zerker stance you can just use the regular Hamstring.  So, both abilities can all be bound to the same key, because they will never overlap.
---
So make a Macro, /m to open it up and name it something cool like chargestring, and pick the charge Icon.
---
in the macro area type:
---
/cast Charge
---
/cast Hamstring  
---
Then save it.
---
Now you got two buttons for one space, and you put it on the E key that isn't doing anything and you can now get that charge off super fast before you get stuck in combat, and when you are in melee range or in combat charge won't work, so you can just hit it anytime you are in melee range and it will hamstring them as long as you are in battle or berserker stance.
---
Another one of my favorite binds is putting my mount on the W key with a shift modifier.  
---
At the end of the day though you can do whatever you want.
---
Did you just copy someone else's response that I had already replied to?
---
who actually cares
---
Sometimes it do be like that.
---
And suck his balls, if he joins the same party.   God knows what he would do if he got in the same raid...
---
I know!
---
All I want is to do is Tank, but I'm ok healing or DPSing when I need to.
---
I have always played a Warrior and did in classic, but I've really wanted to try Paladin in Classic for the lore and the classic sets.
---
But I want to tank.
---
Also Druid seems to be the least played class and I love being an underdog.
---
The entire concept of the list relies on enough people being on the server that actually care about the list. If the majority of a server are streamers and their followers, then why shouldn't they get to decide who they play with or not? And if they aren't a majority, who cares, the list will be inconsequential. I see no difference in streamers having enough clout to social ostracize someone or large random guilds have that same power.
---
The easiest way to avoid it are, just don't play on "the streamer server" or just don't streamsnipe. Personally I enjoy trolls getting fucked over, so I'm all for the blacklist.
---
Doesn’t mean they all agree on the same stuff, in my opinion. They still gor their viewers, their friendship with certain other streamers etc.
---
Solo play? Hunters/Warlocks cause pets. Warriors cause no mana. Mages because they can conjure food/water, and rouges/druids cause energy.
---
He could hire bodyguards.  But any exposure is good exposure.
---
It’s usually very obvious when they are snipers and when they are just ganking
---
The problem right now is streamers are saying they are going to keep the server a secret. For guilds of 30 people it’s going to be really hard when we roll on their same server and have to tell all 30 people to re-roll.
---
My main was on Skullcrusher but I played an alt with my roommate on Tich. “Tichondrius is not for you” was the first thing that popped in my head when I saw this post.
---
AGREEEEED
---
Streamers will get alot of advantages, people mailing them gear and gold. And alot of hindrances, grave camping. Can't have their cake and eat it too. Meh
---
LIXO boludito! (( I'm sorry that's all I ever learnt from grouping with brazilian players :D)) Love to you, and I hope blizz gives you a realm for your region too!
---
That’s not the point at all but cool addition
---
(who cares)
---
Yea man, Tips is number one tank. I bet he could clear MC solo.
---
Just avoid them, that seems to be the problem at the moment because they state they are going to trick people on purpose so nobody will know their server
---
And getting blacklisted for fucking with people in Vanilla was part of the game and people had to deal with it too, even for petty reasons like taking someone's ore node. You could literally get blacklisted from entire guilds over petty shit like that. This isn't something Soda invented. It existed per server for all games WoW and pre-WoW that were community driven. Did you ever play Vanilla at all?
---
Just because I don't have a hate boner for streamers doesn't mean I suck their dick. I'm proud of you for knowing the word sycophant, but I figured someone who could use the word reasonably correctly would be able to work out basic logic. I guess being smart and having a decent vocabulary are different things.
---
I didn’t know Horde armor came in white.
---
&gt;no one is going to spam dungaons for BIS lvl 30 gear, 
---
What do you mean? Are you saying I'm the only one that spams dungeons for bis gear at every level?
---
By sheer chance, during retail vanilla I ended up playing on Laughing Skull, the same realm as Leeroy.  
---
Only saw him twice, but both times I went out of my way to kill him. I imagine I wasn't the only person to do this.   
---
That's what it's like to have any degree of notoriety in a PVP game. Good luck to steamers who roll on PVP.
---
Protip: if you see a raid group of level 30 somethings wandering through STV following one guy, you're on a streamer sever. Know the signs! Be prepared. (: good luck in Classic.
---
And thus several stream sniping guilds were suddenly formed
---
Wasn’t there a video with a streamer that lost the roll for a weapon but got it gifted because he was merely a streamer? Let me dig it up.
---
What in the actual hell? You publicize your location, openly sharing where you are and what you’re doing, all while making a FUCK ton of money, and you’re going to suggest people get blacklisted for killing you? Go fuck yourself, Chance.
---
Server info is posted weeks before launch when you can save your character name
---
Why?
---
They definitely will. They are used on private servers and for decent reason. Some classes have specific strats on fights with positioning, coordinations, and tasks. Frost mages is kinda silly cause all they need to do is hit one button, but for other classes it can be more complex
---
&gt;Doesn’t mean they all agree on the same stuff,
---
I agree. They don't all agree on the same stuff. Which is precisely why someone trying to black list a person for a completely stupid reason would never happen.
---
can't use the search on the website :( Does anybody know if Druidbar will come to classic?
---
Would be nice to have sticky at release with all the streamers and their realm.. Just for ***cough*** informational reasons.
---
Yep, it's one thing if you complain about it anytime you get ganked, and another if you're suspicious of someone and mention it.
---
I thought it was mildly amusing satire.
---
Show the enemy what you are doing live.
---
Enemy watches and kills you.
---
Surprised pikachu face? D:
---
People that go out of there way to continuously corpse camp a streamer should be banned or suspended. Just cuz they stream doesn’t mean you get to devote your wow life to trying to make it hell for them.
---
If you’re one of those stream snipers then you’re an actual loser and should get some help lol
---
You are a God among men. I can't tell you how many level 60's I whispered in IF asking if they would run me through Gnomer, a notoriously bad dungeon. I'd reckon I never tried for more than 30 minutes before someone would do it.
---
soda is pretty great. sure the blacklist idea is not that great an idea but i can see where he is coming from. if you're getting constantly sniped and you know it (ie being in prowl and everyone always honing in on your location) you're gonna get pissed off and its not fun.
---
Piece of shit streamers turn out to be pieces of shit, example 73626
---
This subreddit: Streamers SHOULD say us were they will play, because WE DON'T WANT to play with them, or even better, make them play all in the same server! give them no choice.
---
Also this sub: What? they are asking for stuff? they are so entitled.
---
You're the only one arguing here champ. Everyone else just asked for a graphics toggle
---
Hah classic RULEZ
---
Hah retail SUX
---
Just like most games these days, stream snipers should be banned.
---
If you get mad because you keep getting killed, move to a PvE server. The horde bitches need to burn!
---
What a piece of entitled shit.
---
I'm not even a huuuge vanilla fan (prefer tbc) but I still hope for this. So many people love vanilla, why not extend its life
---
you speak as though it's going to be 1v1...
---
I agree and for the most part have the same attitude. That said it will suck when you are leveling and run into a huge group of seemingly random people and god forbid kill a spawn that their fearless leader was waiting in or some other such thing. And then become the target of their grief.
---
Average /played to get to 60 is about 11 Days played.
---
that's 10 months worth of subs
---
There was always a blacklist. 
---
That's what he was talking about.
---
If someone is being dick, he won't be invited to events or raids.
---
And if you know that you're being added to the list if you're a dick (e.g. by stream sniping), everyone just plays how they're supposed to.
---
Problem → possible solution.
---
I don't see where the fucking problem is.
---
This is war. You use your every advantage to beat the enemy. Stream with 20 minutes delay  if you want to avoid ganking and streamsnipping.
---
Bitchpoppin should turn off his stream or play on a pve server. He isn't even a good pvper anyway
---
Shrouds fame came out of near nowhere. He had started streaming pubg and had your liveable viewcount. Maybe 1000 or so people. One weekend he did a 24 hour stream and it just clicked. He had the steady 40,000 viewers for a long time after that at the height of pubg.
---
Lol I remember when we had some guy camping our friend in STV in burning crusade. That turned into a 10v10 real fast. Which for some reason we got pissed at all alliance and took a 40 man raid into sentinel hill. Gah I miss making alliance go and cry to their main city trying to get more people.
---
PvE server aren't an option because they actually *want* to PvP. Soda said it himself, he loves ganking people, and he enjoys being ganked, he sometimes likes massive 40v40 faction wars, but he wants it to be genuine. All streamers do, they want to play on a PvP server just like everyone else, no special treatment, if they run into some world PvP, that's fun content. 
---
The point is that's almost impossible because some people will streamsnipe, and since streamsniping isn't against Blizzard tos, a community blacklist is the next best thing.
---
Funny I was torn between the 2 same classes myself. I too chose the priest after seeing a cool post here on reddit about forsaken priests.
---
&gt; Then look how Nick pays his rent (and how that happened).  
---
Then watch why Ryan thinks Chance is stupid/silly. 
---
im confused tbh
---
Literally was automatic for me. My mind starting reading "time" in the goblin voice before reaching the end. How the fuck did my mind know to do that? Black magic.
---
I leveled 1 to 60 as a resto druid 90% questing.
---
Sure he can blacklist the people on the opposite faction that annoy him, however as soon as he colludes with someone on the opposite faction to deny them groups he is in a bannable spot. It is just another instance of crybaby streamers who aren't getting their way enough to suit them so they want to get the person who annoyed them banned or punished in some way. 
---
Learn to play the game as it is, or fuck off. It's that simple. If he doesn't like being pvp'd he can go pve, or he could not stream. plenty of options that don't involve acting like a 5 year old running to mommy when the other kids don't like you.
---
Lol keeping the hunter stereotypes alive I see.
---
My main memory is trying to do RFC at like level 14 in a group of 3 people very early on and we were so confused why everything was so hard to kill and why the mobs chased you right back to the start portal. We had no idea what an instance or tank or anything was. We thought it was just another quest.
---
I feel like people seem to take streamers words as gospel, if you ignore them and just, play the game I honestly doubt you’d ever even notice they are there. Not that that excuses Chance’s entitlement but he only has that because so many people are blowing smoke up his ass.
---
Yeah? They were using MCP back then like they were today?
---
So I started playing back in Vanilla in 2005, but was a kid and mained hunter but had no idea what I was doing. Didn’t really start raiding and getting into PvP until WotLK where I was a DK main. I loved my DK, like it was unrivaled to me in terms of how much fun it was to play that class.
---
That being said, I’m unsure as to go Rogue or Warrior to try and fill that void. I want to do’s, so it’s between Combat and Fury respectively. Faction is undecided. Help me pick between the two
---
It was spot on lol
---
Will definitely join &lt;the blacklist&gt; to hunt all the streamers that migrate horde. You have my gnome warlock friend!
---
Streaming for a living isn't all that it's cracked up to be - you depend on a lot of factors! You have to make sure everyone likes you, you have to censor yourself and carefully curate all your social media, and do a bunch of shit outside the stream to keep growth on an upward trend. You're not just playing videogames, you're a business owner, you are your own marketing team, and you are never really "off work". It's not that great.  
---
I'll take my job where I can leave work at work any day.
---
I'm fairly sure people who want to grief don't give two shits about dishonorable kills. I've seen pettier people in videogames that get kicked out of guilds or clans.
---
I am aware that in a PvP server killing or camping is not griefing according to the rules and yadda yadda, but the fact that people do it out of sheer spite or just to troll because it's a streamer is the issue. Blacklists or lists in general already existed on people who "bluewall".
---
Again, it serves no comedic purpose or entertainment and the people who do it are well aware that they are ruining a wholesome experience that's at this point supposed to be a showcase on what vanilla is for thousands of people.
---
Call it what you will, griefing is intentionally going out your way to ruin someone elses experience.
---
Because it is not a rule, this suggestion is completely valid. A bit overboard, but valid.
---
No one has ever been banned for corpse camping lol.
---
Fucking carebears
---
Wow is just the sims for incels. Change my mind.
---
Very cool- will watch
---
&gt;some of the best players in the game's history
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA, just watch a few of them and you'll realize how shit they are at this game.
---
I don't get why he thinks he could encourage the opposite faction to Blacklist people for camping in. They probably encourage it, support it, give free Epix to every controlling the most.
---
I played horde retail on the same server is Leeroy Jenkins. He basically couldn't do anything other than sit in Stormwind without being camped constantly after that stupid video.
---
Fuck yeah. If they end up joining my server when I make a character, I'm totally going to participate in this. 
---
Streamers have a place in the game, but acting like they are exempt from the standard expectations of a PvP server, like spawncamping (however frequent it is and for whatever reason) is toxic and I'd 100% support doing this whitelist. Show Asmongold's body after he enters people onto the Blacklist, I'll let you nab a rare instead of killing you while fighting it.
---
lmao, you are going to spend hours just rekilling re-spawning trash.
---
Yeah but there’s no reason for sharding otherwise because this is something that only happened due to the level cap increase.
---
Sounds like he's gonna learn the hard way that he's not all that.  
---
I thought he loved pvp?  Hmm.

Lol I can’t wait to have the alliance screech over not being able to kill their stream sniping endeavors. XD
---
You should be able to afford buying all your spells and still getting amount at 40, they're not that expensive
---
&gt;I'm surprised he can't think of a solution.
---
He did think of a solution, a community blacklist that makes it nearly impossible for the streamsniper to do group content.
---
Yup. The core challenge in many ways is having the time, the coordination, and commitment to be consistent on all of those fronts.
---
People say classic is figured out, so it's easy.
---
Well, no.
---
I have 100% of the knowledge I need to lose weight and literally look like a super model. 
---
**100%**
---
But will I **commit** to the actions I need to, over a long period of time, to achieve that goal? Very unlikely.
---
Difficulty and challenge is more than just how many actions you can make per minute, or how quick your reflexes are.
---
It might it’s usually red from all the blood of the alliance :)
---
Subs are not even 50% of most streamers income. You then need to add in ad revenues, bounties, sponsors and of course donations.
---
Feral ass
---
That doesn’t imply they can’t agree on stuff as well. I see it being only run by celebrities the exact same as if it was normal people. The celebrities trying to put people on the Black list still have their viewers who could potentially push for their views and could potentially make up for a decent amount of people on the server.
---
I feel like everyone has the wrong mentality about this his ideal seems pretty reasonable. It’s the equivalent of a obsessed fan meeting a celebrity in public and asks for autographs n pictures it’s gets annoying sometimes and people just want to be normal. I see nothing wrong with wanting to blacklist someone who is literally just following you the entire day you play. I’m almost positive he cares less about someone just killing him what’s annoying is when 5-10 people gang up and camp the fk out of him or just follow him. Remember it’s stream sniping they do it on purpose it’s not a random scenario.  When people argue just don’t stream yes that’s a possibility, but his way of income is streaming... also can’t just play a separate character because you gotta invest a lot just into one character in vanilla. Stream sniping should socially be acceptable most the time but times like this is when it shouldn’t be acceptable.
---
yikes
---
I can't imagine being so high on the smell of my own farts that I expect the game to be designed around me individually.
---
Did you really think anything else would happen?   These streamers will obviously encourage their horde of virgin morons following them to harass and report anyone that gets in their way.
---
Hey Alliance, if you corpse camp sodapoppin or any of his Horde streamer friends, post a screenshot on the realm discord and I will add you to my whitelist and never engage you in wPVP ever. And I'll put whatever Horde exclusives you want up on the cross-faction AH with no markup.
---
You don’t have to try to get along with coworkers? Or have to censor your real thoughts at work?
---
The other stuff is true, but like you said would be the same for any business. Perks include being your own boss. 
---
And in terms of “off work” they usually stream from their bedroom or living room. So they don’t have to physically be somewhere else 9-5, so they can easily put in the same amount of hours streaming. 
---
Also, I imagine most people get compensated much less than the big streamers we see.
---
Same thing in Runescape for me. I enjoy the mundane grind. It's almost a form of meditation.
---
It's a bug if he cant
---
People get angry over nothing these days.
---
Atleast the train emote is group only, other emotes like laughing/crying should be 'public'
---
I played the hell our of this game.
---
The one class I regret not maining is rogue.
---
See you in STV boys
---
Wait, are you not supposed to level poisons?
---
Ok well some people think we never landed on the moon. You're free  to have your conspiracy theories. I'll stay down here on earth.
---
go back to bfa
---
Imagine getting paid the amount he does and his biggest problem is people killing him on a PVP server lol.
---
Lmao I don’t play retail
---
They can't re-do. Cooldown was 1hr long. That's absurd to think they'd just wait to set up exactly the same scenario with exactly the same things off CD. Soda was at least reasonably disappointed in the outcome of that duel.
---
Instant Poison is the only one you want for leveling.
---
I ain't gonna switch it up because we all know BFA ain't killing shit but itself
---
Asking a mage for water on lvl8 warrior just to drink it by myself. Gotta stay fresh 😂
---
Hate to say it but unless it's a mob of stream snipers then the chance of some random wrecking sodapoppin is like 1%. He's not asmongold.
---
not when i played vanilla but i started in BC
---
I used the Deadmines daggers from sneed up until level 55
---
Oh lmao, I'm too sleepy to get these jokes
---
Frost oil on your weapon to slow them down, Pursuit of Justice/boot enchant to increase your movement speed a bit, burst them hard when they get low and try to run with a stun + Judgement + Divine Favor for an auto-crit Holy Shock.
---
If Soda doesn't like being stream sniped, he should opt for a PvE server at launch.
---
True, mine in classic was bear to charge to cat that I used. I had a friend that used a sequence that did the charge to bash to cat. But it was buggy and he had issues with it sometimes.
---
No one spec fulfills everything perfectly, but here are some decent options for ya.
---
[Heart of the Wild + Nature's Swiftness](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxMTscMdxVvc0co) (0/30/21) gives you the ability to do large parts of the game in PvP or PvE without respeccing.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
And just to compare, here are some other specs you can use.
---
[Swiftmend PvP](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxMuoZVgcoeq0o)
---
[Swiftmend PvE](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLZZxEcqeqio)
---
[Moonglow PvE](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zjVIo0sZZxgcoxq) - once you have more gear
---
Oh man, I did not enjoy leveling a Pally in Vanilla.
---
Because I like what I do, get paid well and add value to society
---
WOahhhh there! Did I stumble into Rule34?
---
Oh piss right the fuck off with this shit. Don’t want to get camped? Don’t stream. End of story.
---
This is bait.
---
Dalvengyr and a few others were "overflow" servers, and were a one-time special exception. Normal protocol however is no server xfers, and no realm xfers, for PvP characters.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Server:Dalvengyr_US
---
Bannable to kill a streamer??
---
Lmao that literally is dumbest logic ever. I really don’t understand why wow hates streamers so much. What have they done that’s ruined the game or affected you in any way
---
Mages can aoe farm as soon as they get imp blizzard
---
#NotMyHorde
---
because spending your hard earned cash to an already rich person just sitting infront of a monitor playing games the whole day for a few seconds of shoutout(s) is stupid honestly
---
Druid, for some stealth shenanigans, or another rogue.
---
Wtf are you talking about. Shroud was one of the most popular csgo pros.
---
Any healer 
---
Warlock for metal rp
---
Meh not really. It’s cool to see ppl passionate over something, and to me I’m stoked to actually be proud of my faction and pvp, without a storyline telling me to. One of those ways for me was helping ppl getting corpse camped. Plus alliance are just scum
---
That’s well and all, but that generic answer would be given by most people that like their job. It’s almost taken directly from Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs. 
---
Care to be more specific, or at least describe perceived negatives of being a streamer?
---
I have been a full time streamer before. I lasted 4 months. Money was good, mental health was not so good. 
---
I got a day job and I've been happy ever since.
---
Peace has come to Azeroth from our mutual hatred of streamers.
---
I had never heard of stream sniping before, but im pretty happy it’s a thing. Fuck that guy. 
---
Reminds of the kids I used to tutor complaining about their stuff getting blown up in Minecraft...
---
Druid. You can stealth stuff together, druid can heal or tank, giving you group options, and you can even farm a lot of Pre BiS gear as a duo (but not UBRS or Strat, maybe not all of Scholo).
---
Theconspiracy is me believing that streamers can make mistakes, and if they do, it can cause a lot more trouble than if a regular person did it. Especially when it’s about the reputation of a person, in a game where reputation means a lot.
---
I can live with that.
---
Have fun being the viewer, pushing for a Black list of the guy who ganked your favourite streamer a few times.
---
Perfect for my heart.
---
There was a one-time exception to this rule in 2006 for a few servers.
---
Gearscore and ilvl do not matter in vanilla. Some classes have prebis thats level 40. A lot of items are pre60.
---
If I can 1 v 1 a pro streamer in wpvp, why wouldn't I? Twitch audiences deserve to see that they're following an average player with a nice mic and a cool chair
---
Lmfaooo no your stupid. If its not a natural encounter its not supposed to fucking happen at all. Is that hard to understand?
---
I mean, if we're talking willingness to just pull all the stops and leave paladins have options too, to actually kill them maybe not, but druid and paladin clearly beat out the other two
---
How do I upvote multiple times?
---
Hi, /u/kewlguy7777
---
Real mvp right here
---
If I had more knowledge about video games, (I know just surface level stuff) I would at least try it. 
---
But I get it, looks much easier than it really is.
---
I am a total carebear in wpvp but I still roll pvp servers because it's such a thrill.  You've always gotta be looking over your shoulder.
---
But how is it non-viable if the content is piss easy?
---
Sweet victory.
---
He based.
---
Honestly when people like this and their perceived position of “power” try to pull shot like this I just want to take them on a boat and dump them in the middle of the Atlantic.
---
Blacklist streamers
---
yeah i know i use to raid in Vanilla lol. Hunters pulling corehounds etc
---
It's funny because a gnomon is the part of a sundial that casts a shadow. Now I'm imagining a gnome gnomon.
---
Some of those streamers are the only reason you have a legit classic server to play on.
---
I’d say another rogue or a Druid for from time to time. 
---
If you level with a lock, mage, or priest, you’ll out pace them and they won’t be able to keep up. 
---
Conversely, you won’t be able to keep up with a hunter or warrior. 
---
Also, if you’re on a pvp server, you’d want the two of you to be able to stealth to attack/hide from the opposing faction.
---
This is what kills me about all the streamers. You are making shit loads of money to play a game where you often make content griefing other people but you don't want to be camped yourself? Like shit roll PvE then. Asmon has 20k subs this month which is roughly 60k+ USD he is making this month alone and he has the audacity to talk about how it's unfair for him to be camped by stream snipers. Honestly, at this point, I may just roll horde to fucking murder these guys over and over again.
---
Let's not forget the fact that if they even die once they magically summon an army of autist to help them get vengeance.
---
I usually don't give a fuck about what streamers do but good God I can't stand entitled children crying.
---
Hey man, people smoke and gamble their life away too.
---
Well. I'm also older, with a wife and kid, and I can't be taking on the role of a main tank/off tank. I play WoW mostly for the raids so, at least as a healer I can be a bit more flexible. *Still* a bit of a rough life for healers, but not as depending as the MT/OT.
---
Fuck, I **love** gaming!
---
Can't they get TOS'ed by Blizzard for targeted harrasment though (public shaming someone)?
---
This is an insecurity of mine. I know that I can’t play as much as I wish and I’m afraid no one will be there for me. :(
---
TL;DSearch  
---
Nick gave Chance monthly checks for his rent. Soda never redeemed them. Lives there for free.
---
Ryan talked about Soda rejecting ridiculous amounts of money (advertising deals), because it wasn't him / didn't feel right.
---
That sucks man, hope your situation improves.
---
Oh yeah, that's why he'd stop streaming for 1-2 weeks to play on TBC private servers. The money.
---
Its increased by spellpower and shadow dmg increasing talents/items
---
I do not. Good luck
---
Good point.  Imagine how easy it would be for them to tell their followers of sheep to buy up and hoard arcane crystals and monopolize them.
---
Now this is the shit I F5 for.
---
Or pulling bosses while everyone is still eating and drinking ;P
---
Bruh chill. How about this, we both play the game as it was in 1.12 as it will be released this summer. Whoever has more fun wins. 
---
Happy?
---
Shhhh this is NOT what people want to hear right now.
---
This is exactly right. The 3 character limit is only to create the characters 2 weeks before launch. When the game goes live on the 26th for na you can make up to 50 characters right then if you want.
---
It's not going that well at the moment. My strategy is in producing Hexweave Bags and they are selling on my realm for around $800g while a WOW Token is around $120K gold at the moment. 
---
With Alchemy and Tailoring as my main Professions, a Trading Post to buy Fur and maxed out Herb Garden and Mine, I have all the supplies in-house to make my own bags. 
---
My calculations are not complete but I think I need quite a high number of Alts with Garrisons in order to make enough gold each month to buy a Token. I only have one level 110 character with the rest spread from level 90 to 24. I don't think I have enough motivation to level all of them.
---
So random person comes along and decides to corpse camp a streamer. Ten different people do it over the course of two days. How many of them are stream snipers?
---
Looks like a fun use of mechanics. Surely that video isn't indicating insane DPS, right? That seems rather low is all.
---
Yea but his viewer count was never that high before
---
&gt; Plus alliance are just scum
---
Well, I won't argue with that.
---
but it isn't the only option
---
Good luck to you, too!
---
Dude i want to join this super guiild
---
Anyone else remember that shadow priests melt faces
---
The classic wow team is listening to the community.  If big name streamers start coming up with ideas and nobody complains, blizzard might actually implement them.  It's important that members of the community make their voices heard.
---
Blacklists didn't work on 90% of the servers. It's obvious that you didn't play vanilla if you think those stories are true. 
---
Ninja looting was bad but those players could always find a new guild. No one is gonna give a single shit about a little bitches blacklist because he lost a world pvp fight to him
---
he just wants to ban people who can beat him, not everyone watches his stream
---
Two come to mind:
---
1. Sometime around level 45, I saw a player with a Phantom Blade and thought “Wow, that sword looks amazing!” So I went to the AH and splurged on all the mats, then had someone craft one for me, then went out and was meleeing mobs to death with it. The one catch was that I was a Mage. And I was literally trying to kill mobs with auto-attacks and Fire Blast because I thought it looked cool. I had fun, but I feel like such a noob when I think back on that!
---
2. My first run of Molten Core was with an already-established guild (they were up to Domo at the time, I think). I was super excited and was lagging to badly to really fight anyway, so i spent a lot of time just taking screenshots of literally everything (mobs, the runes, lava, walls, etc.) We were Crossing Golemagg’s bridge, and I really wanted a screenshot of his back (because I wasn’t sure if we were even going to see him again since I didn’t know where we were going). So I crept up behind him and got real close...and then aggro’d him from the bridge. I think I even have a screenshot somewhere of him starting to run.
---
Needless to say, we wiped hard, but the raid group was chill about t and laughed it off. When we finally killed Golemagg, I actually got both the Arcanist Robes and the Azuresong Mageblade off of him (yay swords!), which made me absolutely ecstatic.
---
Go look at his stream numbers. In 2017 when he started pubg he had an insane jump. I may have been wrong on the exact numbers, but he went from 6k avg in july, to 20k in August and 30k by september. He wasn't just always walking around as a top 10 streamer because of csgo. His streamer fame os from pubg
---
Dbm yes, but not the point of current dbm drawing stuff on the floor for you, it was just timers. The detailed guides were text based guides written by the top guilds as they tested content and if there were videos they weren’t this massively available thing that everyone used. And videos weren’t guides back then, most videos you could find were kill videos with music dubbed over it with no explanation as to what was going on. The amount of information we have now with the state of what YouTube and streaming has become makes the info so much easier and clear than before, you would have to be a total fool to think that vanilla is actually harder than heroic/mythic from wotlk to current content.
---
[who's the tank](https://youtu.be/2ekLO8BwxwE) is my absolute favourite. I feel like I saw this before tbc. They are talking about onyxia. But it says uploaded 2008. So it might not really be classic.
---
That's what this thread is, a bunch of salty children who act like the server is going to be ruined by someone like Soda who is also one of the only reasons Blizzard even considered making a WoW classic server. Why shouldn't you be able to stream the game? So much autism.
---
They were in beta I think, also I think they were in the original game manual
---
play pve servers. If you roll pvp, accept the corpse camping and stop acting like the rules need to change because it upsets you?
---
&lt;Pirates of the Pancreas&gt;?
---
Dude, those guys are *hard-fucking-core* organized wPVPers, and will absolutely rape every modicum of some amateur streamer fanboi army. I hate PoP with a passion but goddamn I respect them. On the pservers I frequented, they made Eve/Goonsquad look like fucking kittens.
---
The 25% always applies to the three other factions. Also, the information gets posted directly to my website, free for others to use.
---
Thats a really good point I didnt really think about. Im very busy as well and I wouldnt want to let people down not being able to show. I also love to Raid.
---
Absolutely not.
---
im going pvp server. If my hour a day is taken by ganking so be it. Im in no hurry to hit 60
---
You are aware that even if Soda didn't stream this game, all it would take is a /who, followed by a small hunt, to get the same reaction. He would essentially have to go into the WoW equivalent of witness protection, as interacting with any of his friends, whom are also streamers, could reveal his name. It's virtually an unworkable situation across the board.
---
No no no, don't be reasonable. Don't use your brain. He's just trying to ruin the server that he put a shit ton of effort into advocating for and nagging Blizzard about. He's only in it for the money.
---
Say that after someome steals your quest mob and then kills you when you tag it after it spawns.
---
I didn’t play an mmo that did quests the way wow did. Most involved talking to the npc’s and using keywords. Granted I didn’t play every mmo before wow but I played a few of the ones that came before.
---
He said on stream that he was able to buy a house based off his streaming. So yeah for what its worth.
---
This is oc?  It's fucking fire dude.
---
Warlock, you just have to take care with your pet when you jump .So the pet doesn-t aggro the whole instance.
---
Cool. He can take my 8-6 job and I’ll stream.
---
This makes me want to stream snipe him.
---
Commenting for later
---
This is so fucking funny. I love reading these BOOMER ass comments like yours being repeated over and over in this thread. You guys have no idea what streaming entails, what stream sniping is, or anything that this guy is advocating. What he's calling for happened in Vanilla, there were blacklists, and being a douchebag that ninja'd, was a dipshit, or cheated were blacklisted from the top guilds. Streamsniping is a direct form of cheating.
---
Also, it's a joke that everyone here thinks they can just "gank" these streamers. Sodapoppin especially is a great PvP player with more rank 1 titles than I can recall. He'll be way ahead of the leveling curve, be way ahead of the gear, and will be way more progressed. He'll be playing with dozens of other rank 1 players.
---
lmao this is a joke, Sodapoppin would roll you and smoke your ass, then think nothing of camping your corpse for an hour or two while he chats on stream.
---
What race are you?
---
Soda is asking for a cross-faction blacklist. There's an expected amount of communication between the factions with Discord, but this is a whole new level.
---
He is the judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to those who gank him or camp him. He cannot confirm the person killing him is streamsniping, as there is a language barrier. He only thinks they are, and that is apparently enough justification to blacklist them when they have, as far as I'm concerned, done nothing wrong. He wants almost everything that comes with streaming (money, fanbase, and I know he specifically stated that he didn't want any streamer benefits) and none of the consequences that may or may not be amplified by his popularity.
---
**He needs to roll on a PvE server with a secret alt that he can be an "asshole" with off stream camping level 15 players**. He wants WPvP, but **that comes with corpsecamping**. If he cannot deal with the fact that he will be corpsecamped, whether or not it is actually caused by streamsniping (which we can confirm cannot be **proven** unless he finds and speaks to the person who did it), then he needs to roll PvE. 
---
That's it, roll PvE. 
---
There's your solution and you can avoid all of the BS that comes with leveling on a PvP server. He doesn't have to level "fast as fuck", which he would have to do on a PvP server, he can take his time and take in the pixels like he really wants to. Honestly, by the sounds of it, Soda really actually wants to roll PvE. Most long-term benefits on PvE are in line with what he says he wants, he's only missing WPvP which is literally his problem encapsulated. He doesn't like the culture of WPvP.
---
!RemindMe 80 days
---
Dense ass orc
---
Yeah i know it was a joke btw :P yes i will drink water and yes i also will eat reg food and alot of junk food
---
&gt;if you go out of your way to do it all the time to the same person then that should be a problem
---
I have no problem with that lol it’s when people go out of their way to do it day in and day out. Obviously world PvP will happen on a PvP server. There’s a difference between world PvP and stream sniping purely to grief and get some twitch fame like a lot of loser evidently care about. Everyone knows PvP servers have another element of fun to them because of world PvP. 
---
There’s a huge difference between the stream sniper and normal world PvP, I have absolutely no problems with the latter
---
Pretty sure the 12 year olds that would do such a thing can't afford to lose their accounts for personal attacks
---
Warlock or Hunter
---
stream sniping is a streamer problem and the streamer can deal with it their own way, games shouldn't be designed around streamers and their shitty communities
---
Oh yeah, hunting streamers and dedicating hours of your time to them specifically. He's definitely the one sucking streamer dick, huh? What a fucking sperg you are.
---
I think it’s the fear that these streamers won’t announce the server they are rolling. I have a guild of 30 people and I’m terrified if we end up on a streamer server.
---
If anything, they're *better* on pservers than they were in Vanilla. Ret was utter trash as a raiding spec, excepting the extremely well-geared Holy Paladins who respecced in Naxx and got damage boosts because of Undead-specific moves that Ret had access too.

There are pserver addons out there for 2.4.4 (so it can easily be ported to classic/modern engine) that scan your combat log for anything done by enemy players and parses a list of names you created. You can get all sorts of nice flashy warnings all over your screen when someone on your KoS list is nearby. They'll even broadcast to /party /yell etc with your location and the name of the person, their class, estimated current level (based on the ability they're using from combat log) and other things.
---
*Spy* was the name of the one used on most pservers.
---
I'm glad that I'm from EU and dont have to play with soda and other NA streamers on their servers.
---
wow!
---
Kevin Jordan has said on his twitch stream that he stole the idea of the ! for a quest from Metal Gear Solid I believe. Not quite sure about the ? for completed quests though.
---
Priest rolling on that cloak would be offspec roll. I wouldnt roll myself unless nobody else needs.
---
Im not playing Beta so I dont know, but it def was a retail vanilla thing
---
Right? Streamer just needs to git gud
---
I agree with that to an extent. But, in my opinion, WoW is a different thing than games like PuBG, H1Z1, etc. Whether someone knows of a streamer or otherwise through a watching a stream, seeing a youtube video or w/e - odd are if they haven't seen someone through their streams or videos, they will hear of said person via the chat channels and community of the server. 
---
A random gankster rogue will almost never run randomly into a large streamer like Soda - since he will usually have a parade of people around him on his faction. Plus the other faction will be doing nothing but talking about him in /1 chat of that zone. 
---
This whole "buzz" topic of streamers and servers is a joke. There will be players that follow the streamers to the server they decide to roll on, and that server's dynamic will attract people wanting to be apart of that chaos. If people do not want to be effected by someone like Soda, then don't play on the server he's on. What's the big deal?
---
Who gives a shit about streamers? The retards that roll on their servers get what they deserve
---
Good boy haha 😂 I don’t need to do this I got boosters leveling me and doing mc/ony attunement and getting some easy gear, while I level on my alt acc mostly got herbing and stuff. So can take my time :)
---
You can see his unarmed leveling like crazy I doubt he's built to abuse it.
---
And what’s your point? Just because someone does something good doesn’t mean he can’t fuck up something else.
---
To go with the other comment, while it's true that in Classic, Taurens do not have the Orgrimmar flight path from the beginning, I think what happened is that later on in WoW, Tauren do have it from the beginning but not when the zeppelin was added.  That said, it's a cozy ride, so I would take the zeppelin for fun sometimes.
---
According to one of the blizz reps he's one of the biggest factors in getting them to consider making Classic, while that whole petition, getting what's-his-name to sign it, and getting Vanilla streaming banned from Twitch because for a long while Sodapoppin was streaming Vanilla private servers and getting more viewers then all of the other WoW players that were playing the live version.
---
But this sub doesn't know shit about anything, and it's a bunch of boomers yelling at kids to get off their lawn. Meanwhile most of these guys won't hit max level and the few that do won't progress.
---
Yep Submachine wand is awesome
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers...
---
I'm not an MMO historian, but vanilla was the first place I saw "!" be used.  
---
Immediately proceeding WoW, in EverQuest, you had to "hail" an NPC to get their attention for a quest. Then you would write out key-phrases that may (or may not) be \[highlighted\] by brackets in the NPCs' text in order to trigger different responses or quest turn-ins.
---
Hows your asscheeks feel from all that dick riding?
---
Will all raids reset on tue. Or will they use the old 3/5/7 day reset cycle?
---
Like I said I don’t play bfa. Ive quit wow since mop, coming back for classic after a stint on a vanilla private server.
---
I don’t think you understand what all the time means? I’m not talking about your average PvP scenarios here
---
That's not how vanilla works.
---
They can share video card. For like 20 years this has been possible. But they do need thier own power outlet
---
When you find out which ones they end up being, let the rest of us know so we dont roll toons on it too.
---
I know it was definitely there by Cataclysm, though the OP is saying Wrath, which also sounds sort of right, so maybe 3.2 or 3.3 of Wrath.
---
I meant those absurdly strong items don't get replaced till tier 2.5.
---
Soda, venruki, snutz, cdew, talbadar, and toez are just a few streamers who are some of the best pvpers the game has seen. From the PvE side, pretty much every top raid/M+ guild is filled with streamers.
---
Nope, they were bad when it was live too I'm afraid.
---
Decent healing spec though.
---
yes it did? Andorhal shared ninja lists between factions, and even shared KOS lists.
---
This would literally happen back in the day. If a prominent person or guild decided to blacklist you for something you did or didn't do it was out of your control. The thing about social interactions is that they're not all positive, but you can only really get the most rewarding interactions when there is a bit of risk, as in possibility of negative reactions.
---
There really wouldn't be a Classic server without Soda though. Of course all the spergs in this thread have the memory span of a goldfish so they forgot about all the bullshit we had to go through to convince Blizzard to make a classic server. His "wake up call". Lmfao.
---
Pendulum of doom is straight nuts at 40 for wars and shaman.
---
There was a group perfectly following streamers around when they were a ghost. I think the blacklist is really only for stuff like that. 
---
It could be abused of course so there's still a very valid argument against it, but telling streamers to just suck it up isn't a solution either. Ideally blizzard bans the worst offenders like people spamming hate speech trying to get people banned so there's no real need for a blacklist at all.

Especially as a shaman, yes. You might want to look into totem twisting.
---
Wow.
---
Jumping around harvesters in westfall trying to get behind them thinking It made a difference because I saw my brother do it in PvP.... when he saw this he called me an idiot, and told me to get the fuck off the game he wanted to play....
---
Good times.
---
I agree I hate when streamers whine about snipers, I’m sure it is super annoying for them but like...it comes off as vaguely ungrateful. Like it’s a game, just marvel at the fact that you’re so good people watch you play AND people snipe you. They all take such a negative attitude toward it, if he was constantly complaining I could see why you and others lost interest
---
Dang, I completely forgot streamers(or their concerns) were a thing in my anticipation  for classic.  WoW launched before even YouTube, Everything felt organic, huge, and unexplored(not quite like Star Wars Galaxies but still huge).
---
Well, I guess that Classic WoW just lost a little piece of the classic.
---
Do you not think there were giant guilds with 500+ plus players that would listen to the GM if they decided to blacklist someone? There have always been people with large social influence. It part of lIvINg iN a SoCIetY.
---
Dude if the streamer is hanging out with a big ol' school of fish, he's gonna attract a whale. You think big PvP guilds like &lt;Pirates of the Pancreas&gt; won't see this as a direct threat and eat those little fish for lunch?
---
There is *always* a bigger fish looking for a challenge.
---
Fast travel is asking a mage for a port.
---
I levelled my first toon a NE rogue to lvl 18. I then rolled a priest and decided I liked it better. I proceeded to delete the toon. It never occurred to me to at the least vendor the items and mail her money to my new toon.  Wasted gold and later I wanted to play a rogue again so I had to reroll.
---
I watched one of his streams the other day and tons of people were coming up to him in-game saying they were fans and giving him items and gold, which he had no problem taking. Ridiculous that he is fine with all the benefits of streaming but complains and attempts to use influence to eliminate the downsides of it. Kind of pathetic.
---
If I like watching streams it makes sense for me to support streamers. Though I will agree that people who are donating and just trying to get a reaction out of the streamer are doing it for different reasons. Personally if I've been watching a channel for a while I'll just subscribe. 
---
 I will also agree that the bigger streamers who are seriously raking it in don't need my support but I wouldn't call people subbing to any streamer they get a lot of entertainment from stupid given they have the means to do so.
---
I also think the whole "they're just playing a video game" thing is pretty silly. It's probably not the hardest job ever (if you have a naturally entertaining personality) but it is still work. Personally I think I'd rather have my regular job where I'm not on camera all day. That would get tiring very quick.
---
Streamers basically get paid to play. They're likely on just as many hours as any no-lifer.  If a no lifer can surpass a streamer who has their own personal army helping them, I would be surprised.
---
You and I are in the same boat my friend. I really *really* wanna tank. But I just know I wouldn't be reliable. So I may make a tank later on down the line. Just not now
---
Watching people fawn over Asmongold is honestly depressing. I saw a clip recently where they wanted to hold Orgrimmar hostage until Asmongold was given 1,000 gold. Why? Why not some random guy in your raid?
---
This is so poetic it's beautiful.
---
Hey, good luck with the transition to WoW.
---
Every class is able to accomplish something solo at level cap. Those kinds of things tend to be farming resources like herbs and ore, killing mobs for drops to use in professions like Alchemy or Enchanting, or farming reputation with a faction to earn rewards like gear or profesion recipes. Solo PvP like dueling, World PvP, and PuG battlegrounds (10, 15, and 40 man) are also semi-solo options.
---
In WoW, it takes up to about 30 seconds to get full mana back between fights while drinking, and only a couple off-meta specs tend to run out of mana mid fight.
---
Tanking can certainly be a higher pressure role if you're worried about wiping a raid, but raids take 8-14 or so healers to a raid, taking some of the pressure off. Guilds often to healing assignments during fights where highers amount of damage will be taken. For example, you and two others might be healing the same tank.
---
Unfortunately all of the healing classes, Priest, Paladin, Druid, and Shaman, are not great at solo killing mobs in the open world very quickly.
---
Classes like Mages, Warlocks, Hunters, and Rogues might be more up your alley. They are all pure DPS classes that do better solo.
---
Hunters and Warlocks are both pet classes. Warlocks have sustained DoT DPS. Their Affliction talent tree focused on that playstyle. Warriors provide utility through trap CC and an attack damage aura for their allies while Warlocks provide healthstones (extra potions), soulstone (free resurrection / wipe protection for themselves or the healer), and portals to summon their allies.
---
Mages also have the ability to AoE farm starting in the mid 20s, and if that's the kind of solo playstyle you want at 60. [Here's an example of it.](https://youtu.be/dKxSpNS6IBw?t=55) Mages provide utility to a group through the ability to remove curse-type debuffs, conjure food and water, provide polymorph CC, and create teleportation portals to major cities.
---
From what you've described, Warlock sounds like what you're looking for, but Mage and Hunter might also be worth looking into. Oh, and Rogues also have lots of options for solo play at 60 with stealth if that's your kind of thing.
---
I mean yeah, I agree, how sad does your life have to be to actually want to spend hours stream sniping and being a troll. But still, wow has plenty of systems in place to deal with things that *arent* same-faction griefing and I don't think streamers need any more tools
---
With the way this subreddit has acted about anything streamer related for the last couple of weeks I almost want Blizzard to listen to streamers just for the unimaginable amount of salt. 
---
Not getting into the beta has driven this whole sub into a berserking rage.
---
Only a few people if any are gonan get it
---
Well, even if they were in it for the money. It’s just a much of a job as being a comedian, or TV Host. If anyone could be a streamer and be successful there would be a lot more people doing it, but it requires a personality, equipment to start, and typically some skill in the game(s) you play. 
---
A lot of people can get the skill and equipment part down, but personality is where most wannabe streamers fall flat. 
---
Targeted harassment isn’t okay, even if the person is a streamer. None of these people would go out and follow a celebrity around for days on end harassing them, so why is that okay in a game where it can directly impact their job? 
---
These people don’t make any sense, and are just a bunch of keyboard warriors who are afraid of the consequences.
---
It's $free.99, I ain't paying for a flight I can get for free.
---
Well yeah obviously- he played a dying game. Shrould would still get 10k people watching him play ESEA pugs. I imagine you'd see similar growth when looking at overall twitch viewers when pubg came out.
---
Everyone and their mother was playing pubg and everyone that played cs competitively knew Shroud was one of the best fps players in the World. Was only a matter of time before the rest caught on. Saying his fame came out of nowhere is laughable.
---
Doesnt Pikaboo have beta as well? Id honestly say he is one of the best wow players in general.
---
See private servers
---
Rogues do get blind to complete their toolkit, I just yet to see anyone (streamer) on beta who actually knows how to play a rogue. So far the mage guy shows an insane skill compared to the rest and with Ice Barrier it could get nasty. 
---
Warlocks get SL but the meta was Sac so I dont see it helping much
---
Warr MS mages kind of shit all over that
---
Shadow priest maybe........
---
Stormstrike for shamans gives them another chance at RNG every 20 sec. 
---
So to answer your question Rogue should take it if they are very good. But I think mage will win again.
---
My best friend and a GM both said "they're craftsman, they craft things."
---
But I ran deadmines literally thousands of times.  I knew better.
---
Thank yo uso much! Since I have you here which poisons goes on the MH weapon?
---
Dethecus was a wild place back in the day.
---
They want the option of "everyone is in pvp mode when I want them to be but when I want to farm I want to be left alone". If you're on a PVE server you can't just randomly gank everyone you see when you decide to PVP.
---
Umm those same players use to be glads/rank1 ones.
---
All this streamer drama is really making me want to roll rogue for the ganks.
---
Sodapoppins PR team is really working hard on these reddit posts.
---
The Axe, a level 40 weapon at 30 and still did not help. I dont see pendulum swinging too much into warr favour :)
---
Honestly, don’t look anything up. Run around and figure it out yourself, the game will mean so much more to you. Don’t listen to “min/maxing” because it’s not THAT important. Play what you think is fun with what race sounds fun. If you stick to it enough, you can make literally anything viable enough as you grow in skill. Obviously somethings will be better than others, but for the most part so long as your build isn’t absolutely god awful you’ll manage. Save your gold for the mounts, you’ll need every single gold piece to do so.
---
Distracting shot isn't that important for leveling dungeons pre-40 and Mend Pet can be easily replaced with Healing Kits.
---
Hey blizzard, i get donated millions a years to play classic wow, can you please ban that troll cleaning sewer to afford his monthly membership? Thanks in advance!
---
Not all WoW streamers are Asmongold, Alinity, or Mizkif. You can go in the wow section right now and easily find a dozen or more multi R1s/99th percentile Mythic raid parsers, all of whom have as much time as they want to play at launch because it's literally their job.
---
I was consistently the top healer in my guild, by a wide margin, with only other paladins behind me.
---
Yeah, I recovered my old photobucket from when I was a kid hoping to dig up some old screenshots, but this was the only WoW related thing in there.
---
Alexsensual is creating this type of guild.
---
Isn't asmon rolling on pve specifically because he knows he would get camped on pvp servers? Why does soda just follow suit?
---
JM_BP
---
That is pretty good by anyone's standards. He's a smart guy so he probably doesn't do anything too dumb or extravagant which helps keep a reasonable quality of life
---
Yup, i've had plenty of experience with wpvp on a pve server.
---
It's boe everyone who really wants it will get it but that's not the point .  It's a massive power spike.  Shaman can windfury someone classes down in 1 hit with it.
---
I find soda entertaining, but it doesn't change that he's a spoiled kid. Maybe they (streamers who complain because they stream?) should be isolated from the rest of the game, like another realm just for them. This way they'll play with their happy streamer friends and stop abusing their "godly" streamer powers.
---
I was planning on rolling Ally for my main but I also wanted to play as Horde too. I might start a Hordie rogue on a streamer server for ganks.
---
didnt even set it to high settings firsthand? whelp, I guess it adds to the nostalgia
---
The issue is that they think it's the same person. If you're going to be a streamer and get anything done you need to roll PvE. Or else you will always have someone popping in to say 'Hi' with a dagger to the kidneys. It doesn't have to be the same person if you're that popular of a streamer. I'd assume there is the same amount of people who want to be able to say they killed a streamer as there are people who want to interact with the streamer in a positive way (even to go as far as paying 100g just to port them somewhere). Fortunately, Blizzard has a system in place if you would rather be able to get questing, etc. done than have to stop what you're doing and fight for your life. PvE servers. It's honestly that simple.
---
not to mention these leveling dungeons were not remotely balanced to be particularly difficult. they are leveling dungeons FFS, of course people are going to dumpster them when they twink their characters
---
Don't know him, sounds like a generic asshole
---
Hey, clown. Before shitting out crap from your mouth, remember why classic wow is happening.
---
I mean if we're just talking duels warriors have a lot of hard counters but shaman are solid and put out NUTTY damage with this weapon.
---
How would that affect me personally if I play a character in a video game?
---
Sounds like if he wants an "authentic" vanilla experience, he should roll a character that he plays off-stream that people don't know is him.  Whenever he's online, he's going to be impacted both positively and negatively by his status.  It is what it is.
---
Sure i find the stream snipers really fking annoying and i don't like them at all but this idea is just dumb as hell lol, it's not like the stream snipers etc will form their own guild and get their gear that way...
---
You do realize that Sodapoppin has multiple rank 1, glad, titles and most of his friends has many as well. He's also close friends with professional players. Guys that think they're good at PvPing regularly get fucked on by players like Soda.
---
I can't wait for Bitchpoppin to cry on stream when the players that have camped him before keep coming back with better gear.
---
you should really stop crying about what some random dude does in the internet
---
Perplexity? Payo?
---
People never got banned for corpse camping on a PvP server... People never got banned for killing quest givers over and over on PvP or PvE servers. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
Druid. He can heal or tank for a dungeons and stealth alongside you as well.
---
Like it or not, the popularity of online games in 2019 live and die with streamers. If nobody streams classic, it'll be dead in a month.
---
People forget that the Classic stuff only really gained traction after a bunch of streamers made lengthy, passionate videos about it.
---
Ultima online was the same. You had to hail them and talk to them using keywords. Although quests in that game were vastly different until later in the games life. Generally the “quests” were just escorting an NPC from one place to another. Be it a town or dungeon.
---
As a fledgling warrior to make some quick coin early I would accept a quest to take one somewhere, being very selective about what NPC I would choose. As soon as we got out of town I would kill them and take all they had.
---
Cryptstalker is one of the best looking sets in classic but the colors really bring down Dragonstalker while Beaststalker just looks kind of goofy.
---
That addon existed in Vanilla.
---
Esfand is the only one I can watch on the US side. The rest are entitled little pricks.
---
The Brits are pretty entertaining though - Tribe and perplexity. They actually turn off their streams and play so people don’t know their whereabouts.
---
Uhh, I completely disagree with that. I started playing in May of '05 and all throughout Vanilla, TM vs SS was constant chaos. Long after BGs were around.
---
How many brain cells you got left after that one bro
---
the 4th thing must of been the D. Ragecage lol
---
Haven’t seen a streamer that’s good..
---
Absolute asshole.
---
No chance
---
&gt; spergs
---
Oh look, this guy talks like him. How do his nuts taste Grabbles?
---
This is where the fun begins.
---
If you weren't looking at your buddies screen you weren't trying to win. 
---
One of my favorite maps in all games is from Halo CE, the one with 2 ships opposite each other, and the floors all had red or blue numbers showing exactly where you were (Boarding Action???) 
---
Information is available to everyone, trying to make rules against screenpeeking is just unenforceable and only will lead to fighting.   Just steer into the slide and embrace it.
---
Oh lol
---
Hey bro, just wanted to tell you you're an absolute legend. I still check your old site occasionally for the laughs.
---
Thomas Jefferson Chance Morris IV deserves to get ganked. That name sounds so waspy
---
Expect warriors + support to dominate group fights. Warriors were already good in 30 wsg, at 40 with mortal strike and whirlwind and pummel they are a much more powerful class. Shamans now get WF totem which is a nice buff to horde warriors.    
---
Warlocks still don't have deathcoil and if they get soul link they lose all other trees which is pretty bad. They probably won't be that impressive.   
---
SPriests/Frost mages will be the main go to in duels I think - they both have very good single spec tree classes. Rogues still are in a pretty awkward spot but at least they have blind now.   
---
BM Hunters should be pretty good too but once gear gets twinked at 40 I don't think they'll worry mages/spriests much.
---
Seriously!? "Hey, Blizzard! You multi billion dollar company. I dislike this thing that happens, that is unique to less than 1% of 1% of your player base. Change it to fit my views." 
---
What a cunt.
---
How can you prove they are streamsniping?
---
People corpse camp whenever they feel like it. It can be a person who just targets you because they don't like your name or race or class. [Perhaps, because you camped their level 15 brother last night for 2 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk&amp;t=4m06s), and they recognized the name and decided to do that right back at you. There are plenty of different motivations behind corpse camping, and they are as varied as the social situations in Classic WoW can get.
---
People corpse camp for indeterminate amounts of time. Being a streamer who got corpse camped for an hour does not make you special. Maybe they were covering a lower level friend who needed the mobs where you were?
---
**Hell, the language barrier in Classic makes it impossible for the person to even admit that they did it in game.**
---
You only **think** that someone is streamsniping you. You literally can't prove it until the person admits in via Discord, and you might as well just talk to them about stopping while you're there (off stream, of course). Maybe use that conversation to try to get them for griefing?
---
**That's why I'm SO OPPOSED to a cross-faction blacklist.** They, for most cases, are doing nothing wrong and you cannot prove that they are in fact targeting you using your stream. You can only guess that they are. The best you can do is get them banned or suspended for griefing **which is fine**. If you report an incident to a GM about being corpse camped for an hour or more, and they think it is malicious and not just people trying to farm Honor or something, then they can take action, **NOT the person who is getting directly affected by the griefing.**
---
It's all about who doles out the whooping. In almost any scenario for WoW, the person who was wronged will use that bias to give out punishments far beyond the one that is likely deserved. THAT is showing the streamer privilege. Just because you get X amount of people watching your stream doesn't make you important enough to punish the person who you **think** was streamsniping. Report it to a GM if you think it is griefing, and if possible, submit your footage as evidence. 
---
They, the streamers, are just another group of players, and treating them as anything other than that **is streamer privilege**. That is doubly so since they get as much good as they get bad, whether or not the good is always in game.
---
Check Warblade from Argent Dawn.
---
Lead a raid of raids to the gates of stormwind, clear it of NPCs and corpsecamp all allies who dare ress within the city wall. 
---
I would claim it for the horde and just rule it for half an hour. Maybe some slave NEs and humans could be left alive to do /dance. 
---
Also everyone thinks I'm supercool and smart. Ooh also I win money because of this for some reason.
---
Yeah, I played BC from basically the start. Didn't play Vanilla, because I thought RPGs aren't my thing. 
---
We knew ninja looting people's names. We all used a server wide chat. Wasn't hard. Weren't that many.
---
How he suggests, it would most likely work. 
---
Especially with Google Docs at everyone's fingertips and &gt;&gt;30k pairs of eyes.
---
That list would only be filled with idiots.   
---
You won't be on there if you can kill a streamer several times in a fair fight after you randomly met them in-game. Or if you kill the mobs the streamer was going to kill or when you stole an ore.  
---
There is a vast difference between Soda's suggested blacklist and the social score in China.
---
If you're scared of false positives - you can prevent those by using a strike (and voting [overkill]) system.
---
Ur a fuckin dipshit lol
---
Everyone that kills me in Counter Strike should be banned.
---
1-6. Shift 1-6. Alt 1-6
---
Mouse buttons. What i do. Anything that i use very rarely i wont bother hotbaring
---
Eyup.
---
Even if he wasn't every PVPer on his server is going to gank the shit out of him at every opportunity.
---
It's just what you do to whiny bitches.
---
All the clickers.
---
Use modifiers
---
Idk I've killed Payo in that yeti cave a bunch of times
---
personally i hate using alt and control on the keyboard i bind alt, shift and control to my mouse and then bind the less used spells/cooldowns to modifier keys.   
---
I bind my most popular abilities to QERFGZXC1234 But have all those buttons as modifiers too.
---
Stop defending your shitty meme. Just take your 47 updoots and go please.
---
get yourself a mouse with just two buttons, opened up another world of potential easy to click spells.
---
I only say Payo play, was not impressed. No stun trackers, no tick trackers, no Macro.
---
Took a look at Perplexity and from what I can see at least he has the right tools, UI and so on. Maybe, maybe.
---
He isn't using Seal of Righteousness and has full ret gear instead of spell power gear. The minimal damage for SoR I believe is 20 so normalization doesn't affect it. With spell power you convert 10% of that into the SoR damage not including talents like Sanc aura, imp SoR, imp JoC, and Vengeance. All of this combined with BiS spell power gear you can probably see 400-500 dps unbuffed going into MC.
---
1. My first toon was a mage and I leveled as fire. It was fun but so incredibly slow. Had to eat and drink after almost every pull.
---
2. I switched servers and levelled a priest to 60 since I figured it would be easier to get into a raiding guild than my mage. I spent months doing all the blue dungeons and collecting all my tier 0. I thought I needed it to apply to a raiding guild. Turns out I was better geared than most of the guilds healers as they were only 2 or 3 bosses into MC.
---
Agreed. You can’t really prove stream sniping and Classic was full of people who’d camp you for twenty minutes, lose you, then you’d see them an hour later and they’d camp you again. A streamer will instantly blacklist that person.
---
I remember this song.
---
What the hell is a soda popping
---
Just start binding. If you click it 4/5 times but manage to press the bind 1 time it's progress. Eventually it will feel natural.

It's like when I play the electric bass which I used to do in a band - I don't play any song for 6 months but as soon as I have the instrument in my hand and the song goes on I usually manage to play it. My fingers just move by themselves from the muscle memory.
---
I did the same thing, wasn't particularly unusual at the time. Feral was complete trash before the talent rework and innervate was seen as the one good thing druids got, hurricane was a meme. So yeah many people just levelled as resto.
---
First step may be to buy an mmo mouse. Those PC mouses with a calculator slapped on the side will give you plenty of buttons. If that isn’t an option then use your standard’s mouse wheel for bindings. Wheel up, wheel down and mouse 3(squeeze the wheel) for three extra buttons. 
---
From your keyboard use the Q,E,1,2 if you can’t  move your fingers too much. That’s a total of 7 bindings which is enough for your main abilities but not for emergency options.
---
Its like a  &lt; .1% drop chance from certain mobs in Uldaman.  Not exactly common.
---
Cheers.

Fantastic. My group of buddies is getting back together as well. Few of us built new PCs out of excitement. Classic will be an excellent way to shoot the shit and have a great time.
---
You’ll catch me with tailoring/enchanting making wands for all the newbie casters. Gotta make that sweet, sweet silver.
---
fuck that guy. fuck streamers that think they have a controlling interest in a game. and fuck anyone one that thinks they should be protected by a corporation.
---
Yes it is 52 Agi for 1% crit, and 41 gets you most of the way there (it's around .8% crit).  I'm not saying Ashkandi isn't good for a hunter.  Just that I don't think it's "BIS until Naxx" even in a PvP setting, because in a PvP setting most of your damage will still be coming from shots even if you get in the occasional raptor strike.
---
I'm playing a rogue, carebearz, you might have seen me get killed on a few streams. The big thing is I see a lot of is rogues not reserving energy for kicks. If you just chain spam SS against a caster without a bit of energy in reserve you die. Also a lot of rogues either aren't eng or aren't carrying iron grenades and solid dynamite. 
---
If I'm rezzed and eating expecting to get jumped or need to jump soon I always have an explosive sheep up because the CD starts after you drop it not after it blows up, and it lasts 3 min.
---
It seriously is annoying.. I like this sub but the constant whining about streamers gets really old. 
---
There are plenty of streamers outside of Asmongold and Soda, (Snutz, Cdew, Venruki, Ziqo), that never complain about stream sniping and are just enjoying the beta and giving the game exposure. Not to mention half the shit Asmon says isn't said seriously and is meant to rile people up - which is clearly working. 
---
These people have invested their entire lives into the game, makes sense that they get some sort of preferential treatment.. some of them even work for Blizzard as casters/etc. 
---
Stop crying about streamers, in the end they are not going to affect you at all when the game actually releases.
---
What did they do before with betas?
---
High end guilds will have a good 2 months of loot (8 full MC runs + many more Onyxia clears)  over a casual guild.  They will also have World boss loot and PvP reward loot.  The casual guild will also likely be DKP and have greater turnover, which will also make the loot not always get into the hands of the correct people.  
---
The casual guild might be clearing MC in time before BWL but a lot of them might disband before it gets cleared.
---
When the level cap is 40 theres gonna be a lot of people grinding ulda.  I really don't get the point of these posts like people are gonna have pod if they do a duel tourney lol.
---
this is what lightforge helm looked like later [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/76603.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/76603.jpg)
---
i remember logging on that day and hating the way my paladin looked, looked like i was employed by mc donalds all the sudden, used to be a badass look.
---
You are unironically wanting someone to get account banned because they walked around in a video game. Not because they used size buffs as a tauren to obstruct game objects (mailboxes anyone) preventing normal gameplay. But because they walked around an area a duel was happening.
---
Should we start banning people who use the /train emote on streams because thousands of people are watching the stream? Or the piccolo from the Tram quest on alliance side? Just because people are watching **optional** content created solely by players doesn't mean that you can ban someone for doing absolutely nothing against any rule in the entire game. No harassing messages were sent, no spam inviting, just walking around.
---
Yeah to be a good shaman you can just click most of your totems and only have the main ones keyboud, (tremor, grounding, earthbinding, WF, that kind of stuff) to be an amazing shaman you would want every totem key bound. I would suggest grouping them into PVP and PVE groups and maybe by types so you don't get confused and overwrite one by accident.
---
Mind soothe is insane actually
---
You mean bandages?  
---
I mean yes, but mend pet is going to be a lot cheaper and faster than bandages in the long run.
---
probably venruki what a god
---
Well, there we go.
---
I'm going to kill everyone.   I won't be streaming.
---
Get rid of keyboard turning, move strafes to A,D. This frees up Q and E.  You also have R, T, F, G, Z, X, C, V readily accessible, along with 1-5 and 6 if you prefer.  Mouse buttons generally have a browser back and forward button. The middle mouse button can click in, if you're fine with that.  Also, you can rebind mousewheel up and down if you keep your distance maxed at all times.
---
Then there are modifiers: shift, alt, ctrl.  Shift and ctrl make it easy for Q, E, and so forth.  Pending your keyboard, alt might be the better modifier for 1-5, as well as that first letter row Q, E, R, T.  Any modifier is easy to use with your mouse buttons. 
---
You will also find you may not bind everything.  Also, do note if you decide to do some off healing, you don't need to get all your multiple ranks on the visible bars.  You can swap the main action bar (default Shift mousewheel down or the little arrow on the right side).  So, you can set up healing there, and while you are in raid, you can just get rid of those abilities you don't use and have 12 new abilities with all those heals for the same keybinds.
---
Level to 60 as prot paladin
---
Yeah i was in one of them :)
---
Chance has always been a crying bitch. Don't give him any spotlight
---
Gross.
---
You wouldn't panic more not having a mount at 40?
---
Always your highest rank Instant Poison. Crippling or Instant on the OH, depending on whether or not you're farming mobs that run.
---
The servers are fundamentally different from vanilla.
---
Im a warr but yes he made me alt rogue.

---
Yeah...fuck Kansas
---
Any stream sniper could figure out where someone is, its not difficult. Anyone who is stream sniping isn’t a noob either, they know what they’re doing, and they know how to and could figure out how to get the streamer.
---
Also camping players could have potential ramifications depending on how severe it is.
---
TBh the main reason he ranted on this was due to the trollgodx guy being super annoying in the tourney (standing in front of all the competitors to block everyone view) . I have nothing against stream snipers who just pvp cause thats the point of opposing sides within a pvp server, soda doesn't even die to snipers too much and usually got his own personal army anyways.
---
&gt; beckon call
---
Beck and call is the correct way to spell this phrase. To be at someone's beck and call means you are ready to obey their orders or commands. Beckon call is not the correct way to spell the phrase.
---

"i plan on rushing sulfuras once i hit 60 so i need to get started early"  
---
- literally everyone
---
Streaming is the worst thing that happen to online gaming.
---
And that's supoosed to make their more toxic behavior okay? Because it doesn't.
---
You would have to be pretty delusional to think your better than all the streamers, some of these people steaming won the blizzard tournaments. Some are very good. But in saying that, most steamers, Like most players, are bad too, they're just popular because of their personality or that they give out good info and are interactive with their stream.
---
1-6, Z, X, C , V, Q, E, R, T, G
---
Shift+1-6, Shift+Q, W, E, R, T, G, D, F, C, V
---
CTRL+1-6, CTRL+E, R, F, G, D
---
you can also use ALT as well, but, that should cover most of your abilities that you wanna bind.
---
As /follow works in Classic world PvP, I'd bet money that Prepared will be back
---
You'd need to know the name of his character for this to work. If he didn't name himself soda or chance because he wants people to know who he is then that wouldn't be an issue.
---
You can and should be able to rebind QERTSFGHZXCV I don’t have massive hands but no issue reaching those letters,  also you should only go 1-5 maybe 6 and use alt control or shift, depends what bars you find most comfortable, I ctrl and shift personally. But it’s sort of inevitable you’ll have some spells you might not have binds for just try your best.
---
Honestly who the fuck cares.
---
If you join a server with streamers to purposely streamsnipe and gank a streamer, expect them to retaliate.
---
If it's in the game, it should be allowed.
---
You can gank the hell out of someone all you want, but if the streamer community wants to exclude you they can go for it. I'm definitely sure people will still invite you to groups who form their own community aka your suggestion 'The Blacklist'.
---
If you don't want to be exposed to this type of drama the answer is simply enough to not join their 'streamer server'.
---
I'm fine with playing with streamers, but I probably won't join their server only for the reason that streamer servers can die easily if a streamer quits or moves to another server and all the followers of that stream follow. eg: swifty leaving darkspear.
---
You sir, are not interesting, I wish you the best.
---
No one got blacklisted for ganking the enemy faction. We griefed entire guilds lmao, did YOU play vanilla ?
---
You sir, are not interesting, I wish you the best
---
Yeah, but it’s the time/week that’s the problem. Raiding with my main and a full time job in a tech startup ☺️
---
My man!
---
https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/
---
All of them are there.
---
its insane how dishonest you guys are about what happens to big streamers, downplaying it so hard when its genuine griefing (and sometimes harassment) normal pvp gameplay is fine, the extent that some people go to ruin a streamers experience is not
---
I believe we owe that to Omar and the boys over at Nostralius more
---
Because the difference being is that a normal, non-streaming player does not have a live broadcast of their location at all times. Doesnt matter if it's a streamer or not. If someone had a third party program telling them exactly where you were at all times and they used that to ensure you could no longer play the game, youd get annoyed too. I dont give a fiddler's fuck about twitch or anything going on there, but even if I did I wouldnt let my disdain for any one person keep me from seeing how that is blatantly not a good thing.
---
1. How does a ninja list matter to the other faction? Are they going to run instances with that toxic player?
---
2. How does a KOS list matter to the other faction? Are they going to spam duel invites or avoid this person because of a KOS list borne from PvP confrontations? You can't even roll onto the opposite faction on the PvP servers that this would mostly happen.
---
Both of those lists have a small impact on the player in question.
---
What Soda is suggesting is a cross-faction blacklist in a server that is going to have multiple cult followings of streamers in the server. Soda is friends with a lot of streamers. For example, say Soda tells Esfand that this guy Porcupog was **supposedly** streamsniping him yesterday and to blacklist him, and Esfand talks about that on stream and about how bad this guy is. Suddenly, word starts to spread of this guy, **who may or may not have been streamsniping** (you cannot **prove** someone streamsniped, only that you **think** they streamsniped) that they are not to be interacted with.
---
That is much different than sharing KOS or ninja lists. The loot between factions doesn't matter at all for the opposite faction of the ninja looter and KOS lists barely affect the person's play experience on their faction. Having an entire server full of (mostly) streamer viewers makes them far more susceptible to influence when it comes to this stuff, which is why this is such a big f-in' problem.
---
most of them have no tick timer or stun timer, how can you play a rogue without both. 
---
With blind you dont even need engineering. You can literally lock their class, force a trinket and blind for a resap and kill. I honestly think only mages and lucky stun resists from shamans with a well placed poison cleansing totem stand a chance.
---
iirc, 
---
PvP problems on PvP servers aren't considered griefing or harrasment since you have PvP solutions to them (in otherwords, kill em yourself or have friends help you)
---
there were some enterprising players on pvp servers back in original classic that would lock down entire zones,   
---
 [https://darkone.network/stuff/Angwe/](https://darkone.network/stuff/Angwe/) was a notable one and became more or less a force of nature for lowbie players to deal with.
---
If someone makes a point to gank streamers, who by nature of their profession have a target painted on their back. Conversely, due to the nature of their profession, have followers and friends that they can call on for assistance to return any harassment in kind. 
---
Personally, if reddit is anything to go by, I think there will be somewhat equal sides on either side in that there will be a lot of players gunning to kill streamers and sizeable amount stepping up to defend them. 
---
if streamers don't like being singled out, that's their business to figure out a solution and not Blizzard's (an obvious one is to roll on a pve server). Classic wasn't built for streamers, it was built for people who love WoW and want to replay the original on a Blizzard supported server. 
---
Changing the rules of Classic to cater to people who stream is very much not in the spirit of that design goal and Blizzard would instantly alienate a lot of the people who have been fighting tooth and nail for Classic servers for years now, having an untouchable class of players on pvp servers who already likely enjoy the luxury of celeb perks (fans giving them items, gold, helping them with high level quests, etc) isn't going to happen.
---
Neither are your unoriginal thoughts.

---
That is the epic sword from Strath UD?
---
\+1.  Why would you skip utility spells that give you new and interesting mechanics that increase the fun of your time playing the game?  To need one or two less grey drops to afford a mount at 40?  Seems like a bad trade.
---
What if you could look at your friend's screen but they couldn't look at yours? It's a slightly different situation and gives one side an advantage. I wouldn't have as much fun at that point even if they made looking at their screen an option as a side effect of something else.
---
Their spergs will probably already be doing that and then if you interfere they'll kill you aswell

Wait wait wait... so you're now using Sodapoppin's ideas about blacklisting assholes from progression as a soapbox so you can blacklist the people you see as asshole from progression? Who's the bigger asshole anyway? The asshole who stream snipes, the asshole who wants people to do something to stop stream sniping, or the asshole who gets offended that someone dared to speak out against assholes and now wants to gather up a whole bunch of people to stream snipe them?
---
Look, I don't really care how you play the game, I don't care if you do form a guild and stream snipe to your heart's content. I Just want you to realize that doing so makes you an asshole too, and an even bigger one than the guy who complained about it.
---
Half of his chat interaction is him basically saying "You are all autistic retards and i hate all of you." though.
---
&gt;	Being a streamer who got corpse camped for an hour does not make you special.
---
This isn’t about an hour corpse camp. Or even one day. This is about people continually doing it for days, weeks, months, or god forbid years. 
---
&gt;	They, the streamers, are just another group of players, and treating them as anything other than that is streamer privilege. 
---
So, if someone griefs someone who isn’t a streamer for days, or weeks on end, that’s fine then? 
---
There’s plenty of ways to prove they’re stream sniping. All Blizzard would have to do is take a glance at the logs. If someone is constantly going to X’s position and causing a disturbance for however long, they’ll have a record of that. On top of streamer vods, chat logs, etc. 
---
As for the streamer, make records of it on their own. “X name camped for Y minutes/hours today”, make clips of the people in question, etc. 
---
There is quite literally no need for a direct admission at all, and that’s just an idiotic thing to say. That’s like saying you can’t arrest someone until they admit they’ve done something illegal, even with evidence proving they did.
---
You're only making the target on his back bigger. The prize is too great -- just look at the number of votes on this very post about organizing a rival guild specifically to hunt them. If streamers cry foul and organize to defend themselves, it will only keep growing. And I'm sorry but my money is on the sniper side. The *real* professionals of organized griefing in MMOs (Goons/Brooms, Dreddit, PoP) are something he should very well fear.
---
But we don't have to speculate, we'll get to see it soon. Personally, I've seen both sides of the battle and I'm fucking excited.
---
It’s probably the TCP nagle algorithm you’re talking about(disabling it will send more packages instead of batching them). This will still work if it’s enabled, but I’m not sure wow uses TCP as the network protocol anymore. 
---
Someone else here might have more info about that 😊
---
Thats what some thread from twitch said
---
I could be wrong but i did see that.
---
Compared to today’s trash talk, the picture is like giving someone a hug
---
it's the opposite: Retribution is *worse* in Classic then it is on private servers.
---
i know there's a popular video of a 'Spelladin' rolling around that shows him doing 1100 DPS in Phase 3 BiS, but, more realistically, it'll be half that, simply due to the nature of private servers procs being increased, certain things being bugged, etc.
---
Retribution only moves out of "bad" and into "mediocre" when you start getting into Naxxramas and you can start using your Undead-only damaging spells... and that's only if you're geared to the teeth.
---
that said, it's not like you can't find a raiding guild as Retribution, just... don't be surprised when they ask you to heal.
---
Their behavior isn't toxic and that's extremely ironic considering this entire toxic thread.
---
I understand
---
I love PvP and was pretty decent with my rogue in tbc. I was too young during Vanilla to know wtf I was doing though. Classic release not having BGs until later phases just meams more time for wpvp.
---
Gamers rise up against streamers. 
---
You are actually retarded.
---
should make this into a copy pasta, it sure looks like one.
---
But that would mean I would have to play on eu servers.
---
Tell that to evry character I've leveled
---
You were reading it correctly. MCP is BiS.  
---
Source: I'm a mod in the discord.
---
I'm here from /r/popular. I have no idea who this guy is but I do know that stream sniping is shitty.
---
Thing is, how do you prove it? If you can prove it, sure, by all means punish them, throw the god damn book at them. Fuck 'em, they're assholes and they should get nothing. You can't though, you can't prove it so you can't do fuck all except work with whatever game mechanics are present to minimise it. Run an overlay to block your minimap, the server that you run on, your character name, whatever. Outside of that, there's not much that can be done.
---
Vanilla used to exponentially increase your ping the higher it was due to nagling been enabled. Things like:  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13581-LeatrixLatencyFix.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13581-LeatrixLatencyFix.html) 
---
disabled it, but yeah ping times are alot lower now. I dont believe it does anything.
---
Something about these streamers. I like them for a day or two, and it doesn't take long for me to really dislike them. Idk. Are there any streamers that aren't total asshats? The only one I've been watching is Joana, but he doesn't stream very often.
---
Is that not just everyone of the opposite faction?
---
if you're a classic hunter that doesn't immediately buy both Eagle Eye and Eyes of the Beast, I don't ever want to fucking talk to you.  Go play Warlock.
---
It's more like being one of those celebrities whose career relies on a gimmick, and when it passes they become entirely unknown and have to live like normal people.
---
Soda will become the god of the new world. He'll take a potato chip... and eat it!!!!!!!!!
---
meowsouls
---
...actually that's pretty good.
---
Same exact feeling here. I really WANTED to play rogue, but after trying one at 60 it'a a snooze fest (2-3 buttons, slow resource gain).
---
Fury warrior feels slightly better at 60 (rage feels better than energy, a bit faster gameplay, more buttons) but all classes are slow/easy in Classic compared to Retail.
---
Most likely a german will detect another german who is typing in english just based of the syntax and general typing habits. After that it is always like: Are you german? And then the conversation will switch into the german language. I think we germans feel way more confident in expressing ourselfs in our own language even though the most of us speak english fluently.
---
for old school splitscreen games like goldeneye, I can't even imagine how that was possible.  
---
If you are at like a LAN party doing Halo CE or any other game, with multiple screens, then yeah its cheating and fuck that person.
---
hes just as much of a troll as anyone ganking him. fuck his rich ass.
---
People will end up blacklisted. The streamer wont give two shits to realise it and will use their authority
---
Hope you don't have a popular name in mind caus eyou just reminded 1000s of people to log in that day lol
---
yeah
---
Doesn't sound too too much different from the current meta. I thought the warriors having WW was gonna make them super nasty, but it just hasn't. They've given me very little trouble as a rogue. You're right about frost mages and spriests though. Even getting a jump on either class I have little faith in winning. That priest bubble just soaks up so much damage, and has such a low cooldown it's nuts.
---
Remember when battle masters didn’t exist and you had to go to the big entrance to queue? The world pvp in those zones increased even more. It was so much fun, and more effective than waiting for battleground.
---
Which is exactly what they're for. Now I love PvP servers but I know what I'm getting myself into when I make a character there. If a steamer decides to play on a PvP server, they need to be prepared for ganks, especially if they're broadcasting their location to the world in real time.
---
World pvp is great and Id love to see some huge battles take place. Streamer wars would be fun as hell. 
---
I wouldnt really care to watch a stream soley based around stream sniping/ganking/camping streamers though.
---
Lol really soda is NOT the reason for fucking classic. Go back to subbing each month in hopes he remembers your name
---
Literally said "pussy" out loud to myself watching this. What. A. P U S S A A Y Y Y
---
so he's a ret pally
---
eL oH eL
---
He isn’t owed both streaming and not being bothered by stream snipers. There are multiple solutions to his problem, but instead he wants special treatment from Blizzard. Besides, corpse camping, ganking, and graveyard camping are not against TOS. How do you prove someone is a stream sniper and not just a ganker? Just blacklist every person who attacks him while prowling? I don’t hate him at all, but his take on this is ridiculous.
---
Thank you :) I did some more research and I think I got the idea wrong in the first place, it's not particularly about weapon damage. It's about getting all those procs to happen (which scale from Spell power). Those -other- weapons are just for when your time with MCP is over. Is that correct?
---
Although if that's the case, wouldn't it just be better to burn another MCP and forgo another weapon entirely?
---
Incorrect. It's always worst to best. MCP is BiS, even above Thunderfury and etc.  
---
The only time a weapon comes close to MCP is if Ironfoe has a 10% proc rate AND can proc off itself. Thunderfury is not better than MCP. Ashbringer is not better than MCP.  
---
All the weapons besides MCP are for use on trash, becuase using MCPs on trash is both dumb, unreasonable, and largely impossible. They'll also be used on fights that last longer than 90 seconds but shorter than \~150 seconds.
---
You being so bad at levelling that you have mount money before you hit 40 has nothing to do with what the average person will experience
---
Yeah agreed...have to be able to take the good with the bad.
---
"You get the perks of being a streamer, and one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you." 
---
Holt shit, can't believe anyone actually believes this bs. Apparently this sub has a lot of entitled people that want their 15 seconds of glory/fame. He's a "famous" person so he shouldn't mind the headhunting, he gets to be "famous" and I don't so it's only fair. I hope you're not older than 15yrs old and even then it'd still be pathetic. Not a fan of sodapoppin and have not even seen 5min of stream combined but you're so pitiful it's embarrassing. Him being wrong about the amount of times people snipe him just make him a whiner irl, that doesn't affect the game as does stream snipers. "I don't like streamer but I can't ignore him because I still get advantage for watching, and now streamer I don't like wants to take my god given perks, wahhhhhhhhh"
---
Yeah as a rogue I was expecting to get roflstomped by warriors. Using The Butcher and ironspines hammer which is really good but not +10 levels good. I'm pretty even against some pretty geared warriors it seems.
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
He's saying that there's nothing more "Vanilla WoW" than a level 60 hunter who is just decked out enough to be annoying going to cause problems in STV.
---
It's not about good vs careless. It's about skilled + rocks up on time with right gear and spec + puts in during progression raids vs someone who doesn't do those things. As you pointed out, the content isn't hard. The hard part is getting 40 people to show up on time and prepared and focused.
---
I changed guilds early TBC and for TBC I was in top world 50 for every kill in T5,T6 when the game had 7+ million subs. The biggest difference between that and my more casual guild was the attitude. People wanted to be the best. They'd show up, put in the effort, push hard, etc. Part of that mentality was that most people just didn't want to play crappy specs and they didn't want others in the raid doing it either. If you're burning tons of gold to get 10% more dps while would you invite a class that's only going to be doing 55% of your dps?
---
If you're not in a top tier guild there will be a lot more leeway to play feral dps if you can simply show that you will rock up on time and put in effort when it needs to be put in (progression).
---
They are weapons for trash, don't worry. MCP is king. They are only listed because they are technically better than things like Ironfoe/Blade of Hanna ON TRASH.
---
Doesn't this zone have that chicken beacon thing that is a high percentage drop?
---
&gt;Troll Paladin
---
wat
---
&gt;2 days 18 hours to get to lvl 120
---
WAT. Level 120. Yeesh.
---
&gt; Mag'har Warrior
---
I don't know what that is, but it sounds like a centaur faction, which would be pretty cool.
---
Monk reminds me of Everquest. At least Tauren Monk seems like it would make sense, with their spiritualistic steak plus their physical strength. I'm guessing they retconned monk fluff into the lore.
---
XP potions . . . please don't tell me that's some sort of microtransaction for an XP boost.
---
Go to bed mom! Also, thanks pal.
---
Nah. But I'd watch a YouTube video of stream sniping if you show their reactions.
---
&gt;  pay attention
---
 i'd camp him
---
You contradict yourself in 2 sentences
---
Ok and we trust these streamers to be 100% accurate with their “blacklist” and not abuse it? Oops ganked a streamer now a large portion OF MY OWN FACTION won’t play with me.
---
It's only witch hunting if you made up the reason he's being condemned for, like how they would call someone they didn't like witch to get rid of them. It's not witch hunting if he is being condemned for his own actions.
---
Maybe we were just... bad at the game?  I know I for sure was.
---
This entire thread is missing the point that there is a difference between ganking and stream sniping.
---
Ganking is finding someone randomly and deciding to camp their body.
---
Stream sniping is watching somebodies stream and following them *all over azeroth*, always being 1 step ahead because you literally know every move they make. 
---
Not saying they should be denied all content period- but blacklists have existed since true Vanilla, and this behavior fits the criteria for being blacklisted 100%.
---
Act like an asshole, people avoid you. Simple as that.
---
Lol I'm guessing your name is Aiden? Seems like a WOW-y spin on a name.
---
Seems dumb that rules are up for interpretation, but probably explains why i was instantly perma'd for saying sperg.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Griefing What part of what you sent invalidates this?
---
What item gives you shadoeform effect?
---
Oh. Hey.
---
Yeah nothing new has been posted in /new for a bit, might post a rant about streamers, seems like the in thing to do.
---
Specifically Eye of the Beast and Eagle Eye haha. There's *only one rank* for each of them. That's 24 silver.
---
I want to see it in PvP.  If someone can prove it to work in the beta and that can be recorded, they would probably leave it in rather than change the game.  Do any streamers play pally?  It's probably worth reaching out to one.
---
You're entitled to an opinion, however wrong it may be :D
---
You are both right and wrong. I'm going to make a real boi comment in this thread and link it to you here in an edit.
---
I haven't touched wow in years, but where do I sign up for this?
---
I started in TBC and never played classic wow, so this is a cool way for me to kill two birds with one stone.
---
I'm serious. OP where do i sign up?
---
How do I apply? Also, I think that Against All Authority sounds cooler \^\^
---
Blizzard created this mess by intentionally inviting "influencers" instead of keeping it purely random. Thats why people are salty.
---
Here's a decent one for Hybrids, especially if you primarily heal:
---
Use help/harm modifier in macros to change certain spells depending on if you're targetting/mousing over friendly players or enemies, 
---
My primary keybinds 1-6 all double-up on my priest between flash heal/smite, greater heal/holy fire, renew/shadow word: pain etc etc
---
Hang on I'm gonna make a big boi comment stand by.
---
Don't worry, I'll be playing a Holy Paladin.  There are people out there like me looking forward to... oh god.  I'm going to be a buffbot aren't I?
---
That's what captivated me the most when i started playing. Going from PS2 games to this was like a religious experience. Opening up the map after exploring the first zone was like oh shit this is gonna be my new life lol.
---
Yea I'm almost on that boat too.  Like if I roll on a random server and its the 'streamer server', I am going to reciprocate all bullshit.
---
Damn son coulda just ran with it and I’d be more impressed. Still impressive you have it still. Cheers mate!
---
The difference is focusing, stop pretending to be so dense
---
Yeah when I talk about mythic raiding I am talking about the entire thing.  Stuff like the world first race is definitely a lot more serious.  Although even in that case being a good world first guild is more about being able to play a very long time versus play with a large amount of skill
---
This may be allowed by Blizzard, but actually is *not* allowed by Twitch. Brazen stream-sniping of streamers by other streamers is Twitch bannable. Can't make it the theme of your stream.
---
The fact that it's got a set date is nice, but its still a few months after what people were waiting for it to show up (like, right around now, late spring/early summer) and WAY later than what people had hoped for (closer to last christmas time-frame).
---
It also doesn't help that theres the beta is taunting people with videos of what they 'could' be playing, rather than just giving us the damn game.
---
Also, a lot of people either dropped private servers or stopped playing them as they previously did (i.e. normal raiders turned level speedrunners in anticipation). The quitters (like me) were likely doing it because they didn't want to be burned out when it happened, but didn't expect to wait this long (read above) and the speedrunners are feeling the same waiting game, just wanting to finally make a character that's usable/real.
---
SubmersibleGoat, please tell me that’s a Tauren Druid
---
Feralas is my favorite zone of all time.
---
Looks like this is correct 1.12.1 behavior, judging by the Thottbot comment: https://i.imgur.com/tBLVpsN.jpg
---
Hi, /u/Contempt4All
---
So you can get banned for killing someone in a game where you are supposed to kill people? That’s so catabolic.
---
Aaah Saltshire, aka the Noob Cemetery.
---
You lied they all have full mana.
---
I mean, we try to be as objective as possible, but there isn't a perfect rubric by which we can make every decision. Some level of subjective decision making comes into the modding process although we avoid it as much as possible.
---
I think summit got camped by one player for hours yesterday that would just walk up to him while he was in stealth hiding lol, "stream sniping" is definitely a thing
---
You're right, I was just trying to point out the difference from a standard split-screen screen-cheat if you didn't already see it. 
---
It's like playing with screens back to back and they happen to have a mirror behind them. In the case of streamers their boss put the mirror there and threatened to fire them if they move it. They ask you to try not to go out of your way to look at the mirror, but they can't stop you. 
---
They can move the mirror themselves and lose their income, but that's not reasonable. They could threaten you if you look (blacklist) but that's not reasonable. They could ask nicely for you not to cheat, but that's not reasonable. There's just no real clean solution.
---
Awesomeness.
---
Can you tell me how to do this for my setup?
---
Monkey see, monkey do.
---
Makes sense. Thank you for the hardcore perspective. All the raiding I did was in Wrath and I personally capped out at Trial of the Grand Crusader. I was never part of a \*super\* hardcore guild but Quirks and Flaws on Zul'Jin let me tag along.
---
That was unnecessarily hostile.  All I was doing is noting that there are reasons why some people tend to have issue with streamers.
---
it's up to you, but i'd say Tailoring since it pairs a lot better with Enchanting then Alchemy, and, you don't need to buy herbs from the AH. Alchemy will be much more expensive since you won't be able to farm your own herbs.
---
Truefaith Vestaments are the biggest draw.
---
Fuck me, you're right that is exactly the toon I have been planning on rolling. This reddit name was chosen long before I settled on a race or class for my wow character though.
---
I have to ask, what about SubmersibleGoat makes you think Tauren Druid?
---
Lmao I went to middle school with this guy and sat right next to him for a year
---
&gt; youre too soft for pvp because you whine, once you whine youre a carebear.
---
lol. You're too soft if you have to fight people 30 levels lower than you because you suck at pvp.
---
The fact that you'd have so many people harassing you would be annoying to deal with
---
It works great on patrols in Zul'Farrak, I've gotten a lot of niche use out of it.
---
He was like this in middle school too.
---
Source: sat next to him for a whole year in math class
---
Making people sad is the only content that's fun for me in classic.  Streamers or not.
---
Actually, perhaps not quite, judging from these: https://imgur.com/a/RC5yci8/
---
But then you would be a streamer and you'd have to kill yourself.
---
win/win/win
---
I get that he's obviously going to argue against stream sniping, but come on, broadcasting your fucking gameplay on a pvp server? I really don't get how non-streamers defend this.
---
But please don't kill or you might get blacklisted!
---
Cool, lets make a 1000 player guild with soul purpose to hunt down streamers, lets see who win :)
---
it wouldnt work. ninja looting blacklists hardly worked on actual servers. 
---
people are going to camp him and not give a shit about the blacklist. actual raiding guilds arent going to give a shit about the blacklist.
---
hes not going to get anywhere on a pvp server and should just go to a pve server or stop streaming.
---
Hes saying some bad player who scraped by in raids for leftovers is going to STV to gank lowbies.
---
oh 100% it exists. its just not everyone who kills a streamer
---
Unless you are playing with friends it seems like common sense for everyone to need all boe rares and epics. Anything else is just asking for trouble and "mistakes".
---
Dank addon
---
I've been doing this with youtube..literally watching anything classic wow related even if it is all things I already knew
---
&gt;This isn’t about an hour corpse camp. Or even one day. This is about people continually doing it for days, weeks, months, or god forbid years.
---
"People" can certainly do that to any other player. This is the reality of WPvP, where dumb shit like week long corpse camping can happen. Honestly, if an entire guild of people streamsniped and camped Soda, then raided to get gear to progress alongside him and still cause issues, you'd have a fairly solid case to make to Blizzard, the people who should be doling out the punishments. 
---
Blizzard should suspend of ban griefers to that degree, whether or not the people being camped are streamers.
---
&gt;So, if someone griefs someone who isn’t a streamer for days, or weeks on end, that’s fine then?
---
Both scenarios would absolutely get a report from me if I were in either situation. If I was a streamer, I'd report the person doing that. If I got camped that hard as myself, not a streamer, I'd report them.
---
That is griefing, and that is Blizzard's job to handle. The community establishing a cross-faction blacklist that is governed by the people who are affected the most by the problems is bound to be abused. Soda said it himself, he's an asshole, and sentencing a player of the other faction to game-death under the rule of the top streamers on the other faction is no where near as bad as him corpse camping someone on the beta for losing WSG. 
---
I don't trust him to make consistent, coherent, and rational decisions. People **will** be wrongfully blacklisted.
---
**It's also literal, actual, toxic, abusable cross-faction collusion**, [which we know was actionable back then.](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8) I'd fully expect a ban from Blizzard for that level of horse shit, and be outraged if they didn't give one.
---
&gt;As for the streamer, make records of it on their own. “X name camped for Y minutes/hours today”, make clips of the people in question, etc.
---
Do that and submit it to Blizzard. Being camped for a week or longer is obviously griefing, and Blizzard should be the one to handle that, not the victim.
---
&gt;There is quite literally no need for a direct admission at all, and that’s just an idiotic thing to say. That’s like saying you can’t arrest someone until they admit they’ve done something illegal, even with evidence proving they did.
---
What evidence? That the player had inhabited the same position as Soda for a while? STV is a PvP shithole. People can find you organically, and some fairly quickly, and the fact that you were in the same place as a streamer and killed the mrepeatedly does not mean you were streamsniping.
---
Ask yourself, what irrevocably proves someone was streamsniping and not just camping a guy for their friend so they can grab the long respawn mobs or the rare nearby? What bit of information from the game says "This guy actually opened up this player's stream and watched him move"? Legitimately nothing I can come up with, everything can potentially be organic. Week long or month long or year long camping DOES NOT prove streamsniping, it proves targeting and griefing. Unless you can prove the person opened up their stream and tracked them with that, you cannot convince me that you can **prove** streamsniping just by corpse camping and how long it goes on or how frequent it is.
---
**You can prove griefing or targeting, but you can't prove streamsniping.**
---
The only comparison I can think of is Dark Souls 1 remastered. Not an  MMO but pretty hyped some very similar reasons.
---
I am having the same debate. I have played Hunter most of my WoW career starting at the end of BC and I really want to play Hunter PvP. Druid would be my preference for PvE but there is no chance I'm leveling both classes.            
---
I have never raided as a tank and have never really played druid but at the same time am worried I wouldn't like it as much as Hunter... It's hard to choose.
---
i thought the same thing when reading the title lol.
---
A settlement needs your help!
---
I think maybe posters in this thread have had their brains regress to 2005 as well.
---
"I suggest we create a super guild...with the goal of hunting those"  "Also guys, it's about challenging, not witch hunting." fucking pepega
---
you also have to be a pathetic attention whore to make a living streaming
---
You right. My bad dog. What you said is still stupid tho.
---
Lol I like how some people don't realise this. The reason some people have a lot more money when they hit 40/60 is because they level way *less* efficiently, and take a lot longer to hit that level. That's the only reason you've got more money at 40 than the average person.
---
There isn't much content to measure PvP skill in vanilla though, the PvP progression is time and grind based, I don't imagine cdew, venruki or snutz getting rank 14 first on their server, they probably won't get it at all. Not because they're not good, mostly because they just won't poopsock as much.
---
I did the same thing for Echeyakee as a NE Hunter. Some horde was nice enough to help my little level... 12? Self at the time. 
---
I still have that pet today, as my Hunter from 2004 is the same toon I play today.
---
If you purposly do everything you can to ruin the game for someone else for an extended time (for example if you're a druid that follows a warrior who's trying to level and moonfire all the mobs he's trying to kill for 8 hours) that's player harrassment whether you're a streamer or not and players who prarticipate in this kind of behaviour should first recive a warning and then if continued, a punishment.
---
It took me like, 2 days max from release to cap in D1 and 2 aswell. Far from the 240 hours it takes to level to 60 casually.
---
They are both fairly similar in pve playstyle. I think warrior is more fun but I’m biased as that’s my main. 
---
Ret and feral are REALLY not worth it IMO. Some people like to put a lot of time and effort into non traditional specs and I respect that but it’s def going to piss you off when you realize that you can put a lot of time an effort into these specs and be laughed out of the raid for the most part. 
---
Do not underestimate the massive quality of life that is stealth. It’s insane. Warrior is basically the class that gets their shit pushed in for the entire leveling process and pretty much PvP in any 1v1 situation. 
---
Group play is another story. Warriors are Gods. The inverse is true for rogue. Better leveling experience. Less gear dependent due to eviscerate and amazing in 1v1 scenarios. Kind of shit in groups tbh.
---
How do you get one of your mouse buttons to serve as a modifier?  I feel like I tried that in Vanilla and it didn't work, but it's been a while.
---
Ok Ricky... it isn't rocket appliances
---
Because it’s obviously a cow and anyone seeing your aquatic form with that name is gonna cackle. It might be too long though? Tauren players always have the funniest names.
---
&gt;	"People" can certainly do that to any other player. This is the reality of WPvP, where dumb shit like week long corpse camping can happen
---
No, they can’t. That line is all I needed to read to know you have no clue what you’re talking about. Guarantee you’re some salty kid that streamsnipes people to feel cool. You’ll grow up one day (hopefully).
---
Crippling comes in handy all the time, even on PvE. Runnings mobs pulling adds slows you down a lot as a rogue. It's often worth the 2% dps loss to run crippling. For pvp obviously you always need to train it.
---
Ahww man . I am building a pc in a few months and now im gonna miss the mass pillaging
---
How much is riding and a mount and how much does this add on save a hunter?
---
But a goat isn't the same thing as a cow. I am confused.
---
Huh? Swifty? He's always been a personality, never even a contender. From TBC to mop he never even got duelist, he never even got the rating to be able to post on AJ.
---
Powerless and weak people in real life like killing lowbies for hours because it gives them a feeling of power and control. It’s pretty pathetic. They should be pitied more than mocked, but they deserve both.
---
I also find it hilarious that after almost 15 years of playing on pvp these kids still haven’t grown up. When they were 16... ok. Kids are dumb. That’s kind of an excuse. Someone who played at 16 in 2004 is in his 30s now and still thinks camping lowbies is fun or cool. Imagine that. There’s some serious psychological issues there.
---
to be honest I went on a nostalgia trip and completely forgot the point of this whole thread, totally missed the point you were trying to make at first.
---
Asking people nicely not to cheat is reasonable, but not effective. 
---
TBH I don't even play WoW, just saw this on r/all 
---
Is a time delay worthwhile?  Not sure how fast things move in this game... 
---
I get that its affecting these guys income, but they got into this "career" knowing the challenges.  I don't get to go out on a fishing boat and ask the fish to just nicely jump in my net so they don't risk my payday.  I don't get to forbid sharks from stealing my catch either.   You either overcome it or you don't.  In this case its not sharks its just trolls who get enjoyment from trying to screw with a streamer.   It was a choice to stream, live with the consequences... My 2 cents at least.
---
Is 550 dps bad in BWL?
---
How long did you stream before being able to go full time?
---
Depends for PvP and pve. 
---
PvP orc hands down. That SR is fucking nutty. 
---
Pve - human is better imo if you want to tank and honestly probably better for fury due to blessing of salvation increasing your threat cap and the fact that good itemized swords are just easier to obtain. Bloodfury on orc is still a nice dps boost. 
---
Perception is pretty meh imo
---
&gt; cannot sign more than once per account
---
This is incorrect. It's once *per character*. You can absolutely have a friend make 9 level 1 alts and sign the charter. They can even delete each of the alts after they sign.
---
Is it though.
---
There arent that many people in the beta. Ive been in since Monday and it feels like a mega low pop server. (Im on PvP)
---
The toxicity in this discussion is real
---
God these comments are cancer. So many people taking things at face value.
---
Isn't the point of a beta to check for bugs? Not grind levels in a dungeon?
---
Guilds on servers in classic used to blacklist ninja looters, adding streamsnipers to the list this time around on stream servers honestly seem like a good fix to the problem.
---
Isnt it pretty entitled by the streamsnipers to be able to ruin a players exp and make the game unplayable for them by repeatble ganking them.  
---
If you don't want to get blacklisted just dont stream snipe, or roll another server, a blacklist is better than a ban you would get in most other games for cheating by Stream sniping.
---
I haven't watched any classic streams it's going to feel good to just play the game again true cosmic brain 
---
I'm hype for classic when it's ready
---
10 silver and 9 signatures (not counting your own).
---
You probably need to install software for your mouse and do it through there
---
Nice bfa smashin' meme!
---
Thank you.
---
Wouldn't what he's suggesting get him banned? I thought cross faction collusion on PVP servers wasn't allowed.
---
Just cause you say there's no shame in that doesn't make there no shame in that.
---
That's his own problem, then. Streaming has its own risks. Anyone in Hearthstone that wants to avoid stream sniping would just use something to cover their cards on the screen.
---
This is like someone playing hide and seek for $10,000 and streaming his location to the world and being surprised when he is found within 10 minutes.
---
Ended up deciding on:
---
Main tank warrior with Fury/Arms for PvP
---
&amp;
---
Raid Healer shaman Ele/Resto for PvP
---
I love healing in mmo’s but this time i really want to try tanking.
---
I’m really worried that there will be many warriors and i won’t be able to get any spots in dungeons or raid guilds because I have little actual vanilla tanking experience.
---
I’m also worried about getting obliterated in pvp with my warrior. Everyone seems to say that Warrior is a monster in pvp, and then the other half says that warrior gets shitted on by literally any caster.
---
My main thoughts here is,
---
I normally main priests in mmo’s. This time around i want to actually be the badass hero and look the part. I’m so sick of being a little cloth bitch.
---
Been playing on a private server. I kinda like it better than beta access, and either way everyone will be level 1 on the 27th.
---
Yes, did you see my edits? I removed Crippling from the do-not-train list for this exact reason.
---
I'm curious why you think that.  Do you disagree with my intended point, or how I (somewhat vaguely and with no small amount of meandering, I shall admit) put it?
---
I'm interested in anything that ruins a streamer's day
---
Haha, there is that too.  Plus, I think zeppelins had vendors as early as Wrath, so while you're flying, emptying your bags with their very limited space in the early levels is really nice!  It's easy to forget to sell before departing when you just want to travel and you're new or not artificially boosting an alt.
---
Some of these guys are making millions apparently.  A few of them in the classic beta.  They can literally do this for only a couple years and retire for life comfortably.
---
I don't understand why anyone takes anything Soda says seriously. Like he's entertaining and everything but he's an entertainer and you're doing just what he wants. He's saying provocative shit cause it gets attention which helps his stream. You're just feeding a troll. A sweet ass twink looking troll who is fun to watch. But that's about it.
---
Mainly want to pvp but I would like to experience all of the raid content as well. Very helpful advice!
---
But stream sniping \*is\* dictating who is able to enjoy the game. It's treating streamers like content that's part of the game and not other players.  
---
You're basically responding to a frustrated call for an overkill punishment by calling for even greater levels of asshole behavior.  
---
I'll be honest, if you actually put this together I hope everyone who joins gets banned for harassment.
---
Or report it for being harder than he remembers. He always has a choice.
---
I have no words...
---
IIRC it was 100% drop rate. I got mine the second go around in MC with my guild at the time.
---
I doubt blizzard gives enough of a fuck about streamers to care.
---
PUBG basically got most of its marketing from streamers so the streamers had some power. Classic had 10 million active players in its hay day, blizzard knows the product will sell itself regardless of little crybaby streamers. I mean look at tim the tatt man that was harrassed by a single toxic stream sniping symmetra for literal months before blizzard said "okay okay, we get it, banned"
---
Level 60 Paladin.  
---
Level 1 Rogue.
---
This guy knows what he wants to play.
---
I can't stand Sodapoppin, he's like the Ben Shapiro of Twitch.
---
Has more to do with money jealousy I think. “This person makes millions I should be allowed to treat them like shit! Wtf do you mean there’s rules saying I can’t?! Wtfuuuuuck” followed by a lot of sobbing about their own sad lives.
---
Guzu
---
Okay, so here's the deal. First off, I'm a mod in the discord, that's my credential, so I know my memes. Secondly, I'm realizing that we kind of fucked up the presentation of what the build is by accident, so I'll explain it better here (Also going to update the guide with some disclaimers and such). I'll address two major points:  
---
1) MCP is BiS forever unless things get super crazy. All the other weapons you see in the guide are for use on trash, or on fights that range between 90 and \~150 seconds. The reason for the duration is because MCP has THREE 30 second charges before you have to equip another one. This means you have 90 seocnds of MCP uptime and another 30 seconds from the equip cooldown. Therefore on fights that last above 90 seconds, you have two options: Switch to your trash weapon, or equip another MCP. The trash weapon will out perform a MCP if the MCP never gets a full use off due to the cooldown, so if a fight lasts 120 seconds and you equipped a second MCP, you're just using a shitty level 30 blue with no benefit, obviously a level 60 weapon will be better. If you can get off a full charge of MCP though, or multiple, then it will outperform the level 60 weapons. In any case, to be 100% clear, MCP is the main meme here and all other weapons falter before its greatness. The only time a weapon would ever perform ALMOST as good as MCP, is a 10% proc rate Ironfoe that also self-procs. This is unlikely to happen, and even if it does happen, reduces our mana uptime by about 2 minutes in Naxx gear, which is bad. It'll be a nice meme until naxx though.  
---
2) Procs are not the focal point of this build. SPEED is the focal point. Procs simply work better with speed. They are an addon, not the core foundation. The reason that speed is so important is because 1) SoR scales with spellpower and 2) SoR damage isn't normalized based on haste. Therefore when you're using MCP, Scrolls of blinding light, librams of rapidity, minor haste, jujuflurrys, etc. you bring your weapon speed down to sub 1.0 speeds, 1 attack per second. However, SoR is still doing damage as if you were swinging at 2.0 speeds. In essence this doubles the damage of SoR, and therefore doubles the value of spellpower's effect on SoR. Icing on the cake is that SoR causes \*at least\* weapon procs (ie. "Chance on hit" effects") to occur, meaning that every swing ends up with 2 chances of proccing, meaning the procrate is close to doubled. This increases the value of things like Hand of Justice and Shadow oil (Currently not proccing off SoR on beta, possible bug) and dragonbreath chili. However, these procs are not essential to the build and it will outperform AP ret, based on our testing, regardless.  
---
As a closing point I will say this, when you look at an MCP and see a dps value of 29, it's actually very misleading. If you only using MCPs when you have the active enabled, for the 50% increased speed, then it's actually a 1.33 speed weapon with a dps of 43.5. This dps and attack speed is on par with level 60 daggers, such as Alcor's Sunrazor, only minus the additional proc or effect of these weapons. It is however a 2H mace, meaning it benefits from both 2H spec (ret talent) and the human racial, which are both strong (Note that on the beta 2H spec is increasing SoR damage). Additionally, increased attack speed means more uptime for mana through JoW AND more uptime on vengeance despite a lower crit rating than AP ret. This is because we're hitting with as much as 4x as many attacks as a tradition AP ret in the same amount of time, and all of those extra attacks have a chance to crit. The increased mana regen from JoW also allows spamming consecration, which AP ret can't do.

I think that's most of the memes. Thanks for reading and we'll update the guide to be less confusing :)

Stream sniping =/= ganking. They are two different things and trying to equate them to make a strawman argument only makes you look dumb. If mainstream streaming and sniping existed back then, people would have been put on lists for it during Vanilla too. I know this upsets you because you plan to and/or want to watch these streamers get griefed via stream sniping nonstop, but that just isn't gonna happen without consequences.
---
Classic WoW may be the same game as Vanilla WoW, but the people and mechanics outside of the game aren't the same. It won't be the same experience and you can either accept that or keep crying about it, I guess, but one of those is a waste of time. Your choice though.
---
Willitclassic has all the updates ones and ones that are planned
---
Who has changed more since - you or the pal?
---
Probably more like level each to 20 and play the favourite to 60.
---
Don't come to twitch tomorrow.

I hope this is a 4D move by Soda to aggregate more pvp to the server he plays on for some high quality rivalries and world pvp after rolling PvE content.  Or it could be EOG (early onset grumpiness) which some popular streamers seem to experience D:
---
Stream snipe on Twitch, while streaming to Youtube?
---
Ony is still on the old 5 day cycle IIRC, MC + BWL are both on the standard Tuesday reset. Most hardcore raider types will be done ranking before ZG is out.
---
"I want to be able to gank people whenever I feel like it, but nobody should be allowed to gank me when I am not interested in pvp"
---
LOL, they were right, this subreddit is retarded :D
---
Did you watch the whole video? Even though it's cut, it has more info than what you seem to have used to extrapolate.
---
It's relatively clear who stream snipes. A strike system would probably work. Chat could vote if soda is a bitch or if he's being stream sniped [overkill imho].
---
If you see a problem in a solution, try to solve it instead of complaining about its lack of completeness.
---
This is in response to people streaming in a starcraft match. It does not apply to WoW. 
---
Also while it can be argued that it's fair play to look at streams for information, acting on that information to blatantly grief someone is not allowed in the ToS just like if you greifed them without the help of a stream.
---
Asside from that they are saying that sniping is fine, but ghosting still isn't. It's okay to watch so that you can match with them in a BG, but watching the stream to see where their rogues are hiding isn't good.
---
I'm just saying that not everyone in the raid needs to be 60.
---
Isn’t consecration far too mana expensive at low levels?
---
I'm curious where you get these ideas from. A rogue can't keep up with a warrior, but a mage can't keep up with a rogue?
---
Itll be interesting to see if the stars align and everything pans out. PvP gear wont be added until phase 2 at the earliest iirc, relics weren't added until 1.10 so the Libram wont be accessible until phase 5. 
---
This might be worth trying in Naxx If:
---
1) Judgment debuffs stack
---
2) Torch isnt nerfed by phase 6
---
3) 6 Paladins get to sufficient rank for the pvp gloves
---
4) Enough Paladins get bis for spell ret to work
---
5) Guild runs a dedicated Nightfall
---
Even if Torch doesn't pan out, Manual Crowd Pummeler is a nice fallback, and is already being theoycrafted around. If Torch does somehow work out better than MCP that would be much nicer than having to grind Gnomer dozens of times every week for years lol
---
It would be cool to see this crackpot idea actually works and Alliance raid meta shifts to judgment debuff priority.
---
lol you dumbass you'll get banned from several streaming platforms if you stream snipe.
---
also you probably suck dick, and even if you were OKAY you would get rolled by most streamers as they're actually mostly great players, even if you somehow managed to get one kill your dumbass would get fucking annihilated but the hordes of fanbois, because you know they're actually popular and you're a wannabe.
---
Probably one of the coolest screenshots shared in here
---
If people are salty because streamers got invites they are dumb. There isn't a limited amount of invite they aren't zero sum. Blizz knows how many randoms they want in the beta to test with they send out that many invites. We'll call this number X. Then they will have a set number of invites decided by their marketting team to send to streamers and content creators in order to get the game in front of as many eyes as possible. We'll call this number Y. Then then have a third category of F&amp;F invites sent out to employees and so on. We'll call this number Z
---
So currently the population of beta is X+Y+Z. People seem to be under the impression that if invites for Y and Z didn't exist then the population would be the same it would just be all random invites for X would equal X(now) + Y + Z. This isn't true if categories Y and Z didn't exist it would just be X and maybe some amount of Z. The streamer and content creators have ZERO impact of you getting into Beta.
---
He says he wants to play without the benefits or downsides of being a streamer... well making fuck tons of money is one of the benefits. If you want to be a regular player and treated normally, DONT STREAM! I don’t see what’s so hard to understand lmao!
---
Use your mouse software or if thats shitty use x-mouse control.
---
Bladefist was pve and came out December 2006
---
This. Where is the fun when you cannot gank a little aswell.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Thank you for this :)) It all makes sense now :)) I'll edit the main post with this info so that people don't miss it.
---
Why do you think streamers, who are paid to play the game full time, will do worse in time based grinds than non streamers, who largely have jobs they have to go to.
---
Okie dokie buddy.
---
Maybe he's a Goldman Sachs banker working on the next 1MDB
---
lol this happened a few yrs ago where he had a shift in personality and became a super dick, he abuses his viewers and they still flock, Stockholm syndrome
---
I'm the opposite. I was always PvE before. Now I want to experience that PvP server tension.
---
&gt;No, they can’t. That line is all I needed to read to know you have no clue what you’re talking about. Guarantee you’re some salty kid that streamsnipes people to feel cool. You’ll grow up one day (hopefully).
---
What I meant was that it is a possibility, not an act that is ok to perform. That is absolutely griefing, and the people who camp someone for weeks are assholes. 
---
Hopefully you read the entire thing like the adult that you are, as I believe I clarified that further down in the reply.
---
You are the first to name call here, and that is telling. Allow me to organize my apparently juvenile mind using this reply so that you may help me understand where I'm wrong.
---
- Streamers are just another group of players. They have no more and no less rights than I do in game. I do not get any special permissions or treatment from Blizzard, thus they don't get any special permissions or treatment from Blizzard.
---
- Griefing, onto anyone, by anyone, is condemnable. It doesn't matter if they are a streamer or not, it is wrong to do.
---
- Blizzard, the least biased party involved in every player conflict in this game, should be the one to decide punishment upon people that they verify as griefers or as players that breach other rules in the ToS, not the ones directly affected by the griefing or breach of the ToS, whether or not they are streamers.
---
- [A cross-faction blacklist, like Soda suggests, is strictly against the ToS of WoW when the game came out.](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8) There has to be some allowance, given the interconnected nature of today's society, but something that can potentially ruin the game for a member of the other faction due to a namedrop on the blacklist and a word to the other streamers on the server to avoid said player is absolutely crossing the line and should be actionable. The presence and function of that list violates the first belief I hold.
---
I'd like to think that it is more reasonable to maintain that the streamers are average people, and that if I wouldn't camp the average person, I wouldn't camp them either (which is why I'm strictly avoiding streamer servers). Do unto others as you would have done unto you, that's my philosophy for this. Or at the very least don't dish out what you can't take back.
---
XXX dps doesn't really mean anything. It changes dramatically depending on the length of the fight and world buffs and fight mechanics. Suffice to say if you're playing ret I hope you have a 4k monitor because you're going to need to extend your damage meter window down a long way to find yourself.
---
Which is why some of us roll pve.
---
jesus what a pathetic thread
---
All of this shit is really making me not want to play classic. Get a life lmao.
---
Thanks for clearing that up. I heard rumors of the build a few months back, excited to see it on live servers.. soon.
---
yes it is. it might be slightly higher, but it's definitely not going to hit anywhere near that mark.
---
Can we get rp pvp servers? Anybody whos following loves maga and pepe memes is bound to bring tons of cringe and annoyance to normal people. Dont believe me go look at twitch streams chat
---
Until we hear something solid, use the BFA specs as your guide.
---
Less than a handful, but many were quick to hop on that Classic $$$ bandwagon when they had the chance; let's be real here...
---
Lol if I could I would gank him or at least mob tag. Blacklist my ass. I don't have time for dungeons and raids anyways so who cares. will solo queue BGs. If my 1hr per day involves mining a little and do a little streamsniping haha its fine and fun.
---
Sure a very small percentage of streamers are making a million dollar salary (Asmon and maybe Soda) but that ignores A) the large majority that are not making that amount of money and b) the time it took them to get to that point and the salary they had before that,
---
I think the question is are you actually serious for asking that?
---
Sure. Then I can do the same to you.
---
So the specs for that say Intel core i7. A laptop with i3 wouldn't run it?
---
Terrible advice.
---
This entire deleted thread
---
Dont wanna get stream sniped dont stream loser
---
He can play PVE then
---
Technically, co-workers are a factor for streamers. Rarely popular streamers play exclusively alone, as they're playing with fellow streamers, meaning their interaction has to remain somewhat civilized, otherwise it might impact their career. Additionally, streamers also "employ" people like mods and designers for their stream overlay, etc. 
---
All in all, streamers do have co-workers.
---
Because ganking isn't fun for some people? Crazy how different people like different things
---
While raids only need a few tanks, demand for tanks in 5 mans is always high. Tank as a Warrior is a very interactive and engaging experience compared to many other PvE classes.
---
Both of your concerns about Warriors are correct but in different scenarios. Warriors do struggle against casters in 1v1 scenarios, but when a Warriors are geared and supported by a healers and buffs from other classes, they become monsters in that environment.
---
If looks are a high priority to you, you should just know ahead of time that the good PvE healing gear will be mismatched pieces of cloth, leather, and mail. [This](https://i.redd.it/mlbep5i1d4z01.jpg) is about Paladins, but the same principle applies to Shaman. If you want good gear in PvE, you're still gonna be a little cloth bitch.
---
Welcome to classic wow where people get killed, camped and pissed off.
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. Addons such as this take away a bit of a flavor from the game. If you just want to mash shit go play fucking BFA.
---
A laptop with 4gig of ram might run it on high at 100fps or it might struggle on low at 10fps. If you want any helpful advice you'll need to tell us the useful information about the laptop - that is the CPU and GPU model.
---
Then what does soda have to worry about?
---
I hope I don't get blacklisted for not caring and inviting whoever is there/has the gear to my groups.
---
Other than that I really don't mind, sounds like it could make for some hilarious drama and emergent social gameplay.
---
Aside from straight up saying you're streamsniping there's no real way to accuse someone of streamsniping in wow.   Like anyone can find anyone in wow without streamsniping so you're just a streamer getting camped by another streamer, no stream sniping needed.
---
nope. this was bladefirst pvp on european realm. Was open day #1 of eu vanilla released  February 11, 2005
---
That’s why you can add delay to the Stream ... smh
---
The specs are definitely not the ones from 15 years ago.
---
* 1.3 Ghz (Dual-core recommended)
---
* 512 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)
---
* 32 MB VRAM (128 MB recommended)
---
I created a VM with both the minimum and recommended specs, installed the Classic Beta, logged in, and had single digit FPS on the lowest settings and resolution. And that was with the video RAM being fed from a modern GPU. If you limited your GPU's power to what was available in the era, it'd be even worse.
---
The minimum required specs for Legion are much more accurate, if not exactly the same save for hard disk space and video ram requirements.
---
They wont' care. They already made their money at that point. No one will be watching them because the only people that \*would\* watch them are busy playing. But at that point, they are already retiring.
---
I think in the end, it doesn't matter what you guys do. Soda has a huge following and will stomp out most competition in the long run. Like it or not if you decide to go through with this guild idea it will just be more of an annoyance than an actually road block.
---
Leveled as an arms warrior dual wielding.
---
I wonder when these losers start complaining about the game being too unbalanced and hard so we repeat the destruction of WoW
---
People will be so upset when the method boys start taking classic seriously and start racking up world firsts. People like Venruki or Cdew are streamers that aren't even that into vanilla and they would wipe the floor with 99.999% of the community.
---
When we started playin wow there were no BG's, campin south short just killin alliance for free. Hell yeh
---
It depends on a situation. For example, during faction invasions (like Legion invasions except it´s Horde/Alliance attacking the other), I experienced ton of wPvP, mostly because players naturally flock to the area because they want to do WQs there, so you are far more likely to experience some PvP.
---
So go with legion specifications?
---
Ahaha. The Haters came out of their holes.
---
Not a fan of the 1-6 keybinds. I use Q E R T F G binds. Mouse wheel up/down, and any of the mouse buttons u have.
---
That's true, not big brained 😔
---
I bought a one handed sword with int and agility for my warlock and walked around with that for about 10 levels before my friends checked in on me questing. I had just started and they all played way longer than me. Didn’t live that down to quick lol
---
Yeah that surely wong lead in to any false accusations.
---
Yeah I'm not sure why people think this is a big deal, streamer blacklists won't have much of an impact on top end guilds because any guild worth being in would literally just not care as long as you were a good player and raided well in the guild.
---
I'm gonna find the pve server with the least amount of self entitled streamers and roll on that. Seriously all these streamers talk about #nochanges but streaming really didn't exist in vanilla so them streaming it in itself is somewhat of a change in regards to how classics community worked.
---
Watch other streams than Asmongold.
---
The bulk of your damage comes from shadow oil procs. You want the fastest attack speed possible to apply as many procs as possible. CP with buff active gives you a 1.0 attack speed, and can be even slightly faster with the counterweight.
---
The two swords you mentioned have 2.0+ speed, so you'd only be getting roughly half the shadow oil procs.
---
Never seen him play a rogue
---
 &gt; higher skilled players 
---
That's a stretch
---
This guy should never play EVE Online.
---
It would on low settings for sure. But you might gonna have  to try it out.
---
Try BFA on that laptop and adjust the settings.
---
I hate the anti-streamer mindset in this subreddit. I honestly think most of the time people advocating against streamers are just being big babies. In this case, the streamer is just flat out wrong.
---
Stream sniping isn't abuse. You took that risk when you started playing the game live. If others want to use that to their advantage that's fine, save for tournament settings (where both parties agree in as part of the event that they won't have access to extra information).
---
If a community wants to blacklist people for whatever reason, fine. I know there are people on Vanilla servers I refuse to play with. Good luck convincing the guilds of a server to blacklist a person over them following you around. Even better luck convincing the other faction to blacklist people. Fuck yourself with if you want Blizzard to blacklist people. Don't want stream sniped? Don't stream.
---
So, you're telling me that &gt;&gt;30k pair of eyes won't look at the raid frames and try to spot idiot's names in a searchable document, with huge viewer bases that switch between Horde and Alliance streams?
---
And that people will play for weeks to get to lvl 60 just to make other people feel bad or even keep tens of thousands of people from having a good day by watching WoW Classic streams?
---
Damn their lifes must be fucking boring.
---
obviously not
---
Human priest gives you a decent spirit buff though. It's pretty useful for holy priest. I'm thinking about night elves for some reason. M druid, F warrior, F hunter you know, going with the lore, for classic. I never really messed with them before. But I was mostly horde before.
---
Kill chance in open world, you get blacklisted lol.
---
Grow a set of balls you fucking nerd
---
Lol, it sounds like you have never held down a job.
---
Engineering gives you an edge in PVP. Mining will help to be self sufficient. Tailoring is an absolute must if you are rolling any of the three cloth classes because of a very powerful BOP chest piece a tailor makes for themselves. Enchanting makes a best in slot for a feral druid tank. 
---
There are some pros and cons with the other professions but from the information you provided it would be difficult to say.
---
true there isnt the metrics to measure skill in vanilla, but in any case they're still good players. we're talking people who were world champions in 2007, so sure you might argue that 10 years later they might not have the same reflexes, sure. you might argue that classic isnt the same as vanilla, but really the game mechanics are similar enough, if they were world champions in 2007, they're still going to be good now, unless they lost a limb or got brain damage or something....
---
Yes. Any decent Intel i5 (or AMD equivalent), 4GB RAM, and a video card from either company in the last ~3 generations will be fine.
---
It was killer instinct which got that turd started
---
You can't actually believe this? As soda said, these streamers make up maybe 1% of the population. The classic crowd existed long before their followers joined in just cause they are gonna play it.
---
I mean over half their subscribers joined in just the last season. Their activity towers over the /r/gameofthrones sub.
---
Damn, where is this utopia you live in.
---
No. The earliest you can get it is lvl 21 and it costs like 100 something mana. You don’t even get Rank 2 until lvl 30, which is like 100 more mana. Plus you can easily fight 2-3 mobs with it. 
---
It’s really not that much. If you are sitting on a full mana pool all the time, you’re probably not playing correctly...
---
One word. Itemization.
---
With streaming comes not only free money, but in-game griefing. It comes with the territory. Can't hack it? Don't stream.
---
Oh man, changing tcpackfrequency in the registry, those were the days
---
may you try enabling "classic graphics" I saw there was a button for that during the stress test.
---
I hope there are none of those douche nozzles on my server, but if there are, that makes me want to kill them on sight.
---
It's popular, but bear in mind that most of the worthwhile recipes are hard to get. Guilds only need 1 enchanter, and if you aren't their main enchanter you've spent all that gold leveling for little gain.
---
I was so happy when South Park made a game 
---
I wish they had a Warcraft DLC or at least a mission/storyline that involved the kids playing or referencing WoW
---
Do you run with W or hold the mouse buttons?
---
I understand tanking is a bit harder in Vanilla but are the majority of dungeon pug tanks pretty bad? I got the feeling they barely knew how to tank.
---
Leveling a Warrior to do it myself now.
---
I did. This was included in my "lowest settings possible" attempt.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Yes but do they all have full mountain dew?
---
But if you stream yourself steamsniping streamers, wouldn't you have to streamsnipe yourself?
---
Who cares about what the streamers does? Everyone else is questing! STOP FOCUSING ON THE STREAMERS, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING DAMMIT.
---
Don't bind them, just click.
---
Trust me, no one will be able to tell the difference.
---
I've been enjoying seeing the hardcore arena streamers saying they are addicted to the classic beta. Glad to see more people convinced more of the potential in classic.  
---
Its funny to see people comparing BFA as "fast paced" but in vanilla you can be dead to a lot of stuff within a second or two if not managed properly
---
You almost never sit on full mana pool if you play at all, judgment with discounts on 22 costs you 20 mana seal of command 55 and hoj 30 total of 115 mana dealing more than consecration. But I will test holy spec maybe it is faster this way. SoC feels strong but so does consecration.
---
Fookin' ~~kneelers~~ streamers.
---
I vaguely remember a horde mage doing this, in cata? I think. He would get 40 man raids to raid stormwind to kill swiftly consistently. His name was coneofcool I think and he would barely get like 40-100 viewers avg, and 1-3k when hosted. 
---
I don’t think many people enjoy watching stream snipers since it is not organic.
---
Dude. So it wasn’t that you can’t camp anyone player. It was the facts that these people would know his location and target him. Not naturally stumbling upon someone while playing. 
---
Because they could see his location at all time multiple people will show up and relentlessly kill. All while knowing his exact location at all time. 
---
He loves the game and wants to do well. That attracts a lot of trolls like many other streamers who want to have there fame on stream. So it’s a problem in all games and this was a rage filled rant to help avoid the most toxic trait of streaming. 
---
Grow up.
---
To be clear I dont know a lot about computers and was just going to shop around for something that would run the minimum requirements.
---
The comments just says that most people doesnt even understand what his point really was. Ganking someone in a PvP servers is not agains ToS and there is no way someone should be punished for it, but on the other hand when streamsniping can easliy be proved and those people should be punished. Even if he is streaming his location on a pvp server,when a group of people break him ot of stealth is ruining his experience and content. And now before those butt hurt by streamers players attack me  let me give you an example. Asmongold is super toxic and he may blacklist people just walking by I understand that, but lets say summit for example. He was taken our of stealth and camped left and right before chance actually helped him. Even if they are streaming, they are still paying the same amount of money for the same rights. If he goes to a PvE server, then both factions can kill their mobs and slow their leveling process. Blizzard just simply cannot create streamerless servers or the other way around just because it will take out their rights to choose server.
---
In vanilla there were blacklisted people and those who played back in the day know that. They will probably play with friends and they will want normal   
---
experience. You people cant really be toxic without seeing their point of view. Its not their fault that there are some edgy viewers thay want attention of their stream or just straight hate the streamer. Thats harassment and since streaming the game isnt agains ToS, they are ruining his experience as a part of the player base. Now streamers like Asmongold which may abuse that system must be punished even if thatbdoesnt workout. People crying thay the streamers wont reveal their servers should just chill, I understand that you dont want to play on a "streamer server" but anyone can always wait for the server to be leaked plus lets not walk about the fact that if you know the streamer name you can easily check where they are and you can simple avoid them.
---
If a streamsniping can be proved and the individual really is sniping then those people will be punished, not the normal player base. Im sure those who want normal game experience wont waste 2 or more hours camping the corpse of a streamer which meant that they wont ruin your experience. Remember, they have as much rights as you do. They can express their opinion just as all those people cry about then at reddit or the general forums. Even if they have some kind of small army its not like most streamers will encourage that. Most  of them want normal game leveling just as chance said that he can accept playing the game without his streamer perks. For the most time he has been saying thay he will put Classic before his stream and there are bunch of streamers that will do the same. Toxic streamers and those who abuse something in front of lets say 20k viewers must be punished, but not all the streamers should get that kind of hate. Every community has their toxic people and streamers cannot control them.
---
Venruki is the mage who won the duel tourney
---
... I'm pretty sure there will be more people praising the streamsnipers than shunning them.
---
This doesn't matter. Fans will not immediately know what server streamers are on until a bit after the game launches. If streamers want to converge on a server together, they'll decide on one together shortly before the game launches, and create their characters first.
---
The insane queues that will result from their followers trying to roll on that server won't happen until a day or two.
---
Or! we could play on servers that don't have these big streamers on them?
---
To be fair, some of the streamers in the Beta are at the top echelon of players. Venruki, Monkeynews, Guzu for example.
---
I absolutely love that helmet model. I don't think its in vanilla anymore. RIP
---
Another fun fact i remember from this beta is that Warrior was the first class to receive talents and Mortal Strike was incredible good because it had no re-cast timer in the beginning so you were only limited to the amount of rage you had.
---
I remember running up against 5 alliance in the hillsbrad yeti cave and ripping through them all like butter spamming the immortal strike ability as i had a train of mobs helping me keep my rage up, was fixed not long after the introduction of talents and in this screenshot it had already been fixed.
---
Such a little bitch, I hope people kill him relentlessly which makes him go to a PVE server. :)
---

This is absolutely incredible, where can i see more of your friends work?!
---
Wound poison in vanilla was a 50% healing reduction.
---
My friends told me to "sell at AH" to make gold. I repeatedly went to Arathi Highlands and vendored everything in my bags during level 35 to 50.
---
just play with your spellbook open like the pros do it
---
Don't know about you, but private servers have been perfectly fine to pass the time until classic. I've been playing on more of a fun server lately (check out class-less WoW on google) but it's great to fill the void until classic release.
---
And the fuck if I'm gonna pay $15 a month for a shot at beta access lol.
---
the second boss is easy to work around if you know how to....use mechanics
---
There will be people who are online 18hours+  per day, no they do not have to work or go to school.
---
They'll be online more than most streamers, they just won't have a hundreds of followers giving them free shit but a  no-life player will most likely have a strong guild backup too.
---
Not exactly how it happened but k...
---
Are they actually still sending invites?
---
There is a learning curve for sure.
---
You use the tip of your thump to press down so it's not an issue really.
---
I find it faster to press the buttons on the mouse  because there is less travel with your fingers and the buttons are closer together. If you master the mouse it's really nice and effective.
---
You could play this on a $1000 budget gaming PC easy (if your from US).  
---
I honestly don't recommend getting cheap laptop. They crap out and overheat within a year of use, than need fixing or replacing.
---
It doesn't work, haven't you seen the vid where he spends 10min screaming at esfand for not rolling horde?
---
Good money full time streaming with 1.5k followers?  yeah, okay
---
oof yeah this looks to be the way it is supposed to work

why yall gotta be so hateful?
---
Not streaming the game isn't *really* an option for a full time streamer. If he wasn't streaming classic he would have to be streaming something else, so he wouldn't have the time to dedicate to it that the game requires
---
Ironically, the ones who will be making a 'dent in their play' are their own viewers who constantly try to get on stream. Good luck tagging the mobs for that quest when dozens of people are swarming you.

I feel bad for the left monitor. It didn’t ask for that Nazi symbol.

Strange, I could've sworn I never used the words "all", "global", "100" or "everyone".
---
Probably finding something with the best GPU you can for the money would be a good start. Check ones you find against [this list](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Graphics-Cards-Benchmark-List.844.0.html?type=&amp;sort=&amp;perfrating=1&amp;or=0&amp;gpu_fullname=1&amp;codename=1). Anything in the top 200 will run it ok on medium, but the higher ranked the better.
---
Because judging retail dungeons on the group finder is an excellent idea. Retail raiding is shit because I did lfr once hur dur. What a fucking stupid comparison
---

---
Time delay helps, but it doesn't stop much. Honestly at this point even if the streamers don't stream they're going to be targeted and griefed pretty hard. It's pretty easy to find people in wow just by typing /who . 
---
You're right, they signed up for it. A closer analogy though would be if another boat saw where you put all your crab cages and picked them up before you got there. Seeing where they put down cages and even using that info to place your cages is fine. Accidentally taking one of their cages thinking it's yours can be explained away. Repeatedly stealing from their cages with clear premeditation is not fine.
---
I can guarantee there will be a blacklist system just like there was in classic, much of retail and every private server. The question is just if stream griefers are added to the list in addition to everything else. Since griefers of major guilds are already added to the list it doesn't seem like a crazy jump in logic. I'd still be for getting rid of the system all together though.
---
I do think there is a middle-ground somewhere. Hopefully blizzard steps up and bans the really bad cases themselves and doesn't just stick to banning bots.
---
Which is a retarded idea.
---
Bone apple tea
---
The only thing Seal of Crusader is good for is Judging the target with that seal to give the target the debuff that makes them take more holy damage, which is why I recommend improved Seal of Crusader. Then you want to use to Seal of Command. It’s about using all the synergy you can to maximize your holy damage from all your different moves. 
---
Yes, getting consecration as early as you can will force you to wait until higher levels to get Seal of Command but you will be doing much more holy damage if you do it that way.
---
I don't think you need actual literal streamsniping with the target's stream opened on a second monitor for it not to be allowed. Mere deliberate targeting of other streamers would be enough. Also, this isn't a government prosecution; it isn't like they have to meet some burden of proof like you would have to to put someone in jail. It is more like being fired from a job, I would imagine. If another streamer reports you for doing this and Twitch reviews it internally and determines that yes, in fact, that's what you were doing, then of course you can be banned for that. Think about it from Twitch's perspective; *of course* they don't want their guys going around doing this to one-another.
---
Thanks that makes sense.
---
Im german too but i’ll most likely play on eu english servers because i really like the international aspect i have experienced on the last big pserver. German guilds seemed so strange in comparison to the international ones. As a matter of fact in the good guilds i have played 1/4 to 1/3 were germans anyway.
---
You guys are doing it wrong, My brothers 13 now and plans to PvP full time on my Mage. I’m going to go for at least R13 and I get a little robot to play half the time.
---
You can still talk cross-faction with /me
---
W and right-click down.
---
He’s pointing out the fact that the set sucks, and that if someone collected it then it would be only for the looks. The logic is that gearing for looks=bad player.
---
That fucking website always has something wrong with it. A couple of days ago it was full of fake addons, last night I got spammed with popups to make a profile name, now it won't let me click on the addons because the cookie prompt won't go away.
---
What
---
Hey OP delivers! Thanks bro!
---
Fuck just getting camped on a video game. I would take it up the ass on stream all day if I was making that much money, lmao.
---
When you pay an extra $15/mo because you can’t be bothered to make friends for buffs and food/water...
---
__yes it is. it might be slightly higher, but it's definitely not going to hit anywhere near that mark.__
---
I had a few screenshots on xfire, unfortunately I missed the date to pull my old data before they scrapped the servers. :(
---
This guy suffered so much
---
To be fair, Shroud makes everyone look like a pleb.
---
Just barrens chat
---
Honestly if anything it sounds like your projecting your insecurities and bashing streamers for it.
---
Not witch-huntng btw
---
The old that is strong does not wither
---
It’s not like you’re forced to play on that server forever
---
Now you don't have to subscribe to this mindset, but from the way I understand it the process goes like this. If I'm being responsible and playing an optimal spec, why should I have to spend extra time every raid to gear up objectively bad specs who will only make us wipe once we get to Vael in BWL. Say it takes you 2 hours instead of 1.5 hours to clear MC. You shouldn't be required to spend that extra half hour twice a week because someone wants to do shit dps and soak up valuable gear.
---
Now I'm not going to be in a serious guild like this, but I understand the mindset. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the guild and players involved.
---
Agreed. None of these streamers were made famous off of MMO's and to sit there and assume they are better is a fucking laugh.
---
If I remember correctly this set originally didnt look like this. I remember clearing LBRS like 15 times for the shoulders. It looked nice and more colorful. Later they patched it to look like this.
---
Well the young bfa players came over to this sub. It's fine just scroll past all the streaming posts and the this is better in classic than in bfa thread.
---
1000 times better than people with their 'what comes after naxx obsession'
---
The current DBC files have it as 0.5s swing timer, 2H weapon with no sounds on hit.
---
Unfortunately I cannot find 'WeaponSpeed' in the 1.13 database files because im lazy/bad, but the source they are pulling from has 500ms swing timer listed.
---
Cheers, looks fun.
---
Straight up; the only streamers getting world firsts are the ones who became streamers by getting world firsts. Idc what anyone thinks i’d largely doubt Asmon and Soda have what it takes to get a first.
---
It isn’t a purely PvE game in the First race, you are competing with other players - many of whom will be better at the game, more dedicated etc.
---
bro you literally have 0% chance of killing him even if you botted and stream sniped like a cheating bitch.
---
It's either streamsniping or its just playing the game.  I have no idea how twitch works I don't deal with twitch but I know they do a lot of stupid shit so you're probably right. 
---
"Streamsniping" barely makes sense in the context of wow.
---
normies GET OUT
---
I'm a bit conflicted tbh. 
---
On one hand big streamers can make for interesting community driven content. The arathi highland battles are a good example. 
---
On the other hand you have to deal their community...
---
Tell me that makes sense
---
Is 550 bad.
---
Yes 550 is bad 550 might be slightly higher, but 550 definetly not going to hit anywhere near that mark
---
I get the impression that many of you must be experiencing streamers for the first time with the Classic beta. You're worrying about them way too much. All you have to do is ignore them and they go away. You no longer have to deal with them.
---
It's ok but not really anything special. It's nice for lvl 35 for sure, but most people will pick up the staff from ZF around lvl 45 that's pretty much the same so it's just a matter of time before you upgrade it while levelling. If you're hardcore levelling fast even if you bought it at lvl 35 you might only use it for 2 days.  
---
By lvl 60 there's better options easily obtainable.
---
Pretty sure it’s running on the BFA engine , minus the updated character models. 
---
Keep in mind a 40 person raid is going to be a lot more resource heavy than BFA raids with all the spell effects and particle rendering (not even adding environment graphics and boss graphics overtop of any custom UI enhancements). 
---
Yes it would run on a potato, but with low FPS and some input lag. Will it run on a potato today? This remains to be seen.
---
How can you be so upset about this?! Streamsnipers are annoying to both streamer and viewer and he is the right to be upset about them and not want them inside the game. It is very toxic behavior afterall! And you're not helping anyone by creating a guild full of salty stream snipers.
---
Streaming is an option, very easy to not get stream sniped.
---
Okay thank you, I won’t be grabbing it then, maybe long down the road just for the name only I have spare gold (if I ever do)
---
Link pls
---
Oh shit, an influencer got early access did they? Stop the presses that is completely uncalled for. Never in the history of ever has a streamer been sent games before release. Oh wait, they all get games before release.
---
Streamers are Blizzards biggest form of advertising for Classic. Get over it, it should be in everyones interest for Classic to be a wild success and getting exposure will lead to that.
---
Fake picture, doesn’t have action bars /s
---
Shouldn't anyone old enough to care about classic be too old to be this thirsty?
---
or, if players are being asshats and grief - enforce player driven consequences.. like what happened before
---
did you post it some time ago, i swear i have seen this image before.
---
Soda has always been an entitled bitch. If you don’t want to get stream sniped, don’t stream.
---
You shouldn't take these sayings and thier meanings for granite.
---
Yes they are. Knowing your opponent was a huge deal, it made battlgrounds so much more enjoyable than fighting 10-15-40 random players with red nameplates.
---
Hahahaha wow
---
My favorite part about this is now he’s going to get streamsniped way more because of it.
---
Maybe if he wants to sit and nolife a 15 year old game he can do it on his own time and not continue getting paid for it. Few streamers are actually about community and a better future. They literally started to make money playing video games. Radio Personalities that play video games and mostly get donations from people trying to be funny or smart. Nothing about him should really give him a say in what the developers do to the game. 
---
Not like it's ever really changed, but he is back into the same toxic life as when he started streaming WoW. Can't open his stream without hearing him just call something or someone or his chat retarded, like he is so unretarded he's at the top of the food chain. The game was big before him, you don't need him streaming to bring in users. If he streams himself live constantly trash talking and literally showing people "hey I am at this location and I am a literal god, no one can beat me" that is his own fault.
---
Is every winner of a duel against him a sniper and not allowed to raid? What the fuck. You can't just say people sniped you when you are begging for money by showing your screen to everyone who wants to see. Can't you /who and /target anyone you want to find? This is stupid and he should have been blacklisted from making money from being a toxic gamer a long time ago.
---
Yes, and it was possible up until cata iirc.
---
/cancelform /cast !Form  
---
This was a staple macro for any druid worth their salt.  It was used to remove CC/snares as well as powershift 10 rage (or energy).
---
I recall seeing those too. My first toon was a dwarf warrior and upon finding those statues I had to get my brother to come and take a look since it reminded us of the statues in the river in lotr!
---
i didn't even bash streamers, you're(see how that's spelled?) a fucking idiot
---
What an entitled baby. He wants his own special rules huh? Pffft...
---
Exactly. Well said
---
yes
---
She's a pretty lady, I've done my fair share of naked level 1 NE deletes before
---
You realize that the majority of streamers with high viewer counts right now are multi rank 1 players and others who have won blizzcon right? Cdew, venruki, snutz, xaryu, ziqo, pika, toez, the list goes on and on.
---
Agreed, I’m not disputing that he was toxic in the past, but it’s cool to see he’s doing pretty well (not Shroud well but still full time streaming) and it’s because his attitude is better
---
The queue time is irrelevant because if you get slow queues so do everyone else on your realm who you are competing against.  
---
Destroying a memorable and fun aspect of vanilla is not worth faster queues.
---
Exactly as easy as it used to be?
---
The druid Redridgelol?
---
Neither!
---
Fair-uh-lahs
---
so were demon hunters.
---
Rip
---
Most of them still are
---
You don't even need /cancelform on that iirc, since NS+HT will auto cancel form (unless I am tainted with retail memories ha)
---
TIL there is a time you're too old to enjoy a good booty shaking.
---
Does your route solely focus on questing?
---
Or a mix of grinding as well?
---
Very interested
---
I played Star Wars Galaxies back in the day and could use my Ranger skills to hunt Rebels with whoever would hire me. Use abilities in-game or fuck off.
---
You are absolutely 100% talking out your arse. 
---
It's not impossible that a GM would step in to stop *extortion,* but people were kiting Emeraldon elites to Org and Kazzak to Stormwind for years in Vanilla. Blizzard absolutely let it happen then, why not now?
---
He's right, though. Soda was one of the biggest factors in bringing back Classic WoW and [has been for years](https://youtu.be/UVY9R0L_B2U).
---
This sub loooves to give themselves credit and say petty shit about streamers, but you guys would still be looking for new private servers to play on without the impact of streamers.
---
Wait... can not every race or class learn certain professions in WoW Classic?
---
That’s your opinion. I personally didn’t give a fuck  about recognizing anyone on the opposite faction, but even after Battlegroups became a thing, I still saw names and guilds from my own server.
---
What isn’t opinion is that queue times that take hours or even days to pop suck. And premade queue dodging sucks. Cross realm BGs helps alleviate both these problems
---
Y’all need your safe space in classic wow too? 
---
Welcome to the jungle! Classic wow Pvp servers were a war zone where you could get camped for hours. No special treatment for streamers. Play a PvP server get ganked and get camped. It is part of the world that I s Warcraft. Period.
---
Higher population servers pretty much always have higher skilled players. Doesn't matter what game it is. 
---
Look at live wow. Its easier to get a group of reasonably geared and skilled players together on Illidan than it is on some random server like Eitrigg.
---
Its not a stretch its just a fact of life that if you have more people to draw from you will have more talented people.
---
Amen. Tobbe fair though the same applies to all the dorks in this thread makingbit their vendetta to hunt streamers...
---
im saying actual players wont give a shit. more than likely most of his fans wont give a shit because of how little people are going to be available. 
---
this bitchlist from bitchpoppin isnt going to do anything but make him look petty.
---
oki doki
---
And your insecure? Whats your point.
---
Melee hunter ftw.
---
A streamer saying "we are going to blacklist this one guy because he killed me a few times in hillsbrad" is targeted harassment on a pretty large scale from a streamer like Soda....
---
All that time is wasted if you're banned.
---
I'm not saying the streamers are skilled. I'm saying higher population servers have more players. Thus they have more skilled players.
---
Hahaha swifty is the one player you picked out to say how good he is? Surely you could have chosen someone a little bit better.
---
http://www.vanilla-info.com/warrior
---
Every Streamer cries about stream snipping and here everyone tries to avoid big streamers and so. Right now i am so happy that i am EU and dont have to deal as much with that bullshit
---
"I want to be a completely normal player" - easy fix, stop steaming make a character with a name that noone would recognize and enjoy the "normal player classic warcraft experience"
---
Same for French
---
Soda has chosen to be a streamer. He sure enjoys all pros so he should accept cons as well.
---
Kind of a stretch to compare what he made to what the bigger wow streamers make. Even dudes who sit on ~2k viewers are likely making 6 digits.
---
What’s his server? Asking for a friend
---
so you're out in full support of stream sniping?  c'mon man, that's just the lowest common denominator of a gamer.  idk if i agree with soda, but you only comment on the blacklisting, not the act of stream sniping which makes me think that's exactly what you are.
---
If rogues go daggers then they can use the ST weapon for huge ambush/backstab crits. Probably won't give them the edge for duels, but for WPvP/BGs it'll be fun.
---
For dueling, I feel like SPriest is going to take the top tier.
---
I am always truly amazed when I see his viewership on twitch. Seriously, 40-70 k ppl that enjoy this?
---
What is wrong with those people, lol.
---
Oof. My condolences
---
DBM doesn’t draw stuff on the floors. Not that it’s relevant in vanilla much anyway.
---
Its bad, and I debunked his video elsewhere.
---
He is misrepresenting his gear, and the fights.  Expect &lt;300 dps unless fully buffed with his listed gear unless you farm multiple MCPs per raid.
---
I've been watching Venruki. His stream is pretty chill and he seems like a good dude and the people in chat, if you pay attention to that, stay pretty chill too.
---
&gt; 3) 6 Paladins get to sufficient rank for the pvp gloves
---
Fortunately the [rank 7 gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23274) have the same +20 bonus to Judgement of Crusader so it's a matter of a few weeks worth of casual grinding to get there.
---
No. Go drink your soy milk.
---
&gt; Will it run on a potato today? This remains to be seen.
---
I created a virtual potato using the recommended specs from 15 years ago and the game was unplayable on the lowest possible settings.
---
Lmao we already know Blaze doesn't scale, chili is 100% SP scaling, and whatever other crap is going to be bad.
---
Yeah imagine outpacing a lock, or mage on a rogue...
---
Levelling was all I did in vanilla. 
---
But no, I’m taking my sweet damn time to get to the endgame.
---
Why did you "have to turn it off" - turning it off wouldn't give you PvP targets and gives lower rewards. Also I've played quite a bit of bfa, leveled 2 new toons from the start and there is always horde around, not so much in kul'tiras but when you go to the opposing island and definitely at incursion sites.
---
I call total bullshit on having to turn warmode off because there was no one there - both because I've never seen that to be true over multiple 0-120s and because there is never a reason to turn it off, you lose rewards and you lose the chance to PvP complete for what? The chance to see unflagged horde you wished you could attack?
---
Streamers are going to have a bad time in classic. They either have to constantly have an army around them or constantly be camped. This will make it not fun so they will cry for bans. 
---
If they wanna ban people attacking them then the followers should also be banned.
---
Wasn't that shit part of the game. I liked how rogue vanilla servers where. Like GM's would govern some shit like I got a warning for having a character with an inappropriate name(total bs but whatever) or we had some bugs during a raid and a GM would come and fix it. But if you decided to gank the shit out of gadgetzan or some other neutral city on a PvP server well tough luck.
---
all the procs are ranged
---
The big streamers are the ones that are whining and they aren’t particularly amazing. But they’ll probably get world firsts because they can play 12 hours a day 7 days a week and most of us can’t.
---
The most skilled guys are the less viewed dudes that have been top pvpers forever like venruki cdew snutz ziqo and they all seem to complain less and get way less streamer benefits than the top viewed.
---
His idea was terrible. But I do see he would love to play Classic in the way he used to play Vanilla and stream it. But it won't happen. Anything he does on stream there will be people ganking and gathering around.
---
You are implying that a 1v1 gank on soda where you win, is equal to gathering a guild/multiple people to only target him for hours?
---
I am also not defending his idea, but at least discern situations. His issue is a valid problem, and moving to a PvE server isn't going to solve the issue, a different form of griefing will appear. "Don't stream then" it's his livelyhood, if you don't like working "not working" isn't a realistic solution, since you still need money.
---
Thanks, I'll look into it.
---
Hes hitting a 60 level target, so subtract like 30% damage off the bat to Miss, Glance, and resist.
---
I know who he is he ganks me on a semi regular basis lol. I'm saying I've never seen him play a rogue since we were talking about good rogues. Thus why Payo and Perplexity were brought up.
---
dmed you
---
In the Classic spirit we would call that situation a shitty zerg guild, and mass PvP would ensue.
---
You might have just convinced me to give it a serious shot
---
Reread the proc for primal.... melee ap.

The streamer hate on this sub is fucking pathetic. What's wrong with being a streamer?
---
Viewers, sure.  Followers =/= viewers.
---
sure man whats his twitch?
---
Was that the guy jumping around in front of people while they were fighting? I just saw Venruki fight and was wondering what the hell was going on.
---
People take screenshots with their phone cameras but this guy took it to the next level and printed screenshot, took photo and uploaded it. Amazing!
---
I'd rather group with a stream sniper than a streamer.
---
I’ll be level 1 on the 26th... so...
---
well its a ratio, lets say 5% of people are truely skilled at the game, that means a higher population has far more unskilled players. More unskilled players than any other server. as a total number. As a percentage its all the same so tyhe comment is irrelevant
---
PvE servers that way -----&gt;
---
Well there’s our answer then, it won’t. Lol
---
Somebody has made a webaite to hookup with old vanilla guild mates. Cant remember the name.
---
He's coming to the right place. Especially if he plays a healer; he'll make friends quickly!
---
it's pretty known that the fists are designed for both ranged and melee in mind. read the description on the weapons set, I just linked directly to the buff.

[Arlokks grasp](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19910)

Streaming is a shit ton of money, however, you kinda have to be a psycopath to be willing to actually stream. He didn't really explain it very well. If you ever watch people talk in twitch, they literally know everything about your personal life. people scrutinize the fuck out of you, make rumors about you, stalk you. You're kinda selling your body out on a mental level, this is the same reason to why it makes so much money however. Theres zero sympathy, its their choice to sell their life out for this. Even once they quit streaming, people will stalk you depending how popular you are for years.
---
I think it's a sign of a great game when you actually do all related stuff even when you are not playing.
---
Race and class decided, then randomize till a decent name and look come up.
---
I think people get it for twinking, at 39 I guess
---
Bro you give me hope and then take it away!
---
Beseeker Rage is only in beserker stance which means you get 10% extra damage or rather 20% in this case because of defensive stance and you lose most of your rage.
---
You act like I should be ashamed of a girl leading me on? LOL. Have fun going through my post history.
---
I like &lt;Blacklisted&gt; better
---
Google vanillafriends, it should be the top result.
---
Shroud is the mega-rare breed of obscene skill, humble demeanor, and a pure sportsman. Kids should take note.
---
Or... Grind mobs with lucrative drops? Skinning?
---
Isnt pubg pvp game? You have to kill everyone to win so how is stream sniping a thing? Its because they watching stream and know where he is? But there are thousands of players so they have to be super lucky to end in the same game.
---
Not taking in terms of “speed”, but more in terms of synergy. 
---
Warriors best synergy classes are ranged, be it mage or lock or priest. Range class attacks, warrior charges kill the target, rinse and repeat. 
---
A rogue would have to “rush” to get in position to open or attack after the warrior attacks. Once the mob dies and let’s say the warrior charges to the next target, the rogue has to “catch up” again. Synergy wise, it’s not as smooth as a range class and a warrior. 
---
Exceptions to these are the hybrid classes like druids and shaman than can do a bit of everything. Even if they’re melee dps, they can keep up with the pace of a warrior or become the “tank” in with a range class (mage, lock, priest). 
---
Hunters are unique as well and could work well with a up front tank, but I think would benefit more from a duo-hunter group as they already have a tank (their pets). 
---
And this is where rogues fall in.. another unique class that would get more benefit from another rogue or Druid, due to their stealth vs that of another class. Their abilities work well together.
---
I'm agreeing with you. Him trying to use his personal experience to say he'd prefer his current job over doing what the current top wow streamers are doing is nonsense. 
---
They are making way more money than he was and likely still is.
---

I'm from Turalyon too! Niar and I used to farm LBRS at one point for gold aha. There was also the Alliance guild, The Last Watch which had some real geared players. Including a NE warrior called Keysoereyz or something like that, ended up with Hand of Rag + Swift Zulian tiger. Guy looked amazing sat in IF.
---
I heard a rumour that levels will remain... Which would be stupid since this is a closed beta. I can kind of understand it if it was an open beta.
---
I like how at some point they made new version to match "current" situation.. well now we are back at original version!
---
At first I thought "Isn't this bullying?". Then I watched the video... Looking forward to the "The Blacklist" VODs now.
---
grr @ Making me google this shit for you: [https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)
---
I guess at this point Blizzard should give a statement on this topic. I don't want people doing PvP-server things (ganking, etc) get banned for doing it to a steamer. They are already privileged, they get paid to play the game. I'd rather have them encourage stream hunting. Though at this point this is not needed. Any streamer playing PvP-servers without a delay will rightfully get sniped.
---
It’s getting so bad.... I open classic forums and I’ll I see is “streamer this.....” “Asmon that ...” ughhh
---
Soda was never one of the top players in the game. We used to PvP together a bit way back in the day on Azjol Nerub in Vanilla, TBC, WotLK...long before he was a streamer. He was a decent player don't get me wrong here, but nothing crazy.
---
I feel like you are misunderstanding what the blacklist is referring to. Its not a ban from blizzard its streamers and some guilds that wouldn't do content with a player or group that is known to grief. Ya it's not gonna work and it's silly but the issue is real. And nobody is saying that killing a streamer or even camping a streamer for a little bit is an issue. The issue is certain people and groups selectively camping certain  players non stop with the intention to stop them from even playing the game. That is without a doubt toxic behaviour that if it can be proven 100% (unlikely) they should be banned imo.
---
It's pretty ignorant to think soda is complaining about being killed in pvp hes very obviously annoyed with the same people trying to ruin his stream intentionally
---
Its also funny, when he gets streamsniped the OMEGALUL river overflows in chat. It's really a salt thing
---
Soda is one of the most entitled streamers.  He is so full of himself and delusional.  He claimed in GTA rp everyone was obsessed with him and followed him around.  Except he hired everyone at the place he worked and then was surprised they were there.   He needs to realize being a streamer doesn’t make him a god.
---
You can also use S, shift/ctrl a+d. 
---
I also bind w and move with both mouse buttons clicked in. Though if that's not natural for you (probably won't be) dont.
---
&gt; If you do not want people to be able to hunt you, perhaps consider not constantly telling others your up to date location
---
Quite literally victim blaming, stay classy, /r/classicwow
---
If you're worried about time restrictions rolling two characters will never be as efficient as focusing on one. Try to find a pocket healer to level with your warrior and everything will happen much faster.
---
No, I am not implying that. I am saying that if Soda got hundreds of people to boycott someone based on something he personally didn't like (Stream sniping) then he is harassing them.
---
He makes over a million a year.  He can deal with stream sniping.
---
When Asmongold still gave a shit he was actually up there in raid parses. I think most of the time he is playing bad on purpose to get a reaction from his viewers.
---
He really does seem like a great dude.

The health you gain is also increased by healing increasing items.
---
Soda is going to say that he got stream sniped whenever he dies.
---
I once was tanking in retail. Healer complained that I was hard to heal (no deaths tho). So one DPS said "we can always get new tank" and I got vote kicked out.
---
I'm really looking forward to authentic WoW classic experience, so I'm going to try avoid streamer servers. 
---
But... it would be some fun to make an all rogue pvp guild and hunt streamers,  Angwe  style.
---
or you can use common sense
---
100% false, Blizzard has **never** kept anyone's progress from **any** WoW Alpha/Beta/PTR, including BFA.
---
Well this is a bit late and probably won't get seen but man so many ignorant people in this post. What Sodapoppin proposes is a legitimate idea to prevent trolls and stream snipers. All the people saying he should just not stream and it wouldn't be a problem, but that's his job. In order to enjoy the game he has to not do his JOB? That's the dumbest suggestion I've ever heard. Also, if people don't want to deal with streamers or possibly getting blacklisted without intending to stream snipe, 1. If this idea was implemented, streamers would probably make sure they are stream snipers or trolls (ie. multiple instances of trolling or sniping, obviously being disruptive or annoying, etc.) usually it's pretty easy to tell when someone's a troll vs. a legitimate player and 2. People can just not play on the same server as the streamers if they're that afraid of it happening to them. You have to understand where Soda is coming from because he rarely gets to play online games without stream snipers and trolls and classic is a game he's wanted to play for a long time so I can understand why he would want to try and prevent trolls and stream snipers. He's not trying to "ruin the game" he just wants idiots and spergs to not be idiots and spergs which seems reasonable to me.
---
If you use your community to negatively impact someone's entire existence in a game, that is targeted harassment.
---
You could auto before sap all the way up to wotlk, I used to do it all the time in duels. It would take you out of stealth is the only problem.
---
Almost every class has DM solo farming capabilities. It's just harder for some classes.
---
Salt n peppa and heavy d up in the limousine!
---
Who the hell picks a character with leveling speed being the chief concern, other than Joana?
---
You can contact support and ask to be granted time that you payed for but never logged in. I’ve done it before at least twice. Left my sub running during legion, forgot about it, and contacted support looking for a refund. Was told no refund to be given but was granted 60 days game time. It was good enough for me since my sub ran for three months of me not using it.
---
I honestly feel on that. It’s kinda a useless zone with not much to offer but that’s what gives it so much MYSTERY for what it does have. All the other high level zones has so much to do in them, while with Azshara it’s not as straight forward. The aqual quints are a necessity and then there’s Azuregos the world boss thats not even aggressive. It has that beautiful fall season feel to it as well.
---
Someone said that in chat, his reply was "Fuck that".
---
It was never happening. The cool kids were out doing drugs and getting laid.
---
👍
---
Wrong person? 
---
Also, yeah me and soda pvpd together back in the day as well and he solo carried 1000 games and won all 1000. 
---
Easy to lie.
---
Dude get off soda’s dick ffs
---
Most of these streamers are US overall, EU is more into esports and actually watching fun stuff. So we won't have much issues.
---
The only "celeb" I noticed in WoW in vanilla / TBC era was  Athene, he had a few people following him when he was in cities but that was about it.
---
I hated feralas so much because it terrified me as a kid. Walking through those ancient forests woth ruins everywhere at nighttime
---
Not who you were talking to, but personally I wouldn’t want my major hobby (gaming in general) to become my job.  
---
If someone makes a great salary already it isn’t surprising they would rather have a private comfortable life.
---
&gt;People that go out of there way to continuously corpse camp a streamer should be banned or suspended.
---
you have to go back
---
Just....don't. Don't play a paladin. Played Paladin for 2 years in Vanilla in 2005. There were rumors the devs personally hated paladin class from EQ days and that's why they were so purposely gimped. Once you hit level 50 the grind was awful, it took FORVER to kill NPCs and leveling was really slow.
---
They even revamped the paladin class in v1.8 and it was a complete shit revamp. 
---
1.  Their biggest downfall? No direct damage (DD). It's literally luck based, look up the proc system. You weapon gets "blessed" for 30sec and has a chance for extra damage, or stun, or whatever effect of the blessing is. Because it was luck based but it had to proc a certain number of times per minute. This led to paladins wielding the slowest 2H weapons in the game with like 3.5s swing times.
---
2. No AOE. None. You can only attack a single target.
---
3. They have NO ranged abilities. NONE. ZERO. If a player gets 2 steps away from you with 1hp you will never kill them. You can't run faster than them, you can' sprint, you can't stun.....so they run until they find a buddy, they both jump you and you get fucked. 
---
TOTALLY sucks for PVP
---
Now....here's why you might want to play them. They are godly at PVE, especially 5man dungeons if you're heal speced. They can save a wipe, they have amazing healing abilities. They have special AOE spells for undead NPCs only.
---
You should be ashamed for going with her LOL.  If that hasn't already happened I suggest you just eat the loss and keep the shredded remnants of your dignity.
---
I think I’ll go Herb/Tailoring on my priest main, then make a bank alt and go enchanting. DE tailored goods and make the wand.
---
I don't think I've ever in my life seen someone banned for sharing an account. It's basically impossible for them to prove, especially if it's the same IP address.
---
Except a big portion of the set is pre-raid bis
---
lol yea sure
---
Still need healer? Sign me up!
---
Who cares they get paid to play a game
---
What? This is entirely false
---
Not defending Soda here (he's a real douche) but PvE is probably even worse. The opposing faction could just follow him around and snipe everything within a mile radius, kill NPC quest givers, purposefully bottleneck quests-- all without his legion of spergs having the option to kill the people camping him.  
---
He's in for a real treat no matter where he goes.
---
I'm going to make a guild to support streamers, and gank the fuck out of BOOMER ass streamsnipers. It won't be too hard since most of the most triggered here are probably pushing 40, and probably aren't nearly as dedicated to playing as they think they will be. Actually, fuck dedication, most of these guys commenting are backpedaling, keyboard turning, clickers who probably would get their ass handed to any rando ZOOMER that watches these streamers. It's pathetic people here are championing the idea of CHEATING (yes stream sniping is a form of cheating, which is why it will get you banned in many games, and from streaming platform) to fill some masturbatory fantasy they have against people they're jealous of.
---
This thread is filled to the brim with delusional man babies that can't even discern the difference from streamsniping and ganking.
---
how does this thread contribute to anything related to vanilla wow? Read through the comments and find anything about wow classic I dare you
---
I think it will be even more social than vanilla was for a while. People will feel the need to be extra social with one another given the social aspect of vanilla being such a huge talking point for why it is/was better than retail.
---
You gotta do it on YouTube or some other platform, Twitch is shit and will ban you for anything.
---
A hunter that was streaming a few weeks ago while killing Asmongold/Esfand got banned.
---
*unzips*
---
prostitute complaining because she is geting fucked  
---
the usual.
---
That's the mentality of a child or a poor person, that everything is acceptable as long as you get money. 
---
He didn't stream for 3 months because he wanted to play wow private servers so bad, he doesn't run ads and doesn't do sponsored streams. He obviously does not care about the money from streaming anymore.
---
TIL I’m a crappy friend.
---
Rouges are overpowdered
---
Read a lot of the comments here and it is pretty split on how people feel. Blacklists are not new to the game, so that doesn't really change. He seems to have a lot of pull, maybe more than a single guild leader that knows a few other guild leaders (or maybe not, I don't know). He could roll pve, which would solve it but I think he wants to play pvp and people would still follow him around and harrass him, maybe even more so. Ganking is still going to be a thing on a pvp server when people find out his name due to the ways to look up and find people in the game, or by having someone whisper you someone's location. It will be interesting to see this play out. I can see how the accusations of stream sniping could get out of control.
---
That's why I'm running far far away from any streamers server. 
---
I don't want 2019 twitch cancer running my server.
---
Thekal Weapons are just a meme, they proc extremely rarely (like once every 5 minutes) on fury warriors and rogues so there's no point trying to build around them at all as a hunter.  
---
   
---
Badge is BiS Fury wep gear so gl ever seeing that for a meme build.  
---
Dragonstalker 8pc is sick but probably has an internal cd which means your wep speed is irrelevant. Even if it doesn't it's just hunter dps increase so unfortunately still not gonna do much in the scheme of things.
---
Nothing personally, I don’t get why people like watching neckbeards play video games. I can think of a million things I’d rather be doing, like playing the video game myself. Must be a gen z thing.
---
I dont think your understanding what im saying and it's not gonna get through to you. But I mean what you said can literally be switched around when people are planning on forming communities to quite literally do what you just said. You seem to have a bias against soda/streamers and arent able to look at it objectively and read what I'm saying
---
Eyes of the beast is gr8 for wiping dags in a dungeon
---
FYI you don't need to do that to get good latency. I live in Germany and I have been playing in Spanish servers all this time without any problem. Just in case that you planned to change your usual non-german server in order to prevent lag.
---
honestly if it was just about testing them they'd be on vendors and "blue frogs" like we had in SWG.  I'm sure the drop rates are way up just to build hype.
---
Streamers will have no choice but to play on PVE servers, it’s as simple as that.
---
Soda has it backwards. It is not the job of other people to make allowances for his chosen lifestyle. It is up to him to accept the consequences of his chosen lifestyle.
---
He is acting like everyone owes him some sort of duty of care. Fucking spunk trumpet.
---
How fucking daft do you have to be to not see the difference between those two scenarios?
---
He's right to complain when he's constantly being targeted by multiple attention seeking stream snipers, although it's unrealistic to think that anything will be done about it.
---
You know those 'skippable' pulls that cause wipes because someone in the party doesn't realize what their aggro radius is against the mobs in the dungeon at the same time that the tank's not paying attention to what's going on behind them before they pull? 
---
Being able to nearly give your party the equivalent of stealth against humanoid skippable pulls is great, and totally worth the cost.
---
Track humanoids is absolutely mandatory, if you are leveling on a pvp server
---
I mean by no means cater to this shit, but a blacklist is always okay. You build your own society, and deal with it as one chooses. It's as simple as that.
---
Our First Kid will be Born on ~15 Aug, I'll stay 3 Months at Home, but I dont think I will have much time to Play. :/
---
and they will make their streamer blacklist work for everyone helping the other would be scarab lords. imagine grinding the insect parts and all the streamer followers ganking everyone that isnt in asmongloids party just because they want scarab lords for him.
---
Oh yep my bad, meant to reply to the guy above you.
---
I don’t believe /me has ever been able to do that. For the other faction it says you make random gestures or say something unintelligible or something like that.
---
its' a beta, it's not worth anything.
---
I loved the druid quests to get a new form
---
Hunter.
---
Works only if You're named "Shaadowdeth" and him "Maxcritshotz", otherwise you lack synergy.
---
You're forgetting that some classes there's actually no point in getting rank 14 at all.
---
So you mean you're not allowed to PvP on a PvP realm? Camping, hunting, bodyguards is all part of classic WoW, and everything after. Gear up and get better it's part of the game. Blacklisting from raids and such, well you don't need to play with him, but if you're good enough you won't need to worry about it. Also if you're killing Soda or anyone, you'll be on the enemy faction, and why would they care?
---
Because he has made so much.  I’m saying it is just part of the job.  He can not stream vanilla and then not have this issue.  He clearly wants to stream and make money (insane amounts).  The downside is some stream snipers.
---
I understand you perfectly, you think stream sniping is just as bad as something like ninja looting and people who stream snipe should be black listed. Reality check: Streamers WILL get stream sniped all the time, NOTHING will change that. Calling out the people to do it, if anything, makes it WORSE for the streamer. If they want to avoid stream snipers they have an option: Play on a PvE server. 
---
I also never said that people planning to form "anti-streamer" communities" is a good thing either, in fact, I said the opposite when I said that " If you use your community to negatively impact someone's entire existence in a game, that is targeted harassment. "
---
Community also applies to guilds. I don't have a bias towards Soda, nor have I ever watched him. I just have a problem with what is essentially a celebrity telling his community they should make a group of people specifically designed to ruin the experience of players who kill them a handful of times while leveling or out in the world. (Something that will happen to anyone)
---
No not really. Only stuff I remember skipping was in Dire Maul/Strat when you're doing the dungeon to kill certain bosses and don't want to waste any time. For levelling dungeons you pretty much charge around killing everything in your path.
---
Sure bud. Spread your wisdom. Change the meta. Youre the greatest.
---
Yeah, most people even. I had a naga but went back to a regular mouse because the naga was unnecessary.
---
when i was playing vanilla/tbc probably the most commonly reported thing was loot ninjas. Blizz will sort it out.
---
&gt; This is in response to people streaming in a starcraft match. It does not apply to WoW. 
---
🤔 I'm not sure how you come to this conclusion. Blizzard is Blizzard. If you've seen a blue post specific to WoW, I'd love to see it. I haven't seen one that supersedes this.
---
I'm 100% on-board saying stream sniping creates a bad experience for everyone. It's not sportsmanlike in a competitive sense - it's not entertaining for viewers. And -- If you get 'fun' from ensuring someone else can't have 'fun', for hours, you need professional help. 
---
That aside, I don't think Blizzard has ever taken a strict stance on stream sniping. They absolutely have taken action on griefers *(I have a dozen+ stories about people getting 3h or 1d banned for camping flight masters, killing quest npcs repeatedly, following a target player for hours, etc)* - but action on griefers would happen regardless of the 'target' being a streamer or 'normal' player. I don't think anyone is 'entitled' - if the rules apply to everyone.
---
Viable?  Not really. 
---
Is it possible to clear all content with a ret paladin in the group?  Sure. 
---
Are you a contributing member to the raids success?  Nope. You’re an anchor. At BEST you could swing nightfall and help the raid carry you. 
---
I REALLY advise against ret. if you want to melee dps play rogue or warrior. 
---
You are 100% a detriment to your raid group. 
---
That being said - I’m sure you can find some guild that will take you.  Getting 40 reliable players can be tough and some dps is better than no dps I suppose. 
---
Just be aware that given options - not intelligent raid leader would choose ret over just about any other spec.
---
Soda was never one of the top players in the game. We used to PvP together a bit way back in the day on Azjol Nerub in Vanilla and WotLK (not actually sure he played much in TBC, don't remember seeing him around), this was before he was a big streamer. He was a decent player don't get me wrong here, but nothing crazy, certainly nothing remotely close to being on the best players in the game's history.
---
But guys like Snutz, Venruki, Cdew, Ziqo, they're the real deal.
---
And your response is basically that you believe really really hard that it will be totally different this time.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not Christopher Robin, Honey isn't a lubricant, and Winnie Poh actually died from suffocation in that Honey tree.
---
This is something that happened because thousands of players at the same level wanted to level up. AKA what will be happening on launch.
---
I don't know how to read asmon, as I'm if he is being serious or not, but he told his chat to clip him saying his raid group will clear the raids the day they come out. I think they were taking about nax. There was some sort of deal he made with chat. He may be kidding. I haven't watched him enough to know of he is serious or not.
---
Gloooory daaaaaaayssssss
---
&gt;He clearly wants to stream and make money (insane amounts).
---
You assume that he wants to stream to make "insane amounts of money", maybe he's genuinely excited for the game he's been looking forward to for years, has a passion for and wants to enjoy it with his community?
---
Unfortunately warlocks have the worst of the 3 robes though.... But it's pretty good until BWL.
---
Google "classic warlock discord" or Zephan's gear sheet and make a copy for yourself. You can set your gear and talents in the spreadsheet and check your dps. Things may be different in real scenario due to rng (no spell hit so your dps can change a lot), but you can get an idea.
---
Key talents for raiding: shadow mastery or demonic sacrefice, imp shadow bolt, bane (-0,5s cast), devestation (+5%crit), 36yrd range and ruin. The more you missing, the more your dps will dip below optimal lvls (anywhere between -3-30%)
---
Cats are the only ones that can be viable throughout the raid cycle, thanks to those 1.12 buffs. But it still requires them getting gear. Gear which you rather want on your warriors/rogues.
---
I've been watching Venruki, probably my favorite to watch. He's really good but also really relaxed.
---
One of the biggest ones plays paladin I believe
---
The only reason they can Aoe level so efficient is because they are in full bis gear. A full geared level 30 has the same stats as a leveling level 45.
---
Paladin or Warlock probably have the best class quests imo
---
Where are you getting that number from? Because even in full AQ40 gear with full buffs on APES first clear of Naxx I'm seeing 600-750 DPS on Patchwerk.
---
Here's a random Nefarian kill video from pserver I found:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrikSf-ACsw
---
Their top DPS is doing like 450 DPS with more of them around 350 DPS.
---
This is so ridiculous, I hated the fact he said he's willing to camp lowbies because hes an asshole but someone being an asshole to him? BANN!!!! NO CONTENT!!! COMMUNITY RISE UP! fuck off... I hope he gets streamsniped to hell and his seething with anger, he'll get what he deserves.
---
Get rich. Like 5k+  rich.
---
High horse streamers at it again. FFS.
---
I don't really understand why people waste their time trying to piss off a celebrity streamer, why they feel entitled to go bully and camp them because they "shouldn't give their location". They do it for positive viewer interaction, and when you streamsnipe, you're honestly worse than a so-called "dictating streamer". 
---
Imagine not being able to play the game anymore because everyone's out to get you, or so it feels. Even that ceeling can turn you from a game completely. I stopped playing CS:GO for example due to the insane percentage of cheaters, which made every death or killstreak very fishy to me. Not fun to play anymore at that point.
---
Zizek...dude...i remember when i first watched his pvp vid......changed my life
---
Will of the forsaken, as you mentioned, is quite nice but the Orc passive of 25% stun resistance is the real shit here.
---
1/4 of all stuns will just not happen to you by default.
---
Tbh there's nothing inherently wrong with what he's saying, but trying to identify who's actually stream sniping and who's just camping him cause hes a streamer is nearly impossible to do, not to mention that people really wont care outside his guild whos on the blacklist. Too naive.
---
95% of the mages will solo single target level.
---
No one is gonna read this
---
soda acting entilted, what a surprise
---
fura videos .... one of my first loves
---
Only very very few make millions, and you probably as a new streamer won’t be making even 6 figures for a long time.
---
Whereas taking the proper education can land you six figures with a higher success rate.
---
Don’t stream for just the money, and don’t rely on it as your main income before it actually is your main income.
---
Private servers often implement deserter debuffs on failing to join a queue pop because dodging is so rampant among people now due to ease of access to things like discord.
---
There's very little reason for me to believe that this in combination with what other people have said about faction imbalance and queue times would result in healthy PvP.
---
You can say ridiculous things like "just merge servers" which not only assumes there are equal server types with opposite faction imbalances, but also that such mergers wouldn't overpopulate but they don't cut it.
---
More importantly let me ask you this, what's the difference in your mind between merging servers permanently and merging servers temporarily into a BG group?
---
I also did. Doing white staff damage and moonfire spam.
---
i pvp'd with macabre crew (randawl with his atiesh/sloanez/glickz etc)  loved inspecting tshingh too (creator/leader of  vodka)
---
Off topic but i always wanted a rogue-ish melee class that has shadow elements/casts as a way to deal damage with poison/shadow dots and shadow melee spells. 
---
Like a melee class that evolves around heavy dot/spell damage.
---
True, at least i didn't.
---
They don't call it STVietnam for nothing :p
---
The answer varies based on the patch. In general no, and certainly not in patch 1.12
---
People that are hotheaded say stupid thing sometimes
---
That is a legit essay
---
What? The early hunter tiers are the worst!
---
Ya then they gave it to other classes. I think in cata?
---
 BFA orc Warrior fashion = fierce champion of the Horde
---
Classic orc Warrior fashion = circus clown dropout
---
But somehow I am still so much more excited to play classic WoW than BFA, I can't explain why =D
---
I mean you still to this day have your Enchantment Shamans..
---
Getting to 60 quick will be a legitimate concern for many early on. Think about it. Modern games are ALL about the "end game". For any that are either new to wow or started playing anytime after BC, they don't know any better. 
---
So, my prediction is that they will start paladins and warriors, see people begin to drastically outlevel them, and choose to reroll a faster leveling class. It won't be until they realize that classic wow is a journey, not a destination, that this will change.
---
Pacifist guild....that mage joink made a few videos...i remember them very well.  remember being very sad watching him slowly disappear when tbc came out and rarely saw him in screenshots in kara/ssc etc...remember pacifist guild forums and checking their screenshot threads....
---
I have a great deal of respect for you OP for being mature and trying to put a stop to senseless name calling.
---
That being said, soda's a dickhead. So are about 90% of WoW streamers it seems. At least the popular ones
---
Well, there's no more useful information there than in the blizzard interface code, really. It helps a bit but it's still challenging without being able to test. Anyway, thanks for the information.
---
This was with over-stacking armor buffs i believe so consider this for physical damage dealers (ie should be a bit lower.)
---
Dwarf priests are THE shit. This is an excellent choice
---
Downvote
---
The Chad classic vs the virgin BFA.
---
The last line makes you sound like a hypocrite. He says he wats to blacklist people for chasing him down relentlessly on stream while uou say you will do the same to people you blacklist. So basically you plan on doing exactly what he plans on doing you jist don't stream.
---
A level 20 vs a level 120.... come on now?
---
I know even at 60 some of the outfits weren’t that cool but at level 20 you’re mix matched to hell and back.
---
Besides that BFA had Time to make badass sets.
---
* Paladins have the DM / Scholo mount quest.
---
* Warlocks have their DM mount quest.
---
* Priests have their Benediction/Anathema quest.
---
* Hunters have their Rhok'delar quest.
---
* Rogues have Ravenholdt related quests.
---
* Warriors have stance quests plus WW Axe. Technically a few lucky Warriors will get to experience the full Thunderfury quest, though it isn't technically a class quest.
---
* Shaman have totems plus their Skyfury helmet quest
---
* Druids have various form quests, plus Moonglade, but nothing too exciting later on.
---
* Mages have pretty weak quests, though a few lucky ones will likely get to do the Atiesh quest-line which is pretty neat.
---
It does fuck all in bgs, but it still works for world pvp and where it'll come in importance is world dragons.
---
Ahh, you fight like a pregnant woman.
---
Wives are the ultimate Boss 
---
They have no weakness and will use yours against you
---
Haha too true.
---
In classic, you start to look good, after you actually deserve it. Grind raids or pvp and maybe then you get something worth showing off while standing on OG bank.
---
Yeah, have fun letting people run when you're a few bosses into BRD. Also next time you could view the spell info to know Rebirth is not a 10 min cooldown. "Don't let people die LUL".
---
1. As a streamer you will inevitably get your private life involved in some way. When you sit in front of the screen for 10 hours a day every day its impossible to not reveal some facts and tidbits about your private life, like whether you are single or have a partner, whether you still live with your parents or not etc. 
---
This kind of exposure to an audience can have a lot of negatives. Your partner or family could fall victim to stalking. 
---
2. You have to entertain an audience that is whimsical at best. Young teens and millenials mostly, pleasing them can be pretty hard. You can lose your audience in a day if you fuck up in their eyes.
---
3. We see those big 10k streamers and think "holy shit they make bank from nothing.", but we dont really look at the thousands of sub-100 viewer streamers who just cant grow. To grow on Twitch you need a personality or persona and it can be surprisingly hard to build one and keep it up. Thats something alot of people underestimate.
---
4. Specifically concering Twitch, you have to be incredibly careful with your community these days with the way TOS is set up. Your community CAN get you banned if you dont moderate it correctly, but too much moderation turns people off your stream.
---
Thats just a few points, there are surely more.
---
Great job on the addon, however Im not a huge fan of this. Lets not built in stuff like this into Classic. The game is and should continue to be individual, and experimental. Spells that many would consider a waist might suddenly be used in some creative way - and even become the new meta.   
---
Choosing spells accordingly to your current economy and needs is just one of many places in Vanilla where the player accually have to stop, think and make a individuall choice. It may sound silly, but lets not make small things like this "automatic".
---
 The streamer servers gonna be a sad thing, just a pool of streamers hunting for content, constantly whining about stream sniping and sheeps running around fanboying them, a hard yikes.
---
Made an alt but never logged in.
---
I love how, after literally describing a witch hunt, you said it's not a witch hunt XD
---
New, LUL
---
gratz tho
---
It's still VERY few items obtainable in phase 1 and 2 that are so strong they'll last that long. Most will be replaced by BWL (phase 3) and ZG (phase 4) at the latest.
---
&gt; Why did you "have to turn it off" - turning it off wouldn't give you PvP targets and gives lower rewards.
---
There was almost no one around when I turned it on.   I felt like I was playing WOW - single player simulator 5000.  I went through around 40 levels before I turned it off.
---
With bad spawn rates
---
Do you have a source?
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=10922
---
honestly, i was just spitballing and basing it off what the Paladin did, account for similar gear and figured someone on full BiS BWL gear would probably hit more then that... probably. i don't remember numbers at all.
---
All blizz did was teleport the tauren troll to a zone that was far away, didnt ban him or anything
---
Dam i have always been a horde player but might have to roll ally to camp this fucker
---
IB4 this moron gets a bounty put on his head and is harassed into quiting the game.
---
I’m game witch hunt is different from irl witch-hunting
---
I'm avoiding the streamer server and i would suggest everyone do the same but moist people in this thread seem clueless about stream snipers. It is very obvious when someone is sniping
---
I'm not on the Beta, but if someone could check it would be great.
---
They tried to normalize the pets in the later patches but originally yes there were certain unique abilities
---
and unless you're the top few % of streamers then you aren't making that much money
---
I couldn't care less about stream sniping. Ghosting is very questionable though, especially in a tournament setting. Griefing is bad in any context. 
---
The thread you linked is talking about sniping on ladder in a game centered around matchmaking. It's a pretty big difference in context, but maybe they hold the same ideas for wow. I guess I should have said that it doesn't necessarily apply to wow. That being said sniping isn't really the problem here.

He was a fucking cs superstar.
---
I was on that server!! Human paladin, Skorpion
---
Sounds awful.
---
Good things come to those at the gate
---
Why even comment at all then?
---
Funny, you call everyone else delusional man babies. Ironic.
---
Warrior is nothing without  pocket healer in vanilla. Leveling is pain.
---
PPP was the top top guild I remember. Still remember the first time I saw Bru fully decked in T2 tier in org.
---
Frets on Fire was created at the Assembly LAN event held in Finland as part of a game compo and iirc won the competition and yes, it was a total Guitar Hero rip-off for PC.
---
He is absolutely not serious. 
---
He banks on people taking him serious then laughing at them for taking him serious.
---
Its all rng, inflation, and ah manipulation tbh. Like the other day in the beta I bought a bunch of herbs/cloth at 70% price and relisted
---
Just gota have a good eye for opportunity
---
It is worrying people need an addon to tell them what to buy.
---
Have you tried reading the skills and judging whether or not it's useful to your playstyle?
---
Oh really? So like, you don't really kill the person?  
---
It's the same concept and it derives from it. Of course it's different, you know, it's a videogame.

BFA = participation trophy/dress up for folks that had to wait to solo content to transmog out .  BFA to me in one huge instant gratification participation trophy.

But loot at the sexy seal of sylvannas from SFK, the shield from the turtle boss in WC And the sword quest reward! On a level 20 thats pritty nice gear.
---
Exactly. But today I'm drawing on a whiteboard :D
---
After I saw a pic of Asmons living area around his computer, I can't take him serious.  What a fucking filthy slob.
---
Asmons entire stream is carefully constructed to get reactions from viewers. He keeps hyping shit up to farm Pogs and PagChomps from chat, then farms LULWs and OMEGALULs from chat when he inevitably fails to live up to the hype.
---
Private servers have had populations far, far exceeding any server that classic ever had and with like 48/52 balances and they have queue issues. Popularity isn't the only variable.
---
No one would watch
---
Streamers who account share will end up permabanned like reckful, they also probably won't stream bg grind 16 hours a day because it seems like something that would kill viewership after months of the same thing over and over. Some streamers just don't have time either, cdew has a family, a child and 4 dogs to take care of between streams.

My wife keeps saying no, I think it's time for a divorce

Nice one. I giggled.

Because we were playing on patch 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc. Not 1.12.
---
Bloodthirst was a pure leveling talent originally that increased the damage of your next attack by 100% after killing enemies that awarded XP or Honor.

The Warrior class got overhauled in 1.6 which was the BWL patch.

But you're being toxic to him?

Hi, /u/dr4ikus
---
I like getting the 4 totems on Shamans, Forms on Druids or Demons on Warlock. These quest give new abillities, thats why these are the best.
---
&gt;carebears whinging about pvp on a pvp server.
---
It really is vanilla wow *cries with joy*.
---
Wait where are the maxim magazines?!
---
I can understand why. While I do like the Lightforge set all in all, I've also never really liked that "new" helmet, which is by far the worst looking item of the set. 
---
My first level 60 was a paladin and I never got to have the "old" lightforge helmet. Oh well, at least really cool looking armor sets will await us later in the game.
---
Random.
---
Can only make 1 faction on a pvp server
---
He's perfectly switched on. This thread is (ironically) full of whining entitled people. Soda came up with a suggestion to solve the problem of stream sniping that is entirely within the rules and community power, and suggested an unofficial streamer server to do it on, containing the problem of streamers literally everyone has been bitching about.
---
Soda essentially suggested a vanilla ethos that was there back in the day 'Act like a dick and people will spread the word'. That's it.
---
Now everyone is up in arms as they want to do whatever they want without any community consiquences whatsoever. 'sure! Gank me while I'm invis! I'll still raid with you! Wouldn't want to upset you today :((('
---
Yeah it's soda that's entitled...

I specifically wont be banned because I am a legal guardian of my brother and he is unable to have his own account.

I thought this was common knowledge by now but sharing an account with children in your family is not bannable by the TOS.
---
If I had 2-3 brothers I could literally shift them around and pretty much have living bots to play my game with zero chances of repercussions.

Those are terrible weapons for weaving aimed shot between auto shots. You'll clip way too much auto shot dps.  Plz no.

I play OSRS, I watch forbearance who regularly PKs streamers on PK worlds or in the designated areas that you should expect to be killed by other players. That’s just apart of the game.

Warlockage
---
Playing in a PvP server, broadcasting your location at all times, get mad when people play the game lolol, put a delay on your stream? And also doesn’t he have like a raid following him that he can summon if anyone ganks him?

Whenever someone tags me with a dot or anything. I just freeze and let my character stand still, the majority of gankers will prolly kill you 2-3 times then leave you alone.

All i see here is a level 20 that doesnt skip leg day

There was addons that would attempt to join everyone in the raid to a queue at the same time get everyone in the same BG but it wasn't perfect by any means.

Hey that sucks but good thing is you got plenty of time to be set up till august? :)

Thanks for your reply. It didnt know if they were gonna do something like lvl syncing or something similar or if it was a complete restart.
---
 Yeah AQ is what I was thinking. 
---
I loved vanilla WoW (except for the running back to MC after wipes and waiting on everyone to go to the bathroom and get a drink). I just got fed up when they started completely changing how my lock worked. I literally just saw an ad here on reddit for it and was like wha?!?!! Lol.
---
No memes it was a legit question
---
not your personal army. just relax
---
Cheap bait, try harder.
---
fuck all streamers big and small
---
Depends entirely on the streamer. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near a server that Asmon or Soda are playing on, but I'd definitely consider rolling on Swifty's server and trying to participate in whatever PvP antics he gets up to. My 14 year old self would shit his pants if I told him I got to PvP with/against Swifty.
---
Nice jugs
---
I feel like this touches on an important issue a lot of people will be completely blind-sided by; If Classic is the big success people are dreaming of EVERYTHING will change. If Classic sees millions of players sticking around that's millions of players that is not and has not been part of the classic wow community. Every grievance, every hot topic, every suggestion from this community will become nothing but a whimper from an extremely small minority.
---
You might hope that all these people flooding in would share many of the sentiments that shared around these parts, but in reality most of them won't. In some way you could say that the success of classic might just end up killing the classic community (yet again).
---
Crazy fucking idea here, if you don’t want to be ganked by opposing faction, don’t broadcast your exact location to the opposite faction. There is no such thing as honor in pvp you win or you die. If you don’t wanna get corpse camped do what literally everyone else does, log out for a few minutes and then hearth back in a little bit later. Soda is being a whiny bitch
---
Be an oce player a streamer will never impact you.
---
I'm not a fan of trying to follow a streamer around either to be a dick or help in some way.  I feel it's better for the server and the stream for them to be treated like anyone else. 
---
But that won't happen, so I'll just avoid the big ones the best I can.
---
But not on Monday, he has to watch is son. Bummer.
---
Hopefully someones redoes the addon for warlock pet spells that Mark's the ones you've gotten already. Hard to remeber what ones you have and dont have
---
Excellent key bindings.
---
I never cared to begin with.  You guys should try it.
---
I thought you had to unlock each race and class by getting the last to 60. Human Warrior start and I hated it.
---
Younger me was..
---
I'll be rerolling if one of the big ones winds up on my server because i'll straight up quit if all forms of chat simply become "POGGERS" "POGCHAMP OMEGALULZ", etc like twitch chat spam is.
---
Maybe i'm old, but this whole "act retarded to fit" in thing and typing largely in twitch emotes just isn't the community i want to be a part of.
---
If you subscribe to World of *War*craft, expect a world of war. If you can't deal with that go play candy crush
---
We used to MC opposite faction, then they could understand our chat
---
..usually to give them vent details so we could win trade AB lel
---
So high ranks and premades will essentially stomp everyone? Legit not a casual game. :D
---
This guy is a self entitled a\*\*hole  
---
Big baby crying on his millions of donated dollars without any work done cause he got killed in a video game  
---
Insane
---
Nope. Still hoping Blizzard makes the smart decision here.
---
LMAO noooo
---
How much are the most popular streamers making, really? Like what companies are sponsoring them, is it more than one? Is there that much money in retail wow market for streamers? I'm way out of the loop with blizzard / gaming scene at large, had no idea it was this big a thing
---
What was it called?
---
My server had a website, but you could literally submit your friends names and a screenshot of them in your party doing anything and they'd be added a few days later for whatever thing you made up so barely anyone used it outside of guild recruitment.
---
&gt; people don't talk in games anymore.
---
You know, that's not totally surprising. Video games (and "heavy" boardgames) are games first. There are flukes that lead to more socialization (like WoW and tabletop RPGs). But overall games actually try to remove the need for socialization because it increases pure play experience.
---
So the video game industry has been moving to automate away most friction that stop you from playing games. No friends online? Automated matchmaking! No time to travel to the dungeon/raid? Porting right to the start of the instance! No time to grind consumables? Decrease reliance on them! Too long travel times? Flying mounts with 3x the speed!
---
And it has been successful. People play games **a lot** more now than back then. Mechanics are a lot more complex. It's impotant to understand that this is an important intrinsic incentive for developers. If more people play a game longer, it's satisfying for the dev. By understanding this, you can identify how to counteract it so the choice of games available actually reflects a variety of experiences that not only focus on the "game" part. WoW:Classic is a very good example for that (as is OSRS).
---
Me pointing out the lack of logic in his toxic attitude makes me toxic?  What?
---
My retail account has been wasting its 6 month sub for a while now. I have heaps of b.net currency and even the prospect of free retail can’t make me want to play.
---
Good post dude, I've enjoyed reading it. Sadly the majority of the people who think griefing vs streamers is okay won't change their mind until they are the griefers victim.  
---
And I applaud at everyone saying "I won't stop ganking streamers because reasons" because they don't stand a chance against experienced PvP players like Venruki, Sodapoppin and even Asmongold.
---
Wait I don’t get it what’s wrong with not wanting to be stream snipped in video games?
---
That’s why I’ll play on a PvP server ! https://youtu.be/lcXY3I3_uHs
---
mage is ook leuk
---
no you are right. This is part of role playing. i would understand if a GM steps in if something like that lasts too long. Similar to the hakkar plague debuff. But actually banning people for utilizing game mechanics in an mmorpg is absurd.
---
Also as for streamers, Soda is a child and therefore his ideas should be treated as such until proven otherwise. Even Asmon said it once, in a clip i watched, that streamers are making money from streaming a game, sniping a just a small disadvantage that comes from it.
---
Most gamers game with 2 monitors these days (many of me and my friends did and we would have guides or a tv show on depending on what we were doing) it’s not a stretch, modern Internet is more than capable of gaming and streaming simultaneously
---
Vanilla peaked at like 7 mil towards the end. Still a ton though
---
I’m running BFA just fine on my 10 year old desktop (i7-920, Radeon HD4800). So classic won’t be an issue either. Don’t waste your money.
---
And LOL at that guy recommending a “budget gaming pc for 1000$”. 300 is probably enough if you really have nothing right now.
---
Good explanation except you are talking about layering versus sharding. Phasing is a totally different thing!
---
QQ
---
That is called mental illness
---
There’s an ally in a horde group nooOOOO !
---
Maybe he likes is job?
---
its an mmorpg with a lot of socialization and community. nothing would prevent that from happening. I would certainly do it, as would anyone here if given the opportunity to earn 100g.
---
I’d do it for the lols and offer to sell them the name for $100
---
man.. I was expecting SoTC &gt; judgement &gt; SoTR and then watch that plant explode by all the holy damage but the videoman sat in wisdom all day not realizing the power in his hands.
---
if you are talking about the trade-skill and not the poison ranks: 
---
yes it definitly makes sense to level it while leveling your char. Especially since pick pocket doulbes down to also skill lockpicking besides giving poison mats.
---
I would :)
---
Streaming has nothing to do with the game. You choose to stream, pay the consequences.
---
The more spell/shadow damage a warlock has on their gear, the more profitable Drain Life becomes (your CO). In my experience drain tanking build starts really shine since 38+ level.
---
Millions? Streaming itself brings that much money? I mean, I know nothing about streaming but that numbers seem unreal, got any source for that? I doubt that playing video games in your room can make you a millionaire in one year...maybe I'm wrong, as I said I know nothing about the twitch revenue
---
Sounds like he's entitled and wants the game to bend to his will because he has influence.  I'll be sure to roll on the same server just so I can try and stream snipe him.
---
The saddest part is that stream sniping is such a fucking zoomer thing to do, but it's the old school vanilla boomers crying about streamers making a blacklist, something THEY themselves used to do too. 
---
This sub makes no fucking sense and I hope to god it doesn't represent the general Classic WoW playerbase, because it's gonna be a horrible experience to play with these guys if they act like this in-game. Vanilla was as much about the players as it was the mechanics, and the players can easily ruin the entire thing.
---
and with an invalid name to boot
---
So because someone works at McDonalds, they have priority over everyone else in a McDonalds?  Fuck off with your warped logic.
---
Soda wasn't famous off MMOs? Interesting what game did he start his career with?
---
TIL killing "someone elses mobs" whatever the fuck that means, is griefing.
---
Your opinions are unpopular because you don't know what you're talking about.
---
If you think I should be banned because I pop out of stealth on top of a corpse you want to loot, and you get flagged for PvP and I kill you.  Then I don't think this is the game for you, streamer or not.
---
&gt; If he really cared that much about experiencing pvp vanilla properly he'd have a separate off stream anonymous account/character that he plays for 3-4 hours a day that no one knows about. Even if he only played it for 3 hours a day he could still easily play and raid at the highest level and experience the game just like a normal person would.
---
He could do that, but he couldn't really do ranked BG's or play with most of his friends since they are streaming as well. Voicechat is also out of the question since he someone could recognize him and leak his alt. Keeping a character hidden while still playing normally is more or less impossible for Soda, he would have to mostly play solo, which isn't all that much fun in a mmorpg in the long run.
---
the world is big enough to just go your own ways and mind your business.
---
The occasional ganking by much higher level players is as a matter of fact part of the game. 
---
Take a notebook, write down their names, go looking for them when your lvl 60 and get some payback.
---
Matchmaking was never really an issue back in the day...
---
Nice summary. 
---
My guild set up an internal private server where we create characters with a GM account just to practice individual regions and level areas. Everyone knows their route by heart. We practice UBRS runs and other bottlenecks in full greens. We share workout and cooking guides to make sure we're all physically fit for the 35-40 hours straight to lvl32 on opening night and the 4-6 hours of sleep per night until lvl60 afterwards. We'll clear MC in the first week yet nobody has heard of these players outside of the private server scene. 
---
Anybody can dick around in the game for hours. We've watched their leveling times. Those streamers are not prepared. Not even close.
---
Classic is gaining popularity. The mass is coming in this sub in large numbers. Get ready when Classic launches it will just as interesting or possibly even more ! Stay tuned ;)
---
yeah I never understood leaving out the fun spells,either. I get it when it comes to high level fireball/ arcane missiles as a frost mages and stuff like that,though.
---
Luckily warlocks get their lvl 40 mount for free anyway, no reason to choose.
---
Go ahead and make your little "blacklist" guild, it will be easily squashed.
---
Red=Dead friend.
---
I can't wait to be camped personally, haven't had to keep a list of people to fuck up later since vanilla and i'm so excited to get to do it again.
---
It's not a fair comparison. If it's natural it's fine but I can understand being angry at several people targetting you and trying to grief and ruin your time. Yes, that sometimes happens to everyone, but obviously nowhere near the same scale as to streamers.
---
I think they're setting themselves up by streaming but it's not like he's mad at some one off things. He's obviously talking about repeated occurrences that make it obvious what's going on. Like having the same rogue gank you 3 days straight and know exactly where you go is pretty obvious. Someone who is lame enough to do that receives no sympathy from me.
---
&gt; shitshow Saturdays
---
You mean that thing where he gives people some kind of gambling like incentive to give him :5bux: every month?
---
And turn with A and D
---
you dont drain life while leveling. you dot and wand.
---
Since I never played vanilla I know so little about end game pvp. Im just worried that casuals are just gonna have a horrible time in battlegrounds vs high ranked players or even premades.
---
My friend and I would try to shut down entire zones for the entire weekend and by extension prevent people from progressing in that zone. 10 hours straight back in the day would not be a stretch. 
---
I can't do it now because I am an old fuck with responsibilities but I don't doubt some horde players will just log in/log out of red ridge/dark shire.
---
So where is the issue, exactly? If a group of people want to maintain a shared Blacklist/Kill-on-Sight-list, they should obviously be free to do so. Most servers will, most guilds will, most players will for themselves. Why would a streamer community be any different?
---
Don't be a dick or live with the consequences. I'm not going to invite a ninja looter just because he only did it to screw over whatever streamer on camera.
---
TL:DR Your post is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Griefing vs everyone is fine, it’s a part of the game, sort the problem out yourself or with your friends the old fashioned way with in game violence. Find that jerk, with your friends and ruin him until he logs out, if you can’t do that lead him to some guards and have them kill him. Outplay people harassing you it’s as easy as that.
---
TIL, thank you
---
Stuff like blink is always scroll up. Makes so much sense to me. Also on my dk in retail the grip was always scroll down, felt good.
---
Fun fact: the idea of "!" as a quest icon is older than WoW. Blizz used this icon first in WC3 in 2003 in the Rexxar campaign of Frozen Throne
---
J OMEGALUL B
---
Your logic is shit.  One nerd making a video means fuck all unless thousands show their opinion of the video as well, meaning they all had the same impact.
---
Streamers 'saving wow' is like some shithead on reddit saying "DAE STUFF?"
---
I wouldn't take beta economy into any thought of classic. Everything's wack because of low max level cap. The extra silver you get from quests help at Max as well.
---
We'll see when classic hits. I'll be suprised to see people with mounts right at 40. Unless your spending all your time on the AH instead of leveling
---
I really miss that pre wotlk paladin feels
---
Wrote a comment 2 days ago that exactly this would happen.
---
True, it also makes his more "cocky" persona work.
---
Because if you just act cocky and succeed all the time people will be annoyed by that, it's rather unlikable if someone brags all the time.
---
But if you fail regularly while being cocky it gives it a somewhat comedic touch.
---
Get off the computer, Dad. Mom said she needs to talk to you in the kitchen.
---
Posts like this are why I spend hours in the Barrens killing quest NPCs.
---
Don't night elves get extra dodge? Is that not good for tanking?
---
nicebinds
---
Make like a tree and get out
---
That I dont mind so much.  Again, the difference  is in targeting a character (aka popping out of stealth so you can gank me) and targeting the player (spending almost two hours doing nothing but trying to keep me from playing the game). I didnt mind the trying to get me to attack him. Annoying? Yes. A problem? No. It was when he followed me and killed every mob in sight for no reason other than to keep me from doing anything FOR OVER AN HOUR! I eventually gave up and logged off.  I call that griefing.
---
Stream snipers ruin the game, plain and simple!
---
I don't know man, I kinda get where he is coming from. I mean people should be free to do whatever they want in this game as it is part of the game. But I also imagine it to be very annoying and frustrating to be constantly surrounded and disturbed by a group of other players when all you want to do is to enjoy the game. Shitty situation for everyone involved
---
Nope. Not pre-raid. The tier 1 and 2 sets are bis for their phase though. Unsure about tier 3.
---
Its somewhat sad to see honestly.
---
Asmon was a true nolife gamer a few years ago, he meant what he said. Nowadays its really all just an act.
---
A true southpark fan would have renamed him Edwin VanQueef.
---
i'd say hunter leaf quests
---
Why did you even leave a comment then as I clearly said 10 hours above. Zero issue with 1-5 hours really!
---
I don't know, I find the shit my *allies* say in Heroes of the Storm bad enough to frequently consider disabling chat entirely for the sake of my sanity.
---

---
I'm pretty sure the idea is more so for people like the guys who camped summit. 
---
Sorry to tell you guys but if you camp someone for hours you are probably going to get banned. It is sad what people will do for attention these days.
---
So they're not actually improving as they play?!? I havent watched too many streams of late but the ones I did watch displayed their lack of Classic knowledge for all the world to see
---
he also turns off his stream when people kill him in wow. Literally ended his stream yesterday cuz some guy killed him like cmon lol
---
Waa waAaa me no like streamer ! Me no want streamer to be able to play game!
---
I know.  I leveled one, lol
---
The VIP beta streamer list shows they care more than they used to...

I love the idea of a guild going after people like that, especially with the same name lmao
---
Did you guys get bullied by streamer back in high school?
---
That's not really true entirely. There are a lot of un censored streamers out there who make good money. Also, at work with a typical job, you do need to censor yourself. You can turn off stream and just stop and come back anytime and still be successful, Asmongold did it for several months, others have done it, and more will.
---
Your post seems like complete conjecture and you don't know really what you're talking about.
---
Now all his luck has been used up, there’s none left for drops during live classic :(
---
Only morons believe that playing on a PVE server magically fixes the issue. His best option would be to not stream, but he's still fucked since a lot of the people he's going to be playing with is going to be streaming.
---
So now you can sell your account for double the amount
---
&gt; TL;DR: Griefing should not be allowed
---
im gonna grief you in game ty friend
---
Hey, that's what the above link was from. Starcraft ladder and tournaments. I didn't bring it up.
---
Well if I ignored every post that has been posted/asked before I could literally just stay out of this reddit overall.
---
For twinking at 39 its the best staff for casters and 2nd best 2h for melee behind PoD.
---
The weird thing is that my girlfriend got me into playing retail again. We lvled up to 120 and joined a guild.
---
And I FELT WEIRD because she started talking to them in the guild chat. Like regular talking. How are you, what you up to, where do you live, what hobbies etc. 
---
I thought it was weird because WoW have become such an anti-social place, that talking just felt off. 
---
Can't wait for Classic and especially RP (PLZ RP-PVP) realms, gonna chat dem people up hard.
---
Streaming wasn't a thing back then? Like fast internet connections, better hardware, AOL-Discs, Winamp instead of Spotify, CRT-Monitors? What kind of argument is that?
---
And it is not bannable to kill streamers in PvP or wPvP. If you don't know a thing about Twitch and it's policies don't spread false facts.  
---
The stream sniping referred to PUBG where people joined streamers matches just to kill them instead of playing the game the normal way. It is some form of extreme griefing.
---
But you did
---
I *really* need to settle on the 3 names I'll be going for before August... Arg!
---
Tell me what potato specs you think will work and I'll test them.
---
He might go back to that once Classic is actually out.
---
At least one can hope, right now he is just screwing around.
---
I mean, I don't mind his persona streams from time to time, but I like the parts more where he talks about actual game mechanics and what he thinks should be implemented and such. He takes those a bit more serious.
---
Are you going to play Classic with your wife’s son?
---
I only play on Russian servers in Dota 2, because they're freaking hilarious and talk a lot. And the majority is actually extremely friendly and fun.
---
I think you mean tank pallidan thank you
---
Not how it works. There's more players which means more trash which increases your odds of grouping with trash. Most people who watch streamers to the point of wanting to be on their realm are normally trash.
---
I ended up with a dwarf hunter, but at level 30 i got bored, made a gnome mage and never looked back. The hunter is still level 30 ;)
---
&gt;Warrior was the first class to receive talents
---
Along with mages! It was Warriors and Mages, then Priests and Rogues, then Druids and Shaman, then Warlocks. Paladins and Hunters got theirs with release.
---
I think he just made himself a big target for stream snipers. I kind of feel like stream sniping him a few times now just to give it a go.
---
The boy not to worry about
---
Of course everyone overreatcs. There are plenty of streamers out there playing all kinds of games. Asmongold, Sodapoppin and all the other WoW Streamers aren't the most toxic ones, trust me. I watch Twitch on a daily basis.   
---
When classic launches all will be fine. And most of the fans don't follow streamers around. Most of them watch the stream while doing their own stuff.
---
Pretty much. He also plays a druid so in theory he can just run away if he's losing a 1v1.
---
Yeah i was shocked too hahahaha
---
Just gonna point out, you are still going to get camped on PvE servers. The PvP is only turned off in certain areas, but many are Contested Zones too, STV for example. There are just less Contested Zones than on PvP servers.
---
Whenever i read peoples opinions about what is and isn't acceptable to them on a PvP server in classic i just think "you didn't play on a PvP server in vanilla, did you?".
---
We had people who literally owned a spot on my server, that orc rogue that was sitting in Menethil 8+ hours a day killing lowbies, the guild of 60s that patrolled STV damn near constantly, etc.
---
I kept a list of people that had camped me, and your name didn't even make it onto that list before the 1-2 hour mark because SO MANY people would just camp you for an hour or so, only a rare breed took it further. Record was like 8 hours or something, various zone changes, still found me lol.
---
THAT is the experience i want, none of this "You killed me twice, you're a greifer, reported" nonsense that people seem to be expecting nowadays, that shit isn't nochanges, it's just a reason for your to play a PvE server and the reason they exist.
---
Correct. Custom emotes (/emote, /e, /me, /em) just give a generic message cross-faction, to avoid letting you use it for cross-faction communication.
---
I'll probably start a Rogue second, I'm a big PvPer and since no BGs at launch I may as well level my PvE char first
---
Which is why there is layering 🤔
---
Exactly this.  I hate this sub so much sometimes. Just a hate bandwagon at this point. Everyone always be like omg yes love Classic for the community and when you’re a dick youll be not invited etc etc. Now a streamer talks about it and all of the sudden its the worst thing in the world. And the funny thing is now people in the comments are praising esfand while not even a week ago this whole sub was hating on him. Shitty toxic subreddit
---
I hope they will make an RPPVP server after all, as this is the perfect way to test the waters. If it's gonna have very few characters compared to others, they will just shut it down before release and people will move to other PVP or RP before they invest any time into the game. 
---
Classic isn't gonna be like Vanilla, it won't have a constant stream of new players like it used to, it will have a tsunami of players on release, then it will slowly wind down. So if they open an RPPVP server after launch, it's guaranteed to be a ghost town, as most people won't bother leaving their old characters and communities behind to move there (i sure wouldn't)
---
Reminds me of the one time I watched ninja on fortnite, he ran towards a warehouse that a team was already at and engaged them but when things didn’t go his way claimed they was stream snipers.
---
You have to take the bad with the good
---
&gt; They actually turn off their streams and play so people don’t know their whereabouts.
---
Soda plays a lot off stream as well.
---
Yeah, just having the patience of really thinking through all options. Now you just google "top 10 fun classed" or "best class in game" and let the internet decide...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxl3hn/in_response_to_sodapoppins_entitled_beliefs_about/eq8qzrl/
---
This is the guy that wants a random LFG tool + gearscore’ish working addons for Classic, just fyi
---
&gt;and it was confirmed to be true
---
You don't get it... No one should ever get banned for streamsniping a streamer. There is nothing wrong with doing that. It is the streamers own fault for live broadcasting their gameplay in a PvP game. You can't let a minority like that affect the game itself and its rules.
---
Side-effects of streaming is being stream sniped.  
---
As streaming is in no way required to play the game, blacklisting is void.
---
It's built on the aspect of people "Stream Sniping" which is something happening not only outside of the game, but is completely up to the streamer to decide if they stream or not.
---
If they Ninja looted something or did something else that back then would have put you on a list like that then it would be ok, but this is a completely different issue.
---
The issue is that people do not seem to make that connection in their brain that this is really fucked up.
---
Specially since someone like Soda is a very big hypocrite but does not expect the same treatment he gets when he does the same thing.
---
I watch Soda and most Classic Streamers since Classic Beta went live so it's not like I hated them just out of nowhere, I also watched Soda a long time back.
---
But what he asks for here is  invitation to get spawn camped 24/7, nothing else.
---
This also means that other Streamers will be the target of that, specially the ones that agree with him here.
---
I know a lot of people complain about their Streamer benefits in the Beta, which I also thinks sucked but I came to agree with some of the things because it's just the Beta, BUT if even a single thing of that translates into the Release Game, then I can promise you they will have the worst times of their life playing this game.
---
There is a difference between a potato and relic. I think I might struggle trying to find the parts to build something that bad. Anyone who bought there computer within the last 10 years ought to be able to run the game in a playable state.
---
Well, that's part of the game really. There was a saying in Vanilla "When it's red, it's dead!". Some people lived by it.
---
Also the community aspect here implies that you get someone from your faction to take care of it. If people are getting ganked in Redridge by some 60 UD Rogues, someone from your faction 60s need to haul ass there and take care of it. The game is self policing in that sense.
---
In general, rolling on a PvE server is going to reduce the chance of stuff like this happening. But it won't guarantee it.
---
Sure thing, glad I could clear it up!
---
Well, just tell me what potato specs you think will work and I'll test them.
---
don't you mean bacon call?
---
Hey grim what's the name of the song when the bfa part starts? It sounds like a remake of the gates of stormwind
---
This isn't at all related to Classic WoW...
---
Stream Sniping should not be a banable offense in any game.
---
If you Stream your ingame location to people then you are asking for it on the internet.
---
Blame the person streaming not the one watching the stream.
---
Weird your posting redundant useless links guess I'll do the same

Yeah bro, the only games that streamers get viewers are the ones that arent released yet, what a dumbfuck take.
---
Just start handing out bans to people who stand on duel totems outside org lul.
---
Pubg carhorn all over again.
---
I played a pally tank at the end of vanilla, but didn't tank past strath (where paladins were godlike). I figured out the gearing in BC (MT'd through ZA) and after that, WOTLK was easy mode. BC was hard but once you hit uncrushable, warriors had a hard time keeping up. I've heard a couple of guilds progression tanked with paladins in vanilla, but taunt is necessary in a few fights and that obviously leaves pallies out. I think it's possible, but you need more gear and time because warriors do it better. Because it's classic and it's fun, my friends and I will be running a mostly off-spec casual guild. We'll probably raid at some point, and it'll probably be hilarious. I hope others have some fun with this too.
---
It comes with the territory, doesn´t it? In exchange they get money (for the entertainment they provide whilst playing) and they tend to get free things in-game. Easier access to raids and parties, despite spec/class. 
---
In exchange, those things are possible.
---
I would not be able to do it. And if I would be, I don't think I'd want to.
---
I'll even go one further, I think the presence of a streamer on your server can be disruptive to the experience, therefore I will pick a server that doesn't have streamers. And blacklisting servers that have streamers.
---
You cant spell agreeeeed without reeeee
---
People that are mad about this are overreacting. Soda is trying to find a player solution to a player problem instead of running crying to Blizzard. Blacklists existed back in the day as well and server reputation did matter for if other people wanted to play with you.
---
Yes, they will.
---
Premades with ranked players &gt; random premades &gt; random groups, that's what the food chain was like and is going to be again.
---
click the link in the comment bud. It's a starcraft forum.
---
Yeah i have no clue either, dutch word "vak" would translate to profession but it could have meant something else. The mining/bs is probably indeed because you couldn't wear what you make, but why a dwarf hunter "cant learn all professions" im not sure haha. The mind of a 12 year old can be mysterious ;)
---
In understand your frustration, but that's not a bannable offense.  The word griefing implies bannable offense and has weight to it, as clearly outlined in the ToS.
---
You have solutions, you simply chose not to fix your problem and be helpless prey in a game about War and killing each other.  That player wanted to die, and you didn't oblige him.
---
PvP problems require PvP solutions, that's Blizzard's stance.  You should quest in a group, have a guild, whatever.  Ultimately, someone bigger and stronger came along and you rolled over because you don't have friends, so make some.
---
Now about streamers, if Soda and his entire guild is getting mercilessly destroyed outside of Blackrock Mountain on raid night and they can't raid all day and he writes up a GM ticket "I'm being griefed and can't do my raid this week."  Blizzard is going to tell him tough titties, you chose a PvP server, no go find your own PvP solutions.
---
ITS SO DIFFERENT, BECAUSE ITS ME WINNING NOT THEM
---
Can someone make a list of what realms all the streamers end up rolling on, so I can choose a different one haha
---
I remember this, the honkening lol, dude didn't realize rule no. 1 on the internet, if you appear pissed off about something the trolls will double down on the thing that annoys you.
---
It's a shitty thing to do but it comes with the territory I guess. You have thousands watching, some are bound to come after you in game regardless of what game you're playing. 
---
You can't expect anyone to dictate anything for you, you are already treated with privilege, handed over gold and everything else while you play. You're not even a real player you're put on a pedestal by fan boys who give you what you want whenever you want.
---
I think they can handle the downside considering all the upsides.
---
OP isn’t saying anything about removing this. He’s highlighting it because he found it interesting.
---
I'll click it right now hold on the line
---
Imagine making a very good living playing video games and still throwing a tantrum when some random guy watches your stream and wants to kill you in game. Why do you give a shit. I watch streamers make hundreds of dollars in like 20 minutes doing nothing and they are ungrateful as fuck
---
Not hard at all. You can, for example, look at their username. Dedicated stream snipers usually have a reference to the streamer in their name.
---
You could also look at when they log on. If it's specifically when a streamer is playing, but that's probably easier for a GM to do.
---
Streamsniping is obstructing the gameplay for a specific target, which I feel like is wrong. That said, I don't think it's feasible to ban people from doing it. It's too hard to definitely prove, and as a streamer you're knowingly putting yourself out there. 
---
I don't judge Soda for wishing it didn't exist. This was taken way out of fucking proportion. I think he should just accept it (sadly) and do what he can, like hiring body guards.
---
Being a viable enhancement shaman. And by god, I'll make it happen.
---
Get fucked. He can go play on a rp or pve realm if hes that bothered.
---
Just avoid servers with big streamers. Honestly, why people look up to these entitled man babies amazes me.
---
disclaimer - a lot of streamers are cool awesome people. Sadly some aren't, and the some that aren't are usually the more popular ones.
---
They never ended. Was it harder to cause a large scale ruckus? Sure, ill agree to that but they never stopped. I use to be involved in those fights all the time on my servers you just had to put a bit more effort into actually starting a brawl. Honestly all you really need is a good 5man gank squad to start some shit and people will escalate from there because so many people love a good brawl.
---
I’m amused he thinks none of the streamers will make a name for themselves. Some of them 9-5 this shit, and that pays off in-game.
---
Always had a razer naga for mmo solve me a lot trouble with keybinding.
---
Well, in Vanilla/Classic, you also were some random scrub from your race who picked up a sword and started off on an adventure. Gathering bits and pieces of gear as you went. These days you have so many gear sets that you actually need to look like a hero that you're supposed to be by now ...
---
I completely agree with that. My problem was with the statement that it was done regularly and on perpose by the streamer
---
they already have that with emotes. you can say stuff like hello, well played etc and it's already being abused to BM. they even had to remove 'sorry' because people were only ever using it sarcastically.
---
Haha that would've been something i believed too.
---
Like everyone else here I bought tickets for the hype train early and have been on the ride since they announced classic. Currently, the content creators are the closest thing I get to be actually playing the game (or at least until right before beta dropped and tons of people started streaming it), and it is how I get a tiny bit of the fix I need.
---
When classic is released, I'm very likely to stop watching _every single_ related video that is released - for the simple fact that I won't "need" them anymore. I can just play the game, which is all I really care about.
---
Though, this does not take away anything from the content creators that have been devoting their time into creating something for us to enjoy. Their enthusiasm has fueled the hype flame and definitely helped spread the news to a ton of people, which makes classic a bigger deal collectively. Personally I'm very thankful for all of their work, and I will keep watching some of them in the future for their quality content. 
---
I do hope that they themselves are prepared for "losing" popularity or at least the spotlight, and that they don't see it as a personal failure or loss if they can't compete with classic itself for entertainment purposes.
---
GL with that, everyone knows that being famous its like accepting privacy violations but being a streamer, oh god, your streaming it to everyone ok realtime, deal with it or stop streaming... this guys doesnt have already enough privileges? the real whinners
---
The people who donate huge amounts of real life money or in game items think that they will get this huge recognition or that the streamer will remember them, but they don't realise the reality that they just say thanks for 3 seconds and move on.
---
Sure bud :)

Battle.net terms of use.
---
&gt;You may not share the Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one (1) minor child to use the Account when not in use by you. You are liable for all uses of the Account that has been enabled by you.
---
But wow terms of use get a bit fuzzy.
---
&gt;You agree that you will not
---
… (6) let any third person (except for a minor for whom you opened the Account) play on your Account including, but not limited to, using so-called "power leveling services", i.e. paying a third person for playing on your Account; or
---
(7) play on the Account of a third person including, but not limited to, providing so-called "power leveling services"
---
If you have your siblings grinding on **your** **character** on your off hours, then you risk a ban. But if you'd have them play their own character then it should be fine I theory.
---
It is also important to note that just because you follow the terms of use that you won't be banned and that you can prove innocence. Just because you are coming from the same IP does not mean anything.
---
I doubt it. He said himself he feels like he is growing out of his gaming phase, while he still enjoys games he isnt invested in them anymore.

Hence why you see him screwing around in Classic Beta right now.

Oldest I personally tested and can be considered a potato by today's standards. My 8 year old Lenovo Y570 (i5 2520m 3,5GHz, 8GB RAM and a Nvidia GT555M 1GB, 500GB HDD 7200RPM.
---
If not for the overheating because I didn't clean it in ages I could have even cranked up the graphics to high but I just tested on low and had constant 60fps (note it's a 720p screen and used vsync).
---
Yes, and you can combine it with mouse over too. It was a little tricky to get it working right though, like when targeting an enemy but mousing over myself I want it to cast the heal. You can easily find examples by googling "mouseover harm help macro wow"!
---
To be that priest with Atiesh
---
I never did much pvp, neither at lvl 60 nor during leveling. 
---
What I said above was mainly regarding the leveling part of the game.
---
For battlegrounds:
---
Back in the day you were grouped to allow somewhat equal gameplay. Meaning: when you’re in the twenties lvl wise there where only player lvls 20-29 with you in the BG.
---
Hence: In the BGs there defintetly was sorta matchmaking.
---
Dammit i forgot, you are right it has been implemented in TBC
---
QQ NOOB
---
No problem, and sorry if my comment earlier sounded a little aggressive. I was just talking in the discord before seeing this post about how I thought people were coming into the discord confused and had the wrong idea about us being reliant on procs, mostly due to our own wording and attempts at hyping things up. So that's a misconception I really want to clear up, because we'll get memers saying things like "Ironfoe won't be 10% proc rate in classic idiot lolret, this build will be shit like the rest." We've already had people saying the build won't work because Shockadin was tried before, or it won't work because Ashbringer won't have 100% scaling like on private servers, and it's like bruh -\_-  
---
Or worse, people who want to play ret seeing that ironfoe has 2.7% proc rate or ashbringer has 0% scaling on the beta or something and getting super discouraged like the spelladin dream is dead when it's not at all.  
---
I'm talking with DexterBravo about simplifying the guide, so that the people who are really interested in the spec can just come to the discord, and the people are are passively curious about it leave with a good understanding of it. :)
---
Random dude? 99% of players in the opposing faction won't give a shit about what Soda thinks about anything.
---
Nobody thinks a full wipe is different with a priest/shaman/paladin than with a druid, the issue is with partial wipes which suddenly turn into a full corpserun.
---
I agree with both of you, as of right now stream sniping doesn't seem to be something you can easily prove, which is extremely important if you're going to punish someone for it.   
---
I can't imagine how but I wish there was a way to prevent it. It gets complained about most in PvP situations and understandably so, but people can be still be sniped on PvE servers and messed with in other ways. Like I said in my previous post, I don't care who the streamer is, or how big they are. I also don't particularly care about the severity of the stream snipe. It's the equivalent of screen cheating on split screen. Fuck those people.
---
&gt; And.. she said "yes you can lock into your room and play as much as you want that new game"! 
---
And here I was thinking she's going to join you in Azeroth :P
---
I have 2 things to say to this:
---
1) in the example I gave, I was on a pve server.  That's why I thought it was a good example.
---
2) I totally get the whole pvp server mentality that you are talking about and the camping etc.  That doesnt bother me and never did.  But in all those cases, a character was targeted and not a player.  I remember spending hours moving just a little closer to town with each death and knowing that as soon as I rez, that guy will be on me.  But, generally, I felt that it was all in keeping with the game and he was not trying to ruin my day, just my characters day.  Stream sniping and griefing target the player and not his character.
---
Suggestion:   
---
It may be interesting to have a 3 tiered system in place. So instead of "take this" and "dont take that" you would have "you really want this now", "thats helpful, but not required" and "lul".
---
you are 100% right. I also noticed since i started following him that his ego has gotten a lot bigger...
---
I miss my helm of transcendence looking like a turban.
---
&gt;Rogues have Ravenholdt related quests.
---
Quite sure those sucked and didn't provide anything useful either ...

Found 2 pictures from one of the shows after Only Inhuman was released, this is how close we were to them (was litterally just a small fence between us and the stage)

They were amazing, and very down to earth. And I had such a teenage crush on Karin lol
---
Maybe I misunderstood Soda, but did not he say he would like to see a server known for having streamers where streamsniping is taboo and bannable?  
---
I do not think he meant to say any streamer should be able to blacklist people in any server for streamsniping.
---
Every other server would be free game.  
---
And, hey, for me and many others knowing my server does not have streamers is a huge plus. If they all concentrate in one server they will be easy to avoid.  
---
I like their content but I do not want them in my vanilla experience.
---
I’ve got 3 more months of BFA subbed. I purchased the 6 month sub to save money but I’ve only logged in 2 times in the past 3 months. 
---
Come classic, that’ll change D R A S T I C A L L Y
---
Then don't be a normal player, get stream sniped and dick suckings from fanboys. Can't have both.
---
hello me streamer here i take your advice and won't play on your server because immersion kthxbye
---
In my experience, it’s weird to talk in guild chat but pretty normal for a group of people to hang out in discord while playing, even if not grouped. Typing is more intrusive than speaking.
---
Depar
---
You are able to live your dream by making a shit ton of money for "gaming" and this is what it has come to.
---
They want people banned who work on a 9-5 job to pay their bills and have a little fun while gaming and these rich streamers only problems is to blacklist them? LOL
---
I wouldn't mind playing games as a full time job and getting rich off of that, 10/10 wouldn't complain.
---
&gt;The narcacissm streaming can breed is astounding.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it there later will be discovered a link between streaming and narcassistic behaviors from science doctors.
---
I can't think of many big time streamers at least that started out humble in person but now has horrible entitlement characteristics.
---
The best type of server there is; RPPvP
---
The problem is that you’ve just split the people who want to play old vanilla about 3 ways. Sure, you could still see healthy server populations, but for now I’m satisfied with 1 version - though I do hope that 1 version just becomes a more polished version of their original vision. I’m no talking about big changes or implementing retail talents, just a tweak here and there. A more complete game that relied on constant updates.
---
Yes, I would advice to a PC too. Laptops are nice - but really they aren't for Gaming :D
---
And who knows - maybe you get into gaming again with Classic and want to Play other things too :P 
---
Otherwise... A Laptop can probably do and is cheaper
---
*Stealth
---
Huh? The giant stalker set is in the raid so it can't be preraid-bis. Also release isn't gonna have pvp equipment and as far as I know you want at least the 4set bonus if you can't afford the devilsaur set.
---
Cool video, but Sonii can get fucked. Dude threatens people with assault when they do something he doesn't like.
---
They wrote forums how to get around this rogue.....
---
I mean streaming come with its perks and with having to deal with people knowing where you are at all times. 
---
That said all these people saying QQ and play on a PvE server won’t be saying it when it’s them getting camped to the point they have to log out.
---
No one talks about it anymore, we all just watch the latest MadSeason video to get our fixes
---
So I guess I'm the only person on planet earth who thinks cheating should be a punishable offense then.
---
Why don't you do it then if its so easy
---
Yeah, even if you pull twice the amount of mons, you can probably handle it by using some cooldowns
---
He’s the biggest wow streamer by absolute miles lol
---
They aren't :(
---
“New game”
---
Just admit you want diffrent content from streamers, no need to alter the game for it.
---
&gt;The spec requirements for WoW Classic are the same as Retail with the exception of required video RAM (smaller textures) and hard disk space.
---
But running Classic on a 2006 era PC doesn't really prove this. Have you done more testing that you haven't shared? Surely the vastly reduced polygon count and lower texture resolution should reduce the system requirements more than just the required VRAM.
---
I theorise as a baseline, Classic requires more resources, but once you have a somewhat competent PC (2 modern cores@3GHz, 4GBs of ram, 1GB vram, 0.5TFLOP GPU), the Classic and Vanilla should run fairly similarly.
---
Active Sub… K E K

Patches during vanilla led to almost all pets being about the same. I like it better when pet ability where unique and interesting, but it what it is.  I think it was the AV frost wolves that destroyed that system.  I tamed one and that thing ran at about 300% speed.  I used to gank people just by sicking my pet on them as they tried to ride away on their mounts.  It was massively OPed.

If BLIZZARD wants to host an event that they want to have viewed. Then they can make ground rules so said event can't be ruined. A streamer hosted event is just a retarded get together that their dumb viewers choose to watch. A streamer is just another player that apparently thousands of retards are interested in seeing play.
---
Blizzard didn't ban a guild for wrecking a funeral for a dead person in game on a pvp server, why should they punish some guy who wants to crash a duel tournament. Backasswards logic.
---
Dc,
---
do this. You will love it. And shock/cons are great for leveling.

Alliance scum, always bringing their aggression to the noble races of the Horde.

...Ignore the undead rogue cannibalizing a gnome in the background, he had it coming.

for me the bfa orc loos more ridiculous. the shoulders just look wrong, instead of touching the orcs shoulders they seem to hoover over them

Me, maining a rogue from day 1.

Im a returning player, pvp'ed a lot in vanilla, R11, i wouldnt dream of rolling on a pvp server this time, don't need all the frustration that comes with world ganks, just wanna return and have fun while levelling.
---
Holy neckbeard..
---
I have a current bfa sub and have 2 months left until it expires. In the past 4 months I’ve probably logged on in 6 separate occasions.
---
Naw, Disney would never okay anything as cool as swg. Star wars MMOs from now are going to be pure mainstream mediocrity aimed squarely at people who don't actually like video games.
---
I will just play with my GF, pala/priest + warlock, and she promised me allready 40h per week pair gametime, but i know her it wont end with 40h\^\^
---
Hey, to be fair, if you're clearing the content in a reasonable time, you're not holding others back. I get the appeal of speedrunning raids, but for a lot of groups that's simply not the goal
---
IDK why but I feel like all these streamer guilds just end up dying every time so I wouldn't be surprised if this "blacklist" doesn't last very long.
---
Soda made a guild in Legion and they didn't even clear Emerald Nightmare.
---
Some people do like this sub.
---
Other don't like this sub.
---
No one cares eigther.
---
So you theorize that a PC running hardware better than the minimum required specs for Retail should be able to run Classic...
---
Exactly.
---
Finally someone who thought about this for more than 10 seconds. Well written.
---
I like your attitude.
---
Easy, i’ll just let him create the character. Everyone can get pissy about the rules but they aren’t going to ban me over my little brother grinding / farming / PVPing.
---
"Reason dies" brilliant name
---
Asmongold does other content in WoW that people like.  He does mount comps, transmog comps, gets people together to go kill world bosses and more.  I actually enjoy his content.  If he or others like Soda are really that concerned by snipers, they can always have a second account that NOBODY knows about where they can be off line and play unmolested.  The problem with Soda is that he doesn't actually do anything else but play and he wants to play on a PvP server and is trying to head off stream snipers.  Yah, good luck with that.  If you can't generate interesting content for your viewers like Asmon does then play on a PvE server or stop complaining.
---
Going to feel so bad for casuals. :D But then again, the game is not for casuals. :D
---
the general consensus is that 10-11 days /played (ingame time) is the average for a gamer that has held a mouse in its hand before. 8-9 you're in the more efficient ballpark. 6-7 days youre pretty damn fast and anything less than 6 days is pretty much a speedrun. u will hear about 3 days and 14 hours and such (a friend of mine on pserver) but thats with bloated tbc exp values on quests and serious preparation.
---
Reread it. "**Ranged** and melee attack power increased by 300 for 12 seconds"
---
GTFO, who the hell compares WOW with OSRS.
---
Whats wrong with you?
---
https://youtu.be/LJ74mSq_5Dc
---
Is this a joke? It's his job to deal with the circumstances, not have a whiny complaint that he might get stream sniped. Don't stream at all if you can't handle it? If you didn't like your job at all would you do it everyday for the rest of your life or move on to find one you liked..?
---
He would also have to convince everyone in his guild to not stream as well.
---
Itll probably take a little longer than usual for you since itll feel mostly new. I play osrs on the side and have done since it released and I still dont have a 99. 
---
The thing is, with runescape you pretty much have the freedom to do whatever the hell you want and because each skill individually takes so long to Max, like myself, a lot of people never make it. 
---
As I understand it, depending on your experience playing the game and knowledge base, you can hit 99 in some skills in less than 6 hours (world record) 
---
In classic, as you know all of your xp is going toward one level, if you grind it out and know what you're doing, it can take as little as 4 days. That was the standard for a 'good' player back in the day. 
---
Pretty sure it took me a solid 3 months the first time I did it. But then again, I was 12 years old lol.
---
LOL, this is the coldest water I think anyone could have thrown in that little bitch soda's face. well fucking done
---
It isn't really tho.
---
Having another blessing in the raid adds much more than one single dps ever could for example.
---
Rogues and warriors literally don't bring anything useful to the raid but damage.
---
Hybrid dps however can easily decide whether the raid wipes or not by a single lay on hands, special buffs or their ability to help healing when its necessary.
---
/s ?
---
Hard to listen to that. Love the fact he says he wants to be a normal player... Yeah, just don't stream then and get a real job... experience some reality
---
I have run Beta on an 8 year old laptop with no graphics card and it worked okay, albeit at lower quality but reasonably smooth. 
---
It’s pretty robust for older computers.
---
Post kinda unfairly misleading: in the video soda specifically specified that it obviously won't be done on every server but there will be one server publicly known as a streamers server in which if you act like a complete annoying asshole you will be blacklisted on this specific server.
---
Can confirm
---
Source: His teacher
---
I'd prefer Discord ofc. We always had a teamspeak server up to talk with everyone within the guild but guild chat was full of conversations back in the days :)
---
1-60 world record is  4 days 20 hours. So 116 hours. Which was straight questing. 
---
Just assume it’s going to take you over a month if you don’t no life it.
---
They’re both mmorpgs that have been around for 15+ years, both getting a classic version, both take lots of time commitment...what’s wrong with you?
---
Fraps, this is legit.
---
did you have multiple wow accounts? Also were you subbed on multiple accounts?
---
Maybe 180h+ for someone unfamiliar with questing/WoW.
---
This is not what Soda is talking about tho. He is talking about a list made within the players, not an official thing from blizzard. People are taking this way out of proportion loool.
---
Having a few hundred dps more or not will not make a noticeable difference in raids, timewise.
---
Logistics, organization, pulls, trash, regeneration and wipes make like 80% of the time. The bossfights themselves are neglectable.
---
Hunter pets are a bit lame by 1.12 unfortunately. I get why they made changes but I was considering Hunter and the changes to pets put me off.
---
He never asked blizzards help, at any point. He simply talked about a personal list within the players.

There's so much factors and streamers almost never communicate so it's always tricky to say but very roughly, the streamers who can gather more than 5000 viewers daily will get into the 6 figures yearly revenue.
---
When you add youtube revenue, sponsorship, donation and merchandising in the balance and get even more viewers, some can reach a lot more but of course only a very few will reach that point.
---
Now the WoW classic market? again it's very hard to tell:  streamers get a lot of view because people want to play the game but they can't so it leads them there. What will happen next? maybe the game will only be a mild success and wow classic viewers will drop and only a select few will manage to get 'standard salary' or the game will be a huge success and there will be a dozen of streamers making a lot of cash with a big name becoming filthy rich
---
No, I theorised that Classic and Vanilla should run similarly to each other.
---
You mean free advertisement? You do realize this is good for the game?
---
Who?
---
In the end, I'm an engineer. If I lose my job, I'll search for a new one. With my ever increasing experience, and skills, I'll find a new one and might even increase my pay.
---
In the end they are people who have no valid real life skills. Especially those who have been' working ' as a streamer for decades. Once they lose their job they are fucked. What are you going to write on your cv?  'Skills in blacklisting people for ganking me on a wow pvp server'?
---
Sure, their job is awesome... For now. But never forget that their job is very very volatile,while the average Joe's is not.
---
They make plenty from sponsorships and ad revenue. Revenue that's only generated through viewers. If there's no viewers, there's no revenue. 
---
Paying a streamer is like tipping. And not like tipping is in the USA where it's pretty much customary to subsidise their shitty income. It's tipping if you enjoy their stuff to the point where you feel compelled to give them stuff.
---
Did u play a Super Saiyan 3?
---
You can frame it as "I want to be unique", you can also frame it as "this is what I have fun doing".
---
If your guild doesn't mind then who the fuck cares? Not everyone's goal is clearing raids as fast as possible. If it is, yeah, don't bring ret paladins, but don't shit on other people for playing a video game in the manner they enjoy. If they're in your raid and you don't like it, there's lots of guilds who only take meta specs to raid
---
World record is 4 days 20 hours.  Those pservers really had the numbers screwed up.
---
Its not cheating, they are voluntary showing were they are. Being a streamer does not make a person special nd they do not deserve special treatment. If they dont want people to know were they are, all they need to do is not show it.
---
Add a delay, record and then uppload or get a real job and play offline. Streamsniping ia not cheating and never have been.
---
It's just beneficial for them. If they get like 50k more subs because of streamers that's great but streamers won't bring any significant number of subs to classic.
---
It's free hype and commercial.
---
Streamers dont need to stream? It's their job, of course they do.
---
&gt;1)
---
It doesn't sadly.
---
It wouldn't just be Soda, it'd be over 20 of the biggest wow streamers, their guilds and all their followers that play on that same server.
---
It doesn’t cost 10g to make a guild
---
Complain to who exactly? He is talking about a player made list, made BY players.
---
It's running the Legion engine. So the recommended specs for Legion are enough.
---
I don't know the guy, the reason he streams could be anything. That doesn't change the fact that broadcasting your location on a pvp server will lead to problems. If someone is ganking him he can easily get people to help him deal with the issue.
---
Also, how do you prove stream sniping? I was ganked for a couple days by some orc in wetlands for days. Some people are just really committed to ganking lol. Stream or not.
---
Also by marking yourself as a server celebrity your going to be targeted more. People didn't avoid ganking HWLs in vanilla, they took it up as a challenge and got the jump on them.
---
*not letting their actions dictate my fun*
---
Camping in a game and stream sniping aren't at all the same. ????????????????
---
We go on reddit and complain while putting as much insults in a senctence as we can.  
---
Also, streamers
---
He is not asking people to get banned or blizzard to get involved, did you guys even watch the video? Or you just comment on anything that is negative towards streamers lol?
---
So basically all the abilities that ended up being removed in expansions
---
I'll translate the specs to laptop for you.
---
they specify an i7-4770 as recommended (aka max settings). A modern desktop i3 absolutely smashes this, but even a modern laptop i7 is still inferior to it (and way more expensive). 
---
GPU they recommend "GeForce GTX 960 2GB". 
---
This compares to a "modern" equivalent of between a 1050M or a 1060M.
---
In short: If you want a laptop, look for something with a 'modern i5 (aka model number starting with an 8 or a 6 -&gt; i5-8***/i5-9***). and GPU that says GTX-1060M(or higher), I wouldn't go under 8GB of ram and preferably even 12+.
---
Those are your base 'specs'. Anything over that depends on your budget.
---
you seem to know a lot, pls be my manager !
---
Or just ignore them, you know.
---
WArsong Gulch is also in the beta and will be added in phase 3
---
It looks like most US streamers will be rolling on same servers.
---
And if they do, much of these events will probably be between the streamers only so everyone gets "them viewer gains"
---
Wow now I know what people were talking about when they say this subreddit is toxic af.
---
Sodapoppin never talked about report or getting anyone banned 99% of the people on this thread didnt ACTUALLY watch the video LOOOL.
---
plot twist: he is a streamer
---
Orc hunters are cool! ohh man you've got loads on! good luck with the masters! Might see you in orgrimmar somewhere!
---
Nah mate. Different strokes for different folks.
---
Most of the hardcore guilds will probably have max level alts to split raid by 4 months so they can funnel more gear to their mains.
---
Good lord I hate that weapon, my one and only **EVER** world drop and it was that trash. It wasn't even worth putting on the AH and the memory still haunts me to this day.....
---
It is possibly (not that I have logged in in a very very long time) still sitting in my Shamans bank as a token of disappointment, alongside the stack of Frostwolf insignia teleport stone things I refused to ever use and hoarded.
---
Why do people care so much..?
---
240 hours
---
and thus &lt;Streamer hit jobs 4 hire&gt; was created lol
---
Off meta picks don't mean you're a bad player. Skill is independent of class choice
---
Please respond specifically to the people who say this in their threads. Those people will never come to your thread and engage you.
---
Druid vs Paladin?
---
As far as I can tell, druid is the better tank both while leveling and at 60, while paladin is the better healer? I am happy to fill either role, my main concern is time it will take to find a group. Will 5 man groups be happy to roll with either class as a tank/healer?
---
It seems druids have a better time in both leveling and in PvP. I would take that into consideration too.
---
Which class would have the most optimal spec that could see me alternate between PvP and 5 man pve reletive to respec costs? I would be happy to spend time farming for respec gold if it's not too outrageous of a time investment.
---
Most of the people watch streamers on Wow Classic probably because they (we) are not to play ourselves. The streamers will have much lower viewers numbers when everybody will finally be able to play.
---
I plan to roll RP-PvP server, even if streamer chooses to play there too well... whatever.
---
BTW. Blizzard: we need RP-PvP severs from start!!!
---
Tbh stream snipers are literal human waste
---
I guarantee letting five dudes who are on off meta picks, isn't going to do that to your progression. It's not like everyone is suddenly going to play enhancement shaman
---
Basically it's like a baby that never gets told when their actions is wrong but instead of a baby its a big time streamer and the parents condoning their actions is their subs/mods.
---
The issue then is that they'll get outgeared over time. Most people that are playing the game seriously probably wont waste their time being a fan/anti fan of some streamer anyways.
---
10s to register a guild
---
And you were unable to find the courage to reply directly to the threads that bothered you.
---
I though you were gonna say she was joining you. Either way though grats. As someone who knows what it’s like to have gf’s not understand it and then one who does. Lock that shit down.
---
Maybe the players who make the blacklist will evaluate it? Did you even watch the video? 90% here seems to think he wants blizzard to interfere, he is talking about a list made between players on that server.
---
Pretty sure you could do the same thing in vanilla except the macro needed was way more complex and typically needed a macro addon to work. Also, it was just "laggier" whereas the new client+streamlined macro coding is so much snappier. That's why you can see a charging tauren/cat etc.
---
in your logic, getting ganked means more subs. more subs equals $$, problem?
---
He didnt ask for blizzard to interfere tho, so nobody ACTUALLY watched the video? :D :D
---
&gt;This will happen on every server in Classic and is what happened in Vanilla, if you were known as a douche, many people would avoid playing with you.
---
This really isn't true. I never saw a single person in vanilla that had been made into a social outcast for being a ganker or griefer. No guild ever cared what another guild thought about some player.
---
Nah, it's not about age, even back in the day we had these kinds of people. It's just more visible due to accessibility. Much more visible.
---
That's why I wrote bis, not pre-raid bis.
---
I'd say there's a lingering bitterness of some people when they see that some guys not only can play the game and get lots of money while doing it.
---
Also it feels like many people simply weren't aware of streaming and how popular it was and just don't get it.
---
Thats good, because soda never asked for blizzard to take a stance, watch the video next time buddy.
---
I was already 100% dead set on warrior, but then i started watching asmon, and i dunno anymore. Even he started doubting if he chose the right class. It just seems a little basic compared to other classes, and I'm afraid i will get bored with it pretty quick and end re-rolling before i hit 60. Which is precisely what I'm trying to avoid.
---
Server names aren't revealed yet but yo man I'm EU and i'll be on that shit asap to join forces with you if you wanna join the blacklist.
---
No, I'm the one who found the exploit first.
---
lol
---
 This really going to be an all out war... I honestly never saw this coming and seeing Soda say what he did yesterday, it makes me think he won't stick with Classic and will move on to another game rather quick if he even plays Classic at all now.
---
*for the most part from what I have saw from the streamers playing the beta, they are nice and pretty chill and just having fun*
---
It doesn't matter - leveling is the same game as raiding - it is just transition from "game given quests" to "self made up quests" (farm for raid, get flasks, killing bosses).
---
You posted specs that would run any version of WoW...
---
I'm sorry but isn't uniting against one person abusing power of a group and forcing them to do something? Which is the very thing he's complaining about? 
---
You're not supposed to bully players at all really. But i think teaming up as an entire guild to destroy streamers is just becoming the bad guy you sought out to destro. Whether it becomes the streamer or you is the next question. 
---
"You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villan. "
---
Rhok'delar is up there, yep. Here's a list of Bows in Classic: https://classic.wowhead.com/bows#items:0-2+17
---
I enjoy the amount of energy people are showing for this game. So many morality threads. We can't play it with our keyboards and a mouse yet so we're playing it with a keyboard and our minds. 
---
But in this case it's acceptable to grief anybody. It should neither be encouraged nor discouraged in online conversations. Let players in the world figure it out.
---
He lost because he got feared into fleeing out of the duel after using all his CD's. including 1 hours cooldowns. Get your facts straight why dont you.
---
Mainly just gear my rogue and streamsnipe soda for being the little bitch he is.
---
&gt; You get the perks of being a streamer, **and one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you**.
---
Wait so do you actually do this? Do you think this is actually okay?
---
In what world isn't this shit cheating? Sure you won't get banned and it isn't against the game's rules but be fucking real right now, this is cheating, straight up. 
---
This is akin to looking at someone else's screen to know their location, it breaks the spirit of gaming, hell, it breaks the spirit of competition.
---
I cannot fucking believe that this is actually part of you whole fucking argument, you're not even saying that he might blacklist people that don't deserve it, you're saying that you're entitled to stream snipe him.
---
This shit is insane, never would've thought that part of the wow classic experience was to feel entitled to cheat in order to ruin other people's experiences. 
---
Not to mention that you seem to believe that you have to get something out of his "perks" like holy shit, this is the most retarded post I've ever read in a while.
---
That's why we need RP-PvP servers...
---
&gt;Wtf do you mean there’s rules saying I can’t?!
---
No you fucking idiot. There literally AREN'T any rules against that. That is the whole fucking point of this thread. It is 100%, perfectly, completely allowed to gank and corpsefarm someone as much as you want, even streamsnipe them - and Blizzard will take no action against you. That is part of the game. But Soda is a manbaby and is trying to "blacklist" players who are not breaking any rules, also he is the kind of person to claim anyone that kills him is a stream sniper anyway, which will lead to blacklisting normal gankers.
---
Why don't you go suck Sodas micropeen some more.
---
For Christ sake I live this
---
I still don't understand where the attention regarding streamers comes from. These guys are not more than every other player, except they said: Hey lets place a camera and call myself "streamer". These guys are mortal beeing like everybody else, so why do people count their opinion way above other opinions, why adapt to their playstyle, why even some people adapt their behavior in terms of ingame-language you use. Just be yourself. I hope blizz will not listen mainly on them but on the majority of players (and also not only to the loud minority in the boards etc.).
---
Meta
---
This is really a big wake up call for me. In a totally unrelated note though, but yeah, if you put yourself out there, expect to attract more attention. Not just allies, but enemies too. That's just the way of life.
---
Please fuckin stop, either you have dementia or you never watchted the dueling tournament.
---
I haunted the AH for months back in the day for it. Finally got it for less than 1g.
---
True warriors don't wear pants as chaffing is a real problem when intercepting and charging.
---
And then the entire individualized gaming economy collapses because by your logic, zero people at any level of any game should be streaming for any length of time. Goodbye Twitch. Goodbye YouTube streams. Goodbye monetization. Goodbye donations. Goodbye being able to take a game seriously enough to make a living off of it.  
---
What you have revealed yourself to be with your response is a succubus, a bottom feeder, one who is completely unwilling to put any real effort into a game (and likely anything in life). Not only are you also unwilling to reward those who are truly the best at their craft, **you believe those who are great enough to produce content should be placed at an active disadvantage without punishment to the offender.** Certainly iGen, definitely a little **bitch** IRL, the next level of entitled. You make me sick.
---
I don't think you understand what "witch hunting" means, because actually Soda's blacklist idea is witch hunting, but streamsniping and ganking him is not.
---
Look up the definition.
---
Whichever alliance players actively goes after Soda I will let you kill me clean on site for life.
---
TLDR - PVP server contains PVP
---
Not only most will get outskilled, they will be camped and sniped nearly non stop on PvP servers. As someone who played on Tich since BC, it was always fun watching top 5 steamers cry and hide in the cities, while there is a raid or two waiting for them. Even their fan base was never able to protect them, until people got bored of stream sniping.
---
So if anything - you will see streamers play on pve servers or run bgs/ raids with their guilds and fans.
---
Would've liked it more if they just walked past each other without a word.
---
Such an original post. Glad nobody has posted this on here already.
---
I hated retail streamers for how cocky they were and how zealous their fans could be with all the soap box drama, especially Sodapoppin. I hope we didn't start this whole journey in 2015 for vanilla to have them corrupt the streaming side of vanilla... Need more like Esfand imo, doesn't have an overwhelming ego and can talk like an adult.
---
And thats literally what he meant. 99% of the responses here act like Soda was asking blizzard to ban people.
---
a few weeks ago said he's gonna streamsnipe asmongold (another streamer) when classic releases, so i guess he wants to be blacklisted too?
---
 just go to website that already does it.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
How is it clear at all? You can extremely easily camp a specific player for hours and hours without them streaming their location to you.
---
arf, should added that at the top
---
No, you can tell when someone is stream sniping, if they know exactly where you sit in stealth eating, thats not random PVP, thats stream sniping.
---
Oh man if a hunter takes a fang from a rogue :(
---
Not true. There were servers that were "Locked". If you did not have a character on it before that happened, you could not create a character there. Believe me, 2 of my friends played on a Locked server and the rest of the boys had to go a different server.
---
&gt;t's water under the fridge

It's
---
I love [Muphry's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law). In fact, I almost invoked it myself by not capitalizing the 'i' in "It" above.
---
i don't think transmogs would help him much at lvl 20 either way
---
Its perfectly clear, you dont know what you talking about. Stream snipers know exactly your location at all times EVEN when stealthed.
---
This is dumb. Roll PvE.
---
Top ugly...
---
Bottom... epic!
---
There is a solution for that, its called playing on a PVE server. Asmongold is pretty 5Head since he is going PVE on launch.
---
Where did he ask to blindly trust?
---
How do you make it snowing in your desktop?
---
Broken tooth or slavering worg
---
The tauren should be banned, you are on a beta millions of people want to join and the only thing you can come up with is making a level 1 to grief? Should be removed from the beta for sure, waste of a beta spot.
---
I guess OldLogoPSN id's following around streamers himself? 
---
But apart from the group around the steamer,  you most likely will get imbalance between alliance and horde characters resulting in long bg queues if you are on the steamers side. Also the server might get overpopulated such that you have to queue before you can play. Both of these are annoying when you only got a little spare time to play.
---
You have guts to come to this board an announce you have not one but two beta keys.
---
I used to play Vanilla WoW on a Intel PIII 600mhz based pc with 512MB ram with a Radeon All In Wonder 7200 or 7500? it was a gaming gpu at the time with TV-tuner/capture card all in one.
---
I used a Soundblaster soundcard if I recall and WoW and EverQuest 2 both ran on that old PC!
---
It's a job like MLMs and sucking cock are a job.
---
yeah, he pretty much fucked not just himself, but every other big wow streamer over now just because of the comment he made lol
---
I'd love to (I've been only alliance), but I honestly can't stand Orgrimmar and all the early zones (except undead I guess). I've tried many times, but just couldn't get into it.
---
Yes, and with WoW Classic, you'll barely be able to login.
---
Because PvP happened on a PvP server! (GASP) 😲
---
Rogue is gonna have a bad time against a Druid.
---
I don't know about you guys but I do trade work and ain't nobody censoring themselves there (as much as I wish they did sometimes)
---
First, that works on a pvp server, which in this case it was not.  Secondly, I never said he should be banned (I didnt report him), I said it should not be encouraged. Thirdly, griefing, as defined by blizzard's code of conduct, is anything that detracts from a players enjoyment and is nor acceptable.  They have also said, that certain things do not count if you sign up for a pvp server.  I get that, but even on pvp servers, targeting a specific player is very much prohibited and considered harassment.
---
Or a warlock in the target zone. Think about playing a warlock standing at SM porting allience groups all day for money \^\^
---
Streamers give me a whole new avenue of enjoyment. I can now see my victims reaction to my ganking and corpse camping.
---
I mean this makes sense as wow classic official is running on modern servers. Tho I'm glad you cleared this up :)
---
If he didn't have that edit this post will be taken down because it's against the rules of the subreddit. This is 100% a witch hunt and I'm fucking happy we finally get to rise up against these entitled bitch streamers.
---
BUT THIS IS A STREAMER, SO OBVIOUSLY ITS THE END CLASSIC WOW AS WE KNOW IT
---
How dare they PvP on a PvP server!!! Call the GMs
---
He was stream sniping, some guy was streaming with a title "Streamsniping Asmongold" and was farming Assmongoloid non-stop, and Twitch banned his account.
---
Who cares though, Twitch isn't the game. Streamsniping is not against the games TOS and Blizzard won't do anything about it.
---
Or its because most people have established groups of friends they play with. 
---
Of course nobody is gonna talk to some random idiot who spouts shit all day
---
sounds awesome
---
PvE server, bro.
---
I want to just step in and mention there are some level 40 gloves or bracers of the bear that drop from uldaman that actually sit in the pre-raid bis slot I can't remember the full name but they give +defense
---
Stream sniping is not camping, when someone knows exactly where you are, EVEN in stealth, thats not simple camping.
---
Have you not seen how much an immature manbaby Soda is? He will write up the name of anyone that kills him on the blacklist lmao
---
"pet is important"
---
Welcome to vanilla.
---
Oh please, every server will be a streamer server.
---
LOL 😂
---
&gt; you should be able to kill Doctor Weavil through the wall completely avoiding his AoE damage stun by LoSing it well
---
It's a bit of a gray area. I mean, what you described can very well be considered an exploit - one of those Blizzard were going to fix.
---
How is this even a fucking discussion? It's fucking cheating, I knew it was cheating when I was a kid and some fucker I was playing with tried to look at my screen to know my location.
---
It 
---
Is
---
Cheating.
---
The only reason Blizzard won't ban your ass is because they don't have the manpower to do so, if they had, stream snipers would all be banned, in a perfect world, stream snipers would always be banned. 
---
Anybody that stream snipes knows they're cheating, so I don't understand why the fuck this thread is full of people who support it.
---
This is not to you in particular btw, it just pisses me off that the people against the blacklist are so disingenous.
---
Just say "hey man, fuck you, I want to cheat without consequences" because that's what y'all really mean.
---
Lmao imagine being this retarded
---
Youre not understanding. The people making the blacklist and reporting "streamsnipers" to twitch are the ones who decide whats stream sniping and what isnt. And a bunch of times already theyve accused innocent ppl for sniping
---
Okay but you would have to be incredibly stupid to believe that.
---
&gt;But camping someone specifically for hours on end BECAUSE they are a streamer is fucking lame.
---
This happens to all non-streamers in vanilla WoW. Same player can camp you for hours. Why should a streamer be able to avoid that? You are fucking lame.
---
It's also much more mainstream and popular, before we just had weird people who behaved a little immature or acted like a retard because they enjoyed it for whatever reason, now it's what these people do to fit in and if you don't do it you're the weird one.
---
Not saying i'm right, but i'll bet you the server with the biggest number of mainstream streamers on will just be people communicating in twitch emotes and you wondering what the hell happened to the community.
---
That’s literally what paparazzi is. And it’s legal.
---
What do you know, people have different opinions and like different sources of entertainment. Yes streamers make people laugh, was that rocket science?
---
PvE servers flagging for pvp is voluntary even in contested zones. So you can't even depend on the opposing faction to kill the people from your own factions griefing you.
---
\&gt;doesn't want 1.13 because it might add flying and dungeon finder
---
\&gt;wants tbc and wotlk servers
---
 i don't see anything wrong with that logic.
---
They stream and get paid yet dare to complain about most of the things. Most of the streamers have huge benefits such as receiving gold from random people and so on. To stream is their free choice, since nobody is forcing them to stream. It's a public platform and of course, they have to live with the consequences and banning people who kill streamers is just idiotic.
---
Maybe in proper hardcore/semi-hardcore guilds holypalas do spec to improved BoM..? Then retri brings nothing a holy wouldn't bring.
---
[Super debunked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvmawj/are_spelladins_going_to_be_a_legit_dps_or_a_meme/eps6wmw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) :')  
---
Btw aren't you an Esfan? You know he's in our discord and interested in the spec, right?
---
I did it in 22 days back when WoW first launched playing a hunter and having no clue wtf I was doing but learning fast and put in a helluva lot hours each day... it was not healthy and there is no way I could it now being older and the job I have.
---
I honestly put 5-15hrs in each day when leveling and it was so much fun and so much to do...
---
That's literally not their argument tho.
---
You realize you literally only need to find their location ONCE by looking at their stream, after that you know where they died and you can corpsecamp them for hours? It's exactly how it works for any non-streamer after the first encounter.
---
Its pretty fuckin easy to distinguish. A stream sniper will know you every single step, hell they know exactly your location EVEN if you are stealthed.
---
The problem isn't really camping or crashing streamers content. It's that the people doing it are doing it for attention, clout, exposure, whatever. Or even worse, out of spite and envy. Either way, pathetic people. Like soda said, camp people cause you're an asshole, not a emotionally unstable twitch viewer.
---
&gt; I mean look at tim the tatt man that was harrassed by a single toxic stream sniping symmetra for literal months before blizzard said "okay okay, we get it, banned"
---
Good 'ol Overwatch onetricks. Maan, fuck those people ...
---
This is the true meaning of jolly co-operation! Thank you sir!
---
Getting donations is not a job, silly fanboy of a manbaby.
---
How large of a delay can you have on twitch?
---
By blacklisted he means by the community of their server.
---
He does not want Blizzard to ban these streamsnipers.
---
He wants them blacklisted, just like a ninja looter would be blacklisted and not banned.
---
How? They have a group of 2k children screaming and spamming around them.
---
Imagine being this upset, must be an incel 🤷‍♂️
---
Blizzard isn't getting involved, it's player driven decisions. Don't play an mmo if you don't want a world of people with differing levels of power...
---
Thats bait.
---
The issue is 2 fold.
---
1. The game is 14 years old, there just aren't that many people starting or playing low levels
---
2. In the first 40 levels the zones are rarely cross faction - even more so now that zones scale so you have no need to travel to the more risky areas, so there would be very little chance to see anyone who isn't doing the same quests as you.
---
wPvP isn't great in BFA, but it is there and i've never not seen anyone - because of sharding you should be *more* likely to see other people, because it groups together the small amount of people in zones across lots of servers into one shard to make them feel more populated, not less.  They don't start  new shard just for you, thats not how this works.
---
" The difference here is that streamer influence has grown substantially over the years "  
---
There also wasnt players that would receive as much abuse as some streamers will.
---
You can unsub if you want...
---
Awesome, that increased spirit will definitely help with levelling too!
---
Same here 👍
---
Screw this entitled man baby BS streamer cult shite!
---
Do pets grow in size with level in the Classic servers?
---
You're really making things better, champ.
---
&gt;  but at least read the whole thing 
---
That's a no.
---
Sad thing is they won’t get stream sniped as much as people think. The streamers have all day long to play and will out level and out gear 99% of the player base. So unless they can keep up with them they have to wait a while.
---
Immortality. Now there’s an old name.
---
Listened to a podcast with Kevin Jordan (Vanilla WoW lead class designer) a few weeks ago. Apparently the survival hunter was supposed to be Aragorn.
---
He literally said he doesn't care about getting ganked. He cares about the intentions and motivations of the gankers being wrong. Rather than just being an asshole, they're doing it for attention, exposure, envy, hatred, etc.
---
Difficulty is relative and there are many different ways to measure difficulty, it's not just about mechanical execution. The mechanics in vanilla raids were not very hard but relative to the information that was available, it was harder. You didn't have youtube videos to look up strategies, you didn't have a dungeon journal, add ons were much more limited. You also had a lot more things to work towards outside of raids like making sure you had all the necessary consumables. 
---
The fact is that while mythic raiding is still challenging they have dumbed some things down a bit because they simplified a lot of the classes by pruning out loads of different abilities. Raiding difficulty was probably at its apex in Mists of Pandaria when class design was excellent and raiding was hard too.
---
Have you seen the lengths people go to piss people off on hearthstone? Kripparian literally had a network of people sniping his arena games at every level with OP decks over and over. People in WoW can do this way easier to piss off a streamer.
---
You are pathetic
---
What? He is right. Camping another player is 100% fair and an allowed part of the game. It is not unavoidable, you can log off or reroll on a PvE server.
---
Hehe good one :)
---
There are 12 spaces on the action bar tho.. 12345QERFCXZ
---
Oh no, streamers are the new Chads.
---
I use elvui. Stock ui 😂
---
The point I'm trying to work towards, but maybe failing at is Classic probably requires something between what's required to run Vanilla decently and what's required to run BFA decently. BFA pushes way more polygons and texels. So it stands to reason the minimum requirements would be lower, especially on the GPU side.
---
&gt; Also what the fuck kind of paladin doesn't wear a libram? 
---
The kind smart enough to know librams aren't in Phase 3 :)  
---
Fair point on the dummy though, we talked about it in the discord, was just an oversight on his part.
---
No one's gonna get blacklisted unless they repeatedly piss someone off or do something like what trollgodx did in the tournament. Doesn't take much thinking to assume a random gank will result in blacklisting.
---
Ok
---
 10s to make a guild, no?
---
Yeah, I'm hoping the more people who complain the direction this sub is heading towards eventually stops the toxic train, but just a hope
---
Lmao you realize you're describing things like mythic raiding right? Those scenarios exist where you still need to socialize. 
---
Blizzard just made the game easier for people to play who don't have active guilds and communities. 
---
Even in vanilla if you weren't in a dedicated group or guild you could feel ostracized from most activities. 
---
The real problem lies with people not the game. Some like being left alone and some like socializing. 
---
Many people have groups of friends they already play games with and don't feel like they need to befriend every idiot on the server to do simple tasks. 
---
And even if you wanted to argue "its an mmo you should he forced to talk" guess what, its the only warcraft game released in 18 years and people still wanna play warcraft.
---
Obviously he cares about getting ganked if he wants to cross faction collude to make a blacklist if someone camps him for more than 15 mins.
---
&lt;3
---
Imagine being a normie and getting baited
---
Is it hard to understand? People killing him do it for attention, he doesn't care if he just gets ganked for ganking sake.
---
Soda has talked about vanilla for decades..
---
I really don’t think it is. People complain there is no social interaction when in reality there is plenty, people just do what they can to avoid it and expect Blizzard to force them to socialize like it’s some kindergarten. If you want to socialize you have all the chances in the world to do so, and you can make some pretty good friends down the road.
---
Yeah leveling might be dull and lonely, but at max level there is group content all around you.
---
Deadblood
---
I’m leveling as enhancement on PS atm just about to hit 20. It’s a real slog up until I’d say lv17 then it kicked off for me. I’d def recommend joining groups whenever you can. I’ve noticed in the past few weeks that everyone is grouping a lot - like you get invites if you just run close to people. Pretty hopeful that’ll carry over into Classic. I’m gonna be leveling Paladin so I’ll be in pretty much the same boat as you.
---
Well. You can always let someone else, like me for example, test a little bit.
---
imagine still defending Maza's attackers lmao
---
Ok. Well I never heard of him before. Even after your explanation (I would use a bit more punctuation in your first paragraph as it id's kinda hard to read,  lol) he still doesn't feel important to me.  While I do believe he could have helped Blizzard decide to create classic,  I think it is only marginal.
---
Ps: Thanks for the downvotes because I dont know a person. (Internet) people are so superficial.
---
I know it's not wow but look at that douche ninja who streams fortnite. Everytime someone fairly beats him he cries and reports them. 
---
Imagine that happening in WoW.
---
Imagine being such a little bitch
---
i only know of cohhcarnage to pay his mods
---
This thread is a perfect example of the deeply rooted jealousy and hatred people have towards streamers. So easy to see through the shallow arguments. Grow up and play on a different server, none of this should offend you
---
As a vanilla player. I loved camping and ganking people. I'd have ganked level 1's at 60 given the opportunity. It's PVP, that's what happens sometimes. Nothing would have given me more joy than watching a streamer freak the fuck out after being repeatedly ganked back in the day.  Shame we didn't have the computers/internet speeds to stream back then. Some of the content would have been a goldmine. 
---
Although back in the day, if we did have streamers, it probably wouldn't have been like today where 99/100 of them sperg out jumping around in their gaming chairs screaming like "OMG OMG WHAT THE FUCK EVEN IS THIS GANK OMG BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO".
---
uhm, just play on a PvE server then?
---
Paladin also has the 2H mace quest. (verigans fist iirc) Which is also a nice quest to do.
---
\\\^ I can't gank people who are just minding their own business for no reason without feeling terrible about it.
---
Rogues have poison quests where you have to steal key and open box using your lock picking.
---
i recently made a amazing friend in wow private servers, ya, i admit it, i played on a private server, and it made me a really good friend so fawk u less social games
---
Funny thing was Grimmmz was found to be using aimbot himself.. the irony
---
It's about guild mentality. It's why the casual guild I was in had mages rocking up as frost, an arms warrior, all sorts of hunter/lock specs, rogues coming as sub, etc. Either you enforce "raid" specs or you don't.
---
no one is saying you shouldnt wpvp them, they're saying maybe dont look at their stream to find them in stealth, pretty simple right?
---
!RemindMe 82 days
---
If you are saying streamers and content creators didnt bring light to Nostalrius shutdown you are truly delusional. EVery big content creator made a video after nostalrius was shutdown.
---
I enjoy a lot of the classic streamers, but fuck soda, hes a little prick.
---
The blacklist will be a badge of honor.
---
Can yall shut the fuck up about streamers already and just talk about the god damn game? Who fucking cares man, if you don't like streamers, don't watch them. 
---
Simple as that. Leave it to Reddit to make a big fucking deal over nothing as usual.
---
The thing is his influence won't extend to the opposing faction. No one there gives a single fuck what Soda thinks about someone that ganks him. Sodas fanboys are playing on the same faction than him, because they all want to play WITH him.
---
So his entitled rant only achieves one thing, more people who want to gank him because he's a bitch.
---
Ok.
---
But they are literally getting special shitty treatment. No normal player will be ganked as much as streamers. So special bad treatment is good, but special good treatment is a no no?
---
I actually red your whole post. It was well written and had a lot of good points.
---
You make no sense
---
Im pretty sure most pokestreamers hide the bottom screen in battles? Or was it a showdown streamer?
---
But the guy said a streamer shouldnt get special treatment, LITERALLY beeing stream sniped IS special treatment. A shitty special treatment but one none the less.
---
I’ll gladly accept donations so I can no-life this game to ensure that a big streamer doesn’t get Scarab Lord. 
---
How much would that be worth to everyone?
---
Why would they have cross faction ninja lists, when the player can't play on the other faction?
---
Secondly, why would anyone in the other faction care that one of theirs is stream sniping Soda. Anyone that cares about Soda is playing on his faction.
---
Shoulders do that always. You don’t notice it as much in the vanilla/classic screenie cause of the horde hunch.
---
Personally flat back orc &gt; hunched orc. There is always female orc for vanilla/classic though.
---
&gt; Which class would have the most optimal spec that could see me alternate between PvP and 5 man pve reletive to respec costs?
---
Holy pally
---
Awww mannnn Xfire. The OG discord.
---
It took me longer to understand that joke than it should have. Nice one!
---
By you? Are you a rank 1 and gladiator player?
---
I'm sorry but most of your contribution to this sub is complaining about toxicity. Maybe get in there, start and participate in meaningful discussions and help guide it to where you'd like it to be.
---
This thread achieves absolutely nothing.
---
* Just because the servers are nowadays capable of handling 10k+ players, doesn't mean there will be that many
---
* You also don't know most people on a server with 5000 people. I came from a small town with 1800 people. Do you think I knew everyone there?
---
And seriously people, what is wrong with you? Do you wake up in the morning asking yourself: _"Now then, what can I worry about today to make my life miserable?"_
---
If the servers are empty, you complain. If they are full, you complain. If there is layering, you complain. If they turn off layering, you complain.
---
One of the beautiful things of the Blizzard of days gone by, is that they didn't give a flying fart about all the whine on the internet. I muss those days.
---
Letting people know how Classic works isn’t toxic. Perhaps conveying things more gently might help?
---
Yes you can, the stream snipers literally know sodas location when he is stealthed, by simply sniping.
---
Or if he knows your exact location IN STEALTH lol
---
The player based completely changed wow and even vanilla wow. The original manual teased that siege weapons and city raids would be a thing and before that came people banded together to have a bitch and moan about impromptu city/town raids that stopped them from questing and having fun on a pvp server.
---
So the devs introduced infinite spawning guards which ended that original philosophy.
---
So yes, the game changed because of the community even in vanilla.
---
The tier 0 set is not pre-raid bis, and I do not believe parts of it is either. However, the tier 1 and 2 (and possibly 3, I don't remember) are bis in their phase. Hunter is one of the few classes that have their set as bis. Makes sense?
---
Your face is the worst thing about classic wow so far.  
---
[What, bro?](https://media.giphy.com/media/UjK3JJmpf6Q6s/giphy.gif)
---
&gt;Or he has to realize that being a well known streamer just has its downsides
---
He clearly realizes this. I think what you meant by that though is that he needs to &lt;i&gt;accept&lt;i&gt; it.
---
What streamers don't like is people using outside of game information to affect them inside of game. Like walking straight at someone who is in stealth, or literally following their ghost around which is impossible to see w/o looking at their screen. Or showing up every 5 minutes after they change location and the same retards show up to fight again for no reason other than to harass them.
---
&gt; As far as I can tell, druid is the better tank both while leveling and at 60, while paladin is the better healer?
---
Yes, although druids can heal dungeons well enough. Their main Achilles heel is the long cooldown on their resurrect. Resto druids will also be taken for raids but holy paladins will take priority.
---
They're different in PvP. Paladins are superior pocket healers almost exclusively because of dispel and blessing of freedom. Druids are equally unattractive targets as paladins but they are much more slippery and disruptive because of spells like Feral Charge, Bash, and Entangling Roots.
---
As for leveling experience druid wins no contest. They are the third fastest levelers behind hunter and warlock while paladins are among the worst.
---
Druid is easily the better class for running a hybrid build as well. Most of your healing effectiveness comes from gear so you can afford to put significant points into feral and change roles on the fly. A holy paladin would want to be grouped up pretty much all of the time. AFAIK prot paladins aren't used because they have trouble holding aggro.
---
tl;dr: If you want to be a very desirable support class and win favor with min-maxers go paladin, if you want more flexibility and independence go druid.
---
another mmo with an earlier version that was released to the public was Dofus (version 1.29) sometime in 2016, by a french company Ankama. This game was big back in the days 2007-2009, especially in the french community, but once they migrated to version 2.0 (i think late 2009) a lot of players quit because of the massive shift of art style (too big of a change for most players) and so the game heavily declined internationally since then. So they released the old 1.29 version (which had peak population btw) in 2016. Unsure of the current population now  but goes to show, a lot of companies change something that isnt broken!
---
Warlock.
---
The reasonable argument against a blacklist is that they can and will be abused. People will be put on it that shouldn't be. The question is really just if it does more harm or good. I hate getting matched with toxic players, ninja looters, griefers, etc. I'd also really hate getting blacklisted because someone with blacklist rights was having a bad day.  
---
Ideally blizzard just bans people. Hopefully that's the case or someone comes up with a better system.
---
Waauw!
---
Doesn’t really differ based on patch. Very few pets (comparatively) retained much. Matter of fact early vanilla hunter pets were a joke. I think only 6 abilities among all pet families and a good amount of pet families had 0 abilities.
---
I don't see anyone claiming it costs 10g. I just see claim of speedfarming 10g &amp; using part of that money to buy guildname.
---
He didnt ask blizzard to ban, did you even watch the video?
---
The unsubscribe button is that way -&gt;
---
&gt; And seriously people, what is wrong with you? Do you wake up in the morning asking yourself: "Now then, what can I worry about today to make my life miserable?"
---
&gt;If the servers are empty, you complain. If they are full, you complain. If there is layering, you complain. If they turn off layering, you complain.
---
????? To ignore the question and let out all your pent up frustration at me, I suppose?
---
&gt; Just be aware that barely killing bosses in MC wont really allow for much BWL clearing
---
even the most casual guilds of today will have zero problem with MC or BWL.  
---
even AQ is not hard mechanically. its time consuming.
---
there is no need for sacrificing anything in vanilla. except the absolute endgame its piss easy and it always will be.
---
I still don't see the issue, on my server we had a horde guild lockdown one of the Thunderfury NPCs to prevent an alliance guild that had both bindings from getting server first Thunderfury.
---
They used another account to /who his location and then sent hunting parties to him, kited the NPC around Silithus all day every day, just all around went out of their way to make sure this one player specifically couldn't do what he wanted and it was celebrated, rather than considered griefing.
---
He got it in the end, by organising 3 or 4 full 40 man raids to go and wipe them, whilst he stood at the quest spot with another 40 man raid defending the reset point of the NPC.
---
Nowadays all that's changed is there's people out there stupid enough to constantly broadcast their location on a PvP server with no delay.
---
As for the PvE bit; Ye i do actually think griefing should be against the rules for PvE, they're there to offer an escape from all the red=dead stuff and to largely prevent your play time from being at the whim of the other faction, so an hour of stalking is OTT IMO.
---
PvP servers are fair game though IMO.
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon. Period!
---
and:
---
**Pet heal equip &gt; all**
---
What? What are you on about, raids are limited to one per week. Soda isn't going to have any more gear than any normal person whose guild never misses a raid. Playing 16 hours a day versus 8 hours a day makes zero difference in raid gear.
---
Not only will most of his stream snipers be as well geared then Soda, thing is, Soda plays a Druid. You can't fucking do shit in world PvP with druid against many other classes like Mage, Warlock, Rogue and so on. Now consider the fact that it won't be a single Rogue ganking him, it will be a full group or raid of them. All with great gear.
---
Sodas going to get bullied into switching to a PvE server or stopping streaming, and there is nothing he can do to stop it.
---
Too long, didn't read.  
---
Not kidding. There is this fantastic thing called the Enter button.
---
Imagine being upset when you call for the attack and silencing of people with opposing opinions, then play victim when someone calls you by what you identify as. 
---
I can tell you're a big fan of soda and asmons little social blacklist.
---
Useful for dungeons but if you plan on ignoring dungeons mind soothe/mind vision are very much unnecessary - skipping mobs as a priest is pointless since even +5 level mobs can be killing without stressing your mana.
---
You are the one who doesnt understand, its a community made list, something that ALREADY existed in vanilla BEFORE streaming was even a thing. I dont get how reporting someone on twitch will benefit in the game WTF? :D
---
Ah, interesting! Could humans even be survival hunters back then? 
---
Do you have a link to it mate? Would really like to hear their imaginings (for a lack of better term) of the different classes
---
It's a complex ecosystem. I am beneficial to a streamer even though I don't give him anything and I am an adblock user so no ad revenue either. Chat activity and viewer count are both good for creating environment where they do get payed - more viewers -&gt; more paying viewers, adwatching users, sponsorships, advertisment...
---
But that still means I'm getting hundreds of hours of free entertainment, that don't cost me anything. Since getting the same amount of value elsewhere would cost me much more, it's not so surprising I'm willing to pay, even though it's not necessary. Like you said, it's like the non-mandatory restaurant tipping.
---
But. Don't forget about starting streamers. I know plenty of big names that were able to grow only because of the support of their viewers. Quite common to see someone eventually quit their former job to finally stream full-time, which wouldn't be possible without people subscribing and donating. 
---
But that's not my main point. My main point is that in a capitalistic world, paying for service is a standard. I don't care if they get infinitely more money from sponsors. I'm happy to add more to that, because they're worth it *to me*. That's all. Just like I'm not gonna steal from someone just because he can afford the loss. From this point of view, their income is not relevant to me. I am getting a service I like -&gt; I pay for it. 
---
Like if I'm playing a free to play game and I buy a bunch of stuff, because I feel the company deserves my support. It doesn't matter they make millions and I as a player create an environment for whales to pay them what I never could or would. I still want to give something back. Because I feel it's right to support things in your life that make it better.
---
Lock of warrior? Plz help
---
Sorry to say, but you are very wrong. The biggest streamers are multimillionaires. The biggest streamers are pulling between 100k and 500k a MONTH. Yes, you heard that right..  
---
Just google it, you'll find plenty of evidence there.
---
Nobody forces you to go here and there is nothing wrong with elitism and negativity.
---
Also the Classic generals on 4chan’s /vg/ are far worse, at least I don’t see any trannies spamming about wanting to be a healslut here.
---
ropetown for life.
---
Don’t be like this lol. The picture is clearly implying that it costs 10g to make a guild otherwise it wouldn’t state “speedfarm”.   OP fucked up with this meme and is probably salty about it
---
Imagine having the same guy show up and run straight at you while you're in stealth from a mile away. Or being a ghost and the same guy is running around right on top of your ghost. That is the type of bullshit sniping they are talking about. I don't know what you guys think they are getting upset about but it's not fighting someone or getting camped, it's them watching their screens to harass them in game.
---
Ahhh classic goals!
---
ITT: People who have a personal vendetta against streamers for no real reason at all.

Streamers are reviving a dying game by providing entertaining content. I’m seeing people who have never even played wow take an interest in the vanilla experience which I think is a great thing. 
---
What’s not so great is seeing players exploiting streamers by tracking their movements down to the pixel. It’s unfair in the same sense of screen looking in split screen gaming. It takes no skill or finesse and is a cheap tactic. Sure, ganking a low level player could be comparable to this, but at least it is within the confines of the game and doesn’t draw your attention away to an alt-tabbed window/different monitor. 
---
Soda’s solution to stream snipers may be harsh due to his emotions, but I think stream snipers will present a problem to the longevity of the game.
---
&gt; As a result I suggest we create a super guild, "The Blacklist" 
---
Congratulations, reddit, you have peaked.
---
Why would you not get Eyes of the Beast or Eagle Eye? It's like 12s each. Well worth it just for the fun.
---
But if your guild reaches their goals, what's the problem?
---
To me the crux of the "meme spec" discussion always comes back to a lot of people thinking that clearing as efficiently as possible is either the only way you can possibly clear it and you'll just wipe for half a year, or that it's the only way to have fun. If that's someone's shtick, more power to them, but plenty don't like to play that way. It frustrates me that people get stuck in a pattern of thinking stacking fury warriors is the only way it could ever work. Again, if that's their goal, I wish them the best, but my idea of fun isn't playing specs I don't like because it's 30% better. I'm just gonna show up to the raid in a shit mood and start hating wow if I do that
---
Stv isn't contested in classic.  The only time you are flagged unintentionally is if you hit an enemy faction nexus or intentionally wander into occupied territory.  Scarlett monastery is more an appropriate of an example for alliance players.  You flagged as soon as you hit the bulwark and were easy meat if you trickled into the instance.
---
Be an asshole on a social game where reputation matters and then be surprised when no one wants to play with you?
---
came in prepared to downvote.  
---
well, you are not wrong. have an upvote instead.
---
I don't watch streamers, but I start to hate them.  
---
not because of their fanbase or themselves. no. its because even though I have zero interest in any of their opinions or activities the sites I visit get constantly spammed with content I don't care about. rants about streamers, content by streamers, all of this.  
---
go away, I don't care.
---
If blizzard listens to the community again we will have everyevery QoL back, flying, lfg, focus on balance and not fun etc. I hope blizzard stops listening to the majority and develop a good game instead.
---
People were progressing through AQ 40 with Boomkins in their raids.
---
It's all "QQ a streamer said he'd blacklist me or call for me to be banned QQ " who cares?
---
This is so epic 😎
---
There was an addon for that! The Kill on Sight addon was one of the first I installed at level 30 or so
---
Nah, i don't think so.
---
Just started playing Overwatch Ranked Mode. Really love the gameplay as a whole but the community seems quite toxic
---
It will run on a potato, but not an ultra potato.
---
It’s been years since the ‘Shamans are OP’ memes!!!!
---
Haha same, I thought my internet was being dumb again!
---
&gt; The reasonable argument against a blacklist is that they can and will be abused.
---
Sure, and y'all can have a discussion about it. Personally, I think you would be overreacting if you say that, kind of a "just try it and see if it works at least" kinda situation.
---
But read the god damn OP, that dude said that one of "our" perks is to be able to stream snipe. Like what the actual fuck, how is this garbage post getting upvotes?
---
Its a 21:9 3440x1440 120hz gsync monitor.
---
So just one ultrawide at 200% resolution scale.
---
I've been leveling a mage on a private server to test out builds as I was facing the exact same dilemma as you. I've only reached level 40, so take what I say with a pinch of salt, but...
---
I've found if you commit to CoC/AE AoE grinding instead of Blizzard grinding, Frostbite doesn't fuck up your rotation anywhere near as much. It definitely requires more attention, but since you're essentially just running around the mobs in a circle, the mobs end up pretty much just running round any Frostbitten mobs, so they're still grouped up enough to hit with the next CoC.
---
I've been successfully AoEing groups of 6-8 mobs with that technique, and I'll be employing the same strategy and build when Classic launches.
---
I work in a very international environment - from my experience this is not a isolated German only thing. Currently, we have a few French natives in our team. Even when we all sit together in our team room, they would speak french only to each other, speaking about work, coworkers, you name it. Fully agree with you that speaking in foreign tongue when there are alternative options available in front of others is fairly disrespectful.
---
As much as I love seeing the random assortment of bindings people are throwing at you :) I'm the guy that actually looked down at his keyboard when deciding bindings. You want everything encircling your movement keys. Numbers should generally be spells with a cast time, since you'll be lifting your finger off W to stop moving and cast them. It's not hard to hold W and press 2, but it's not comfortable. Instant cast spells should be on letter binds, as those buttons are easy to hit while holding W or strafing. There are 12 buttons on each action bar. Why not fill them in nicely. 12345QERFCXZ  
---
Everything in a row, no gaps, concise. After that it's your choice to use Shift, Alt or Ctrl on additional bars with the same layout. An addition bar may also have TGV and ~ as bindings as they are within reach but not comfortable enough for the main bars. As others have said mouse buttons are great too, but I do not recommend binding anything to your space bar besides jump. Jumping in combat is a way to maintain a strafing direction without stopping, when you need to lift a finger to press a binding. For example if youre strafing left with A, but you need to press something on Q. You would jump and hit Q midair, but having something bound to say Shift- Space Bar, you might miss your jump if you need to cast something on Shift-Q. F1 F2 F3 F4 also great buttons, I like those for Druids and Warrior stances. Hunters and Warlocks absolutely need to bind their Pet Attack/Return to one button, and more buttons for Stay command as well as pet abilities. Hunters should have their Auto Shot on a mouse button, makes it way easier. And anyone who melees should have Auto Attack on a mouse button. U prefer mouse back for Auto Attack/Shot and mouse forward for auto run. Then put pet attack on ~. But if I'm a Warlock I''ll put my Pet Attack/Recall macro on mouse back instead.
---
I find this all incredibly amusing. Why anyone would be interested in what some random asshole on the internet it doing I can't fathom. Let alone spend YOUR playtime following them around like a dog.
---
Id like to see what the new 10nm icelake cpu can do with its integrated graphics. Intel claims 2x the performance over the last generation.
---
The rogues does not have to engage he 20k viewers. They can gank him until he starts calling for backup then slink away when the threat becomes too high and wait.
---
He is broadcasting his every move, which means tracking him and anticipating backup is the easiest thing in the world, so you can stay in stealth and pick your battles. Even if he mounts up to relocate you don't have to exit stealth to follow because you know where he'll be.
---
Eventually that army of drones will get tired of running around for nothing, and then you strike again
---
I get it, the guy is a multiglad player and him and his buddies are good at this game. But there is no resilience to stack, and there is very little your glad titles can do when you get 1v5d. It won't be a fair fight if the gankers have any kind of brain cells
---
Won't someone please think of the streamers.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Literally everything you said was somehow the opposite of what is going to happen. Just because you don't have time to play the game, does not mean most WoW players do not. It's a fucking MMORPG, it draws in the kind of crowd that plays 8-16 hours a day.
---
It will actually be far better to camp a streamer at lvl 60 vs lvl 60, because your full epic gear can kill another player very quickly, even though they are equally well geared. Fights are a lot slower at earlier levels. But a Rogue in full T2 epics is going to perma stunlock and crit Sodas Druid ass to death in a matter of seconds no matter if he has full epics as well.
---
Wow cool argument bro! Your own must be low if you can't read!
---
Yes it is. You gain zero advantage in gear from playing 12 hours a day compared to who plays 3 hours a day, if both players guilds are active raiders. Both will have BiS gear.
---
They dont mind being camped, they mind the same retard running straight at them while they are stealth from a mile away, i've even seen people follow soda's ghost around, which is 100% impossible unless you are staring at his screen. you guys seem way more mad than the streamers in all this. If you dont like it dont play on his server, pretty simple. but dont be suprised when acting like an asshole gets you a reputation and no one wants to play with you.

This would be better is Brock Lesnar was giving her an F5 in the last panel

The content in that article is related to patch 3.0. (Not sure why it's in a vanilla wiki.) If you actually click the sources, you'll find:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10918/wound-poison
---
Love the comments in the YouTube link! This guy is a total douche canoe and his attitude alone awards him the prizes of people camping him. He literally deserves it for his attitude alone, and this is coming from someone who genuinely LOATHES campers...
---
Literally any average guild can do 8 MC runs and 16 Onyxia runs in 2 months lmao. Only meme guilds won't.
---
Well you can’t always be right, I wouldn’t get salty about it bud
---
Typical millennial garbage. I hope he ganked relentlessly.
---
God, I can't emphasize this enoguh... :) Streaming is jail, is a slavery in so many ways.
---
What's that supposed to mean? Like, in English please D:
---
Yeah that's certainly the case in hardcore guilds.
---
Many casual guilds and pugs probably won't always have one hpala per blessing, so even if it's not as good, a retri will still be better than another pure dps.
---
Another reason for retri is seal of light. Again, a hardwire guild won't give up a debuffslot for seal of light, but for every group struggling, the additional healing for melee classes will work wonders.
---
Do you happen to remember what post it was you saw? I'm torn between Mage and Priest, but I've already decided I'm going to roll undead...
---
Maybe it will win me over as well lol
---
Huh??

She could've at least got you War of the Spark or Modern Horizons. lol
---
I know.
---
This is why I chose to CLICK refresh instead mashing the F5 key.
---
/s
---
I honestly enjoy some of his content, but every once in a while his very entitled attitude shows up. He literally expects every group he joins to be just for gearing him up.
---
Woah. 
---
If only people took real life this seriously. We might have cured cancer.
---
so at first its fine as long as its sniping and now it doesnt matter because its their list nice take dude!! XD!!
---
ohh this is a really cool addon! I'll be using this!
---
I dont think we really disagree.  Frankly, the thunderfury story was awesome! But again, pvp server and they targeted a character not a player.  After he got thunderfury, did the guild decide to gank him every time he was on just to ruin his life? Did they go after his alts? Cause that is what stream snipers are trying to justify as "just pvp stuff".  If there was a player that was ganking the same player over and over for days and weeks, if they made a character on the opposite faction just so that they could /who that player and then kill them with there main, and this continued, would you call that normal pvp server shenanigans or have we strayed into harrassment?
---
Unacceptable to who? You? Who's going to care? It's not against the game TOS.
---
Countdown to Classic podcast. Episodes 95 - 101 have a segment with Kevin Jordan. There's also a few more with vanilla WoW devs who worked on level design and other things in the game. It's worth listening to at least the parts with the old devs; they are suuuuper interesting.
---
[Here's the one on Hunter](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/04/12/episode-99-luke-lafreniere-talks-nost-kevin-jordan-talks-hunters-pvp-news-hunter-pvp/) There's time references so you can just listen to the class parts if you want.
---
Fun fact: Staff of Jordan was named after this dude.
---
This is such a non issue
---
What makes you think the ganker won't have full BiS by then? 
---
&gt;somehow you managed to get the same level of gear playing 3 hours a week (you won’t)
---
Why would you think so? That's more than enough to never miss a raid. You will have as much gear as the guy playing 16 hours a day.
---
Grow up mate.
---
Blacklists have been used and abused in classic, most of retail and every private server. It does work if enough people are in on it, but some innocent players get screwed by being put on there when they shouldn't. 
---
Yeah, the main post is crazy. Not defending that.
---
I agree with you on the “act retarded to fit in” being mainstream.
---
If they don't want to be targeted, then don't stream. Simple stuff
---
Class interests does not lie.
---
Streamers and gaming celebs are scum.
---
I agree on streamsniping in general, but on an mmo it‘s not a big deal, being a streamer with a large audience als brings haters, they most likely gonna use information shown to find the streamer and try kill him. (If he has not 100 ppl moving around with him) Yet they still need the skill to gank the streamer. Being in the spitlight has afterall good and bad sides.
---
I don‘t know why there is such a fuss about all this. 
---
Streamers in my opinion have to choose one of the three following: 
---
Grab the money
---
Enjoy the game without streaming on PvP
---
Or play on PvE
---
So you're bullying him because you're mad he has power and community in video game.
---
There is ZERO logic to your claims about someone playing 16 hours a day having better gear than the guy playing 3 hours a day after both have reached lvl 60. Both will do exactly the same amount of raids in the same amount of time.
---
I would love this, but then again I would love to see you get countered by your stream sniper followers. The sniper becomes the SNIPED
---
I only see people getting salty about a "mistake" in a meme. Not sure who here needs to look ar their natrium levels.
---

I’ve never played on a private server myself but since they are alive and flourishing (at least until classic comes), there is something that keeps people on classic servers for years. If blizzard manages to fish all the people in that played on private servers and keeps them entertained similarly they will be fine.
---
Ninjaing intentionally was actually somewhat tos back in the day in wow
---
keep in mind as a lock threat will be the biggest issue for you in raids and you can wipe the whole raid because you pulled the boss/add off of the assigned tank
---
Don't stream don't get streamsniped.. simple stuff
---
People are being deliberately stupid and taking Soda's argument to the extreme. People made blacklists back in the day as well which was shared between guilds. Sure this will be on a larger scale, but he is trying to solve a player problem with a player solution instead of crying to blizzard. It's not exactly a foolproof plan, but it's probably the best way to do it if he still wants to stream. If someone doesn't like it then just play on a different server, guilds are free to exclude and include people however they want.
---
My guess is bloodelf?
---
Ah poor guy, I'm sorry.
---
With Classic we will see small effective groups camping highly trafficked flightmasters and the occasional battle at the entrance to BRM, which will fade (but not entirely vanish) when the BG's are finally released.
---
You are also spending most of the day in your room, and the majority of your social interaction becomes through online. A lot of them start having psychological issues because your life starts to shape around catering to your chat and making sure that they enjoy what they are watching. Glink has a very nice video about it: https://youtu.be/oS6zInjU67U
---
Why do these questions piss you off? Because they're asked so frequently, and a quick search online would quickly find an answer to their question?   
---
Just curious. I don't mind helping others, as that's the spirit of vanilla, yo
---
My bad - Edited :)
---
Well, you saying "it was confirmed to be true [that the guy was streamsniping]" implies that you were saying the ban was justified. Why else even point that out, since it's irrelevant.
---
Good post inbetween all those hate posts! 👍🏻
---
Never mind the 100k+ unique accounts on Nostalrius, the Nostalrius team who actually met with Blizzard, that former Blizzard employee who took those 100 signatures *in print* and dumped them in Blizzard's office.
---
Bro its literally guaranteed
---
If somebody is dumb enough to stream their location on a PvP server they deserve to be ganked. Same thing about streaming in real time while playing a competitive game. Being an attention whore has it’s consequences, just fucking deal with it.
---
So the streamers are toxic, and not the thousands of people devoting their lives to trolling, harassing, trying to ruin streams... Yeah those people are the victims! It's the streamers fault!
---
NOT camping, but streamsniping them, learn the difference you mental idiot or you only repeat lies that some other idiot posted?
---
Crippling poison is really good against enemies who run.
---
It's "'tis", not "t's"; and "water under the bridge", not fridge.  
---
But I think those "errors" were intentional, probably for humour, eh? :)
---
Also: water under a fridge can be a sign of serious problems.
---
Gaming industry is entertainment, its a non productive industry that had no real use for society. It does more harm than good since it removes focus from the important things in the real world so yeah by all means, let the streaming industry die. It does no good for society any way and it will make regular people enjoy their games more than they already are.
---
I am extremely sure STV is contested on PvE servers in vanilla. I very distinctly recall it being a warzone on my PvE server.
---
It'll serve you just fine until 60 (60 dungeon drops are actually not that much stronger). The Zum'rah staff is slightly worse and requires you to do multiple ZF runs to get on average.  
---
Worth using if you're leveling your first character, otherwise sell it to a twink down the road when there's some money in the economy.
---
Just. Play. On. A. Different. Server.
---
People who intentionally start up on a server that a lot of streamers gather on simply to stream snipe them... Are frankly quite sad and need to get some friends and a life.
---
I don’t understand the outrage about this. 
---
Everyone saying this isn’t fair isn’t getting the point. 
---
This isn’t about some random guy coming up and killing you,
---
This is about a guy following you all the time and killing you, 
---
I’ve seen people literally form an entire raid just to farm soda, if this was literally anyone else who isn’t a streamer everyone would be on their side.
---
That's exactly how I feel as well, but I can totally see people prioritising abilities based on their cost to learn. Either way, I have to appreciate all the work that went into this! Thanks, OP!
---
I want to play shaman for healing raids at 60 but i have 2 concerns.
---
Are you able to heal dungeons while leveling with how you put your talent points? My main concern is the early ones like RFC, WC, and SFK.
---
Secondly, you have 16 totems at 60 for raiding right? How the fuck do you bind all those
---
i love seeing this stuff! ive got my hard drive somewhere that i hope has screen shots in from classic wow. need to try dig it out.
---
Same age as I was when Vanilla came out. Can't fucking wait for this one to come out!
---
Too true. It's also because pvp is a slog now. 1vs1 fights can take like 30 mins. It's ridiculous.
---
The world record 1-60 is 4 days and 20 hours. Most that will be no-life speed leveling probably won't hit 60 until 6-7 days played. 
---
Yeah, I don't see any way a 40 man group is geared up enough to clear MC in 10-11 days.
---
BE are in tbc :/
---
This is not an unpopular opinion. It is an incorrect one.
---
If you are deliberately streaming your location in a PvP MMO, then you get what you get. If Osama bin Laden were streaming his exact location, talking absolute trash about the US ... I don't think the US military would have been "above" stream sniping (I don't care if this example is absurd). This is a multiplayer game. World PvP and BGs are based on military-like strategies. One good strategy, if you want to win, is to not broadcast your location to everyone in the world. The streamer is already benefiting a SHIT TON from his popularity. It's not the community's job to protect the streamer from the disadvantages of streaming.
---
If you are playing a single-player game like Hearthstone, sure ... stream sniping is a bit skeezy and low (mostly because it's 1v1 and because the streamer has NO advantage from streaming), but it still comes with the territory. There's a reason football teams don't stream their sidelines during a game. It would get a lot of viewers but it makes you a bit vulnerable.
---
You say that, but a lot of the guys from Method are in Soda's guild so they would be in on the plan for blacklisting.
---
Removing the fun parts of every class, wow what a great addon. You knoe this was the kind of thinking that made wow what it is today (BFA). I dont want to have 6 abilities that are super important, i want to have 40 so that I can use them in different situations.
---
If any partial wipe of 2 members means a full corpserun it absolutely means the class is unplayable in most instances.
---
level 10 or gitgud m8
---
I think the idea is that they blacklist people intentionally griefing just because of the streams such as the Tauren who was trying to ruin the duelling comp. I hope, he doesn't mean to blacklist any and everyone who kills him one time.
---
He wants a classic experience for himself which he can stream and this is his solution. I don't believe this could work.
---
Just putting this statement out there he has already created people either for or against it. The server will dissolve into "with the streamers" and "against the streamers".
---
There will just be factions within the factions and all out war as a result.
---
No they don't lol
---
No, a lot of people dont agree with you.
---
This sub is so fucking retarded with this. Streamers NOW play on live servers and the economy isn’t effected at all. You realize millions of people are going to be playing this game? Even with how big a steamer is, you all thinking they will run the entire server is so ignorant. That doesn’t happen in any mmo with any streamers and it won’t happen now. You won’t even notice they are there , so many other players will be playing
---
You didn't see the video. The blacklist is just a guild blacklist like guilds used to have back in the day. Not a blizzard ban.
---
Whilst this is also my experience (I love the danger of a PVP server) it might not be for some people. And that's cool too.
---
Soda/streamers are allowed to cry about it. Will anything be done because of it? No.
---
 "QQ the original core experience will be ruined"
---
It's already ruined by time, online information and a 15 year old game. You'll never experience true vanilla ever again.
---
Really doubt you're going to get the raid debuff slots for that though.
---
Warzones weren't a thing in classic.  On a pve server it doesn't matter unless you are in the opposite faction's territory.  If you aren't flagged, you aren't attackable.  Green or orange text on zone in and you are un-attackable.  Red text on zone in and you are fair game for the first hit and can't attack opposite faction.  Used to pvp outside the undercity in classic on my alliance character both on and off pvp servers.
---
Ya so were deadmines, and so were 13 year olds. This may be in the classic subreddit, but I’m thinking this is more bc era fanart
---
???
---
My man, wtf are you on about. The ganker is obviously on the OPPOSING FACTION. Sodas followers play on HIS faction, they can't "blacklist" an enemy player. No one on the opposing faction will care that one from their side is ganking a Horde player.
---
Or you hire a mage / get friends with one and youre good to go.
---
Dont have to bind every single totem, there are some you dont have to use all the time. Keep them unbind and klick them when needed.
---
Dont level with resto its a pain, most popular way is to level as enhancer.
---
If someone is following him in stealth or basically following his ghost around.
---
The jump right at the entrance of MC was already common knowledge in Vanilla (I did it in at least 3 different guilds), but I have this OCD that when I enter an instance I have to kill everything inside so I never liked to avoid mobs !
---
Especially raids trash usually drop some nice loot, so I'm not sure it's smart to pass them when your raid is not well geared.
---
For the guides, I never found anything really in depth so I'll watch this thread.
---
Yeah but its blizzard they dont really enforce bans much anymore
---
Why would he quit? You do know someone can be upset at a problem but continue to do something
---
That's precisely what would be happening. Any sort of these kind of bans would be stupid. I just hope that those streamers won't have enough influence on the guilds on the servers. This kind of blacklisting should not become a thing at all.
---
I mean, I know where he's coming from. Getting ganked so much as a person of interest would be annoying to say the least. But if he doesn't want that there's PvE Servers...
---
Ah, the Valley of Kings. Eternal memorial to Madoran Bronzebeard and Khardros Wildhammer, standing guard over the pass into the dangerous Searing Gorge, and a reminder of the price paid by the Dark Iron dwarves. A mesmerizing spot indeed.
---
That dude has the whole thing pretty much figured out. He pays his mods. Pays a production team to keep his graphics and stream fresh. Good work life balance with the wife and kids. If you’re a middle aged dude who was brought up on video games I’d say Cohh is the model to point at.
---
It's literally not their fault. That's why people want blacklisted players. It's the viewers who crave attention and have hatred for the streamer
---
Let me broadcast my location to the whole world. Hey... what the heck...? How do people know where I am??? This is unfair!
---
That's just the risk you take when you *CHOOSE* to live stream.
---
Please.
---
Use.
---
Paragraphs.
---
Lol so wait there are people who want to stream snipe and then try to get invites to that streamers raids? I dont get it, ofc they will be black listed. 99% of guilds wont care and even glorify stream snipers so what's the problem? The only blacklist you dont want to be on is the ninja list. If you get blacklisted for stealing loot you wont raid. If you get blacklisted for stream sniping you got an invite to my guild any day.
---
They can’t be cool don’t you understand? The scary streamers are coming to ruin their favorite game , everywhere you turn there will be a steamer and a giant steamer army and they are gonna stream Azeroth into the ground!
---
STV?
---
People hate that they make so much money and are interesting when they have a shitty job and 0 viewer stream. Hatred runs people's lives all the time
---
You'd only need instant Poison anyway
---
Literally 0 Beast Stalker items are pre raid best in slot for hunters. I'm not saying not to get it though, I'm just saying that if you want to do the most dps don't wear it in a raid.
---
Because random person from raid is not streaming this. They are doing all of this just to be in a spotlight, to have an interaction with their favorite streamer and to get some Pog's in the chat. 
---
Asmon has his own community and it's fucking huge. There's nothing really surprising when this community decides to do something for their stream. Perks of being a celebrity I guess
---
I remember that day too. Buying my first mechanostrider (was it called that?)for my Gnome rogue. Spent 15 minutes pontificating if its really worth it. ”100 gold, all the gear I could buy. I have sprint too, so it wont take too long to travel” 
---
Ended up with the blue one. Good times.
---
&gt;Warzones weren't a thing in classic.
---
You are probably referring to some actual mechanic from retail WoW that is literally called "Warzone" but I was using it in the normal meaning of the word, as in STV was a wild place with constant world PvP.
---
You remember this all wrong. On PvE servers there absolutely were Contested Zones where you could attack enemy faction players on sight without either side initiating a flag. You see, for the PvP flagging system, the one who has to attack first is from the faction that zone "belongs to" canonically. For example in Westfall or Redridge, an Alliance player would have to attack first.
---
But STV does not belong to either faction, it is a neutral zone. All of these neutral zones were Contested territories with permanently enabled PvP, on every single server in the game, including PvE and RP PvE servers.
---
&gt; there is something that keeps people on classic servers for years 
---
Yes...the fact that they are FREE to play and the fact that there is NO other option to play Vanilla. And those "people" you talk about are less than 100k today. Sure, they were over 1 million players on private servers 3 years ago...but REPLAYING a game, again and again, is what led to private servers today having 10% of the population that they had 3 years ago.
---
Do you see Blizzard ignoring a loss of 90% of the subs in 3 years? And we talk about MILLIONS of subs here, which translate in tens of millions monthly.
---
Because this is how many players private servers lost in the last 3 years...90% of them....WHILE BEING FREE TO PLAY.
---
I hope you understand the difference between a free to play private server and a multi-billion company that doesn't plan for the next 2-3 years, but for the next 15 years.
---
i heard that you dont get accepted into raids if you play anything other than resto, is that true?
---
At this point having seen how most of the big time streamers act in just a beta access, i honestly support the idea of a server exclusive for them. 
---
They get the exposure they want and we get to be free of streamer drama.
---
Strangle thorn vale or something like that. It's a popular leveling area known for world pvp.
---
The difference between your examples is the streamer is willingly broadcasting it. Sure it might be wrong to see where wards are in a game of DOTA, but if your enemy says "hey, I just placed a ward here" and tells you where it is, you bet your ass you're going to use that information to your advantage.
---
It's a competitive game, and if your enemy gives you vital information that you can use to your advantage, they cannot blame you for doing so.
---
Requires you to actually be interesting, which if you have to resort to this gimmick. No one's gonna watch
---
I agree with you that there isn’t an effective way to regulate streamsniping. My point is the hate on this subreddit with regards to streamers is too much. Not that I like the streamers myself, but I will be playing my own game. I will be griefing people when I feel like it, in the way Soda puts it when I feel like an asshole, but I wont try to get unfair advantages over people.
---
Streamers are willingly showing their live gameplay. It's not like you've hacked into his computer and can see what he's doing, he's showing it to you willingly.

It seems like it works if you time it right  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9kWkI4F-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9kWkI4F-I)

RemindMe! 89 days
---
&gt; he issues with his cross-faction blacklist are antithetical to Vanilla's community in that it colludes with the enemy faction to a degree that is mind boggling to me 
---
You say that, but this did happen in vanilla. People did trade blacklists cross faction in a "you scratch my back, I scratch yours" kind of way.
---
This is a bug with spell batching.
---
“This kid has it good so he must be less mature than me!”
---
Imagine if soda actually knew enough about the game to have any validity in his words. I mean a few weeks ago he said that SPriests are invited to raids because they give an insane mana regen to everyone. Then sat there with his regular intimidating face until 99% of chat started LULing him for this bullshit. Also the way he plays druid, god I wish there was another english speaking druid stream, whatever soda is doing is embarrassing to watch.
---
Perhaps you are overly concerned with total population numbers. 
---
1500-3000 players on one server is all it takes to make it feel alive. Classic will not deplete below this until our Sun goes red dwarf. So I don't think it means much to the horde warrior Gruzznok on US-Dragontooth if there are 4,000,000 or 50,000 people playing on other servers as long as his server is full. 
---
Perhaps the solution you seek is to accept that Classic will likely be what it is and, after a few years, less populated than in 2019. It will always be available to play and the odds are high that it will not look much different in 2029 than it does in 2019. TBC (or modified TBC) is the likely expansion path.
---
&gt;MANY streamers are fairly mediocre at what they do,
---
I think you're missing where the skill is. They might be mediocre at the game, but they're not mediocre at entertaining people that watch them. That's the skill required here.
---
Some people are watched because they are good and that skill is what brings people in. But if they don't have a likable personality, not many people will stay. 
---
The absolute best ones combine this. They are both very good at games they are playing, while also being great at making it fun for viewers. 
---
But the skill is the less important part of the equation. Just think about how much viewers there are at channels with no mic and no facecam.
---
And what reason do you have to say that ?
---
You realize "run" doesn't mean playing 1080p 60-144fps 100% of the time. It just means it will play without crashing
---
1. If by mana rationing you mean drinking a lot while leveling, it depends on your spec. I’ve leveled as an Ele on a pserver and I definitely had to drink a lot. It’s not so bad if you level as Enhancement though, and even as an Ele it was bearable. If you intend to PvE I wouldn’t give up on Shaman for a Mage, while I haven’t really played a Shaman in Vanilla, I played both a Shaman and a Warlock at lvl 60 and I just got bored of raiding as a Warlock after having played a Shaman. 
---
If you mean mana issues during raids, it depends. As a Resto Mp/5 is your most important stat, but with decent pre-raid BiS gear and the occassional Mana pot you won’t have any trouble during the early raids.
---
2. Not really, as far as I remember there were some Totems I’ve never used and you’ll mostly use the same totems during raids, but keybinding can really be a bitch as a Shaman.
---
3. No, Resto is quite terrible in the open world. You can heal dungeons in caster gear quite fine as Enhancement or Elemental (in that case you can pretty much use the same gear).
---
Ahhhhh gotcha, it's a glorious v. R A R E triple way crossover:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI2PUqJI_V8
---
So are they fixing it? I heard that this is exactly how it worked and there won't be changes to that
---
I appreciate your genuine curiosity. I think it upsets me because the "dumb questions" usually go against the spirit of vanilla, like you say. The people answering the nooby questions are only continuing the cycle of the wrong ways of thinking about the game rather than explaining to people that everything in the game isn't black and white.
---
&gt; but you, yes you, gatekeeping player who played since 2000 BCE drawing Azeroth on papyrus, don't. 
---
xddddddddddddddddddddddd
---
You won't get accepted into Hardcore guilds with anything other than Resto and some semi-hc/casual guilds might copy this attitude so...partially true, at least.
---
You're better off putting Crippling on your OH. The 1-2% DPS loss is worth not having mobs run away.
---
wtf. nobody talks in BFA and surely nobody is that friendly
---
1. If you can keep a semi relevant int gear set you will be able to heal no matter what your spec.
---
2.you have lots of totems but will need for raiding only a handful at a time so you will not need to have them all bound if it is a concern maybe 5 or 6
---
3. Resto is great in PvP and excelled in group fight  because of the group utility it offers. Skill cap is fairly high but that will depend on your personal ability.
---
They did actually farm that guild and player for the remainder of Vanilla, though largely due to the AQ gong war that broke out shortly after and the ally guild wanting revenge for the whole thunderfury mess so we wound up organizing tons of raiding parties, and had guilds sit at various choke points for the quest chain to try give us the lead, but we lost that race.
---
As for alts, they definitely would have if they had any way of knowing who his or our alts were just like we would have if they had told us who any of their alts were. If any of those horde were to have broadcasted their location, no matter what char they were playing they'd be seeing nothing but graveyards for hours.
---
As for your if scenario, there's no if about it. That shit happened in Vanilla, my server had a few people that were so hated or were so far ahead that people wanted to try and slow them down they'd simply be hunted all hours of the day by at least a couple of people and some days they'd get trapped in a zone and just log for the night. Taught you real hatred for the other faction, made the whole red=dead thing real.
---
It just comes down to broadcasting your location IMO, on a PvP server everything is fair game to me. You can kill quest NPCs in my town preventing an entire HUB from being usable by a faction for weeks if you want, that's likely why you rolled PvP to begin with if that's what you're doing for that length of time so fuck it, enjoy.
---
RobertoJ37 .... hmm.. HMMMMM!!! RBJ????
---
Don't level as resto, you don't need it to heal low lvl dungeons and it will slow you down significantly.
---
Level as enhance, it's the most mana efficient of all shaman spec (which isn't much but still \^\^ ).
---
Respec resto around lvl 55 then finish your levelling in dungeons.
---
In classic whatever your class you'll have to make a lot more binds than just the numbers, even the classes with the less skills have about 30 skills to bind, without counting engi, potions, trinkets, racials etc.
---
Warrior is the easiest since a lot of skills are stance dependent but you'll still need more than the number row.
---
I had a lvl 60 alt mage, you will absolutely drink a lot too, the only difference is that it's free.
---
And cute
---
Live to win!
---
Were is your 5 alts from lvl 11-32 befote you landed on a main?
---
This is a spell-batching exploit which has not been 100% confirmed to have worked consistently in Vanilla. 
---
Your sources of information are being very wishful thinking.
---
I get the troubleshooting, but I think they should stop at 50 to prevent streamers from burning through raid content and publicizing exploits for 5-10 mans.
---
Jesus you're stupid, I literally said nothing about Sodapoppin, I said Grimmmz.
---
And Soda never said anything about reporting or banning, he wants the community to blacklist players for steam sniping. I get it.
---
Seems weird to me that you get banned from a game for using information obtained outside the game (information freely given btw) and otherwise playing like everyone else without cheats or anything.
---
Funny, but yeah, use paragraphs, makes it a thousand time better.
---
You get that extra blessing from your holy paladin though.
---
might be for the best, streamers add little to the actual game besides marketing..
---
you're clearly not able to understand the importance of applying rules equally. downright depressing.
---
The Big Black Chicken of Death.  
---
Warlocks.
---
The blacklist isn’t just about streaming raids. They want to blacklist people from any raid or guild on the server, so stream snipers effectively won’t be able to raid anymore.
---
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge how much Warcraft 3 and WoW were influenced by pop culture? WoW, in architecture and world building, practically oozes LoTR. Burning steppes and searing gorge must have taken heavy influence from Mordor and Isengard respectively. It may have come later, but all the Wotlk scourge architecture looks straight out of LoTR Mordor as well. It’s appropriate for the time too. 2004 was at the height of LoTR fandom. These statues were undoubtedly directly inspired by those in fellowship of the ring (?). The iconography is just too similar.
---
Also, arthas’ arc is so similar to anakin’s in the prequels. People very frequently refer to arthas as the Darth Vader of gaming. I haven’t looked up the date for frozen throne, but i wouldn’t be surprised if one inspired the other.
---
Your point would have meaning if these streamers actualy contributed in a big way to the game. Blizzard is using them for free commercial in this case. 
---
Even if all the Twitch WoW viewers at peak hours were new subs it would be a drop in the ocean compared to actual sub numbers classic will see on release.
---
Sure the streamers provide fun but it stops the second they start acting like entitled brats like now.
---
https://trailerpark.fandom.com/wiki/Rickyisms
---
I think there already exists some sort of blacklist, right? Perhaps more? Not for stream snipers, but for players who leave M+ dungeons early? Something like that? I don't know, I get where he's coming from, but I don't think this is the solution. Also the idea of a "streamer server" sounds a bit... I don't know, too much? I guess?
---
Anyone from Firetree NA here may remember Baconn, an infamous Ret Paladin with Hand of Rag who loved to instigate world PvP in Blackrock Mountain by ganking.
---
Ultimately, despite being Alliance Scum, I remember him fondly. 
---
I look forward to that aspect of Vanilla again, if you keep getting camped and it’s the only place you can currently quest, you kinda of get forced into farming or alt leveling. As frustrating as it is, there’s at least a silver lining.
---
Not my proudest moment but when I hit level 40 on my hunter in vanilla, I was still a fucking MASSIVE nub. I bought 100g for like £10 and got my 60% mount and spent the rest on AH mail gear. But blues are ALWAYS better than greens so half the shit I got was Strength, etc.
---
O fukin bloody hell get the fk off your high horse. Streamers should be banned.
---
I gave it the META tag for a reason :)
---
You made a mistake : you chose one handed mace instead of one handed axes.
---
idk what ppl flame the whole time about toxic in here. havent seen any toxic stuff so far, only ppl who have opinions.  
---
if this shit is offending you, better dont play online games.
---
Thats true! I'm messed up by private Servers not getting this correctly and Mobs fleeing in High-speed anyway even tho having crippling/hamstring on them :-/
---
No it wasn’t. It was Nostalrius and the private server community.
---
I like to check the post histories of people who use "toxic", "gatekeeping", and other similar buzzwords. Your is surprisingly benign. You actually have a few positive posts in there. 
---
As such, I do not consider you a politically programmed person and this might be genuine sentiment from a rational human. I am curious about what specific things you've seen that inspired this post.
---
Is he the same one who fucked my mother? Damn that guy.
---
HS (shaman get a spell with lower cooldown, but same destination), mage portal, warlock summon or engineering teleport gadgets (Everlook or Gadgetzan depending on specialization) or as a druid, the Moonglade port. That are all fast travel options I can remember.
---
I think he really likes classic though, he streamed private server until he was made to stop and then played it off stream a bunch.
---
Even if those rules were in place, I would still stream snipe this little entitled cunt just to piss him off.
---
How about setting an delay n your stream, for 2 to 5 minutes.  
---
Problem solved.....
---
I like how you take sodapoppin seriously especially when he is referred to as such god get a grip and go outside for once instead of posting random crap like this on the internet if you think anyones opinion matters more than just to yourself you are obviously a moron.
---
A link is only as long as your longest strong chain
---
You do realize that you have to THANK Soda for this, right? Soda just created a reaction, that led to player driven BRAND new content in Classic.
---
Would your guild even EXIST without Soda?
---
Now, what Soda is saying is clearly upsetting snowflakes...because Soda is right. Only truth upsets snowflakes.
---
If a player's desire is to play Classic ONLY to kill streamers, that player should understand that his actions will have consequences. If you target is a popular streamer, you, as a player, should understand that there will be consequences for your actions.
---
If you target the streamer...he will target you. And because you are a nobody, that streamer can make your life in Classic miserable.
---
But hey, this is WHAT YOU WANTED....right?
---
Instead of PLAYING the game to enjoy it, you are doing it to snipe streamers. More power to you. I am not going to tell you how to play your game.
---
Just don't expect to have a nice Classic experience if you choose a certain path.
---
And if you think your guild idea will fly, you are delusional. 99.99999% of the Classic players are SANE.
---
Snipe-streamers aren't SANE...at all.
---
German is never the best thing about anything.
---
maybe its the best in a phrase like
---
"we kicked the germans out of france"
---
Nah dude, Southshore/tarren milk was always a hotspot for world PvP on my server. Even with BG
---
I watched some girls stream LoL once, every time she got killed she flamed everyone and their gran for being "stream sniped". It was very entertaining to watch someone just freak out like that while knowing for a fact it's all in their head.
---
Hi, /u/Strike1delta
---
anyone knows if the view distance stayed like this during vanilla and if yes, is it now different in classic beta?
---
You don’t have to level to level 60 as a Resto, you can easily learn the basics of Shaman healing while leveling in another spec.
---
Shaman healing is not hard science either, spam Chain heal when you are not dropping Totems, try to use consumables so you won’t go OOM. It’s surprisingly fun though.
---
I remember getting some of these piece in Strat, the day I hit 60. Meeeeeemorieeeeessssssss
---
Objevtively you can't hide this very well in a game like WoW.
---
Server name can be looked publically and location is easy to spot.
---
What a streamer can do though is A) Roll on a pve server for less griefing B) Accept this comes with the job.
---
The old guy telling the young guy "your not my dad" cracked me up
---
Never mind the 100k+ unique accounts on Nostalrius alone, the Nostalrius team who actually met with Blizzard and actually reverse engineered vanilla WoW and open sourced it, countless private server teams who found out which rules work best in vanilla wow, that former Blizzard employee who took those 100 thousand signatures *in print* and dumped them in Blizzard's office, the individuals who actually signed the petition, or the guy who had the guts to ask Blizzard about vanilla servers at the actual Blizzcon.
---
Blizzard was against vanilla WoW for the longest time and the streamers were eating the "rose tinted glasses" rhetoric up and spreading it. "ooh it's gonna be a waste of resources yadayada".
---
The private server initiatives have always been purely grassroots. You can't take that away just because some dude with a fancy BFA title noticed when private server shutdowns made the news.
---
Sodaploppin surely did a lot by doing absolutely nothing and now he wants to change the game because he is afraid of a little ganking. Like wtf. That just goes to show that he has absolutely zero idea about what classic wow is about.
---
the amount of retards in the comments defending the streamers lmao
---
this will be abused by streamers and when try to fight back you ll be banned for tryng to touch blizzards display pets
---
SO DO IT, HUNT THEM, DEATHLIST THE BLACKLISTERS
---
Thanks for your input! Another question, for leveling, sword and board or 2h. I saw kargoz video on earthbind kiting and there is a less than 0 chance I'm doing that shit for 4+ days of game time.
---
I agree with you
---
I love watching Soda, he's very cool and genuine guy and I doubt he would intentionally blacklist someone as a powermove, just to fuck over the person. That said, there's no possibility to tell if a person is stream sniping or not, unless it is really fucking obvious. It is too much power in a hands of one person, especially if you won't be able to tell for sure who's trying to fuck over you and who just happened to be at the same place with you in that moment.
---
Braindead kids who want to fuck over a streamer will do this anyway. You can create fresh character after all. This blacklist won't resolve stream sniping problem, it will only escalate it to make it more hostile towards a streamer.
---
bout tree fiddy

This is spectacular. Well done memer, well done.

You must be new here :D
---
Never mind the 100k+ unique accounts on that famous private server alone, the team of said server who actually met with Blizzard and actually reverse engineered vanilla WoW and open sourced it, countless private server teams who found out which rules work best in vanilla wow, that former Blizzard employee who took those 100 thousand signatures *in print* and dumped them in Blizzard's office, the individuals who actually signed the petition, or the guy who had the guts to ask Blizzard about vanilla servers at the actual Blizzcon.
---
The idea of having an exact location of the enemy faction is ridiculous. But if you need to use that in order to kill people, accept the consequences! :)
---
Yes, back in the day when Starcraft 2 was the most popular thing on twitch stream sniping was indeed regarded as cheating. For some reason now though a lot people seem to think that it isn't.
---
No no no, obviously you are mentally challenged if you can't tell the difference I am saying to you. I am saying if you are the ganker, and you think "HURR DURR ASMONGOLD! LETS FOLLOW HIM ON STREAM AND KILL HIM FOR HOURS." you are lame. Now if you find some random scrub that pisses you off or you are enjoying camping him for other reasons then that just makes you an asshole. It doesn't make you lame. I don't think streamers should be able to avoid getting camped, I think them getting camped BECAUSE they are streamers is the lame part.
---
And beg for subs and donations every sentence you string together.

Yes it is a softcap but there have been testing in the warrior discord which are very valid

Yes, I am.
---
Neither one was named Xxlegolasxx.
---
&gt;If anything will kill classic it wont be streamers, but it will be the toxic cesspool of a community that is shaping around hating streamers to the extent of condoning streamsnipers.
---
Yet being toxic and surrounding yourself with others of the same ilk is kind of the only thing streamers do.  Kind of hypocritical of them to whine when they're on the receiving end of it.
---
Not sure if you are insulting me or just making an observation so yeah i might be new here :)
---
We used to play a lot of split screen, 2v2 multiplayer Goldeneye when I was a kid. We covered a window screen with cardboard and taped it against the TV, dividing it down the middle so we couldn't peak at each other's portion of the screen.
---
It's up to the streamers to find a solution to their problem. If bitching and moaning and making Blacklists is it? Cool, hope it works out for them. Imagine playing Poker and choosing to put your cards down face side up and bitching about people looking at your cards.
---
Calm down, it’s only a commercial
---
Streamsnipers are bigger attention whores than streamers.
---
welcome to class diversity in an mmo. its a wonderful thing.
---
Not who you are replying to but wanted to point out you have it backwards. In vanilla PvE servers, you could not be attacked without being flagged anywhere with the following exeptions:
---
Enemy capital cities
---
Gurubashi Arena
---
Battlegrounds
---
Places like Westfall and Barrens were marked as alliance or horde territory but this was functionally meaningless.
---
Yeah and they’re wrong because that isn’t what the game is supposed to be out remember? We talked about this already 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
But would those thousands have showed their opinions without a popular video?
---
Stream sniping is akin to trolling and even though in classic you get gank squads stream sniping is a whole different thing. In other games they have banned other players for stream sniping.
---
I'm not saying sodas idea is the right punishment but stream sniping is not hunting it's just being the biggest dick just to get your 15 seconds of fame. 
---
Blizzard I would hope will probably monitor this and give appropriate action to players that continually stream snipe.
---
Ubrs, lbrs, brd off the top of my head MIGHT have some mobs and also any dragonkin mobs might have fire resistance if they are fire dragonkin
---
So you're just making this post to call streamers "fake celebs" and prove how hive minded this Reddit is to streamer jealousy
---
It is, but at the high end threat generation is more important than avoidance
---
He really shot himself in the foot with this one. His blacklist idea won't work and he just pissed off a lot of vindictive hateful people that will quite literally waste their life to try and kill him in the game.
---
Would probably take 10 seconds figuring out the name or be leaked from other streamers who dont have names hidden.
---

Good point, is there something easier like an instant 60 pserver where you can get TF?
---
I bet most of you who played in Vanilla and lurked around warcraftmovies.com back then remembers those epic videos he made. 
---
His videos are still could be watched at the same [place](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/pv.php?t=3&amp;l=Urge) it was 13 years ago.
---
What separated him from the rest PvP videos out there at the time was an insane video editing skill and amazing music taste. In fact his work inspired people like myself so much that we took the video editing / multimedia career paths. 
---
I even wrote to the guy years ago, apparently he is still making music with a name of dyF1.6b and [sµbkult](https://soundcloud.com/subkult) if someone is interested.
---
Now prove it... have fun with that m8.
---
You can always go full arcane power and have all the important talents of frost as well.
---
So...what exactly is wrong about a post-Naxx content, not INSTEAD TBC, but in the same time with TBC?
---
Because I think you didn't understood what I was saying, and you clearly didn't read my post.
---
The Classic communities will be merged and remerged, destroying the community.
---
That realm with 1500-3000 people won't be alive AT ALL, because those 1500-300 people will come from a dozen Classic realms, after 2 years of playing with OTHER people.
---
Have you EVER experienced a realm merge in Vanilla? Because I did, and it was a disaster. And we survived only because TBC was announced.
---
Now, imagine a Classic realm being merged again and again, because the loss of players will be massive...AND THERE IS NOTHING in the future for us.
---
Congrats on 200k man! Your channel has grown massively, as it should considering the sheer quality you put out. Great video as always.
---
There is enough control in gaming and life now a days can we not use our platform and audience of tens of thousands to promote more fucking controlling.
---
Your idea that Classic will or could sustain it’s population post naxx with no content updates it’s just ridiculous sorry. That’s not how the world works.
---
tl;dr
---
couldnt care less about your pvp etiquette
---
Yeah I'm 27 and I enjoy watching streamers. People like different things. You're trying to make it look as if it is bad, when in reality this is something others enjoy while you don't. 
---
You don't like cereal ? Okay, cool, but I like it. Let's move on
---
Maybe if you had 5 people doing this.
---
We can closet the thread now.
---
I don't care what you think.
---
Except that literally makes no sense. By the time you've farmed 10g, everyone will have made and signed their guild charters. It's a simple mistake by OP, no big deal.
---
Yea, my reaction didn't make sense. I was kinda triggered when I remembered that specific situation which has nothing to do with the topic
---
Nice story , want try play classic with my just married wife , 17aug wedding.
---
Ur wife play wow ?
---
No need for the salt mate.
---
Are they at least making RP servers?
---
Someone told him that and his response was fuck that. He just wants the game to revolve around his ideal view of it and his ideal view of the game is to make hundreds of thousands of dollars streaming it without having to deal with snipers or having to do anything to counter snipers whether that be stream delay or hiring people in game.
---
and how are you sure he does not use an addon for it? there was no boarders around the party frame either....

If the layer size was correct it wouldn't be any different to launch. If I was on a layer with 2000~ people it still will be same as launchday (if launchday also has 2000~ people layers).

Where is the line? Where does preferential treatment end in terms of WPVP?
---
I’m alliance and a horde wants my rare nodes or spawns. He happens to be a famous streamer. Am I and my friend not allowed to kill him repeatedly because he chose to invest more of his life into the game than me?
---
pretty sure soda doesn't complain about the people killing once, or even corpse camping 1-2 times. if you watched summit stream for example, there were people chasing him down for 5 hours while he was underleveld, just killing him nonstop. soda and cdew and others went to help protect him and the snipers would res and just run at summit trying to kill him before dying.
---
you can't really call this normal pvp with a straight face. i don't think anyone is saying you shouldn't be able to attack someone you see on a pvp server, but 24/7 camping using stream information to find your target is not the same, that's grief territory.
---
Oh, I have no doubt. I'm rolling hunter this time around and I'd bid my house worth in dkp to be reunited with my true love again. Imagine all the salty warriors and Paladins! I guess I'll settle for zinrokh though, that seems a more realistic goal. A man can dream though!

There was a hunter in the top guild on my server that managed to get an Ashkandi, luckily not until after I had mine though so there was no salt from me.
---
Wow, I have to say your reaction is quite emotional. Almost too emotional to not be a  personal thing, lol.
---
1. Announce on X date, all realms will be pushed to TBC.
---
2. Allow the small minority of Vanilla-only players on all these realms to transfer (for free) to a few new servers that will never have TBC.
---
3. X date rolls around, transfers to the Vanilla-only realms are now blocked, but those on the Vanilla-only realms that decide they want TBC can pay to transfer back.
---
good bot
---
Now you're just fucking with us.
---
Not true your basically using a rader hack. Different method send result, I care about the result when playing the game.
---
Depends on the raid and how "hardcore" they are. But in general shaman is better known in raids for being supportive healer.
---
Yeah, RP, PvP or PvE.
---
Is it fix now ?
---
No proof it’s the same individual.
---
more of his vids can be found here https://www.youtube.com/user/urgeOFflesh/videos
---
Sorry to inform you but no salt here. The reactions here shows pretty well who have had overdose of salt just because someone didn't get angry of "mistake" in a meme.
---
Of course
---
Lol did someone hurt your feelings or something? This sub is relatively tame compared to most. Seems to me like you’re just overly sensitive.
---
soda is a trash backpedaller player, if you want to watch a good druid check out stormlingx, hes the guy that soda "learned" everything from vanilla druids
---
Are primarily using Wanda and deranked smite to kill with then?
---
&gt; Wait so do you actually do this? Do you think this is actually okay? 
---
It is okay.
---
&gt;  this is cheating, straight up 
---
No it isn't.
---
&gt; I cannot fucking believe that this is actually part of you whole fucking argument, you're not even saying that he might blacklist people that don't deserve it, you're saying that you're entitled to stream snipe him. 
---
Your whole argument is defending a player broadcasting his entire location to the world, and then wondering why people take advantage of it. It's a game, sometimes peoples fun is to make misery on others. That is life.
---
&gt; This shit is insane, never would've thought that part of the wow classic experience was to feel entitled to cheat in order to ruin other people's experiences. 
---
It's not cheating though really, is it?
---
&gt; this is the most retarded post I've ever read in a while. 
---
 this is the most retarded post I've ever read in a while.
---
On the internet?! What a nightmare!!!
---
You salt af boii
---
Somebody thoucha my skegget!
---
Of course! nbd :)
---
imagine defending carlos maza lmao
---
About what exactly? Because you people are so easily triggered? Sorry but i am having a blast here.
---
This seems to be the point many people are missing. You shouldn't get blacklisted because some egotistical zoomer is having a bad day making millions and you get caught in the whirlwind for harmlessly playing the game.
---
Gankster
---
"you people" how you know I'm black through Reddit?
---
Their new faction allied race are upright trolls which can be paladins. Mag'har are brown orcs. Monks came in with MOP and are basically kungfu mixed with some spiritual magic.

^(Tee hee)
---
Of couse its acceptable. Information is available in the internet.
---
Get a nice gauge on how many people are going to be spamming log in come launch day.
---
What’s the difference, Edgysan-San?
---
Mate you’re comparing Osama to Sodapoppin. Saying they deserve to be streamsniped because they have a lot of benefits streaming is plain nonsense, if you are justifying streamsniping you are doing it out of jealousy. Sure if streamers really really wanted to win, they would stop streaming in order to not get sniped. However I enjoy watching high skill players in competitive environments, and sniping someone to get an advantage isn’t competitive, it’s plain cheating.
---
PvP and PvE servers don't have seperate rules, so it's irrelevant.  You chose to restrict yourself when you made your server choice.  Blizzard isn't going to help you with that unless it's same faction harassment.
---
By saying he's griefing, you're saying he should be banned.  Griefing is a bannable offense outlined in the ToS as I already told you.  So you're going to have to pick a new fun word to call people you don't like besides griefer if we're going to have a serious discussion.  It's also good you didn't bother reporting him because nothing would have come of that.  
---
Players should be encouraged to play a video game (product they paid for) any way they want within the guidelines of the ToS.  "This behavior shouldn't be encouraged" stance is something you're just going to have to drop.  You're not going to tell me, or anyone else how they can spend their time.  Swallow that pill now, it'll save you trouble later.  No one is breaking the rules, you just don't like the game.
---
Now the fact that you'd misquote the ToS to me like I don't know at this point in the conversation was fairly rude, but I'll roll with the punches.  
---
&gt;griefing, as defined by blizzard's code of conduct, is anything that detracts from a players enjoyment and is nor acceptable.
---
The ToS absolutely DOES NOT say griefing is behavior that you don't enjoy, and in fact never mentions player enjoyment anywhere in the ToS.
---
"Conduct intended to unreasonably undermine and disrupt the Game experience of others" is the catch all that you were trying to reference.  You're confusing "things I don't like" with "things that prevent gameplay."  
---
If I drop an inferno in town and kill all of the quest NPCs and low level players, you must think I've disrupted the gameplay of others, and that's griefing and bannable!  You'd be absolutely wrong.
---
If I kill mobs you were after for a quest, I must be undermining your game experience!
---
So here's what you're not understanding, these are PvP issues.  They aren't disrupting gameplay, they ARE the gameplay.  The other faction killing you on sight, EVERY TIME they see you, is the gameplay.  Camping is 100% allowed, always has been.  It's only targeted if you're not killing anyone else, but streamers ruin that because they're never alone.
---
Streamers are going to have a group with them at all times, if they get camped they'll call their guild members to help.  That's not harassment, that's group PvP.  That's PvP server culture.  Period.
---
Old school runescape did it first
---
I am sorry to inform you but you might be a racist. By "you people" i ment redditors. Didn't know i speak with a mongoloid and there would be a need to specify that.
---
Lol who cares? This one guy in a tobe with a commie emblem is going to ruin wow classic? Yea, I'm sure a streamer I've never heard of is going to ruin wow classic.
---
True. Still, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that what we see in a relatively recent video lines up with the post from August 2018.
---
Although i do agree with you in the sense that a naga is great for an MMO, in fps games i feel like your reaction time on your thumb is too slow in comparison to keyboard in switching weps etc.
---
Here's the problem:
---
This subreddit is dedicated to WoW Classic. What state is WoW classic in? Beta. How many people are in the beta? Not many. This means the majority of players on this subreddit won't be able to discuss their own experience playing the game. What does that leave us with discussing? The same "which class should I play" posts we've had since november 2017? Streamer content is the only fresh content that's in large enough quantities that it can be discussed continuosly.
---
Notice how whenever there's a stress test, streamers suddenly get a lot less place to be discussed, because people get to play the game themselves and talk about their own experience.
---
This is going to remain a sub with a heavy focus on streamers untill release, and at that point you should expect things to go back more to discussing the game instead, but right now people obsessed with the game have only one thing to discuss and obviously they are going to discuss it.
---
Saltier than a sardine.
---
There's no such thing as a Classic balance team and there never will be.
---
Pretty sure Sco has said Method isn't going hard on classic. Methodjosh had also stated hes probably playing with Esfand which will be a casual ish guild.
---
There are guilds of players who've been playing on private servers for years. All of which have perfected leveling routes and know all bosses like the back of their hands.
---
truly something a succesful person would say
---
Hpally healer, so in the 4 wings i just need stay alive. In sapphiron and KT extra mana comes in handy. Especially sapphiron is quite rough without it.
---
When someone claims they are special, they are entitled to be an asshole, and that the rules do not apply to them, hitting them in the face with reality is not bullying.
---
Wow. That was awesome. I hope you make more Classic Machinima!
---
So you find out I'm black and call me a mongoloid? Yeah, IM the racist. Tf does being black have to do with atilla the hun of whatever you speaking on
---
Nah, still having a blast.
---
watch full soda's vod and you will know. but tldr: if someone opens your stream and follows you while you are in stealth, then they are stream snipping. if someone just keepins killing you for ages, it is fine... soda said just that but obviously people enjoy hating on streamers so they took the whole thing out of context
---
Having the original experience is not the point. Yes that is indeed impossible, but it doesn’t mean that classic will not be a fun experience, because it is not the same as 15 years ago.
---
No it wasn't functionally meaningless, it dictates which side has to attack first to make PvP possible. A Horde can not attack first in Westfall.
---
However in STV, either side could attack first to initiate PvP.
---
Quite frankly this whole sub has turned to shit.
---
It's either streamer flame, streamer drama, streamer showoff, REALLY stupid memes or people going way too crazy with "living the sub"... Might honestly be best to unsub from r/classicwow ...
---
Im not for stream sniping or anything, but Sodapoppin seems like a real asshole.
---
Wyrmthalaks trinket was added in 1.10 shouldn't be available till phase 5
---
Even if it’s true, the post themselves say that it’s not perfectly consistent and doesn’t always work because it’s not supposed to work.
---
He might have a contract with Blizz for WoW so by playing the beta he's still playing wow and thus don't have to announce anything.
---
I stopped playing LoL because of the number of times my Mother was raped.
---
You not alone, I know they just kids (I hope in 8-14 year olds) that act like fangirls over pop idols in video games.
---
But I just want to play a game and intentionally pretends I never heard about them and ignore them.
---
Honestly, some of the worst experiences I have had a couple of years ago was that I suddenly got spammed for shit by randoms just because I killed a guy.
---
Ye, there is also no such things as Orcs &amp; Gnomes, but many of us will play a role as one :D
---
No it isn't. I remember that location in Vanilla myself, and all private servers have the same location as the old vanilla movies aswell(with any res)
---
Paladins and plate armor. Do they really? I've seen it mentioned often, that holy paladins were pretty much wearing cloth for the stats. Did this change in later raid tiers or is plate PvP specific or is the dress wearing paladin just an overexaggeration?
---
T1 8pc+torch for maximum memes
---
Not only are you lame, but you are the only mentally challenged one here. The streamer brings it on themselves by streaming their location.
---
They should roll PvE server, more their speed.
---
I was teasing you, certainly not meant as an insult ;-)
---
When did i say you are black? Your reading comprehension is not exactly really good.
---
Not their fault,  but still they are causing it.
---
If Diszi was made into a melee spec like they initially planed, I would play dwarf priest all day every day.
---
Yes it is a consequence of being a popular streamer will mean you have a lot of haters that will want to ruin your experience, but that doesn’t mean that people should tolerate streamsnipers.
---
And that is the issue. That can be interpreted in a lot of ways. Blizz will probably interpret it that way if your siblings play their own characters but if they play your character and grinding bgs with it while you're at work than they will most likely interpret it as "powerleveling".
---
Blizzard appeal system acts on a guilty until proven innocent basis.
---
If they see you grinding bgs for 16 hours a day than the "it's my siblings, bro"-line is not gonna cut it. It will most likely be classed as a "power leveling" scenario.
---
The second clause is purposely fuzzy around the terms of power leveling specifically for these kinds of scenarios
---
&gt;I'm going to terrorize lowbies on my server :)
---
Why? It's not fun if it's not a challenge.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed world pvp. I was even an attempted KoS target, rarely killed but I never engaged first. People jumped me and I'd kill them (I started playing in 2005, when warlocks were no longer free HKs). If your auto attack does more damage than someone has health, how is that fun if you're in no immediate danger?
---
Bruh you're being deliberately ignorant.
---
"This is not about post-Naxx content (or Classic+) vs TBC. This is about the popular opinion of character copy option from Classic to TBC, as a way to preserve Classic, and give players the opportunity to replay TBC..."
---
"...I just can't see Classic surviving 2 years after its release, without post-Naxx content."
---
Mhmm.
---
This addon is a good example of what killed WoW Vanilla. Spoon-fed players who cannot bother to think for themselves.
---
Few people are going to trust you and invite you to a guild/raid if you don't have basic spells when you do dungeon with them. I read comment in this thread and I see people recommending to not pick Mind Control or Tranquility... this is madness, you are not saving any meaningful gold by doing this while losing massive knowledge about the game.
---
Funny how all these streamers say they aren't privileged. fuck off , they are all snowflakes. go play on a pve server cry babies
---
It only cost 10s my guy, the meme is in error
---
90% of decent guilds will clear the content on day one, vanilla raiding just isn't that hard.
---
Frankly, I don't care.
---
I really wish you were right.
---
Needs a classic countdown timer
---
Literally against tos of twitch and he would get banned from twitch he must let his viewers know if he is sponsored to play a game or not
---
found the sheep, bullying lmao he can deal with that, he’s been 10x more toxic back in the days.
---
Streamere say where they are. Then people go kill them. I genuinely cannot understand what the issue is?
---
I wish. She played back in BC for a little bit when an ex husband of hers convinced her to play.  But she only made it to like lvl 35 or something. I have a very slim chance of convincing her to play, but I highly doubt she would even get to raid content. She's not a gamer and probably would show no interest in it.  After all, we gave a 2yo daughter who needs a lot of attention. Neglecting her for hours on end, together, is most likely out of the question. Only really have the ability to let one play, naturally being me. :/
---
&gt;spoiled, no culture, room dwellers.
---
You literally just described this sub
---
You are not even trying at this point.
---
Ppl who dig through post histories are just messed in the head tbh. Like get a life lol. What would you do if Reddit was anonymous?
---
Happy cake day!
---
Shiit thats a good idea, i will just block everyone who posts a stream related link
---
You say that, but one of Shroud's Stream Snipers from PUBG (Waduhek) literally launched his streaming career off of sniping shroud, and all he does is say "Wadu" instead of anything tangible.
---
streamers should unironically be banned from any form of rp server.
---
people used to used wow model viewer for stuff like this iirc.
---
You can literally buy a 2nd gen Intel core box from Ebay for 100$ and pop in a GPU for 50$ and run it fine.
---
You are off your rocker.
---
The entire point of layering is to get realms at a stable vanilla-like population. That’s literally the point.
---
Well can't he just play on a PVE server? I get why sitting on totems during duels etc is considered griefing and should not be allowed. But if im in the same zone i want to eliminate competition why shouldn't i? So if i happen to come across the same dude several times during leveling im fucked? This is such a non problem, he could play on a PVE server, he could put on a delay or he could stream for a few hours and then log into another account and play like a normal dude off-stream. 
---
He explicitly said that he likes fucking with lower noobs and camp them for hours, when i tuned into his stream he was corpse camping a priest for taking his node. Should that be reason enough to blacklist himself? The whole concept is retarded. Although i do like the idea of having a contested server with an active PVP meta, streamers vs stream snipers.
---
You might be retarded.
---
The meme here is how easily people can be baited to get triggered. 1 post and nerds are going "bUT mUh SalT".
---
i mean probably an 5th or 6th gen i5($200) and a gtx 970 ($150) should be more than enough. 
---
Also windows &gt; mac
---
So stream sniping only applies to rogues and druids? 
---
I can see where they’re coming from then. But with addons like KOS (if it gets ported) it’s not hard to find stealth classes you’re roaming for
---
I just logged in to write that soda is a whiny bitch.
---
This totally helped. Pooof all streamer topics are gone.
---
Right? imagine also having an entire Army willing to die for you, willing to farm for you, will to do anything you ask.  
---
Good lord I would love PvP as a big streamer, my raid of personal body guards protecting me as i RP walk and /no at people who try to kill me...
---
I dont see how this is a problem.
---
Baron Rivendare's sword! So rare. So wow.
---
Phew. Shame about no RPPvP. But as long as roleplay survives, I'm happy.
---
I really with 99.999% certainty do not think I will get banned. I plan on opening a ticket and explaining my situation to Blizzard to get some reassurance - but its hardly “powerleveling” of any kind, it would be closer to AFKing BG’s cause he is awful at the game.
---
They barely even banned the actual R14 grinders who were definitely sharing accounts with multiple people - playing 24/7
---
Sure it isn’t against the rules to streamsnipe, neither is blacklisting them. My point is that I think that far more people here think getting streamsniped is a reasonable consequence of streaming and is in the nature of things, than someone influential blacklisting people who do such acts.
---
The BENQ XL2720T is not a 144hz monitor, it's 120hz.
---
Your GPU isn't a bottleneck in WoW, it's your CPU, and there isn't a CPU on the market that's going to give you 150 FPS on Ultra settings.
---
If you take asmongold for example, he has around 20,000 subs, according to a few sites on google people who are partnered with twitch typically make anywhere from $2.50 to 3 dollars per sub per month, so asmond is pulling anywhere from $50,000 to $60,000 per month from his subscribers alone, more if you include his adrolls and donations for TTS that he would get. He could also make money other ways by doing advertisement streams and so on, i'm not entirely sure if this is what you're looking for or not.

You’re trying to r/wooosh me, for the dead ones, nice try homie
---
This do look like bc era fan art, kinda hard to tell
---
how is that difficult to understand? if you like the act of killing RANDOM level 15s that's fine, that's part of a PVP Server, but if you're just trying to kill one for the purpose of getting some fame trough his stream / streamsnipe that's bullshit, i don't like soda at all but there's nothing wrong with his 'brain' and that argument, you are obviously the one having issues with your brain if you don't see the difference between those two actions
---
based
---
If we agree that Vanilla pop cap was around ~4.5k, then how is the removal of layering past phase 1 going to result in "vanilla-like" population?
---
Blizzard has stated they will not have huge amount of servers at the start to avoid dead zones, and that individual server's will create multiple instances of themselves with "vanilla pop caps". So *what* happens when layering goes away?
---
But even if it's not 100% consistent, that still does not mean "You won't be doing any reck-bombs in PvP" since it'll eventually work if you try hard enough.
---
And even if it's not true, you still can duel with someone and get forced crits from abilities/legit crits and go reck bomb someone in the wilderness. So, again "You won't be doing any reck-bombs in PvP" doesn't seem to be the case
---
well he obviously made point about stealth, when someone rushes across the whole map to find him under the tree in stealth... that THAT is when you can say the person is 100% snipping and should get blacklisted. but he never said it is the ONLY way to find stream snipper but he said that if SOMEONE randomly finds you, it is free-for-all ganking and camping and THAT is fine, BECAUSE he also does that.    
---
also he said that if you stream for so long, you do know when someone is streamsnipping or not, even without the rogue/druid/stealth thing
---
&lt;3 Carebear! &lt;3
---
Streamer that got big with WoW returns to WoW and acts entitled when things don't go his way.
---

---
This isn't a black and white situation like you make it out to be. There are just as many bad players using meta specs. Knowing the mechanics and being reliable are worth more than anything. If your guild has rules about having to play a certain way down to each talent point, then it's fair to criticize. But not everyone who wants to try out a meme spec is out to ruin your day.
---
I hope this is where Blizzard’s Being Deaf And Blind To Everything attitude pays off
---
People believe it is a reasonable consequence, when it isn’t. As people who want the game to be as good as possible we cannot tolerate streamsniping as an acceptable action due to the competitive nature of the game.
---
What streamers were agreeing with Blizzards stance? After the "you think you do, but you dont" fiasco every wow streamer shat all over Blizzard. And streamers having a large platform certainly did help promote classic wow. Bliz only cares about 1 thing, and thats money. Streamers promoting private servers and showing there was an interest in classic servers helped show bliz that money could be made.
---
Try the Konmari method : hold it near your heart and ask "does this race / class bring joy" ? :D
---
Nothing inherently wrong.
---
How their fans interact with things they orbit is where 99% of the issues arise. It varies from streamer to streamer though.
---
the saltiest.
---
you should check out hector
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRAt4c-L0Ts
---
kinda similar darker themes when it came to editing
---
I'm not going to lie, a big reason i'm watching these classic WoW streamers is solely because i am unable to get beta access and play it myself, once it is out i don't see myself watching their content very frequently if at all. Don't get me wrong i like asmon, payo, esfand etc and enjoy their streaming content for the most part. 
---
But once it out i probably will never really watch them again...
---
Forgive me while I trust multiple rank1 titles over your non-professional judgement. You cant just say someone isn't good because you disagree with their opinion.
---
Didnt blizzard say they would block these kind of addons though? so if  everyone makes them aware about it they should be able to do something about them?
---
As a lock you always skill everything because level 40 mount is free
---
It's like I show you all my password to my bank account in if you log in you shut be punished and put in jail for the crime..... How about stop streaming to solve your problem!
---
We get a new “I hate streamers” post every 5 min
---
&gt;It's kinda different. OP doesn't care about the streamer things people are discussing, but he cares that people are constantly discussing it filling up his reddit page. Those are not the same.
---
PvE servers are even worse for a streamer because there's no way to deal with 1 single player deciding to grief in the open world by doing things like mob-tagging, you don't need good gear to do it. It's worse for same faction griefs *and* opposite faction.
---
Getting ganked once or twice isn't going to be the problem for someone like Soda. The problem is when someone commits their entire day(s) to doing *whatever most hinders* your ability to play the game because you're a "internet celebrity". That can of course be done by permanently corpse-camping someone **if** you have the advantage **but** if you don't have the advantage, other methods of stalking/griefing will work better and will most likely be easier to pull off on a PvE server. There's no requirement of outnumbering or outgearing the person you're trying to annoy on a PvE server.
---
I agree. But the problem is that those streamers like to claim they are stream sniped every time they lose. Ninja went as far as calling someone at Epic because of a 'stream sniper' in Fortnite. Thankfully the other guy was streaming (or recording?)  too and could prove his inocence. This is not a streamer only thing, we all do it to some extent, we all blame lag or dumb teammates but rarely do we admit that it was our fault, at least not nearly as many times as the ones that we were just outplayed  the problem is that streamerd are often too entitled like in the ninja example or have an army of followers to start a serverwide witch hunt. While in the case of regular joes like us its just us cursing at the monitor and thats it.
---
Makes sense, perhaps we need a streamer lingo FAQ because stuff easily gets blown out of proportion when people misunderstand the terms and implications
---
It is relevant in the way where they make themselves the voice of the community towards blizzard. These are the people who get invited to the summits and are asked about decisions, the first ones to be informed. They made them selves representatives who we did not choose, so when they say shit that will damage the classic the community actually wants that deserves attention, there needs to be pushback or there is nothing to suggest to blizzard that there is a differing opinion.
---
I am sorry if that is your current situation.
---
Nostalrius team had NOTHING to do with building classic wow, blizzard said so them selves, none of the nostalrius people were hired or anything. There has been private servers for decades yet they didnt bring classic wow. The difference now was the lound voice of the community WITH the platform of the content creators. Stop beeing delusional just for the sake of hating on streamers lol this is pathetic.
---
Yes you can level resto. Slower dmg but less downtime. Keep lightning shield up and wf melee mobs down uses very little mana and can grind without stopping. Faster to go enhance till 40ish then swap ele till 60 thou. At 60 resto is fine for grinding just collect spell power gear.
---
Shamans are not the most mana efficient healers but they bring the best buff and have the highest HPS output. You will end up with multiple gear sets for short burst fights and long mana conservative fights.
---
You will want to bind every totem except sentry totem. You will rarely use most of them but you will need to drop it asap when you do. Dont want to let a hunter free fire on you while your searching for windwall totem.
---
Dont pick mage just for the water, it only helps half the time (get lvl 25 water spell at 30, only good till you can buy lvl 35 vendor water). If you rather dps raids than heal, mage is a great pick. Probably the most well rounded vanilla class. Sham is my favorite thou. GL.
---
Another different between Vanilla and WoW Classic: Vanilla did not have streamers and it was perfect.
---
This and also the fact that your games becomes your job.
---
Not perticular excited about a new big game title? well tough luck, your paycheck will diminish if you dont play it.
---
I'll take the freedom of playing what i want, when i want any day over the streaming job.
---
You are heavily undervaluing the skillset people need and develop to entertain thousands of different people for hours every day. There is no way a successful streamer couldnt land a job in the entertaining sector.
---
Hunter hands down
---
&gt; there isn't a CPU on the market that's going to give you 150 FPS on Ultra settings 
---
Am I missing something? You're telling me an i9 and 2080ti won't get 150fps in *Classic WoW* on ultra? I'm rocking a 1080ti and a 4790k (which is a botteneck itself) and I get a consistent 144+ on high settings.
---
I don’t see how anything they do is as toxic as blatantly accepting streamsniping (aka cheating) as a reasonable way of getting an edge on someone.
---
This is 2005? Looks like it's the 80s.
---
Streaming in BC? Were you looking through their window?
---
Hey, that's one way to avoid stream sniping. At least he doesn't go on a 10 minute rant on why the guy that killed him should be banned.
---
Blizzard of corse will do nothing about it
---
It’s a solid set to start pvping in if you don’t raid. Decent Stamina and Agility
---
Yes that's the plan smite opener into wand. Then using Mindblast/HolyFire as openers into wanding till 40. Might end up going a more aggressive mindflay route instead in the 30's but haven't decided yet.  
---
I plan to go Tailoring/Enchanting so I'll be grinding humanoids probably for linen to funnel to tailoring to funnel to enchanting to rush to 10 to make myself a Lesser Wand asap.  
---
Generally smite till 10, then I get mindblast. If I get my wand then MBlast opener into wanding. Some people like opening with Holy Fire into a mindblast when you get your first few ranks of holy fire. It's very strong but long cast time can be annoying. Id only ever use it as an opener since pushback is too high.
---
Said something about cancer in my eyesocket I think...
---
yep. to a man.
---
i always hated the fact that my warrior never got AssCandy back in vanilla.
---
dude chill you're just a wow streamer, not a god damn pop star
---
Shit, just how little fame it takes to get inside someone's head
---
At this point streaming games have become a norm and youre fighting thousands of other channels for exposure.
---
The big streamers today have done this for a long long time.
---
You wanna make it as a living you gotta be creative, stand out from the crowd.
---
Not trying to sound edgy or elitist but that set (minus the chest) looks like ten times better than modern sets. It’s just so classy.
---
Holy fuck...
---
&gt;One of the beautiful things of the Blizzard of days gone by, is that they didn't give a flying fart about all the whine on the internet. I miss those days.
---
You and me both.
---
If he was genuinely excited about it he'd play it off stream. He clearly wants the money from streaming this game. He knows he doesn't need to broadcast his whole life but the more time he's offline is potential money he is not making which is all he cares about.
---
You are the one who is stupid, this is a thread about Sodapopping and blacklisting, you mentioned Grimmz and H1Z1, this is not the H1Z1 subreddit so i would ASSUME that the grimms and h1z1 talk related to the topic at hand, sodapoppin and blacklisting, so i responded. You not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
This guy was actually on my server. In one of the screen shots they refer to another guy named BAS, there's a whole huge server lore story to that guy, but he was in Nurfed, and then Months Behind, I knew all those guys and they have a really epic history. Months behind ninja'd our guilds lock out in bwl, we had half cleared it and were working on AQ40 at the time. I knew that name was familiar, angwe. So funny.
---
No clue why I haven't thought of this before tbh..
---
Also Troll warrior is alpha AF my dude.
---
Anybody who wants to put in the time and effort can clear Naxx.
---
Actually Soda mentions in this video that the guy who trolled the Horde Duel tournament should of been banned on the spot.
---
Dudes a fucking narcissist.
---
Layering will most likely be disabled by the 3 month mark. So stop worrying.
---
Eskeegeeeet !!!
---
A few weeks ago I made my own hunter bis lists, including a PVP one.
---
If you want to be full mail (for PVP it's important) and as long we're speaking phase 1 dungeon loot, Beastalker set is certainly not laughable, a few pieces are even bis.
---
I use a 650ti 2gb to run BFA. It’s not great but it works. I’m thinking classic won’t be an issue
---
If this is the attitude Soda and other streamers will have, then I say: "Fuck em!"    
---
Don't watch their stream, kick them from parties you lead, spread the word.
---
Layering will probably never "go away" like you said the layers kick in to keep zones to a vanilla pop cap, if the servers begin to get lower pop the layers simply won't kick in.
---
This guy is such a whiny bitch.
---
On a private server about a week ago I killed was camping a lvl 8 twink who was griefing in Trisfal glades. After a couple deaths he messaged me from a lvl 1 horde character like. “ WeirdChamp” I was confused at first but after I asked if he was talking to me on twitch emotes he said some other emote and logged. Was legit wild.
---
you cannot please everyone, esp here... people seem to not read the whole paragraph of text, let alone do some research. jumping hate trains is the nothing new. you can see how many thousands of upvotes gets a post that is based on lies and simple google will give you the truth in 2seconds, but people are lazy
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Learn to comprehend what you read. " XD "
---
You can cut the „probably“ in the post
---
not really but it looks good compared to the rest of vanilla
---
Realistically, would you even have to stream snipe? If you want to one up a streamer by killing/ganking them, you just need to log in and ask in /world? Chances are that people have run accross them and their 'horde' of followers, so you can just travel there, look them up in the zone and do them in.
---
Looking at their stream while hating and ganking them seems to be rather ... umm .. dunno, double standard?
---
I tried to farm the shoulders for that set by running LBRS for weeks. It never dropped.
---
People do not seem to understand what I'm asking at all, actually.
---
Is playing on a server with 25k population that also has cross-realm battlegrounds as default something you think can develop a close-knit community where reputation matters?
---
Live poker tournaments show each players hands to the audience, imagine a player in that tournament went on the livestream to see his opponents hands. He would be banned for life from any poker tournament at the minimum.
---
Your conversational style is difficult to want to engage with. Who said something was wrong with post-Naxx content? After I do you the honor of reading your extremely long post I get accused of "clearly not reading" it? Meh. Have a good one buddy.
---
Is there a level requirement for transmogging?
---
Thing is, the guys who are viewed less also have less exposure to streamsniping just as they have less exposure to streamer benefits. The more people you have watching you, the higher the likelihood one of them is gonna do dumb shit for attention. For that reason, I'd expect them to have different views on the subject.
---
Well pick your audience I guess.. If you asked in a streamers chat which argument they thought was more acceptable than the other, you'd get a different answer.
---
How so? By streaming? Aren't the people that are causing it, causing it?
---
&gt; So, again "You won't be doing any reck-bombs in PvP" doesn't seem to be the case
---
I mean, if you want to be that annoyingly pedantic guy, then sure. 
---
But it’s like telling people that they can rely on Windfury proccing over and over on itself to one-shot people in BGs. It’s ultimately unrealistic and iffy on whether it’s exploiting or not.
---
Why do humans have 2 for each sex?
---
Perdition's Blade.
---
I used to have to whisper on Ventrilo when I was a kid in late-night raids because if my grandad heard me, he'd go out of his bedroom and unplug the modem.
---
We kill Ragnaros (I think this was my 4th kill with the guild), he drops the dagger, and I forget myself. They're deciding loot and then everything goes quiet, I disconnect from everything.
---
The main stairs were squeaky as fuck, there's no way I'd get down them. So I run across the upstairs, out onto the deck, jump down, nearly breaking my arm, go through the back porch door, and quietly plug the modem back in.
---
But now I have no way back upstairs, so I have to risk it. I'm halfway up the stairs when my grandad's voice booms out. I end up begging him to "let me send this email to my teacher I was supposed to send earlier and then you can punish me all you want".
---
I get upstairs, back online, and they immediately loot Perdition's Blade to me. I type "thanks, but my grandad is gonna kill me, I'll see you all tomorrow" and logoff.
---
Spent all day at school staring at the clock, waiting until I could get home and equip that fucking dagger.
---
Now this... does put a smile on my face
---
Not sure what's your problem now, but if you make a post about a topic in a publicly accessible forum, and expect not to be questioned or criticized, you haven't been on the internet for long.
---
The simple solution would be to not play on the "streamer server". I mean they (the major ones) are even making it extra easy for you by going out of their way to tell you which server they will all be playing on. This information will obviously be going up on the front page of this subreddit come Classic launch, just avoid the server(s) on that list.
---
OP is an important person you know.
---
Hey! Thanks for the reply.. How would this processer work: '2.5GHz dual-core 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz' 
---
I'm thinking of using an eGPU.. That way my main machine will still be a regular macbook... Ill just get an upgrade in CPU! And then in the future i can always upgrade the eGPU card.. What do you think?
---
This streamer hate thing happens constantly. It literally never effects the streamer in the slightest, it's just another day for them.
---
I heard someone say it best, the benefits of having a high viewer count far outweighs the negative.
---
Yeah I messed up ! Meaning's still the same :')
---
Yeah I messed up ! Meaning's still the same tho :')
---
What have people making youtube videos got to do with this sub? I've never made a youtube video in my life.

To fully make use of the 120hz screen? That seems pretty cheap!
---
It is also worth noting that depending where you are that the eula might be governed under a different legal entity than your guardianship and it might not be recognised in the first mentioned country/state
---
I mean, Who the fuck even is this dude. His opinions arent valued.
---
Neither is ninja looting with a party of friends.
---
Always one guy from a pserver
---
Many games ban for streamsniping because it is essentially cheating. Just because you dropped your wallet doesn't mean it's ok to take everything from it.
---
It's already confirmed that layering will be removed, at the latest, when we transition to the first content Phase (DM), regardless of population concerns.
---
Can you fill me in a bit since i really only started classic right when BC was released, but don't servers have populations caps? I remember when i was joining i was recommended a server to play on, and many of the other servers were full if i'm remembering correctly. So there will really only be a limited amount of people per server
---
&gt; Your whole argument is defending a player broadcasting his entire location to the world
---
Irrelevant. Looking at someone else's screen is cheating. We've known this shit since we were children. Don't imply that because it is easy in this particular case to cheat, it is okay to do so. It is not, in a perfect world stream snipers would be punished.
---
&gt; wondering why people take advantage of it
---
People always cheat, I'm not wondering why they're cheating, I'm condemning them.
---
&gt; It's a game, sometimes peoples fun is to make misery on others. That is life.
---
Lmao, how is this not you trying to rationalize their behavior because you know it's wrong?
---
It's fucking cheating, straight up, you're literally looking at the other dude to see where he is, that is info you wouldn't get inside the game, you're going out of your way to cheat.
---
So... I NEVER played on the alliance side... ever.
---
And now with classic rolling out i REALLY want to play a Gnome Warrior.
---
I mostly play PvP... 
---
Alliance...
---
Gnome...
---
Warrior...
---
Is something wrong with me? I mean I really want a "new" experience. I lvled an undead warrior once in some pandaria time i think. But now... I can see "Escape artist" as a brilliant racial vs mages and druids. + engineering racial + seeing a little guy in full plates with a little 2h sword makes me giggle. I really think I will roll alliance gnome warrior for PvP.
---
Easy solution, turn it around.
---
To be on the blacklist will just be like a badge of honor instead. Nobody except his "hivemind" community is going to give a crap about streamers anyway.
---
fuck fuck fuck
---
Are you kidding me? Playing same game 8 hours a day for months? And not the game you want, but, like, Hearthstone. Hearthstone 8 hours a day for 3 years? This repetitive shit is literally like working unskilled manual labor, except the pay is insane.
---
Appreciate the help. Leaning towards druid even more so now... I also plan in leveling with my mage buddy. Druid seems to combo better with a mage than pally does.
---
You got downvoted but this is legit the reason, my friend get banned on Xbox every now and then for the most mundane shit.
---
I try my best to be non-toxic and helpful when I play Overwatch and even my account got banned because someone was spamming me, calling me trash - saying “you wouldn’t join party cause your scared of us”  I responded “what are you fucking 9?” and my account got silenced.
---
If you can’t win in these games, if your just going to cop a silence for dishing it back - why even talk in the first place?
---
Are they actually good healers or only Hibernate bots for real healers?
---
That's pure cringe
---
Fake, creep has full mana...

I was today years old when I got to know that books are that old..
---
That's part of the meme, all weapons are hunter weapons and they're very confused about it,.
---
Moot point, like this thread.
---
Is there any apsects of healing druids are not viable at?
---
So dungeons, raiding, pvp, wpvp, farming, soloing?
---
And big of a expense is respecing generally?
---
&gt;Im gonna throw you a "hypothetical"
---
Sorry for the offtopic, but you aren't by any chance a reader of BlackLibrary novels about the Ultramarines, specifically the Horus-Heresy novels?
---
You should have just told him “ you can open the combat log and ignore it stupid”
---
Okay, and? What has that got to do with stream sniping?
---
Well i was incliding to those videos that are posted in this channel time to time about streamers and drama. Not precisely towarded to any specific person. Just generally to the "people"
---
This is pretty much the only place I've seen people not thinking it's cheating and being the opposite and thinking they deserve it. It's nothing but this weird blind hate. And then they think all streamers are like Soda or Asmon and making bank when most streamers are literally not making any money.
---
No way they would do it now
---
Why do you watch football man, just play it yourself
---
I hope it's not viable or we will have even more paladins than the actual polls show :s
---
Imo if they somehow made profs relevant and put mats from newest content in zones like hillsbrad foothills they would have ton of people fighting over them. Biggest problem in retail wow are useless profesions. Without them people have no intrest in leaving major cities. You just travel from bank to ah to raid/dung enterance
---
kill him 1 one more time, with my best regards ! :)
---
VanQueef was so close! Such a missed opportunity
---
I think once classic releases most ppl will just use wowhead etc. for information they need. The only reason any youtube guide or stream is hyped up atm is cuz thats all we got if we wanna see what classic will be like.
---
I think most streamers knows this and are trying to make bank now on the fact no a lot of ppl have beta access.
---
Is druid tanking a private server thing or will we see some druid tanks in the raiding scene?  Do they rely on world buffs too much?  I don't remember a single druid raid tank from back in the day.
---
I'm so glad all these Streamer-Scrubs are Americans.
---
&gt;And seriously people, what is wrong with you? Do you wake up in the morning asking yourself:  
---
&gt;"Good morning! Now then, what can I worry about today to make my life miserable?"
---
I ask myself the exactly same thing every time I check this reddit. The amount of worry is ... frightening.
---
Oh no, I'm not being tolerated.  I broke OPs imaginary rules!
---
I feel like he actually dropped this /s
---
Only uses the bow for pulls
---
LOL that makes me sad, I used to use Sorry often because i’d forget to play for 40+ seconds until the timer tic’d down.
---
Too late to the party but:
---
Wait a few hours or even a day to start playing Classic WOW! Let all streamers and their collective hivemind of players pick their servers and then chose a server WITHOUT them.
---
This my personal opinion but NOTHING good can come out of you playing on their server(s)...unless you are part of their group and even then I have my doubts.
---
Those servers will have a massive spam on chat, finding groups and activities will always be strange, the peak hours wont be organic as it will mostly depend if the streamer is playing or not, the economy will be a mess, the list goes on and on...and the worst of all, if a popular streamer decides to quit Classic WoW for wtv reason, you can bet that a good chunk of his followers will quit in the same second, which can make a medium decent size server become low pop in a matter of days...
---
Just my 2 cents about all this.
---
Are you retarded or what's the deal?
---
I hope there's a guild on his realm dedicated to streamsniping him, would be amazing.
---
I hope so. Cus I cba to lvl 30+ and then figure out that streamers are on my server.
---
But if you're alliance and you're ganking Sodapoppin who's horde how does a blacklist affect you? You couldn't play with those people anyway.
---
It was a deliberately absurd comparison. Why would anyone willingly share their location when they are trying to win a competition (or war) and not lose (or die)???
---
It's absolutely NOT cheating. They are willingly broadcasting their screen to the world. This isn't some official tournament that's being broadcast by the tourney host. If a woman streams a video of herself dancing naked, she can't claim harassment if thousands of men watch and beat off to it. Streamers CHOOSE to share their screen. That will naturally come with advantages and disadvantages. It's their job to deal with it. Not mine. This isn't something forced on them. They can stream on a PvE server. They can avoid doing BGs while streaming. They are not in any way morally or contractually obligated to stream any PvP content.
---
And YIKES. You arguing that my common sense is actually jealousy? That life couldn't be any less appealing. I have a wonderful writing job, make plenty of money, and have a fantastic family. Good god ... I wouldn't want my life to look ANYTHING like most the streamers I've seen. I also wouldn't dream of streaming WoW and bitching if people use that stream to find and kill me. Why? Because I'm not an idiot. I also don't expect the world to cater to my needs and desires. If you need me, I'll be over here enjoying WoW Classic in complete and blissful anonymity.
---
Holy shit. Grow up. You and most these streamers give gamers a bad name. And we wonder there is STILL a stigma around gamers and gaming...
---
This is true. It became ms as we know it in pre patch. It also briefly stacked with ms for 75%. That was fun
---
well if money isnt too much of an issue then go for an  AMD Ryzen 7 2700X &amp;  Nvidia GeForce3 RTX 2060
---
Eyes of the Beast is mandatory and you know it
---
No ones stopping you from buying it, they’re just not recommending it as necessary for levelling efficiency
---
Im more Leman Russ kind of guy
---
I can only shudder at the Dreamfoil/Black Lotus market
---
Exactly. But it might not effect on the viewership, but rather the "presence" they have outside twitch. People dont necessary buy Coca Cola, but they know it as a brand. People dont necesaary sub to Sodapoppin, but they know him, even tho that means they hate him.
---
Something you cant really calculate in numbers. Something far more valuable.
---
In organised PvP, no and yes.
---
In world PvP, absolutely.
---
You have to choose, you can't have short times and close knit community, when servers pops are so small.
---
If server sizes are large, then I can agree with your points, but I played vanilla, I PvP'd in vanilla before cross realm and queues would range from 2 hours to 10mins.
---
Its not as simple as "turn off cross realm kappa omegalul"
---
Not that I do this, or plan on doing this but saying that it is a cheat is bs. There are methods of finding someone's location by using the /who feature, fair enough you will need a toon on the same faction, but if you pair that with a macro /target x, and they become incredibly easy to find. So finding someone is already very simple and available to do in game. While games like fortnite and pubg may survive off streamers wow doesn't. We have less than 10 streamers who can pull more than 15k concurrent viewers
---
And if they weren't streaming, all of it wouldn't happen. Maybe cause is not the right word, but they do support/provide a platform for this behaviour.
---
You're fighting a ghost, who's going to prove anyone was sniping?  Great work champ.
---
All changes just ideas, obviously NO CHANGES support here. ;)
---
* Talent Grim Reach: additionally to increase range, decrease threat of all affliction spells by 10%/20%
---
* Talent Destructive Reach: additionally to increase range, decrease threat of all destruction spells by 10%/20%
---
Additional issue of Locks in PVE is no spell hit talent, but we can leave that as an unique weakness, while threat is really a major problem.
---
* Hunter Pets take 70% less damage from all area of effect damage (pve only, does not affect damage dealt by players)
---
* Talent Spirit Bond provides additionally 3%/6% of Hunters Attack Power to the Pets attack power
---
That would increase survive ability of Hunter pets in Raids and gives Hunters respectively their pets a bit more scale ability from better gear in later raid tiers.
---
* Moonkin Form additionally increases total Spirit and Intellect by 5%
---
* Talent Moonglow Manacost reduction per Talent Point increased from 3% to 4%
---
Should help to improve Moonkins mana issues to make it a bit more viable in Raids. Bit reluctant to make any changes on damage output.
---
I don't think there will be many german PvP servers, like maybe 1 or 2 is my guess. As such, I think "the" PvP server most people play on will be populated quite nicely. Of course not as much as the american servers most of the streamers play on, but I think a bit more than "medium sized".
---
Just my guess, though.
---
Nope. They wear a shit ton of cloth and sometimes leather.  It's their BiS until Naxx
---
&gt;Is playing on a server with 25k population that also has cross-realm battlegrounds as default something you think can develop a close-knit community where reputation matters?
---
That won't be happening. Why do you think Blizz will have 25k people in a server when the final capacity is something like 5k? Have some faith. They will set population cap and take into account probable retention rate, so that by the end of layering you will have a nice healthy server population.
---
In one you are cheating, in the other you are exposing a cheater. It isn’t an argument over apples or oranges, one of them is blatantly wrong.
---
It was for me on pservers :)
---
For any of the "speedrun/hardcore" Guilds probably not.
---
But besides that having 1 or even 2 Feral in Raids is pretty neat. Especially with the confirmed high parry rate makes it harder for fury tanks
---
Where can i sign the fuck up?
---
What is this sub's obsession with posting streamer clips presenting them like its god send gameplay?
---
If you're killing someone repeatedly without watching any streams, you're not screen-sniping and not doing what Soda is complaining about.
---
Soda is talking about a community blacklist as something streamsnipers will be added to within their own circles. There's no action being taken by blizzard in this scenario.
---
He's just saying "Hey - if you use my own stream to find and grief me for attention, I'm going to take note of your name so people can avoid you." It's pretty easy to tell when someone is a streamsniper when they show up wherever you go in-game.
---
I would join
---
No. But i just googled it. I might be in few weeks :D
---
&gt;He has always been vocal about how he wants to be treated like a normal person
---
If you want to be treated by "like a normal person", and then demand special protection by the company who runs the game in the very next sentence, because you are a "famous" internet attention-whore, then I have a better target you can throw the word "hypocrite" at.
---
Also, if you want people to read a long text in it's entirety: **use paragraphs**. If you care so little about your text you don't even bother pressing ENTER a couple times, why should someone else bother enough about it to read?
---
&gt;  the pants don't look the same as a Forsaken
---
They are.
---
Ah did you just tried to bait me with drama and then turned it into yet another shitty streamer post? Well played Sir
---
Me either, sounds like a challenge honestly.  Like walking around flagged on a PvE server 100% of the time.
---
Thanks man! Will definitely see to make more :D
---
Hopefully these jackasses will keep to one server so I can play in peace somewhere else.  I don’t understand why these people are even notable.  I also don’t understand why anyone would watch some loudmouth asshole, or anybody for that matter, play a video game.
---
Truee, but I just had to represent it somehow D:
---
You see Vanilla was much more Gay friendly than BFA :D
---
Oh, it's cheating?  What rule would I be breaking then?
---
Doesn't come down to the class more to the player. They can be really good healers in mid-top field of healing meters as well if played by a dedicated player
---
&gt; 4chan
---
On the beta client, with an i9+2080Ti and everything maxed at 1440p you're looking at 400-500FPS.
---
I personally used the Classic preset and capped FPS at 160, smooth sailing.
---
Like the content, hate the edit.
---
Fellow Dethecus fag here, Looked through the screen shots, funny to see you knew BAS and the other Months Behind guys. I was in Watch Your Back on dethecus, the guild that got their BWL stolen by Months Behind lol. Best time of my life. I'm sure you want to avoid MMO's still, but you should definitely low key play a casual rogue and just camp random spots in world pvp to keep the legend going. Cheers man.
---
Yea totally agree to be fair, it can get fairly boring at times :/ not the same sense of danger for me as in back in the days
---
Fun part: they're viable in everything but don't really stand out cause of that
---
At some point that would become griefing though which is against tos. Stop being blinded by jealousy
---
That's how it is normally yup :D But I just wanted to put more into it
---
Someone seems mad
---
I think it's just the whole concept of poor people **donating** to rich people that is so absolutely mind-boggling. 
---
The whole "supporting" buzzword is kind of misleading, since it gives an image of the donations keeping the stream going and the streamer fed and housed - on the contrary, these big streamers have already made it, and are likely generating massive amounts of passive income from their investments.
---
Imagine if Billy invested or saved up his 500 dollars instead of sending them over to Dr. Disrespect, a literal millionaire.
---
People can do what they want with their money, but I think it's pretty fair to judge those who spend it in this way.
---
How do you differentiate between a camper and a streamsniper? As in, how do you know the guy camping you isn't streamsniping you?
---
I remember i got banned from dayz servers coz streamsniping. I mean dude no1 is streamsniping your dead stream. Hillarious
---
Can’t wait for the damn game...so far away
---
Hey man, it's Stormlords on the March - from WoD
---
This is an online competitive video game my friend, not real life.
---
Cheers man, happy you liked it :D
---
And kill Gamon \\o/ (like you need a quest for that)
---
There's a pretty big jump between high and ultra, especially in draw distance and spell effects.
---
I'm running a 9700K and a 2080ti and I still get FPS drops below 70 in some scenarios on Ultra. Granted, I'm running at 1440p, but the i9 would have no positive effect as the Classic client doesn't support multi-threading.
---
I just realized in also part of the problem. Fucking hell. Maybe we are all outplayed in this kind of situations?
---
Prolly why world is so fucked up place LMAO
---
Now do one for retail. Sick of this sub moaning about it 24/7
---
Different game, different rules.  That's the issue with your logic.
---
Poker tournaments have those rules, but WoW does not.  You're not going to make anyone feel bad about playing by the rules kid.
---
read the other replies here. but if someone runs accross the whole map to find you in stealth, he is obviously streamsnipping
---
And if there are any official BG tournaments, it would be cheating to watch that broadcast while playing. But when you play in a tourney, you sign contracts about broadcasting. The player is not the one CHOOSING to broadcast his hand. The tourney host is. They are worlds apart.
---
Adding dualspecc (expensive), adding summoning stones for warlocks, increasing paladin blessing duration, infinite debuff slots, giving druids a normal ress option, giving mages individual ignites. 
---
The inifinite debuff slots change would be huge, and I don't really see a reason it shouldn't be added except "it wasn't like that". Meanwhile, a lot of classes get gimped because half of their skills can't be used in a raid environment.
---
Distracting Shot allows you to save a healer from becoming a battered pile of goo on the floor when shits hit the fan in a dungeon.
---
It's part of the utility you bring to make up for the fact that your dps is subpar. Buy it, learn how to use it, love it.
---
And are you seriously suggesting to use bandages instead of buying Mend Pet? because that's a Trump-level bad deal
---
Stream sniping isn't cheating, read the ToS.
---
If you learned the rules instead of making up your own, you wouldn't be so frustrated.
---
But the printer only cost 100
---
Ah okay =)
---
I just wondered, because the only other place where I have seen the word "hypothetical" used as a noun, was in one of the novels, where Roboute Gilliman was breaking down his stratigic/tactical considerations into "hypotheticals" and "practicals" all the time, as did the Ultramarines Cpatains.
---
Oh, and do. The fluff novels are by far the best part of the 40k universe!
---
only thing he can really do is delay the stream and in a game like WoW that doesn't help as much as in something like dota or LoL.  Streamers and WoW are a strange combo with unforeseen consequences i'm sure
---
i really just dont want to be on a server with a few big streamers tbh :\\
---
The stupidity of this comment is unreal.
---
Only the most hardcore will clear the content in WEEK 1. Not Day 1. The private server meta (Druid tanks and Fury Tanks) that allow massive damage, will not exist in Classic.
---
I don't see more than 2-3 guilds per server clearing the content on week 1. Couple more guilds in Week 2 or 3.
---
EVERYONE else will lag behind by A LOT. 
---
The hardcore population in gaming was always under 10% of the players. This is how many guilds we are talking about here : 10%.
---
90% of those guilds is irrelevant in judging Classic raids difficulty.
---
The VAST majority of the guilds in Classic will stop in BWL, and no matter how much time they spend, they won't go past BWL.
---
By the time they are ready to go past BWL, TBC and post-Naxx content will be announced, and raiding will come to a still.
---
Vanilla raiding is easy...for excellent players. The vast majority of the players are AVERAGE. They will be happy with MC and BWL, which is not a problem.
---
But to say that Vanilla is easy because the top guilds will clear the raids on release it's STUPID. 
---
**On the same logic, EVERY SINGLE GAME IN EXISTENCE is EASY, because top players are beating the content faster than the others.**
---
Just join american late night guilds. We need og AU players in our guilds to keep the vanilla experience authentic with loud kangaroo emu losing fuckers yelling that we got our shiit pushed in.
---
&gt;Claims that Blizzard should/will “take action” against “sniping.” 
---
Wait did blizz really say that? I seriously doubt that they would interfere in that.
---
But that’s not why people type with emotes. What a retarded take holy shit. People type with twitch emotes for the same reason people use emojis on their phones, they are a representation of what you want to say in the form of a picture. Faster to type and, quite frankly, much more funny
---
Lol make no mistake, Reddit is just as angry
---
People like Soda are still going to be left in the dust by the pserver poopsockers.
---
Besides, a couple of level 30 guys can absolutely camp a 40-something.
---
People say this every time. It won’t actually be earlier though. It’s just timezones.
---
I suppose I haven't tested in scenarios with a lot of stuff happening on the screen, though when I say "high" I mean "very high", like I cranked most things up and left a few low. Sub-70 even with everything cranked and a lot going on still seems suspect, but I can't pretend to know your PC or experience.
---
Will give my rig a good thrashing next stress test.
---
Same. Its even worse on the official forums. I understand I was lucky to get a beta, and people are watching streams because they don't.... but this is unhealthy. Sooo many topic about streamers.
---
Stop giving it attention. Its really not the end of the world.
---
So basically it is okay to cheat when it's easy to do so? That's your argument? Try again.
---
But then, answering those questions with a good answer explaining why everything in the game isn't black and white, while giving them a few pointers on how to deal with their doubts regarding the game, would be very much in line with the spirit of vanilla, no?
---
The i7-7660U you're talking about is not going to give you 100+ FPS on Ultra settings across your WoW experience. You will see drops into 60 or lower.
---
And why should "Stream Sniping" be disallowed, pray tell?
---
When someone paints a big fat target on his back, and expects to not get shot, said someone is an idiot.
---
Haha I’m ally at heart. But gonna have to go horde as that’s where all my friends are playing. 100% gonna level a paladin in secret 😂
---
Fights used to be decided in a matter of seconds. Which to be fair, I really liked. I hate the new system and when resilience came into play, PVP fights just got booooooring. I absolutely can't wait for classic.
---
You're literally still living in 2005. It's going to be exactly like how heroics raids are cleared on day 1 in retail, except classic is even easier.
---
Zf epic sword, never got to complete that. Always wanted it 😭
---
That's because they are completely different types of games. You get no competitive advantage from streaming games like Starcraft and Hearthstone. You ABSOLUTELY get a competitive advantage from streaming WoW.
---
It's an MMO, not an e-sport. They weren't designed for spectators. Play on a PvE server and avoid BGs while streaming if you're worried about it. Or play game better suited for broadcasting!
---
Yea, jack of all trades i guess..
---
I kinda have to play druid, since i was a druid since i started playing wow, cant imagine myself maining anything else. I might go with some alts later, but main has to be a druid
---
Fuck you.
---
They don't have res besides battle res which is 30 (?) minutes cooldown. So a dungeon could be weird without another class to res present.
---
Also take into account that before raids you may be frost AoE specced to mass farm mobs for gold/cloth/goodies. That's way more fun than raid frosbolt mage.
---
Did you really just blame the Mods?  Wtf
---
Found the Soda fan boy
---
so if streamers don't win, they cry stream sniping?
---
Imma check it out. I believe the hypothetical thing i learned fro Two and a Half men, when Charlie Sheen was in the show 🤔
---
/shrug you must have never have the misfortune of having to actually hear one of those dbags talk.  Everything about their presence is toxic.
---
And if they're stupid enough to stream their location on a pvp server(which shockingly they are) they deserve whatever they get.
---
Ah yes, shouting "I had glad titles on retail" is always a good way to get yourself out of a 14-man stunlock gangbang.
---
Streamer Master Race?
---
Yeah, and Horde was "special" until TBC and then the pally's came...  Horde died that day.  :)
---
Nope terrible analogy. Think of it as Bodyguard agency sponsrship. they protect him and pay him to use their service and they get their brand/name exposure. Stop with this tunnel vision mentality.
---
&gt;waaaaaaa dont gank my favorite streamer i just stole my mom's credit card so he could say my name on stream for 3sec
---
&gt;waaaaaa stream snipping is wrong
---
go back to fortnite
---
There should be anti-streamer guilds that will make life hell for them.
---
100% agree with you there. Based on aus private servers the participation rate is pretty low so having a single server would be ideal even if it is overly crowded to begin with.
---
Wow, some people are really bitter that they didn't get a Beta invite.
---
The hardest section of the Scarab Lord grind is the Brood of Nozdormu rep grind which involves killing a shitload of elite bugs that drop a white tradeable item. A big streamer can complete that grind without killing a single bug.
---
yeah its pretty disgusting!  on my human rogue in vanilla i liked duelling other rogues cos of perception but orcs were my nemesis
---
I like that album.
---
Addon idea!  Screenshots every time you die, the  count them up at 60 and reflect.  Sounds sweet as hell.
---
Thats some deep thoughts you shared with us, thank you... I guess...
---
I used to be in &lt;reverends of swagger&gt; with baconn! Good times. There was a dwarf paladin he would gank with too, can't remember his name. But he was the first to figure out how to reck bomb, he and baconn had a bit of fun with that one. Were you horde? I played a gnome lock named torky back then.
---
But in this case it wouldn’t simply stop, stream snipers will still come especially if you have 40k viewers. Addressing the issue is the only solution if the problem won’t go away on its won obviously. Streisand effect is if something happens once...
---
humans cant be grouped with horde silly
---
&gt; Solution is simple, just roll different server as all streamers will most likely roll on the same one... 
---
so we have to avoid the streamers? I don't even care if there's a streamer on my realm, but we don't have to give them privileges others don't have. There's no 100% certainty that a streamsniper will do this. so how will Blizzard explain this?
---
If I see an opposite faction player I'll attack and mostly gank him. I don't f\*cking care if this is a streamer or not...
---
Ditto for me.  :)  After 15 years of release, I've finally completed the original Alliance starting zones.  Had a hard time with the dwarf zone, hated the gnome area, human was "meh" -- but did really enjoy DW and all the new quests, at least new to me.
---
Now, go roll Horde, you will see and feel the difference!  :)
---
Rhok'delar! There's no better way to immediately indicate to a server that you're a skilled player. Also the quest chain for it is the most satisfying thing to complete in all of WoW imho.
---
They said, "You cant spell agreeeeed without reeeee"
---
You're a brainlet.
---
It's not an argument, it's a statement saying they aren't reading it because it's formatted in such a way that it is a pain to read.
---
Your "argument" however definitely shows your "iq"...
---
&gt; And of those people, most will have higher aspirations than "camp Sodapoppin lmao"
---
Have you ever heard of APES?
---
I don't think you really understand the vanilla community.
---
That's "on" a pvp server, it's a contested territory. On a PvE server it's a "neutral" territory and you can't attack.
---
the ones with the follower levels of the ones in beta can make a lot of money from streaming, but your followers only want to see you paying that game, you want to play something else and stream it then you risk losing a lot of followers and in turn a lot of income, you feel rough and not up to playing games for a week or so, you risk losing followers and in turn income.
---
i feel rough i call in sick i lose a few days pay or i get sick pay.
---
i want to play a different game i play a different game who cares, i sometimes stream for guild members/friends i make no money off of it as i don't have loads of follows i don't care i dont do it for money
---
i would love to make money from playing games but i really could not deal with the shit some of these have to deal with to make a living out of it.
---
while i don't like these streamers i have to respect that they put a hell of a lot of work in to make the money they do from their streams.
---
Hahah this is cool! Wonna watch make love not warcraft now
---
Nah well take the american late night players but, just so when they say things like"omg im lagging so hard my ping is 70" we can turn it into a guild joke for the next 2 years.
---
Doesn't look like anything to me
---
Literally one of the biggest.
---
He is publicly broadcasting his location and whining that people use it against him. It really is his problem. He can stream with delay, he can skip streaming, he can do a lot of stuff besides whine.
---
People are outraged because he gets a special status for nothing and it can be abused by him. Anyone finding him in stealth is 100% streamsniping?
---
Complete brainlet.
---
InceptionSniping ! 
---
My head already hurts !
---
This is 5000 IQ genius move by Soda.  He's been streaming for 10 years, he knew this would get people talking.  He knew this would create a lot of buzz and help make content because this will make people stream snipe him and gank him even more.  He will never run out of content with so much world pvp going on.  This is actually going to be a lot of fun.  I was going to go horde but I'm going alliance just to gank him as much as possible now. Even though I know I am being jebaited by him and this is what he wants, it still sounds like a lot of fun.  World pvp is going to be crazy fun,  hopefully the servers can take it.
---
How can he prove the guy who killed him snipped of the snippers ingame name is not even remotly close to the twitch name and he doesn't stream.
---
so many streamer nether legion lickers ugh, no wonder this sub is in ruins
---
He posts here sometimes. I remember someone mentioned him a few months ago and he dropped by the thread.
---
Are these streamer topics the new "what happens after naxx" topics?
---
All this streamer shit just asks for another crusade
---
That opening section and first two bosses of MC are where having good hunters makes it a cakewalk and having bad ones turns it into a shitfight. Not for Mag, but for putting pets away and pulling surgers without imps.
---
The gatekeeping is real. Most people here think they're a special snowflake whose unique and refined taste is responsible for Classic's return.
---
Fun fact: Blizzard doesn't give a fuck about any game unless they know streamers will stream it. Without streamers paving the way, you'd still be looking for the next buggy, lag-filled private server to play before it gets shut down.
---
Im really hoping that playing wow classic brings back the feeling of exploration. The world of Warcraft changed so much because of cataclysm so I’m so excited to explore and remember what it use to be like.
---
I think what you’re missing is the fact that the work put into Classic is now, in the eyes of Blizzard at least, a sunk cost. They decided the spend the money to rebuild the infrastructure/code, get servers running, etc. which was honestly the hardest decision for them.
---
Now let’s assume that they adhere strictly to what the fraction of the potential classic player base wants, that being a Vanilla experience with *zero* changes. Nothing at all done in terms of balance or added content (sidenote: unless the player base stays at higher than projected numbers for longer than anticipated, I see this as the highly probable approach they take). In this scenario, the costs of upkeep in terms of real money input for the IP is basically *non-existent* relative to a property in which you’d have employees debugging constantly, brainstorming potential changes, art teams, music teams, etc. 
---
So basically if they give us the Vanilla experience and nothing more, they already know exactly how much money they need to make in the first 6-12 month window of highest activity in order to recoup their costs and everything else is just pure profit. After they make their investment back (which is nowhere near the figure for actually putting out an expansion and probably more in line with that of a major content patch in the current game), even if they have less than 100k people playing: whatever portion of those players would otherwise not be subbed without Classic are a revenue stream of pure profit due to the negligible cost of upkeep: they’d basically have to just pay the electric bill for the servers. 
---
So while it might seem like they’d care if Classic booms and then largely dies, they don’t have to at all. As long as the initial boom covers investment (hint: it almost certainly will), then Blizzard can just mostly ignore Classic (it is a finished game after all), squeeze the property for every last dime while offering nothing in terms of ongoing development, and still keep their promise to players they initially made.
---
Tl;dr - even if Classic retention long-term is terrible, Blizzard won’t care. They’ll make their investment back during the hype train and just keep the electric bill paid to retain whatever subs they wouldn’t have if they hadn’t made Classic in the first place.
---
I doubt we'll see more than one server for each type for each region with the exception of a few servers per type for US Pacific and US East.
---

---
"It’s ultimately unrealistic and iffy on whether it’s exploiting or not."
---
So are you telling that reck-bombs in general are unrealistic/unreliable? Even if there is a consistent way to get procs? I'm just a bit lost here.
---
To not get banned by twitch : put a webcam behind you so all your screens are visible so everybody can see you're not streamsniping.
---
Have a buddy streamsnipe and give you directions through your headset.
---
Better if your buddy isn't in the same place so he doesn't have the same IP than you (in case Twitch checks IPs).
---
this will be interesting on launch as to how many people snipe streamers names on the character creation weeks, and then how many will actually hard farm the silver to get the guild names as well. you will see the people doing it for laughs, you will probably also get the arseholes that will hold the names/guild names to ransom
---
O'boy not another list, I'm on so many =(
---
Yes it would be. I literally just said that. Do you realize you just repeated back the same thing and asked if I thought that was good?
---
I'd totally install such an addon ! ^^
---
Oh my god i havent seen that name in like 13 years but I still remember him vividly. We had an undead Warlock r14 player named Sancrotis who would always defend the crossroads from Niar attacks haha
---
I really doubt there will be german servers.
---
EU/NA etc. If you wanna play with Germans you should find yourself a german guild.
---
lol dude he reported me and deleted his post it's fine I feel bad.  I forget it's 2019 all this wow classic talk has me in a trash talking mood.  Im sorry /u/Btwrestle04 I think alizee is foxxy as fuck too.
---
You are right there will be private server veterans who have much more knowledge of the fights. But the top level streamers have an advantage in that playing wow is literally their job so they will be ahead of anyone who is not living off their mom.
---
Also they are naturally good at making friends and have plenty of people that would help them with stuff.
---
I can almost guarantee that streamers will have a ton of viewers on launch. Hyped game releases always bringbin the viewers, happens with every WoW expansion, will be the same for Classic.
---
It'll probably go back to normal eventually, with the biggest streamers getting 20-25k and the others ranging around 1k-5k viewers, but the first few weeks of launch will be massive for streamers.
---
Ah so you are simply jealous that he makes money streaming. You might not know this but it is his job so simply not streaming it won’t be an option, and i can also imagine he wants to have fun and the same experience as everyone else. He even said he doesn’t want any streamer benefits if it would be possible but that won’t be possible either
---
So if you streaming a streamer killing session wouldn't it be easier to just kill yourself (ingame)?
---
Dude chill the frick out man. This is just rambling, nothing that ever will be put to the test and even if he had the chance to do so i doubt he really would. He is just pissed about his situation (understandably so) and talks. Thats stuff everybody does but people dont get to see because its in your small 5 m2 dark room which hasnt had the windows open since 321bc.
---
Yeah I don't know how it works I just figured you could find something useful there. No idea why I got downvoted.
---
Hi, /u/Contempt77
---
Don't worry we will come to fight the emus for you. But yeah very late night players in our guild. Hoping for one au server as well. Au players fit our raid times better than na by a lot
---
I just dropped a message into Blizzard, depending on the answer i’m going to have to order a whip and energy drinks for the minion.
---
The big ones in early vanilla were av pets having insane run speed, lupos doing shadow damage, and BT habing a 1.0 attack speed. Idk how much of that will remain in classic - I suspect only BT.
---
You're under estimating EU welfare.
---
I mostly agree, but I would be afraid to play even on Swifty's server. I love him dearly, but he is guilty of calling everybody who ever attacks him a stream sniper. I would be afraid of nasty whispers from his viewers (Maybe his fans are not like that, I'm not sure). Also I think the presence of any streamer could negatively impact a servers's economy.
---
I'm going pvp server.  if I get ganked for 5 hours straight and not being able to play the game, I will have lots of respect for the other person doing it and enjoy every second of it.  I miss world PVP so much.
---
Imagine calling streamers "attention whores" because they make significantly more than you make at your job to play something you play as a hobby.
---
Back in my day comma
---
Is it viable without MCP?
---
how do you cap the FPS?
---
Yeah the only good quests for rouges were the lockpicking/poison ones.
---
I will use the Ryzen 3700x and the RTX 2060. I think it will be a great combo to play.
---
Wait the one month for the new ryzen3 it's worth it in my opinion.
---
Imagine travelling through the world and seeing someone from the other faction, you give him a /wave and a friendly /hi. ...  The maniac then proceeds to attack you, and you fight back killing him, and as is right, proceed to corpse camp him for 4 hours. Suddenly you’re logged out of the game, ans as you try to log back in the game says you’re banned? Well fml, that guy was a streamer.
---
In a perfect raid comp, sure.
---
You won't have 6 hpalas with all blessings skilled every time tho.
---
Streamer bad
---
Can yellow attacks be parried?
---
First off, where's your source on the population on the servers. I haven't seen anyone defending these 15k, 20k, 25k with anything but baseless assumptions.
---
They are aiming for the truest vanilla experience, but they kinda don't want to see 600 night elves in the starting zones all at one time, enter layering.
---
ƓąղҟӀօɾժ
---
Forcing world PvP is dumb, and war mode exist
---
How much you can personally stay online mean anything when the bottleneck is an item that players can trade you.
---
Yah my point is that this isnt realistic. The number of guilds that will refuse to take a raider bcuz they are on sodas blacklist is probably not even in the double digits. Meanwhile if soda makes a blacklist for stream snipers he only succeeded in making himself a bigger target of stream sniping. Blacklists will be a thing but this blacklist is such a joke that many will consider it a triumph to have their name added to it. I hope he does! Lol.
---
I mean a Warlock probably isnt topping the charts either usually, but the dps is good and he brings utility. Same thing with Druids. The heals are good, you might top the charts sometimes but usually not.
---
But if your concern is consistent top healing on the charts Paladin would be my choice.
---
I can't confirm it but the best dps rotation is way the fuck better with slow weapons so I strongly doubt it. Even RAP is altered by speed of your weapon so fast weapons are kinda awful for hunters. It's so bad that Carapace Spine Crossbow is almost better than Rhok'delar.
---
&gt;For any of the "**speedrun**/hardcore" Guilds probably not.
---
Druid tanks have more TPS and DPS, so for speedruns they will be used on some bosses.
---
I am happy that you have found an audience for your braindead analogies. You found another one with a naked woman, you really come up with them quick don’t you.
---
If you were as good as reading as you were at writing shitty analogies, you would see that in nowhere do I say that it is your job to deal with streamsnipers. My intention of the post was to highlight the attitude of this sub towards streamsniping is wrong and maybe that didn’t come across as I intended it to be because I am not a professional writer like yourself. Streamers taking a stance against streamsnipers is seen as catering to their needs, while it is to some extent, the reason I am against it is because it is cheating. If the streamer would say they always target me in battlegrounds because I am a streamer (not through stream sniping in this case), blacklist the people who deliberately kill me first, I would be totally against that as that is - as you said - catering to their needs.
---
I really hope so. I remember way back then you knew a bunch of people on your server. Even if you never went on vent with them you’d chatted loads. Like you’d see them in trade chat/around capital cities I remember crazy stuff like when a guy ninja’d loot from a raid and the whole server black listed him from groups.
---
Yes, to some degree. Both private servers and other mmos like EVE Online that forces you to be social to succeed are like that today. Problem is also that it does get a bit more disconnected the bigger the whole community is and those communities are small in total. Wow classic will be huge, so that will dampen it a little.
---
Does anyone have a guide/link to most efficient spec for solo quest leveling?  
---
I will do dungeons, but they are all faceroll no matter the talent spec - so request is purely for solo questing at odd hours.
---
Yeah, warmode kinda fucked it all up
---
Yeah, I'm relieved RP is around too. And you can always use a perma-PvP flag mod to keep things a little spicy.
---
Yeah, all the salty players that didn't get into the beta so are hating on the streamers that did.
---
I think streamers who suggest this should be reported to GM's/Blizzard and get banned, who are they to even suggest this? I encourage all players who see or hear these kind of statements to report the streamers in order to get them banned.
---
I just remember the ice claw bear having that ice claw attack and it was like a 50% slow or so. That classic cinematic trailer with the dwarf and the bear made me play as a dwarf hunter with an ice claw bear. It was the only hunter pet I ever used in vanilla and TBC but my mains were warlock and druid.
---
Like I said, I've started horde several times, but Durotar makes my eyes bleed, Tauten one literally puts me to sleep. Undead is okish.  
---
And dwarf starter is by far my favourite, humans second (especially westfall), Nelves were meh.
---
Enjoy your free raidspot :)
---
I want to be the night elf hunter named "Legolas"
---
It was already taken.
---
What source are you asking for? Server X has 3000-4500 people per layer, server has 3 layers and it's already 9000-13500 people.
---
And considering only 3 starting locations, you'll sure as hell see 600 night elves in starting zones, layering or not.
---
3000/3=1000 people per starting zone roughly(far more for troll/orc and dwarf/gnome).
---
Yeah that's probably a step too far... Or just good business? I don't know, I sure as hell won't be since I'm EU and have plans to rediscover the whole adventure with friends, but it'll be fun to watch in our downtimes!
---
NE hunter. Went overseas at around level 16 to link up with my friends somewhere close to stormwind. Tried to corpse run from Ironforge through badlands, searing gorge, until a friend asked me. "Why didn't you just take the tram?". I did not know about the tram.
---
I remember having to wait about 20 minutes to res at my corpse. I ended up at the edge between badlands and searing gorge.
---
Also waiting at the non-moving boat in wetlands for 30 minutes waiting for it to start moving right after they got boats instead of the old captain placeholder who would teleport you.
---
Thank god for redditors. It was OP's first time on the internet.
---
I never felt like people cares about specific names very much in WoW compared to other games.  people just put lol or yo after their names or made up something stupid.  I think thats just the nature of having to have multiple names for multiple chars
---
inb4 "It was just a joke"
---
Yes you're the *only* one.
---
Sounds like a facist
---
Number 1 just reminded me to be wary of the first day of launch. Layering or not, it's going to be a real shit show with getting quests done. No shared tagging of mobs, and people everywhere. Good luck to all.
---
Respec caps at 50g, so it's a noticeable expense if you plan to respec frequently. Druids do have a spec that gives them most of the feral PvP talents and most of the Resto talents they need for raids tho.
---
They're okay farmers imo, not amazing but out of all the healers I like their farming the most.
---
World pvp is where the shine the most imo. If someone was just interested in wPvP, I'd highly recommend Druid.
---
Hell yeah
---
But forcing players to go out to world and fight for some resources/nodes is not dumb. Take Devilsaurs in UnGoro for example
---
Same thing for me! My favourite pastime was killing the scourge in Noxious Glade/Fungal Vale and listening to music. It got me enough reputation to buy a healer ring from AD rep vendor. On my warlock.
---
What a rip off
---
I wouldn't mind saving the nostalgia for release if blizzard didn't give anyone who was ever a name in WoW an invite and tell them to stream it.   Kinda feels liek I'm going to be burnt out in 3 months.
---
Its a good idea but all the streamers are going to be concentrated on one server and fuck me that is going to be cancer. I rather not level and raid on a place with a bunch of idiots following a massive streamer around and just get the vanilla expierence
---
This time around I'm just becoming the ganker and embrace it fully. But still, I'm not gonna be a dick and camp people, that shit is just mean.
---
Sure but Classic isn't very alt-friendly so you might wanna be more careful about your name. If Sodapoppin's main has to be called Sodapoppinxx it might bum him out... I'm definitely gonna create and save my favourite names when I can, cause I'm gonna one-char this, so I don't want to have to find a weird name
---
it has nothing to do with blizzard, this isnt ninja-fortnite drama    
---
it is mean to punish complete assholes like the dude who disrupted the horde tournament
---
Let's all snipe the names they want on live classic servers. Then they can pay ransom gold.
---
Is that his video advocating for classic WoW? cause then Jontron beat him by 5 days and using your logic, his this biggest factor then.
---
fyi never even heard of this soda guy before lol
---
I know I won't be watching any of them because I will be too busy playing the game lmao.
---
It's obvious he's saying this stuff on purpose to get people riled up so they can do it even more so he never run's out of content with world pvp.  He's been streaming for 10 years, he know's the ways of publicity.  I am going to do what he wants and go out of my way to join the blacklisted guild just to gank him as much as possible because that sounds fun as heck.  Imagine the world pvp battles this will create.  The best part about Vanilla for me when I played it was the world pvp.
---
Felcloth was always in demand as fsr as I recall.
---
Dunno about that, if Soda goes Horde on a server and Asmongold goes Alliance, and their fanboys flood the server, such a blacklist could be realistic.
---

Potato these days gotta be like a i5 2500k, gtx460 gpu

Try an AMD Phenom ii x965 too
---
Is there anything else you want to change in this historical and authentic recreation of a game from 2006?
---
They are by far the hardest healer in the game. A wealth of healing spells combined with being very mana hungry makes them a tough class to play. I've seen many druids quit because they can't just spam one button and top the meters like paladins. 
---
During vanilla it was very common that druids innervated the priests, which means they effectively only had half their mana. So this is also one of the reasons why people still believe druids are crap healers. 
---
Druids have the highest hps in the game, but also the lowest efficiency. They are straight mandatory on Maexxna and without a skilled and geared druid healer you won't defeat that boss. One of their obvious weaknesses is that a player can only have one HoT of that type on them. So even if you have 4 druids every player can only have one rejuv and one regrowth on them. As for how druids heal good I don't know. I tried it once and didn't get it, went back to my paladin spammer. I've seen druids compete with the other healers, topping the meters is not rare at all.
---
addons were a part of classic what aren't you understanding?
---
I thought Hunter tracking could find stealthed people. And how would he know they ran across the map to find him? Maybe they are doing the same quests.
---
Also, just watched the clip finally, his plan is to prevent snipers from joining his friends and fellow streamers and goes on to say this means they wont get to be in any good guilds. Man I'm really excited to see all the streamers reacting to realizing their guilds are no where near the best.
---
Season 1 2 3 glad lock here. I'd join that classic guild you proposed.
---
So much this!!!
---
This whole sub has become a stupid shitshow. Frontpage is like 80%+ stupid memes, the same crap over and over again. I think we might see some kind of "serious" classic wow reddit in addition to this crapfest that we have now.
---
All of this is obvious, just look at retail. The game doesn't revolve around streamer.
---
Can relate to this - I am actually forcing myself to not watch the streams now.
---
It's not easy.
---
I just hope everyone else isn't burnt out come launch week.
---
I used addons in Vanilla and I'll use them again if they're available. But I won't use quest helper or LFG because it's more fun for me that way, I also have no issues with others using quest helper but fuck LFG for sure.
---
Stop aggroing all these human mobs
---
We aren't talking about people using twitch emotes on twitch, we're talking about how it's a thing now for people to use twitch chat in replacement of normal words, or acronyms. These often aren't faster, like Pogchamp being used as a replacement for hype.
---
When a certain pserver had the attention of Asmon and Kungen main city and leveling zone general chat just became twitch chat 2.0 and the amount of immaturity and toxicity on the server, especially in low level dungeons, just skyrocketed. 
---
I'm not saying anyone's wrong for enjoying engaging in things that the in-crowd does, it's how you make friends and form a community but i just want a server where the in-crowd aren't completely alien to me.
---
The report system isnt autoban,  blizzard confirmed there will be a human element to it to stop this exact thing.
---
They would surely change how this works. A quest reward weapon with 0 inherent DPS being a BiS for at the very least the first tier of raids is as close to a gamebreaking exploit as you can get in the game.
---
thank you contribution lul
---
No. Why would not play with them?
---
Thinking from a business perspective, just re-releasing Classic trough Wrath would be the go-to move. Giving players choice to transfer their characters and maybe have them duplicated but on the next expansion would probably be very appealing to many. Even without duplicating characters and just transfering them would keep a lot of people occupied for 6-7 years, which means 6-7 years of subscription money.
---
Honestly I’d be in favor of a graphical update and that’s it.
---
That is a simple and innocent example of the problem, but lets say he was in a battleground and the opposing team monitor his stream to see where he and his teammates are located in what would otherwise be a fair 10v10 match. Or a group of idiots finds where the streamer is and starts spamming offensive stuff, which results in the streamer getting into trouble. I don’t follow streamers but I am pretty sure they are exaggerating, but I was trying to address that the views of people defending streamsnipers are wrong and regardless of how much they hate streamers and their communities a community which condones streamsnipers is a toxic community.
---
I am to low level for this zone man, can't help it.
---
&gt;Just constant hate, gatekeeping and negativity.
---
So what you're saying you have no actual arguments, only appeal to emotions?
---
Yes and since the Bears mitigation is much higher than those Fury-Tanks they can eat parry hastes easier
---
You wanna stream? You're gonna get sniped.
---
Deal with it.
---
All these streamers are spoiled millenials whose mothers told them they could have anything they ever wanted in life.
---
? never donated, never played fortnite. you must have really  sad life
---
? how come
---
Streamers are cancer.
---
Enh shaman is really slow to level because world pvp is so darn amusing.
---
There is a huge difference between stream sniping and being there by chance, and you can tell pretty easily.
---
I'm talking being ganked constantly by the same people, in remote places, with everything ready and in place just to fuck you different.
---
Of course there is the risk of false accusation, but stream sniping is pretty easy to identify.
---
That dude actually should be removed from beta. Millions of people want beta for actual testing purposes like my self and probably even you, and this moron spends his beta access for this stupid shit, ruining the fun of people who dont have beta, it was irritating to watch with that attention whore seeking attention. His account shouldnt be banned, be he should be removed from the beta and replaced with an actual tester.
---
Yeah, you had to fill up the BfA part with something.
---
Spot on anyway ! Nice vid man.
---
I fingered you were going to say that.
---
But it isn't...
---
Mages wear the Bloodvine Vest but Netherwind Pants and Ringo's Blizzard boots are better than the rest of the set, which means they don't need to be a Tailor to make use of it.
---
In AQ they replace the lot with Robe of Volatile Power, Leggings of the Black BLizzard, and Enigma Boots.
---
People say it takes 12 in-game days, so little under 300 hours.
---
ye true, im thinking of building a new pc too with the new ryzen3 hopefully in time for august classic release.
---
I feel ya. I couldn't possibly care less about playing the beta. Most people bitching about not getting into the beta probably wouldn't even help look for bugs if they did get in. They don't care about what a beta actually is.... They just want to play the game because they feel like they're being left out.
---
Reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3g0q3r/we_will_see_things_through_illidans_eyes/) from the Legion announcement.
---
mmmmmm drama like this feels so vanilla. We’re back, baby.
---
Making this mistake is pretty common, so someone saying 'your' instead of 'you're' is "common man"...  
---
I like your interpretation, it's funny to imagine this person that way. With the monocle and fancy moustache, tea in one hand and a dictionary in the other.
---
I have a feeling blizzards legal actions against very popular private servers had a lot more to do with it. As in, why spend money to protect their IP by getting private servers shut down when they can just make money by hosting their own? Clearly there was already a demand.
---
That's not what we've seen on the beta so far though
---
It's the stupist thing ever.
---
Don't want to get "stream sniped"? Then don't stream ffs.
---
You think you want Classic and World PvP, but you don't.
---
If they were camping him with multiple ppl or following him i cant blame him.
---
You needed to post this again?
---
If you're showing me your location willingly it's not cheating. If I'm looking at where you are without your consent, it is cheating. If you are streaming, you're consenting to show me your location, thereby it is not cheating. Soda is fully allowed to cut his stream, thereby preventing people to look at where he is
---
This is wonderful.
---
"Who pulled, who pulled!!?!?!?!?!?!??!"
---
Still happens on private servers with some of the \*best\* alts. :)
---
Im not someone from the #nochanges crowd but i feel like there is a difference if Blizzards keeps  selective QoL stuff in and getting addons for it. 
---
If Blizzard starts adding QoL stuff where should they start? Where should it end and why? 
---
Its easier for Blizzard to just do no extra QoL stuff and let everyone decide for themselves if they want addons to improve their experience.
---
Phase 6 forever, it is proven to be effective. Years of private servers run it
---
The irony!
---
It's not so much that it's complex, but you have to be pretty on point not to mess it up. At the end of the day, you'll be using 2 abilities for 90% of the encounter.
---
Well he said he would play on whatever server asmongold would play on and asmongold said he would play on PvE server for this very reason so yeah soda could end up on a PvE server. 
---
Asmongold is a fool but I have to give him credit, he said months ago he would roll on PvE server because he knows he is going to get stream sniped constantly.
---
Basically going to clean up my UI and that’s about it that I know of right now, I’ve used addons to do that since I started really getting into wow, and I plan on taking Classic more seriously then I have ever.
---
It’s got to do with the fact that something doesn’t need to be against the TOS for it to be wrong.
---
What are you taking about. How many decently sized streamers can you name, and how big are the betas? The streamers make up maybe 1% of them.
---
To support a blacklist for stream snipers. Everyone has to endorse it. But no, what will happen is that these people will band together... and still continue to gank you and they will be more organised to do so. 
---
RIP Soda. Enjoy your corpse run.
---
I’m gonna roll with Robe of the Archmage. Fuck yall. The difference between that and Bloodvine isn’t that big anyway, and it looks a lot better.
---
Never feel bad for using information for a roast :)
---
I won't be using any addons, I didn't use them back in the day either.
---
I'd be happy with some QoL changes from Blizzard.
---
Friendzone is something to be proud of now? ahah
---
I see what you’re saying
---
Sorry to necro an old post,but I'm on a pserver now and am leveling a warrior(currently lvl 12). I want to do dungeons as I level but to respec for just one dungeon every couple levels will cost a ton. Is it feasible to just stay with my fury spec but use a 1h and shield and sit in defensive stance?
---
Found a person with a real job.  
---
I love the default response by these children: “you’re just mad they make money playing video games!”
---
No thanks, I’d rather not.
---
/r/wowclassicplus
---
Keep this shit out of here. It's against the rules.
---
I applaud his efforts. It wasn’t a Blizzard sanctioned event and I think they should have all been banned for the prize money garbage in the first place, but nope. Cuz streamers.
---
This will never happen because streamers aren’t stupid and won’t reveal which server they’re on until they have a big headstart.
---
What are people gate keeping?
---
Pretty much you wanna rush feral to feral swiftness / feral charge, 5 into furor in resto after that, then just fill out the feral tree. After 30/31 in feral you can either go balance for omen if you want to max your dps, or fill out the rest of resto to be a perfectly competent healer.
---
If they can't organize an event where they have a way to prevent people distrupting their tournament then shame on the organizers.
---
Why on earth should Blizzard get involved in this? How can that be grounds for punishment from Blizzards side?
---
I don't want streamers to start witch hunting players just because their badly organized events get disrupted by trolls!
---
Lmaoooooooooo. The intent of streaming is not necessarily to show your location to other players within the game.
---
You're such a bloody moron if you unironically believe what you just said. Get checked bud.
---
Fuck streamers
---
yes you need to match an item's level to be able to use its appearance. or at least it used to be that way, they probably lifted most restrictions already. but still, unless its an alt, he wouldnt have much items unlocked at this level.
---
I mean streaming is their job. If they want to stream classic and their idiot viewers follow them they can’t do anything about that.
---
Most labtops sub 500 have atleast 2.7ghz 4 core with 8gb ddr3 ram. It can play classic wow
---
Did all of the NE starting zone, was not in a hurry and just reliving classic and exploring.  Loved it.  Dark, happy, menacing, space.  Also did all of Ashenvale.  Finally did ALL of Westfall, too, on my little human lock -- and then when the zones started to criss-cross just stopped leveling.  Found zones and hidden areas that as a Horde, I didn't know existed.  Was a nice and peaceful Sunday afternoon, rainy-day waste-of-time yet satisfying. :)
---
Why people care so much? Just avoid their realms and enjoy the game. People gonna get camped hard in STV, and endgame zones.. If you're streamer or not. Some dudes camping Blackrock mountain for ever and you can beat them or make a 3 corpse runs till you get into brd... That's just the way it is. If you or streamer don't like it, just consider pve realm.
---
I rolled a rogue because of this guy and the "world of roguecraft" videos.
---
Well I split off a 2nd account I had a 60 dwarf priest, sold it on eBay, then used that cash to pay someone to level the rogue.
---
Ah .. the good old days
---
Classic will have streamers. BOOM
---
I feel like this thread just adds fuel to the fire
---
Except when he's playing a game, especially FPS, where he is not instantly good at and complains about "gunplay".
---
He's really good but I remember watching him play Ring of Elysium once and the moment he couldn't instantly headshot a running target in 50m distance he instantly opened the settings and moaned about gunplay instead of just accepting &amp; admitting that he's not used to the gameplay.
---
He can be a good sport, but he has his sore moments too.
---
I don't understand how this works. We reserve the 3 names, and then later see the server list? So that means those 3 names are reserved across ALL potential servers, otherwise the reservation would be ineffective. Am I reading that wrong? Are we reserving the 3 for the entire server list at once?
---
Boring af
---
Wasn’t Illidan already in Outland by the time classic rolled around?
---
Or is this a blindfold joke? 
---
My first instinct was to assume it was a “imprisoned for 10,000 years...” joke.
---
As far as I know the only thing they confirmed is that the amount of reports needed for an autoban will be higher than in retail
---
there will be, fell free to join
---
U have to look at game mechanics/game philosophy and content like raids separately. 
---
I do also love TBC dungeons and raids and zones but looking back I can tell that flying fucked up world PvP. I dont want Blizzard ro make TBC/WotLk without flying ad well because it was part of the expansion and some content was made with players being able to fly on their mounts in mind.
---
Definitely the paladin.
---
Bit ironic seeing as everyone is crying over streamers and beta access.
---
 Quel'Serrar i like the lore behind it, that these weapons existed and was forged by the dragons, and everyone of them look diffrent.  
---
I also like the quest to it, forge it by a dragon.
---
Do you have a link of the clip?
---
It's fine for me.
---
Playing on a Pserver right now and about to hit 60 on my first char there. Haven't played since Cata and enjoying the experience a lot. Tried out quiet a few different classes to level 20/30 and am now set on what I will roll once classic comes out.
---
i definetly won't be paying the monthly fee in advance just to have a shot at getting in the beta.
---
I wouldn't call those potatoes...
---
think i will be using addons, probably not any quest ones as that was one of the charms of classic was that you had to find and work for the quests, the moment you use quest helpers you may as well just do what you do in retail by clicking through the quests without reading them and blindly following the arrows
---
I think the difference is that addons are mostly optional, whereas Blizzard QoL changes are forced onto every player, for better or worst.
---
I'm unsure if I'll use addons or not, it depends what's available. I don't plan to use Questhelper, at least on my first character at all though as I like figuring out where to go from reading quest text.
---
Nope, I have no interest in playing it either.  Commented on a similar thread a few days ago and started a huge salt storm, so I’ll just leave it at that.
---
I’d be soooo pissed if I lost a level 30/40 character.  Leveling burnout is a very real thing for me in Classic.  It typically starts to feel like a chore for me right around level 32 or so.  I enjoy the end game so much that I can usually push through, but if I leveled to 40 in the beta and then had to do it all over from scratch again I’d probably cry and just feel salty and unenthused right from level 1 which is not at all how I want to feel when the launch gets here.  By delaying my gratification a bit, I’m sure to be down right giddy when the real launch gets here, and that’s what I’m going for.
---
&gt;Except when he's playing a game, especially FPS, where he is not instantly good at and complains about "gunplay".  
---
&gt;He's really good but I remember watching him play Ring of ROE ( Apparently my comment got deleted for saying the full name because its coincidentally also a private server) once and the moment he couldn't instantly headshot a running target in 50m distance he instantly opened the settings and moaned about gunplay instead of just accepting &amp; admitting that he's not used to the gameplay.  
---
&gt;He can be a good sport, but he has his sore moments too.
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
Lettuce be honestus:
---
A streemewrs universum revolves around one thing: Them. No matter the event, no matter what is going on, they have to be in les middles! If there would be a funeral that they could attend online, they would try to make themselves the most memorable person around.
---
"Hey guys, what's up, it's ya boiiii Josh Krokensquatch, today we're gonna attent the funeral of Axel Bathstain and for this special occasion, we've injected some blue color in my lachrymal gland, so we can hopefully cry some blue tears. It's gonna be awesome, we're gonna do it and -5 dollars from Todd, heymanthanksiappreciateitverymush- and you're here to see it. Lesgo!"
---
They need the attentione! They must have mmmmmmmmmmmore. MMMMOOOORE... AAAALWAAAYYYS MMMMMOOOOREEE.
---
Streaming was such a harmless thing, just like youtube. People doing stuff because it's fun. Now it's just twisted and corrupted.
---
I have a couple.
---
Azuresong Mageblade is so nice because it actually looks like a sword and not a paddle or some strange and oddly shaped shit. Really looking forwards to getting it.
---
Lok'amir il Romathis must be the most beautiful mace in the game. Some say the KT mace is better but na, the hand of Nefarian is so cool. 
---
Spire of Twilight or the candle staff as I always say. Such a beautiful weapon with the holy candles, fits superbly with the priest T3, too bad its stats are not the best.
---
True. If he's playing 1 hour a day he won't be 60 by the end of the year and if he's not doing dungeons then he will be ridiculously outgeared as phase 2/3 has started when he's 60.
---
Just give me enemy cast bars and I'll be happy. The add-ons for this usually suck.
---
i can see this becoming a nightmare for him, the moment people find him he will be ganked to hell
---
First we need Phase 1 ...
---
Same as retail: Max Foreground and Background FPS in options.
---
Well that is the point, if you integrate all that stuff into a core game people are forced to use them. If they are just addons people can choose to use them. Nothing ironic here.
---
By your standards. I don't give a shit about people stream sniping people if they're stupid enough to broadcast their position in a PVP game on the internet. Suddenly it's not objectively "wrong". What now?
---
Your last reason is probably the biggest reason I'll actively avoid streamer servers. 
---
I can possibly see some of the more OG wow streamers (specifically classic only streamers of previously) sticking with it, but once the new retail xpac comes out or a new hotness game comes out then your popular variety / retail wow streamers will chase the munz and not think twice. 
---
This will severely hurt any sense of community in regards to the streamer's faction. Hopefully the server is populated enough to withstand it, but I doubt it. I fully expect over half of the playerbase, streamer fanboys and tourists, to quit playing very quickly and likely never hit 60. 
---
Unless you really love getting the attention of streamers, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you choose a server solely because they are on it.
---
/2cents
---
Players can hop off anytime. It's called stopping playing.
---
The PvP in Stonetalon Mountains during the US beta was no where near as good as that, I only saw the odd Night Elf
---
Same... a toggle option for new/old race models would be fantastic.
---
I want the base game to stay the same, QoL addons are personal. Just like vanila.
---
Stuff like Questie are no QoL but gamechanging addons. I understand why people want to play without.
---
Thanks man, much appreciated :)
---
While I don't care very much about streamers, what people tend not to acknowledge is the fact that these streamers have like ten of their viewers in the beta, or maybe fifty or something. If you think anything is bad now, wait until ten thousand Asmongold viewers try to roll on the same server. Even a tiny streamer with 500 viewers can completely scuttle a realm if they're on the more obnoxious end of the spectrum.
---
I don't know why Anon thinks streamers will be on "just one of dozens of servers." That's silly. Does he think streamers will all pick one particular server to play on? Or that Blizzard will forcibly confine all streamers to one realm? Of course not. In all likelihood, every major NA server will have at least one big streamer on them. It'll be what makes them major servers. 
---
Even if you can tolerate the company of your average Twitch viewer, it'll be a huge gamble to roll on any server where a group of thousands of people are rolling together on one faction with a clear-cut goal of making the server as memey as possible and revolve around the streamer they worship. They aren't going to be interchangable from other players. They're going to go out of their way to make it clear that they're Sodapoppin's fans or whatever.
---
I don't give a shit about the streamers themselves, but I certainly wouldn't wanna be caught dead in a server with thousands of players who all want WoW to resemble Twitch chat. This isn't Fortnite or League of Legends where streamers and fans are connected only through the Twitch platform, this is a game where fanboys can play and interact directly with their streamer idols. That's going to make them extra rabid.
---
We're in the beta right now. Outside F&amp;F, something like one in ten thousand got an invite and what I described above is *still* evident in-game. You can see the effects of Twitch culture on the most exclusive and stingy beta in the history of gaming. What do you think it'll be like when 100% of those fanboys have access to the game?
---
How do yo ukill that which has no life
---
Sub rogue on retail uses a ton of shadow magic.
---
Sometimes you gotta complain about people complaining
---
He actually said he wants a cross faction black list.
---
Not sure why he thinks that would work, why would the opposing faction agree to blacklist someone pvping?
---
If anything that player should be commended.
---
Too much pve stuff on a pvp server.
---
A pvp server has pros and cons, getting ganked and camped is a con.
---
As if delaying a stream isn't an option. He should either delay his stream a few minutes or play on a PVE server.
---
I mentioned once that TBC and WoLTK could just be on other servers, leaving a few merged classic servers alive for anyone that wants to remain there forever. But I just got replies that it would fragment the community. Not a bad point, but the the same people still wanted to see TBC. But not on the classic server. And not on a separate server. So I guess on the quantum physics server.
---
He joked about holding sw hostage...not orgrimmar. It was that.....a joke.....
---
His sense of humour is unique. You either get him or you dont.
---
They are good. Every healing class is good for the content vanilla has but if you enjoy just healing and nothing else then pick another class. All others are just better at healing (I'll roll both priest and druid) but that didn't make druids bad, just others better. Druids can do other things tho
---
JE WERD NET GEGNOOMD
---
Ok, so let me give you a scenario:
---
At the start of classic there is server pop of about 20k players divided into 4 or 5 layers. After phase 1 they will remove the layering system. Let's say that of the 20k people that started only 10k remain after P1. 
---
How will this work now? Will they just throw 10k people in one layer? I'm really not sure how all this is going to play out.
---
But we are getting  graphical update in Classic.
---
Shoulda been an A dawg
---
The hype train is a very short ride.  I see less and less people logging in every day
---
Maybe this?
---
Questhelper from Blizzard --&gt; Noooooooooo, it will destroy WoW classic, I will not play it if they make it
---
Questhelper addon --&gt; Cool, great addon, used it back then also
---
Tfw some 20yo makes a years salary of some ppl on a sunday afternoon watching videos.
---
ITT butthurt dudes who didnt get beta access. Soda is the epitome of the average classic player. Stay mad people, but this dude is paying the same way anyone who played in 04 would have.
---
Give it time, once the hype dies and streamers move on then it will return to normal.
---
Yup servers should have population caps. My post was a joke more than anything
---
Exactly!! Far too many people in this sub want pvp only when it's convenient. 
---
That's a pve server thing.
---
So Blizzard's ToS and handling of reprimandeds aren't good enough.  I'm going to take the law into my own hands.  
---
*slowly puts on sunglasses*
---
We're going to punish them all.
---
I find a few things kind of interesting here. 
---
First of is of coruse the obvious, that he frowns upon stream snipers, but later on says that he himself CAMPS people because no other reason than "being autistic" and later on says "for being an asshole" I find it interesting that Soda, a person that does seem to be pretty upandup as far as smarts goes, can not understand that stream snipers are just like him, that they might also do it because "they are autistic" or simply being assholes. Why is it different and okay when HE does it and when others do it to him? It's weird that he can't make the distinction there (is that the right word? That he can't differentiate is what I'm trying to say) from the two.
---
Second, if this REALLY became a thing, why couldn't 40-60+ stream dedicated stream snipers just roll on said "streamer" server and be JUST as good as the streamers in PvE (let's be real here, Vanilla raiding isn't really hard before AQ40 rolls around, so the hard part is actually gathering enough people to raid) and just be on par with the streamers as far as gear? The only thing I can see being difficult here is that quite a few of the streamers are actually decent+ in PvP, whilst some are REALLY good. If they are as good in vanilla pvp remains to be seen, BUT if it became a 40v40 zerg fest, the streamers could probably win.
---
Thirdly, if stream sniping is SUCH a big problem, I say the same that was said over at PUBG when the debate was HOT shit over there. WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY WITH DELAY?!?!?!? It's YOUR stream, YOU are the one making the conscious decision to broadcast your gameplay to US! We're not putting a gun to your head and forcing you to show us  your position. You are the one willingly doing it. Sure, you get some less viewer interaction with delay, but that's the price  you got to pay. And again, let's be real, a lot of big streamers chat conversation is brought through by donations anyways, and whilst those are prolly also delayed (you get money on paypal immediately, but they prolly wont notice) it's still your choice.
---
I feel this isn't something streamers should be whining about, really. Unless it's an e-sport event, then it's fair game. I mean, if leveling in WoW was an actual sport with lots of money on the line, sure, ban stream sniping and stream snipers a like, on sight, cus well, it'd be cheating. But when you decide to broadcast your gameplay in a PvP game where money and shit isn't on the line, but you just play it to enjoy it (as I do) and I come kill you and maybe camp your ass. Well, sucks to be you, I got not much else to say.
---
It's like the people who whine about "omg, he used a healthpot, what a noob" ..no, he just used every advantage he/she had, and won over you. Nothing wrong with it, that's how I see stream sniping as well in games like WoW.
---
And again, I feel it's VERY important to see the difference between stream sniping when someone is just leveling in WoW and if you'd lets say stream snipe when there was a tournament in a FPS game or whatever (that's why if people stream that, they use delays, fantastic, isn't?)
---
multibixing boo
---
What an absolute numpty. I don't follow streamers and don't care for it, but I'm not going to dislike them unless they start pulling incredibly stupid stuff like this and think that they can dictate how other players play, like this. Another downside is that any time I've seen clips, they are surrounded by people in-game who clearly are only there in the hope of attracting the streamers attention, usually by spamming nonsensical twitch emotes, or whatever.
---
I'm just hoping to avoid that whole crowd if at all possible. Should be, since I'll be on EU servers.
---
It depends on your computer power. Currently retail wow can't be minimized anyome, only put in the background, I suspect classic work like that to.
---
Really thats cool they went that way. Always thought sub could be like that. 
---
Haven't played retail since WoD but Sub was always my favourite spec.
---
You must have a reallu sad life waaaaaa
---
Nerd and virgin drama
---
*'Et tu, brute?'
---
No players got banned in PUBG for stream sniping.
---
You don't try to join and quit a game multiple times in a row just to get a specific lobby if you aren't sniping.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
In hindsight, yes maybe, but hopefully my beating helps. 
---
Like I said, someone had to say it, and it seems people agree (Upvoted/2xGold)
---
And also dying in PUBG = Lost game.
---
Dying in wow = ress, so not as big of a deal.
---
Plenty of footage on YouTube of people 40boxing raids on privates, and it's not against WoW TOS, so it's entirely possible for people who want to pay $600 a month.
---
are you 12 yo or just trying to be funny?
---
Think of stealth as you’re slightly less visible, not invisible. That’s how mobs perceived you in classic.
---
Maybe those People don't actually want those #nochanges for themself.
---
Maybe they want to give new Players the Option to experience the game they did back when WoW released.
---
If there was an implemented questhelper that would totally ruin that Approach of giving new Players the same feel.
---
Otherwise I get your Point :P Still a slight difference though I guess
---
 [/r/wowclassicplus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowclassicplus/)
---
yes we're recreating vanilla, flaws and all.  why are you confused?  If you start making changes where do you stop?  any 1 change is like oh yeah thats simple why wouldn't you have that?  but all of them makes it a completely different game.
---
Battlegrounds are not real PvP...WPvP is PvP.
---
And there is nothing wrong with either of yours reasons to pick PvE or PvP, or vice versa. And if people tell you otherwise, they are idiots :P
---
do so, nothing is stopping you lol, nobody said you cannot streamsnipe...
---
Stolen from another thread:
---
Kidneyspears, Squekysneaky, Derpstep, Annoying, Mickdagger, Waldo, Hidden, Eviscerape, Hemosexual, Bambush, backpoke, shanksinatra, vancleavage, sneakystabby
---
They were around in vanilla and they will be around now as well. In general they are easier to tank with
---
yeah im not a big fan of leveling my self, so doing in on beta then do it again. Would drain me and it would feel like a choir and not a fun experiance.

This guy, Furyswipes, livestreamed a 40-box MC on a private servers.
---
every lazily moderated subreddit eventually turns into 99% cheap memes
---
I honestly hope there's a group of people that are planning on fucking with streamers all day as part of their enjoyment. I hope it gets so bad that the streamers have to reroll on a different server. Someone needs to put them in their place.
---
Just make a new fresh when naxx is progressed
---
Thank you for the correct friend :)
---
hey its me ur brother
---
Lol no. Are you new
---
Didn't stop Fortnite and Apex to have a crazy viewers count even if anyone could play it and the game was free.
---
Especially an mmo where it take much more time to achieve something.
---
Or I'm stupid and I just got /r/whoosh
---
I think Soda will face huge backlash if he's trying to blacklist people because he got killed once or twice. He will most likely do this when someone constantly shows up and knows his location when he is stealthed. I don't really follow streamers that much, but I have been watching some wow streams lately as I didn't get into the beta. I haven't really seen soda calling out stream sniping unless it was blatantly obvious. He's even pushed back against chat calling stream sniping when he felt there wasn't any evidence.
---
Time to resurrect them for classic.
---
&gt;I don't care about streamers and I'd kill them if I saw them while leveling, but stalking people is just dumb.
---
Well yeah that's true for 99% of people but you can guarantee when you do it, on stream they're going to be saying "Vagrant_Savant this streamsniping kid again what a sperg, he's just cheating he's not even good" even if you have no idea who they are.
---
I'd honestly like to start streaming WoW. I probably will in Classic. But I adamantly disagree with the streamers culture in WoW. I plan to play on a PvP server and if I get stream sniped, well that's on me for streaming my location. I dont expect or want handouts and I just want to have fun with an active WoW community while chatting with other like-minded players. I dont get the privilege a lot of streamers feel. I think people stop caring about the community and just like the "fame". Not for me, gonna stream but not gonna bitch about anything that comes my way because of it.
---
Others said it already but they are lacking in dungeon healing just because they don't have the normal res. It's not going to be problem if you always manage to keep everyone alive but it's still the downside of having druid healer
---
Actually - if you hit the "full context" button for my comment, I was responding to someone who pointed out PUBG players who got banned for stream sniping when they weren't. So I responded to that comment, pointing out that Grimmmz was a streamer who did that. It doesn't have to relate to Sodapoppin at all, people have off topic discussions on threads on reddit all the time.
---
I didn't respond to the thread saying "oh, Sodapoppin is saying players who stream snipe should get banned". Assuming that the Grimmmz discussion related to that just makes you an asshole.
---
Huh, TIL. As a non-native english speaker, this is interesting. I'm too lazy to google, and since you're already here, what does the word "beck" mean? I've never heard it. And is that where "beckon" comes from?
---
I mean theres very limited content so...
---
what the fuck you talking about. blacklist has nothing to do with blizzard... it is their blacklist of assholes, if the community uses the info there, it is on them only. you can still group up with the "blacklisted" people
---
Just curious. Did blizz reach out and ask you to enforce these rules or are you just playing it safe? 
---
Also, at this point I think it's a bit overblown. Everyone who plays or will play on a private server is rolling on classic anyway. Private servers are not a threat to classic, probably the opposite.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Holy dmg is resisted on private servers, when it’s suppose to not be resisted by anything, including raid bosses and other players. So far the beta backs this up, with that being said there’s no possible way they do less dmg on classic than pervers.
---
You must like talking to children on the internet if you can't keep yourself from coming back.
---
You're right, plate is a PvP thing.
---
Unless it's in that batallion game he has been playing lately. Some peopel in that game are actually monsters.
---
blizzard wants exposure, jesus behappy the game will prosper and not die after one week likes most current games
---
But normally when someone refers to the retail LFG-tool, it includes the teleportation, the automated systems, the lack of need of communication. The addon you linked to, requires the player to still walk to the dungeon, manually advert in one way or another that they are LFG/LFM, actually communicate with the player still joining. So no, LFG-tool is not making it to classic. An addon which translates text into a visually pleasing addon is not the same.
---
Streaming is his job tho.
---
&gt;watching your position fall apart and your ensuing saltiness sustains me.
---
Yeah i must admit i'd like to see a few niche videos like these! I know Paladins can be successful tanks in 5mans / UBRS but i'm almost positive they'll need gearing differently to warriors.
---
Very good video - useful &amp; to the point. Looking forward to a shaman healer gearing guide.
---
You sound really mad. And banned from this sub. Feelsbad, probably. Enjoy making a new account because you’re a literal child without the ability to read.
---
Damn accurate.
---
?? what
---
hell I would not put it past them to have sycophants posting here just to drive viewers
---
Hey man I don’t know if you’ve noticed but there are a lot of people that enjoy watching them play. I don’t, and I couldn’t care less if people love or hate them. It isn’t fair that they can be boosted by their fangays but it isn’t fair that their haters can get advantage over them by streaming either. One is being glorified, the other is being shunned at every opportunity.
---
You guys really do just endlessly talk about streamers, don't you. I've never seen anything like it.
---
you must enjoy mature conversation if you keep talking
---
It's not empty... He could make a career in marketing... Especially in gaming. But people like that, they tend to go into business for themselves, so at that point, his resume is a lot less relevant than your typical corporate schlub's would be.
---
Nonsense.
---
What everyone needs is for streamers to have a bigger map of the zone they're in, with coordinates, to make it easier to streamsnipe. 
---
Blizzard should get more involved in this aswell:
---
An AI should analyze the stream and find out where the next destination of the streamer is and what his plans are and give advice on how to best ruin his day. 
---
Also, if the streamers decide to stream during hours with low server activity, high level and geared bots should start spawning to hunt the streamer. 
---
The AI should also recognize followers of the streamers, marking them as mobs, making them fully lootable. I tell you what, being able to kill, loot and skin some of those twitch chat spammers would do my heart so good.
---
For every donation, the streamer loses ingame money. 
---
Twitch should help here too:
---
For every donation, they lose double the amount of real life money.
---
Streamers should have to thank every donor personally: drive to his home, spend a day with them, you know, hang out, go to the movies, restaurant (streamer pays everything of course), or else they lose double the amount of real life money.
---
There we go. Easy as that folks!
---
Depends on servers I guess. I remember guilds having and sharing Kill on sight and blacklists. Sometimes there were guilds you avoided grouping with as well.
---
Hmmm, I thought about that too and I wouldn’t even be mad at them for it because it obviously works...
---
Half the current Classic content I watch are streamers that have been posted here every 7 mins.
---
But you think you're entitled enough to tell me what server I should roll on.  Amazing
---
Druid mage is an extremely good combo, I made lots of mage friends in vanilla. Once arena came out it quickly became a staple 2v2 team.
---
ITT: Why is everyone talking out of their ass as if it were their occupation?
---
You seem to think they'll allow 20k player to be logged in at the same time after layering is gone.         
---
Why do you think they wouldn't just do what they did and still do in retail, once the cap is reached the server turns 'full' and if you have a char on the realm, you get put in a queue, if you don't have a char, you get told to try another realm?
---
To be fair, the addon is nowhere near the level of quality of the blizzards one. It lacks features, sometimes gives you outright false information and is clunky to use.
---
Tru
---
Thanks, that make sense. I stopped playing when Wrath was announced.
---
Glad my work is appreciated. The protection guide should be taken with a pinch of salt though due to how the tanking Meta has shifted in the past few years.
---
Yeah i dont like putting all that time into a character that will be wiped. Sure there might be some memorable experiences in the beta but there will be on live too and i think ill play live longer before  urnput if i dont play the beta.
---
Id prob play like  10 hours of the beta if i got it. Just to mess around with my mods and ui etc really.
---
Technically classic will be on 1.13
---
People bitching about an addon (they don't have to use) suggesting they skip on abilities (they're still free to buy) because they're not needed to be efficient at leveling... 
---
Ah yes, classic will be the utopian, brotherly love, "we're all learning this together" experience we've been missing and trying to get back.
---
I would actually be very grateful if you could test the following specs of my PC back from 2010:
---
Processor: i7-920
---
Graphics: ATI Radeon HD4890
---
RAM: 12GB (DDR3? I believe...)
---
Sorry mate, wrong path.
---
Just with shaders and grass density and stuff like that. I wouldn't be opposed with the ability to toggle new models. Both character models and tier sets.
---
if you hate streamers, roll different server or bear with them. none is pushing you to roll different server than streamers lol
---
You guys are so fucking funny and pathetic. :D
---
The third panel is legit an amazingly hilarious counterpoint  to the "they could fuck it up" argument.
---
Think there will be loads of questions and less high quality memes
---
The biggest punishment is having to play on the server that the fuckhead streamers choose to play on.
---
Not a wise choice, 99% chance she grows to hate you
---
Raid-level tanking for druids was not viable until the Druid talent respec and the itemization pass which gave leather armor enough armor for the Bear Armor multiplier to work its magic.
---
They were around during the last quarter of Vanilla only, prior to that they were not suitable tanks for level 60+ content.
---
1.12 is inclusive of the talent changes, I'm a little unclear on the itemization they are using for this version of WoW, so yes, you will probably see some druid tanks on the raiding scene, but they still fall short of Warrior tanks.
---
This idiot actually cited Chinas social points system and said he would implement it on HIS server. BS. Soda just painted a huge target on his back with that video. 
---
It’s probably going to get worse because Blizzard took down all the posts on the forum that discuss this. Do they think they can bury that video?
---
Depends on the streamer. I'd do it to the toxic, extremely egotistical ones. But as you, I'm on EU, so I'll limit myself to observing from distance.
---
you wanna streamsnipe? you going to get on the streamers blacklist. also read what age are millenials you fcking boomer
---
"a reliant healer with solo potential"  
---
Do you know what reliant means?
---
I can’t help but fee like, wtf are the organizers supposed to do to prevent people interfering with duels on a pvp server?
---
Like really? Shame on the organizers that they can’t prevent trolls from ganking mid duel? What would they possibly do to have control over a rogue just opening on one of the people
---
This literally happened in vanilla except replace streamers with top guilds. Even on PvE servers you could fuck with mobs to slow their grind way way down.
---
These drama queens complaining about the streamers are so annoying. Who cares about these streaming guys?
---
This is the exact trajectory I went back in the days haha
---
Valor is decent too. Nothing spectacular, but serviceable.
---
Getting a mount earlier or a spell I will never use until I'm maxed and bored? Seems like a good trade to me.
---
Kinda just wanna make a rogue on their servers JUST to stream snipe now
---
you DONT HAVE TO avoid them, you can tho. and soda said he is fine with ganking and camping, so stop bashing your chest lul
---
I'm typing and FBI OPEN UP
---
Inb4 people start to streamsnipe you. You will know how they feel now.
---
I find it funny how some guild rocked through Naxxramas, the Guild destroyer just to then finally hit the brick wall when WOD came out :d
---
People did rather wipe over and over again for countless hours on the same Boss then play WOD xD Because compared to WOD - whiping was actual fun ;)
---
you are the one creating threads at 6am to defend some soy streamer and im the one with a sad life? i think its the other way around
---
I've never liked being in MMO beta tests.  I'm getting burnt out just reading/watching it.
---
The real trick to outsmarting streamers is to choose a realm without streamers, disregard them, and enjoy the game for what it is
---
Not really was just saying maybe I’m wrong, doesn’t make the whole thing irrelevant, just admitting that I don’t know just like nobody does
---
Now that i can reserve a name i not even start till 2 weeks after the mess has subsided
---
No problem m8 m8 m8 m8.
---
Thanks for making me laugh with your shit tier rationalization on why stream sniping doesn't go against the spirit of fair competition :)
---
You are on esalty streamsniper… how about instead of cheating you learn to play the game?
---
Because you know back in the day when splitacreen gaming was still a thing, watching what the others do to get an advantage was and still is considered cheating.
---
People using esp get banned so should streamsnipers. The mere existence of esp cheats/game streams is no excuse for using them to gain an unfair advantage in competitive onlinegamimg.
---
MHO
---
I feel like this could be resolved by not gaining an unfair advantage by watching someone's stream solely to attack someone all game in a place you'd otherwise not known he would be. OMG we can't even harass a streamer, REEEE. 
---
Pubg handled it as well as they could, the streamers weren't just crying they got 15+ people jumping them every game while watching them stream. Most bans were so obvious that they were in chat under the same nickname as in game.
---
So which is better? I didn't get it.
---
I'm not for changes, I'm against them. 
---
But addons are also changes which can make stuff  a lot easier (aggro-addon, raid-helper, healbot)
---
Yep, I'm fine with streamers. I'm fine with people watching them. I'm fine with people donating to them. I also find it funny that anyone is remotely shocked when people take advantage of the fact that they're **broadcasting their position in a PVP game**. 
---
You've just said it yourself, they have the advantage of getting free shit from fans. To me, that counters the fact that they might get sniped. If you're a streamer, you take the bad with the good and suck it up. Just like if you choose to stream snipe, you're accepting that you might be shit on for it. I really doubt snipers care about it like Soda does. People will absolutely just roll a second toon with the sole intention of griefing them and then play the game "properly" on their main.
---
Repost
---
There's nothing difficult about Classic WoW.
---
Got it.  I just seen to remember there being portal rooms in some major cities(legion) and couldn't remember.  I left the game in BC as a mage and when I came back I was thinking "well, so much for my teleport ability" because everyone could get around using portal rooms and an intelligently set hearth location .
---
I'm convinced Classic will outgrow Modern wow.
---
I want people to know how the truth situation is. also it is afternoon where I live, go back to school
---
Oooh yes Dun Morogh, I love that one. And Loch Modan is such a nice transition afterwards. My mate and I are probably going to roll horde bc we want to play as Tauren Druid/Shaman but the fact that I won't be able to hang around IF / Dun Morogh / Loch Modan alone is making me doubt.
---
If you think about it, raiding without addons would be like an extra level of difficulty on itself to the game. Would be cool to have server records to finish 40 man raids without addons being used by any member of the raid. But no achievements to keep track of it though.
---
its like the celebrity gossip on tv but for gamer nerds
---
Waahoow
---
Did you actually see the video with Sodapoppin? Maybe watch it first.
---
Using one of those external GPU housing will significantly reduce the performance of the GPU.
---
https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/beck-and-call.html
---
My solution is you should roll on a different server but I'm not pushing anyone to do that lol
---
Of course everyone is here, because WE CANNOT FUCKING PLAY....AAAAAAARRGHHH
---
You can ignore a streamer. It'll be harder to ignore the thousands of Twitch chat idiots rolling on the same server and faction in order to sniff their idol's footsteps. That has the potential to ruin every server where one of the bigger streamers choose to play.
---
Addons were in classic.  Am I not saying it right?
---
where i can download full client beta?
---
The biggest one I've seen personally was 15 man. Biggest I've seen in video was 40.
---
I know a guy who will go with 5 in Classic.
---
That's not a solution
---
The online numbers are more reliable, no one is denying that wow was one of the biggest mmo's ever, of course it has built up 1m subs on Reddit.
---
what
---
Actually, it does affect them. They can ridicule their criticizers on stream, which is free content for them.
---
Try leveling a character in classic, on a PVP server, then say that again. Gearing up is also way harder
---
I'm unconvinced, while possible the grindy nature of the game will turn off many modern gamers
---
We’re gonna have a ninja fiasco again where he’ll accuse random people for stream sniping. Lul
---
they want to bury the misunderstood BS reddit and other idiots created
---
2/10
---
True, it's more about effort and commitment
---
there will be streamer hunters, as always
---
Yes I want Looking for Raid. But once you entered you cannot leave, get summoned out  heartstone out etc. You are stuck there for 10 years.
---
What he’s doing is the equivalent of going into chat and telling everyone where he is all the time.
---
You can’t get mad when you’re willingly doing something that provides a disadvantage. What a dumb baby.
---
ooh - that's a thing?  How does one do that?
---
Awesome!
---
You're equating extra time required to difficulty, that is foolish.
---
But Blizzard did take action during the tournament so they got involved... I was not talking about the "blacklist" thing but responded to you mentioning the trolls disrupting.
---
hunter tracking doesnt work across the whole map and obviously you see when someone is question or streamsnipping ...
---
Yea definitely wowhead and such - but I'd still check out, say, interviews with really skilled players of class x for more insight. Like Tipsout deepdive vids.
---
This is bullshit. A char with lvl lower than 18 has over 2g? What?
---
But the challange outside of rated bg, mythic+ or mythic raids will keep them in.
---
Hmm, I like the green &amp; purple theme. You've got some real Classic Fashioncraft going on right there!
---
Fuck off man. You do not need mind control as soon as it's available. If I'm in a dungeon and a mage tells me he didn't buy Arcane Missles (really bad while leveling) I will think he knows what he's doing rather than not wanting to group with him. Every bit of gold is meaningful; and it's the people who actually *have* knowledge of the game who are skipping these spells. Also note you don't just *never* buy them. You just don't need them as soon as possible because there are a fucking loooott of spells you have to buy and the prices add up very quickly.
---
Whoosh..
---
Stuff like that are jokes
---
Mate it's not going to help shit, this is the internet, all you do was pile more into what you supposedly hate.
---
If you cant take it play on a PVE server.
---
I think this depends on the streamer. Soda is literally a nolife and can play while working, so he doesn't need to take time of work to play. I won't underestimate other nolifers though since there are some people that don't work and play 24/7 as well, but those people don't have the added benefit of a bunch of other people helping. 
---
In the end I think most people that are insanely hardcore will get scarab lord as soon as the war effort ends. There's a window for multiple people to get the mount.
---
I'm happy community made a tournament and I'm happy they did remove the mental idiot. blacklist is just a list, blizzard wont ban all the people on the list...
---
Havn't you seen the latest blue post?
---
Phase 4 will also incluse the possibility to discuss what should come after Phase 6.
---
Maybe I'm just getting old, but I can't imagine being a grown adult and joining these streamer lynch mobs. I just don't care enough. My suspicion is that these are mostly kids with nothing better to do.    
---
It just dawned on my that all of these kids in these forum lynch mobs are about to go on summer break. They won't be able to play classic all summer. This is only going to get worse.   
---
The night is darkest just before the dawn.
---
Once you got the pet on the highest loyality level it’s very easy. They barely need food
---
I know that feeling bro. I was a gnome warrior first time around but I really can't be arsed to tank anymore in raids. So now I'm flip flopping between Tauren or Orc shaman , or an undead priest . I figure if I'm healing I'll still have a good chance to get an invite.
---
I actually dont like this, had to go darkshore and loch 🙃 redridge is a great zone
---
Cool, so according to that article, "beck" is just a shortened version of "beckon" could you in grammar then actually write "beck" in a sentence and it wouldn't be seen as "wrong grammar" `? I couldn't find anything about exactly that in the article, and I guess I'm just curious, more than anything :P
---
if you stream a lot, you start noticing names that only seem to find and gank you ONLY when you stream. also gdpr is something completely diffrent, pls educate yourself
---
Lol that face and hair combo is the same one I use! (Also played Ret Paladin.)  
---
I remember when cross realm BGS came out and I was helping another Ret pally capture a tower in AV. When we were just stood there waiting, I noticed the other Paladin just staring at me....he then proceeded to hide his helm to reveal the exact some face and hair!  
---
Had a giggle about it and our poor life choices as ret and moved on. Never saw him again but seeing this reminded me of that exchange, so thank you for that :)
---
Is that 30/0/21? Can you send an exact talent spread? Thanks.
---
I see you enjoy mature conversation too.  ;)
---
Vanquisher Sword. The first good looking sword you get.
---
I don't really see a big issue with what Soda suggests. This was a common practice back in vanilla for lots of guilds for people like ninja-looters and scammers. Forums had lists of people who did this. If a large group of people decide that a certain behavior isn't wanted, then that's their decision to not play with it, right? It's not like Soda has all the power to simple blacklist whomever -- it's enforced by like-minded people who feel the same way. If you have 50,000 people who enjoy watching your content and feel that a stream sniper is ruining that content, why are they not allowed to be upset? In this example, a stream sniper would be bother more than 1 person, it's effecting thousands. If those thousands then decide to not play with you, that's completely fine imo.   
---
A stream sniper should accept the consequences of their actions such as the potential of a blacklist; I don't really see this as entitlement. If you enter into a community, it's your responsibility to figure out how to function within it. Wouldn't the opposite be the entitled action; expecting that the majority conform to you?
---
sorry, I should write : if you hate streamers so much, just roll different server.
---
Boo hoo. Some streamers are just cancer.
---
hee heee
---
Blonde amputee
---
This guus shit posting everywhere don't worry.
---
Using 3 modifiers is way too much for me. I just use shift. But my mouse has 9 buttons on it as well, so I'm at 52 keybinds total. If that isn't enough then there is just too much to remember anyways...
---
The only tool is roll pve and that is such a different and less fun experience. World PvP was a big thing in classic and early expansions
---
Are you trying to say modern day leveling is more difficult? I don't know about raids, but some dungeons were also harder than what's up these days
---
Out of interest, did you still opt in to the beta?
---
You are an idiot
---
Famous and infamous people got targeted and killed all the time on my server. If you were a Scarab Lord, or sported some really bad-ass gear, you would become focused by everyone in a BG. 
---
We dealt with this for years, these babies need to just grow up and deal with it too, or just roll on a PvE server. They aren't special.
---
Most streamers don't play 14 hours a day like some people on privates :D
---
As long as it's not enforced on the side of blizzard this is completely fine. A blacklist is only effective based on who adheres to it and is only server specific. To think that you have a right to play with someone is so childish as a concept as well.
---
As people have said just play on a different server if a group of people not wanting to play a game with you is such a big deal. Or better yet. Don't steam snipe. Just don't go and be a dick from the start. You don't have a right to anything here.
---
I think you all don't understand what he means when he says streamsnipers. He doesn't mind too much if you use the stream to find him, as long as you give him a fair fight. That's his problem with streamsnipers, that they constantly use his stream to tell where he is, especially when he is in stealth, they know EXACTLY where he is, as soon as the stream catches up that is. The streamsnipers would look for him, no way they could see through his stealth at that point and boom, the stream catches up and they straight b-line for him. 
---
Those are the streamsnipers he's talking about, they don't want a fair fight, they just want to kill the streamer and don't give a shit how
---
To put your post into perspective this is the first post I’ve ever downvoted on Reddit. And have been using it for years
---
Finally some good content. This is the kind of art this subreddit has been lacking
---
I only played on a PvE server and it was like that, there was just a lot more of non contested territories.
---
they are dealing with it, they are making blacklist... it is others who have issues with their solution
---
Thats funny how so many people can't distinguish between streamsniping and just ganking.
---
If its an organic pvp and someone just ganks its fine ofc. He was talking about blacklisting purposeful streamsnipers, which only goal is to ruin the streamer no just any pvp he doesn't like or ganks.
---
It's not that easy to sit in front of a camera for like eight hours straight and be likeable, presentable and continuously interesting for (hopefully) thousands of viewers. It's why most who try to become streamers fail. 
---
Sitting in an office, you aren't under constant scrutiny. You can go quiet for a while, you can slouch and be boring, you can scratch your balls in peace. A streamer has to be someone that thousands of people want to sit and watch as a pastime. While you don't need to be as entertaining as a professional stand-up comedian, you have to be entertaining in some way, for many hours straight.
---
I mean, why wouldn't you sit and watch a guy that looks like a hobo with AIDS who is acting half his age? It is truly the pinnacle of modern entertainment.
---
This channel has a bunch of boss guides: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQdjATUIMPRiV9_a3xer6Q/videos
---
Rhok’delar. That’s it.
---
They can do it before that.  Its just harder and takes more skill
---
There is nothing in Classic WoW that compares to Mythic content. I don't like Retail either, but let's not pretend Classic is a more hardcore game.
---
If you hate streamers, hunt them down and kill them in game.
---
Or better yet, if you have free will, do what ever the fuck you want with your free time.
---
Wait, I got one more really good one.
---
If you're paying money for a product, and not breaking ToS, anyone who tries to tell you what to do is an asshat.
---
Bis means best in slot. What is bis changes depending on context and, in classic, what's phase we are on, since new, better gear becomes available.
---
Bis is not only something you use to refer to preraid gearing.
---
???????? I agree, but if you're planning on live broadcasting your leveling experience, you aren't gonna get organic world pvp. Just level an alt on pvp OR play pve and flag yourself when you aannna fight. Streamers, in particular, have 100% control of their situation
---
But Blizzard interfering and in a way policing in community based events is a pandoras box that I personally don't want to be opened.
---
Having your personal "blacklist" of people is all fine and dandy but witchhunting players for valid or invalid reasons with a backing of 100k+ people is quiet a different thing imo.
---
I'm not banned, why would I be. Ironic of you to say I am "without ability to read" when you seem to be reading some nonexistent bans over there.
---
And I am right, and you wrong. You literally claimed there are rules saying you can't gank or farm another player. This is false. It is 100% allowed by the games rules and you will never get punished for it.
---
No you dont. 24 silver dude, just kill like 10 more things at level 38. There, done.
---
Warlock pre mop basically is a different class man, I wouldn’t worry about burning out on it.
---
If you really wanted to troll you should try and get into their guild and play an important role and raiding for months. Then when naxx opens and you go there opening night you leave the guild and group mid pull on one of the bosses.
---
That would be a way better alternative than having to farm MCP like a maniac for every raid.
---
Level up a hunter and pay attention to how much everyone hates you. It’s enjoyable
---
nobody said you are not free to do all the things, you will just end on some random ass blacklist that has only meaning to the streamers... so what's the fuzz
---
This is really helpful thank you.
---
It's the only classic content we have at the moment. And some of them are really good plays (some are not though.)
---
Mental health of sitting in chair 12 hours a day from your bedroom has got to be taxing. I see it in the agitation and rageyness many streamers display. 
---
I've tried it. I didnt like it. I work from home make more then 99.9% of streamers I'm good. I dont want a pulmonary embolism while raging at my chat.
---
If the 20-30 silver it costs to train that one or two spells is the difference..well, you did it wrong
---
Play the opposite faction of what you're going to play at release. That way you can train your warlock skeelz but also get a refreshing view of the game while doing so
---
On twitch maybe? Dude has hundreds of followers and is currently streaming naxx progression on YouTube lol.
---
Compared to retail questing is a herculean task.
---
Private Server. Profit
---
No, he said 30/21 feral/resto. Which is 0(balance)/30(feral)/21(resto).
---
https://youtu.be/BirMIEA1oVI
---
How can we answer that for you?
---
If you have the time I would recommend you watch this vid for how to level and spec:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNHSOBkCYBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNHSOBkCYBk) 
---
FYI I'm pretty sure there's a FAQ on MMO champion in the classic section that states there will be no frontshredding. But the above video covers all alternatives as well.
---
Haha love that post! Reminded me of myself :D
---
Started when I was like 10? Really early because both my older Brothers played ;) Can't really call it playing tho - more like running around xD 
---
It was very late classic I think like a week after I started gimping TBC came out :) I´m 23 now. Can't wait for classic to come!
---
I bet we'll have a blast :P Don't let your friends get into the RL Sink again - let them destroy their whole RL and start building on the Virtual life like everyone should
---
Ya deep resto for mana tide is important
---
blizzard reacted quickly as they should    
---
personal, in this case public and used by streamers, is the think soda talked about
---
as someone said in another post, the moment live starts streamers will be forgotten about, its only like this because for people without beta this is the only access they have to it, and people that don't like the streamers are watching it and bitching more because they don't like the streamer, i dislike a lot of the streamers but i just keep clear of them to avoid the bitching others do not
---
RIP I figured as much.
---
I hope someone does this. But i’m figuring out which pvp servers have all the big streamers on it and staying.the.fuck.away.
---
Read the game manual. I'm not even kidding. My friend and I found it digging through old wow stuff at his house and it has a lot of great information! Also, the glossary of words from when the game came out is quite funny
---
I'd say if you Level a Warlock in the main game now - you will be even more hyped for classic because it is so shit to Play a Warlock nowadays on low Levels :D
---
I mean questing is okay. But when it Comes to dungeons.... Everything will be dead before your dots tick the first time :D
---
They probably won't be as common due to the dogma they can't tank - largely a relic from early vanilla when they quite literally couldn't tank - but with 1.12 itemisation and talent trees they'll probably be the best tank at the start of Molten Core for a few reasons.
---
You won't be the only one who is taking their time leveling. The vast majority of players are going to be casual levelers with a handful of no lifers rushing to 60. Our view is skewed because people posting on reddit are mega hyped and will be playing more than your average joe. Plus new people will be joining all the time when word gets out that classic is actually still good.
---
I can't burn out on classic at all too bad this has no weight on their decision on allocating beta keys xD
---
Read the game manual. I'm not even kidding. My friend and I found it digging through old wow stuff at his house and it has a lot of great information! Also, the glossary of words from 2004 is quite funny
---
Yes!
---
For those reasons do you think there should be streamer-free servers? I understand at launch you can just avoid the streamer’s chosen server, but what if they decide to re-roll on your server? Or transfer (and Blizzard have stated they will most likely open up transfers late in Classic)?
---
Read the game manual. I'm not even kidding. My friend and I found it digging through old wow stuff at his house and it has a lot of great information! Also, the manuals official glossary from 2004 is quite funny today
---
Is it really modern gamers? Or is it what devs think will g!ther to everyone? Im not sure tbh. Dark souls is one of the most successful new IPs in recent memory and i dont think the demographic of dark souls are a bunch of guys in his 30s
---
does that make asmongold kim kardashian of neckbeards?
---
Ok, so you think it was a good decision for Blizzard to intervene.
---
Where do you draw the line for them to get involved?
---
What if a non streamer hosts an event with way less people involved and they get disrupted. Does Blizzard have to monitor everything at all times? 
---
If the highly watched events get policed shouldn't small events get the same treatment?
---
&gt; The Beard
---
Nice name.
---
Everyone's free to think what he or she wants, but I personally don't see it like that at all. You also only talk solely about dungeons &amp; mythic, not about the leveling experience which was the biggest part of classic.
---
And like I said, I also don't think mythic is harder than some of the dungeons back then. It's just easier to fuck up, but if you know what you are doing they're qual.
---
Good druids don't actually use any HoT, they just cast various ranks of Healing Touch. One of the mid-rank Healing Touch spells is supposed to be the most mana-efficient heal in the game.
---
No. They gave it a voice and kept carrying it when the hype died down.
---
[Orcish] A N A L
---
HAHA GUYS, IT'S LOUD BASS AND MEMEY EDITS AIN'T I FUNNY?
---
I only played on pve as well and you are wrong.
---
hahaha
---
Pretty sure thats the whole point of this thread
---
Dark souls is not grindy in the way classic is, classic is not hard in the same way DS is, it requires time, commitment, and an eye towards very long term goals
---
The confirmed world record 1-60 for vanilla is 4 days and 20 hours played. Vast majority of even the good speed levelers don't approach that. 6 days played would be good for someone who knows what they are doing I would wager.
---
Illidan wasn't in Hyjal during classic, his imprisonment was over before classic even started. He used a portal to outland at the end of the events of Warcraft 3.
---
it is beta, I assume that when the game goes life, blizzard will help people to create their tournaments. The tournament was made in few days so I assume blizzard did their best they could.   
---
small events should get "help", something like special arena to make the tournament in.
---
It be a shamecause my main purpose on Classic is making certain streamer life miserable
---
No? You said the people answering the questions are perpetuating the wrong way of thinking about classic, you compeletely disregarded the possibility of them answering in a satisfying manner
---
what do you think we do when we attend sporting events?  go to the movies?  we're not supporting people just barely making a living...it's entertainment.  Now, if you're dirt ass poor and keep missing your phone payments, but donate to streamers...that's different.  If you have plenty of disposable income, then paying for entertainment should be reasonable.  Besides...it's five dollars.
---
After what sodapoppin said in this video, I hope he gets stream sniped all day, every day.
---
&gt;⁠Server queues will be atrocious. Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine just half of his followers trying to get into the game with him.
---
that's a good point, i haven't thought about that. damn, nevermind streamer only servers, there should be asmongold only server.
---
More hypocrisy than irony
---
Exactly why streamers are stupid and exactly why I don’t watch YouTube or twitch. 
---
It’s just a digital version of entitled spoiled kids.
---
This is meta
---
That one sounds more like trolling yourself to be honest.
---
Engineer is insanely powerful at 60
---
The long con.
---
TBH I'd just give it to them eventually. I'm more interested to see what blizzard would do. Would they actually give them special treatment
---
Mate, sign me up!
---
this here is the current live wow player attention span
---
Not really. Like maybe your leveling and don’t want to bother fighting at that moment. But if they are on the list it is a guarantee they are getting the business.
---
is that necessarily a false statement?
---
Basically if anyone ganks a streamer, they get blacklisted. It's utterly pathetic. I've seen tons of streamers on this beta whine about "stream sniping" from legitimate open-world PvP. How retarded do you have to be to not understand things like Track Humanoids and Cat's Eye Elixir exist in this game that's almost two decades old. I'll tell you though, no one is more retarded though than the idiots who believe all the shit that comes out of their mouths. ;P
---
I wouldn't call them lazy but I definetly don't understand the stance they take. They remove/lock so much content but let all the memes rise to the top. It has become a clownfest!
---
This inn isn't nearly crowded enough to be the beta waiting list [cries in no beta]
---
I'm not sure I understand what you mean. For my personal use, I can choose to adopt a streamer's Blacklist or not, depending on the criteria it is built on. In fact, I can choose to blacklist/ignore any player for any reason, whether I don't like his (ingame) hair colour, the punny character name, because of his guild, or for a million other reasons.
---
So I really don't get all the "what he asks for here is  invitation to get spawn camped 24/7" and "they will have the worst times of their life playing this game".  I should hope GMs deal with people repeatedly griefing other players over a longer time period, streamers or no.
---
i often make this mistake too. Dont underestimate stupidity no matter the age
---
"What if they fuck it up?"
---
Answer : we stay on Classic or move to TBC.
---
But, the REAL question is :
---
**"What if they DON'T?"**
---
And the answer is pretty damn obvious...
---
You can't just look at one side of the coin and use it as an argument against 1.13. "What if they fuck it up?"....Well, "What if they don't?"
---
It all comes down to this : human beings choose safety over risk...but EVERYTHING that we enjoy now in our lives comes AFTER someone took a risk.
---
You think that the guys who invented the plane, or the automobile, didn't risked? Or the guys who invented the computer? We would be living in a cave now, if people wouldn't took risks.
---
Yes, most of the times, it goes wrong...but when it goes right...
---
"But Blizzard fucked up Retail! We can't trust them !"
---
I'm at work, I have nothing but time to go to the toilet and watch YouTube :D
---
Classic didn't have 10 million that was towards the end of bc and early wrath
---
Buffing people gets addicting...
---
Feel lucky lol. Waiting since nostalrius
---
But I hope they ditch that stupid real life thing for the real game that's coming back?
---
We should be discussing important shit like what needs to happen after Naxx. But instead its just REEEE STREAMER REEEEE. For people who say they hate streamers they sure as fuck watch a lot of their content and make a lot of posts about them.
---
Only the loud minority cries for QoL things. I for myself only know players that do not want that stuff back.
---
I just wanted to point out that instead of listening to these self-appointed streamers and the small loud minority that spreads the word of the streamers as if it would be the word of god, they should think first and create a good, non-casual gaming experience again. Just ignore the streamers opinion and create your own. So I think we might both be on the same path.
---
I don't play WoW anymore and I don't watch streamers very often, but I love your moxie.  Fuck 'em up.
---
&gt; and some content was made with players being able to fly on their mounts in mind.
---
Like what? Aside from a couple of completely arbitrary locations where flying could pretty much be replaced by a staircase (Elemental Plateau, Skettis, Tempest Keep, probably something else that I forget), the only thing flying does in TBC is let you take shortcuts.
---
Source please :)
---
Not false.
---
Didn’t Soda use bots to inflate his twitch stream popularity?
---
level your main class, theres so many small things in the beginning that can put you ahead of the pack that you wouldnt believe
---
None of this is that serious nore should anyone care that deeply about it. It's a game everyone is going to play to enjoy. If you're that bored to get excited to jump someone you saw on stream just for the millisecond attention then expect the negative attention from someone who's streaming it. Also, none of this should personally effect your way of life based on another person's comments/beliefs.
---
It's disgusting. I won't be able to play at launch anyway so whatever, but baiting people into subbing two weeks prior to launch is fucked up.
---
The voices in your head cannot be considered a rumour friend
---
Clearly you didn't hear or were able to grasp his whole idea.
---
To you too: Go outside for a while. Take a walk in the sunlight. Away from people (max with closest family or a friend). Or watch the clear night sky for a while.
---
I don't get how people get like that ... who hurt you?
---
!remindme 80 days
---
We can talk about what should happen post Naxx. What is the future of this game. Classic is fully planned out from beginning to end which gives us the luxury of looking really far ahead.
---
The biggest part of Classic? I spent 20 days /played leveling to 60 when I knew nothing and had over 100 days /played when TBC came out. Leveling is a small part of WoW, always has been, and gets infinitely smaller the more time you spend in game.
---
8 hours a day?
---
lol, fuckin casuals.
---
Best way to make friends in wow. Everyone likes a hero healer.
---
Worn Shortsword
---
don't forget to get your mum's cred card and donate to your fav streamer, zoomer
---
there was an issue like that in Runescape where some lady streamer had a whiteknight admin banning anyone who PK'd her for stream sniping.
---
[Hmmm.](https://imgflip.com/i/32vze9)
---
What is extra funny is that someone already made a dungeon/raid finder addon for classic.
---
"Not my greatest drawing". Greatest undersell of 2019.
---
And most will be back in school before classic release lol
---
Yes thank you for agreeing with me and proving my point. Are you slow?
---
Discussing streamer clips = OK
---
Discussing what's happening on the Beta = OK
---
Post's with the sole purpose of talking about how terrible this streamer in particular is = completely unrelated to Classic wow. 
---
Discuss the content, not the person.
---
Back when classic was a thing ie 2004-2006 there were a lot of kids playing.  People act like times haven't changed or haven't adjusted their thinking, bad news, not many kids are playing WoW.  On retail I play with a few different guilds across a few NA servers and only one group from a family has any kids 18 and under in it.  Rest of the guilds and players are all people 25+, average age looking at 30+.  Most of your mob is grown ass adults.
---
This is such an unoriginal Savix ripoff
---
Tiger's Bane. I had that thing all the way from 40-60 because I had no clue where to get a stronger weapon that wasn't from the AH (I was a broke 12 year old). I'd spend hours and hours in wsg with my shitty +bonus damage to beasts Dagger and get slapped around all day, but I'll be damned if it wasn't fun.
---
It sounds cool but it really isn't.
---
You couldn't assembly a group of people to kill Hogger..stfu
---
On my server the theme was adding qt to the end if your name was taken, largely done by the PvP side of the community as calling someone cute / cutie was deemed really insulting for whatever reason, i had a druid called Beargryllsqt because someone had beargrylls.
---
Still annoying though, and my mains always had to have a name rather than [name][random acronym/letters].
---
Down with the evil beverage!
---
Eye of the beast is definitely handy when you want to pull shit out of a house. Get in with pet, run out and shoot down whatever runs out after the pet.
---
I love the idea of a guild called The Blacklist, down with those beta stealing streamers!!
---
Lol. get on a PvE server with the other whiners.
---
*Streamer expresses opinion*
---
Lets devote the rest of our lives to griefing him. Make guilds, rush progression, control the auction house just so we can target this one person.
---
And how do you know if they are stream sniping or just being regular camper ?
---
What proof are those streamers gonna have that the players killing them are stream sniping them or are just regular people playing the game as a good old regular camper ?
---
Why not just delay the stream by like 60 seconds and keep a “blur” effect on your stream console to conceal server ip’s and names when they flash up? It seems like this should be a relatively easy issue to mitigate risk on, you don’t have to be unsnipable, you just have to be harder to snipe than the next big streamer
---
not ganked, streamsnipping someone and ganking/camping is different...    
---
just cause some random streamer is an idiot doesnt mean it is the same thing soda talked about!    
---
again, he said he is fine if someone is ganking his ass, also keep in mind that in in retail, you can get ban for griefing
---
I don't think you should be blacklisted because you hunt steamers, I think you should be blacklisted because you think it's okay to hunt anyone. How fucking pathetic do you have to be to want to actively antagonize someone?
---
"one of the things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you"
---
Seriously? How sociopathic do you have to be to think it's okay to actively work to annoy people?
---
See, in this scenario, both parties are actively trying to keep the other from having fun. Except your fun is there to ruin their fun, while their fun is just the act of trying to enjoy the game.
---
this meme would have done better if you didnt refer to asmon
---
Asking Blizzard to give a soft version of GM powers to bubble living narcsisstic streamers is probably an even worse solution than doing nothing, those streamers are worshipped on a daily basis by a bunch of internet kids that will defend every move they make, they won't be able to make unbiased judgements.
---
You know how to tell if someone is going to be avoiding streamers? They'll fucking tell you.
---
How does he know they came across the whole map? Is he tracking them?
---
It seems like there could be room for error or mistake of judging who is sniping. But if that person then gets blacklisted just because Soda said so, then their character is ruined. It's a possibility. There must be another way to solve this problem without potentially blacklisting someone who might not have been sniping. Maybe the streamers should of just not play on a PVP server, or accept certain consequences of doing it.
---
Except that it's not. There literally wouldn't be a classic server without all the big WoW players constantly battling Blizzard about it. Don't act like history didn't happen. You think you do, but you don't.
---
Or full postmaster set as pre-raid ;)
---
That's... not what you said at all.
---
I'm very interested in the topic. I heard mixed opinions about the TPS, and the DPS is when a warrior wins. Provided, of course, that it's a speedrunning fury dual wield full threat gear warrior.
---
But if TPS is indeed higher, then druids might be a viable alternative. They'd also be way more tanky in this situation, reducing the risk of failure.
---
Hi, /u/AllstarJS
---
Pfft horde
---
Ever notice how you can still play games when you want as well? Streamers who rely on it as a source of income... can't. I sure as fuck wouldn't want to 'have' to play video games when I don't want to. Especially not now that I'm in my mid 20s and just don't view it as my #1 source of entertainment. Maybe some teenagers who stream, or people who are still in that honeymoon 12hrs/day playtime enjoy streaming daily. But I'd be surprised if people who stream enjoy playing the game as much as it appears.
---
Then they're gonna get ganked. As they should.
---
Broadcasting your location to everyone and then bitching when people use that information is either the dumbest or most entitled shit I've heard.
---
There is a difference between going to TBC/WoTLK and staying in classic. You forgot the part of the community that wants neither.
---
lol stop projecting
---
That isn't going to happen.
---
Sure they will get help from guildies / followers, but part of the content is the grind to scarab lord. Obviously the viewers are going to want to see that.
---
Nope beta will burn me out. Ready for release though.
---
Maybe you should stream it so we can all watch.
---
Feralas, Desolace, Azshara. The quiet places are the best.
---
lol thats me after so many years of wow - pvp hardmode
---
I want that blue post confirming RP-PvP servers \*\*at launch\*\* NOW.
---
I main a warlock since TBC until now in retail. They are completely different now. The experience of leveling one  has changed so much. If you have the itch to play go ahead and level one on BFA. It’s a completely different experience.
---
We did ad nauseum. These discussions are actually banned at the moment because we've seen them too much.
---
&gt;I only played on a PvE server and it was like that, there was just a lot more of non contested territories.
---
No it wasn't, you're probably thinking of the gurubashi arena or actually going into a town with PvP flagged guards.
---
This thread reeks of negative IQ.
---
Think about it though, sitting inside for 12h a day, 6 days a week isnt good for your health, mentally or physically. You need to get outside and move!
---
Normally I wouldn't say this, but yeah fuck these entitled streamers.
---
This reminds me of that murlork game on y8
---
discord link?
---
Its closer than any other race though
---
I never really understood why someone would even complain about stream sniping. You're broadcasting your experience, isn't that the point? For people to watch and interact with the streamer?
---
That's like walking down to street screaming "DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO ME" at the top of your lungs.
---
I used to have a rule for my freshly created characters. No logging off until i hit lvl 10 the first day. Then 20 the next. Also I HAD to win the first duel and battleground, otherwise the character was jinxed and i just rerolled.
---
Yeah I went through alot of lvl &lt;20 characters
---
A source that says that at release, we'll have 15k server populations, or a source that says, layering has this capacity and we'll be maxing that on all servers.
---
What I'm thinking they'll do is utilize the layers so instead of 600 NE, you'll see 200 and have the server cap at around what it was in vanilla.
---
But I don't have anything to go on, other than the devs saying they want classic to be as much like vanilla as possible, so I won't make claims or assumptions, unlike other people here.
---
I'm pretty sure that in many situations (e.g. the above-mentioned Maexxna) you need to trade mana efficiency for a HoT.
---
I agree with you, you are making sense but in the opposite ideology of this post, thus getti g diwnvoted. Stream snipping is waaay diferent than camping. You have a lot of advantages when snipping it’s just honorless... at least when camping you don’t just have a full display of every action the other player is doing in that world, regardless if it’s their choice to stream or not. Saying that is like saying oh she is wearing a skirt she deserves to be raped.
---
I didnt say it was. But both dont hold your hands like retail wow does. I guess the point is not about difficulty. I can enjoy easy games. Games who assume that im really stupid is my problem. And blizzard is the worst offender on this. Remember when they nerfed some hearthstone cards in the most stupid way they could have possibly have done it? Everyone hated that change. Their reasoning was that doing the reasonable change would be too confusing for new playerd. Cmon
---
its not like everyone participating in the blacklist would review every blacklisted name and decide if they agreed with the assignment. I guess we just agree to disagree  - I think soda’s idea was bad and you dont
---
Warlock will be the rogues favorite target befor bwl gear. Then only the skilled can kill you.
---
Why not both? Just re-release TBC and keep classic servers separate
---
Use a time delay if it's that big of a deal, ugh.
---
They don't make em like Alizee anymore *sip*
---
Going to TBC/WoTLK or Classic+ doesn't have to affect classic. Just have perm classic servers and new content come out on different servers.
---
I don't see why he can't just have a secret alt on another server or something. Yes he would need to keep his log in screen hidden on stream if he wants to play on the same server and yes he can't play it on stream.
---
If he wants a real experience then shouldn't it be in his own time and not while he is making money streaming? Most of us can't play this at work/school (it won't stop some from trying) but big streamers have a huge advantage because they have a way to play WoW for a living. 
---
Want to raid or do dungeons on steam? Hide chat with face cam don't discuss on voice chat and wait for the warlock to summon you. Or just play a PvE server.
---
This is the WoW he was asking for anyway, I don't think it's Blizzard's job to police an issue that came from streaming.
---
&gt; leaving a few merged classic servers alive for anyone that wants to remain there forever 
---
I hope you realize the stupidity of your comment.
---
NOBODY will pay $15 / month to play a game that have no new content. NOBODY.
---
Classic, in order to survive past Naxxramas, needs new content. It's that simple. No new content = dead game.
---
And don't come with the private example, because it's fucking different. They are FREE to play, and even in these conditions, they lost 90% of the player base in the last 3 years, from 1.3 million on Nost days to under 100k today. Again, while they are FREE TO PLAY.
---
I do not want TBC, I do not want Wrath, and there are millions like me. We want Classic...but not forever. We will enjoy the fuck out of Classic for couple years...and than WHAT?
---
Pay AGAIN $15/month for a content that I already PAID for and seen it for 2-3 years? I am sorry, but I am not crazy.
---
Go on TBC servers? I am sorry, but I hate TBC.
---
So, while for YOU it's fine to have Classic live for 2-3 years and than die, because YOU will play TBC and Wrath...for ME, that is not an option.
---
The ONLY reasonable solution is for Blizzard to re-release TBC while in the same time deliver post-Naxx content.
---
You will be against this reasonable solution because it will be clear that most people will opt for post-Naxx content instead TBC...but at the moment, this is the only way :
---
**BLIZZARD SHOULD DELIVER BOTH TBC AND POST-NAXX content.**
---
Otherwise, they will lose half the subs, from people that don't want TBC and will quit Classic because there is no new content.
---
Really hoping they go the OSRS route and let people vote for the quality of life changes.
---
Is it? Was [Angwe ever banned](http://liquidcode.org/%7Elostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/)? No, no he wasn't.
---
But then.. wouldn't YOU become q streamer? Then you would commit suicide? Or gank yourself somehow..?
---
Lul, man... It's funny cuz it's close to truth.
---
Classic Beta is definitely lower than retail.
---
On retail using the graphic slider I can't set it over an 8/10 questing alone out in the world to stay above 30fps.  In Raids I have to set it to like 5/10 to get decent FPS.
---
In the Classic Beta I have everything maxed and graphics at 10/10 and I get 100FPS everywhere.  Of course I haven't done any raids but it was fine during the stress test with a hundred people on the screen at once. 
---
I mean of course you are not going to be able to run it on a computer from ~2005 but anything somewhat modern is going to be fine.  My computer only cost ~$500 to build a year ago and it runs everything maxed.
---
For savning money while lvling, i guess if you want to midmax
---
Saying stream snipping is ok because that person is chosing to stream is so f**** up on so many levels. It’s like saying “she deserves to be raped she was wearing skirts and shit”. That’s the logic of a spoiled brat not so diferent than that spoiled brat named Sodapoppin.
---
I think it’s more the idea that you skip it early on when you need all the money you can get but learn it later
---
Orrrrr just don't stream snipe?
---
This guys has some interesting stuff to say in the second half of this section: 
---
 [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#rotation](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#rotation)
---
If you wan’t people to contribute you can simply do a github rep for your addon
---
Lol this doesn’t even make sense. Have you been drinking?
---
Obviously I stated already, I don’t think they are the most skilled players.
---
Stream at your own risk... dont want to get stream sniped... put stream in a delay.  These are some of the prices you pay becoming a big/popular streamer.
---
Also if someone gets blacklisted for stream sniping they can still stream snipe you again even if you are full T3 and they are in greens - they just bring more people.
---
I don't think so. Unless they were recorded on actual film, then I'm afraid you're shit out of luck.
---
Guess we should all work on our "charactical skills".
---
Play something totally different while you wait. Play an opposite faction warrior or something.
---
[lol](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/018/512/emhance.jpg)
---
He's definitely taking sadistic pleasure.
---
This guy gets it.
---
You could just switch into bloodvine set for raid boss fights.   Robe of the archmage will usually do higher dps on trash pulls / in 5 mans anyway.
---
You aren’t gunna get it because the wow community accepts it’s okay to stream snipe and camp streamers for clout. We both know playing pve is such a different experience and you can still get organic world PvP as a streamer absolutely. The problem is when losers just spend their life to camp them, obviously when people find the streamer out and about in contested areas it’s more likely they’ll fight them and large scale PvP can still happen as a streamer.
---
Just cuz you stream doesn’t mean you should get different experiences. I really don’t understand the streamer hate from the wow community, in most games they are praised for bringing attention to the game and making it hype. The more attention the more customers the more money, which hopefully the company uses to help better the game and not on some shitty fuckin cosmetics and buyables
---
I think we’re going to see pretty high numbers. The lack of success Aussie pservers suffer from, is more likely a symptom of lack of awareness (rather than lack of interest).. I mean people are genuinely surprised when I tell them there are active aus based private servers
---
I'm just saying I'm not sure the modern gamer wants to grind that hard
---
Exactly, they dont even need to farm for mount or anything else people just give them gold.
---
I thought vanilla wow waas for the common player not the entilted little S...
---
The blacklisting thing will only lead to more problems. People don't understand the amount of leverage streamers can have. It all starts with blacklisting "streamsnipers" to blizzard starting getting involved and banning players. I don't want blizzard to lean torwards the streamers. If they decide to do the blacklisting and blizzard stay out of it it wont affect the lowering of streamsniping. So it's not a solution it's like adding more fuel to the fire. 
---
All your points give reasonable solutions to the question and it depends on what they decide and not make the community responsible by blacklisting players.
---
Big wall of text is big
---
I just pointed out how obvious and yet irrelevant your comment was. But hey, go ahead and insult me, it'll sure prove you're right.
---
Streaming is placing a huge laser on your head saying "Free kill look i'm here".
---
Don't stream, don't get sniped. Welcome to open world PVP. It's why a majority of us want Classic.
---
And there will be nobody left to play.
---
You know why? Because nobody will PAY for the same content, again.
---
Private servers are FREE.
---
Classic servers are NOT.
---
Wait  those discussions are banned but not the endless REEE STREAMER REEE posts?
---
can we ban posts about streamers already
---
Xxlegolasx is mine!!!!!!
---
good or bad i dont care
---
This is why Soda's suggestion was so great. A lot of people missed the fact that his idea would only work on a streamer heavy server. His suggestion was that streamers all band together on ONE server.
---
That means that all the streamers are in one place to [ruin/improve stream content] and no one else has to deal with any of the big streamers on their server.
---
At most one server is effected which will mostly be populated by fans.
---
But no, people decided to fucking REEEEEEEE at completely within the rules social interaction which was just a thing in vanilla.
---
I get what you’re saying and I agree stream sniping should be expected when you’re a big streamer, but thats not a good analogy, it would be more fitting if it was more like 
---
You are walking down the street and someone puts his leg and you trip and fall. 
---
What Im saying is people chatting in his presence or being simply on screen isnt the problem.
---
It's funny how WoW Classic can be both considered a hardcore game, or a casual game, purely depending on the direction you're looking from.
---
Any reason to go dual wield spec as a tank? If you're using a shield it doesn't really make sense.
---
"World PvP" is just 60's chain-farming people in the 50's range for infinite honor
---
I wonder what the guy is up to now (the mage, not Kungen).
---
😂🤣😂😅😅🤣😂😅
---
You are actually trolling.  Why would a private server youtube streamer be given access to the beta for being a streamer.
---
think there is going to be a lot of people that never played in vanilla wanting to get the classic feel only to realise there were a lot of classes that were very restricted on what specs they could play in raids
---
Really good video. You had a lot of options with bfa (server lagging, people phasing out or just completely ignoring each other etc). Anyway i subbed.
---
People will still go on all the servers and do all the names tho
---
Was implying to the "content creators" whos content is only to cause drama in internet. Im sure if you would read the post properly, you'd understand.
---
I know this answer, but i've read most of these threads for the last 2 years now. This is how it looks like, and this is what you can see in almost every threat of the sort. In short, what people want.
---
Everquest approach
---
OSRS approach
---
TBC
---
TBC+
---
WoTLK
---
WoTLK+
---
PvP/PvE/RP servers
---
Fresh servers.
---
You simply can't make everyone happy, and the community split will be massive. Not only a healthy overall amount of people will be required to keep these, but there is also Faction balance. This is the problem, there seems to be equal amount of "Pro changers" that simply can't get it. On the other side we have the No changers (like me).
---
I mean, good luck to Blizzard if they do it. I wonder how long it will be before they inevitably try to make everyone happy and screw it all up yet again.
---
At least till Dobby realizes that he has to restart soon anyways.
---
It’s 2019 we got entitled babies streamers and entitled baby griefers. Just don’t play on their realm how about that. Instead you chose to suffer on reddit and forums on how a person you don’t even cone in contact with is destroying a game that it’s nit even released yet. You all will die of cancer due to stress and literally being cancer yourselves.
---
The streamers aren't as bad as the beta people who will do stupid stuff because they seen a streamer do it and they think it's funny. I can't wait to watch them shoot their own feet because they will build super negative reputations 
---
&gt;Kick Merceron, he's a known ninja and he will delete items if you ask for them just because he thinks it's funny. We don't want him in the group.
---
&gt;Merceron has been removed from the group.
---
Que the flame of hatred by the idiots who "were just having some fun"
---
My idea of a good Classic experience after launch:
---
1) Pick a streamerless server
---
2) Enjoy
---
thank you
---
Separate stats, including spell critical strike and spell hit.
---
really hope they don't because I've seen how the people on this subreddit think, and they're even the less dumb ones
---
I wish I could do that with this sub. Can we start a sub where the posts with the word streamer are auto-deleted?
---
You're making money to stream your favorite video game daily. Suck it up if you're killed a few times because you're broadcasting yourself.
---
Or add a massive delay. Reee.
---
Blacklist streamers and all their lil cuck fans
---
i really prefer not having cross-faction chat, because it gives you that sense of 'other'.  you can only have very limited conversation through emotes, like in a real war almost.  It gives you much more reason to pvp since you dont know if you can peacefully ignore eachother... and sometimes its best to shoot first
---
but then its all the sweeter when you have a peaceful encounter
---
Now while it is important that players are testing beta but still It's really amazing how many people are buying gametime just for a chance to get into beta.  FOMO is strong. Well, activison blizzard must be happy :)
---
I really never have appriciated streamers more than I Do now. They do important testing and I can also follow beta progress without paying 13 euros a month and lvling a character you lose anyways. Thank you streamers.
---
I just really hope they announce what server they're playing on so I can avoid it like the plague.
---
Can we make it RP also :)
---
A hack is circumventing a system that the developers put in place to avoid piracy/cheating/exploiting/etc. If someone broadcasts their location and someone else uses that information that's the broadcaster's own stupid mistake. No reason to get the devs involved for something like that at all.
---
This is such a good analogy for this.
---
you can stream snipe, nobody said you cannot? you will just end up on their blacklist so whats the issues here
---
Deus Vult!
---
For fuck sake and all that is holy, this this this.
---
Maybe not, but I think his e-celeb status at that point in time gave him access to a level of teammates that he never had before.
---
I spent two seasons as a holy paladin with really good teammates. I'm a decent player, but could never hit those 2700+ ratings until I started playing with those two guys, especially the DK. One of those seasons was actually a time where I tried playing with Soda doing Kittycleave, we didn't do terribly well. This would have been around 2011. In fairness we only played maybe 10 games, if we kept at it as a team, maybe we'd have started getting up into the 2500s.
---
God What does that make you
---
Its a mob of people rubbing their hands together grinning at the thought of a never ending streamer hunt. I dont agree with soda, but I also find the idea of creating a guild to hunt down streamers to be a petty and pathetic act.
---
Judging by this subreddit, the community cares a lot. If nobody cared, people wouldn't be burying this place in retarded streamer drama.
---
Jump on a private server and test it out there. If you want to try it at higher levels you can setup your own server and just do .levelup to increase your level. It's actually really simple.
---
what do you mean?
---
&gt;  keep classic servers separate 
---
With or without post-Naxx content? 
---
If without, those servers will close in no time.
---
In the clinical sense.
---
The people who will leave for new content servers might not stick around if classic becomes a dead end. I personally like classic+. Keep it as close as possible to vanilla but with new raids and dungeons.
---
My only gripe is that it uses the new addon tech, which has benefits like being able to grab mobdata so things like DoT timers won't break when you dot a second identical mob and the updated combat log data means threat meters and damage meters won't be wonky as hell.
---
The downside is that you can track pretty much everything, and making WA strings that use radar data, etc massively change the difficulty of content, hence why world first guilds have in house addon devs.
---
I'm fairly sure they said they'd look into limiting the API to prevent people simply using addons to recreate functionality of previous QoL features, but idk about their views on addons having too much scope for the "simplicity" of Classic's PvE content.
---
Heigan for example would be a cake walk if you had an addon that popped a radar up on your screen and told you exactly where to stand, which will exist without intervention because they exist for all mythic bosses with mobility mechanics.
---
sidenote; I also make really good WA strings and have a friend who's a god at it, so if nothing gets changed my guild will have an early advantage unless someone publishes one early.
---
Agreed
---
It's different, yes, but not difficult
---
If you want some data about Druid tanks you should read Talaldril's guide. It's all based on private server data though as far as I know. Conclusion is 
---
-Feral Druid are the best tps in Vanilla
---
-Tier 3 is godly for warrior
---
-Main tanks must use dps consumables
---
-Defense is overrated
---
-Damage spikiness is not so bad
---
-tps with hungering could should be higher then Thunderfury
---
-Druids take more dps
---
-Ferals allow tanks to absorb tank gear faster
---
-Feral tanks are optimal for raid comps
---

---
Stuff I noticed myself. Druid can be second tank and is often second in threat. If the mt dies the druid often finishes tanking the boss for a kill.
---
Can't you get banned?
---
Not possible
---
Mag'har are the uncorrupted orcs. You find them in Outland.
---
My troll paladin is a zandalari. They have an Aztec like kingdom, with a sun/gold theme. Paladin fits them well
---
This is kinda false.
---
I mean, you are not wrong, but why in these situations we're always assuming you are the only one being dedicated and bringing consumables etc?
---
What if your guild also has dedicated players playing Paladins/Shamans and Priests and they also study their classes and bring consumables?
---
At the end of the day there is a "tier list" and yes, Druids are at the bottom of it.
---
Wait a minute... a reasonable opinion.. in this sub.
---
Hyyype
---
Yet another fantastic reason to not play on Soda's server.
---
Just make a frostbolt macro with the fireball icon then fuck with the gamma on your monitor and you can be fire spec
---
I mean he did, he roled a gnome
---
Fucking amen
---
Going into molten core as a sl/nightfall warlock. It’s good in pvp, so it must be good at pve as well!
---
**[PLAYER INTERACTION INTENSIFIES]**
---
Just reset them every couple of years, kind of like Diablo 2 ladders which are STILL going.
---
Is that possible?
---
It wasn't for some Master Plan(tm) by the genius designers at Blizzard HQ, the game was rushed and very little content was finished at release... Including many classes
---
&gt;Streaming is a huge circlejerk and the recent drama unfortunately don't prove otherwise 
---
Oh no my precious streamer said a bunch of dumb shit online and is dealing with the repercussions of his actions
---
Reddit you're so mean! You evil echo chamber! 
---
Sure soda, here's another donation, you and chat are so right
---
In the context of movies or sport events, you pay for access/viewing privileges.
---
It doesn't cost anything to watch a streamer's content - the donation is completely voluntary and optional, and doesn't really provide you with anything that has tangible value.
---
Thanks!
---
Does he stream every day?  I haven't seen clips from him here in a while.  Of course it's not a job if you only do it when you feel like it.
---
but...but... I need to snipe streamers and then complain about how they are ruining the game! I can't just play on another server or choose to ignore them! That would be too logical!
---
Yeah, it's like obsessing about celebs in between seasons of your favorite show. Like who really gives a fuck.
---
For all intensive purposes.
---
The best thing streamers created was this Duel competition. Could you imagine a organized thing. Like regional stuff with realm champions dueling each other? That would be awesome
---
I’d say there is a difference between one person specifically and to the whole server
---
I dont think setting up a button for each totem is worth it, but for macros for SET of totems.
---
You have your basic, doing damage set, healer totem set, healer in melee group, totem twisting macros etc. Then you have the situational totems you are dropping 1 by 1. Like tremor, cleanse, slow etc.
---
So you want to do group of totems in binds that have same duration and are \~almost always used together and then those situational totems (usually much shorter duration totems). But as a shammy healer you will have multiple ranks of the heals you use, so you are going to need a LOT of keybinds regardless.
---
Okay so take a 100% mount and ride from Hellfire to Netherstorm and record the time
---
Depends on the class you fight. Against Hunter Mage Warrior Rogue Feral Enha you ll melee quite a bit.
---
...and also predict player base on long term, while in the same time preparing to move 10.0 to mobile.9/0 will still be on PC, but 10.0 will be on mobile only.
---
I'm pretty sure he just created a monster (i.e. people that will band together solely to stream snipe him and the other stramers).
---
And if these guys are plenty, the blacklist will have no effect on them, since they'll be able to play together.
---
Okay, so if griefing is something that the Blizzard Staff is going to deal withn, then what's the problem then?
---
Oh, right! It's because these streamers want to redefine what "griefing" is, outside of what Blizzard will enforce again. Notice that Soda said that he wants the OPPOSITE faction to ban them as well, which means he considered ENEMY FACTION players who gank him and corpse camp his ass to be "griefers" which is ABSOLUTELY false.
---
I was a legendary camper on my server, spending entire days with a buddy of mine camping between raids. Stay out of pvp areas if you are worried about your dumbass stream
---
I respect your idea, but I also think that stream snipers should be banned for 1 or 2 days. I'm not into wow, but hearthstone or lol for example. In hearthstone the game immediately stops being fun. In league, wether you stop the stream or your team will be in disadvantage.
---
Imagine physically suffering over a game.
---
If you ever get to bwl, that's a serious time commitment
---
What does that means clearly?
---
Mostly just spellpower/intellect weapons. I doubt i’ll ever have time for raiding, so im just going to tank UBRS and heal bgs
---
or, you know, humor? But hey, good for you buddy
---
not what he meant, sorry to crush your witch hunting
---
I knew this wouldn't be easy for you
---
Its not difficult though.
---
&gt;this entire subreddit is just reposts of the same question 20x a day
---
Well yea. The game isn't out. It's to same for any game that has a sub Reddit but isnt out
---
I never said I was against updating the classic server with TBC. I was merely proposing another option during another discussion.  See how replying rationally instead of angrily can work? It's great, you should try it.
---
I hate these drama queens, please go back to Retail
---
YOUNG AND SWEET
---
ONLY SEVENTEEN
---
Can't forget the golden rule... If it's red, it's dead!
---
It's not just those posts, they deleted pretty much any post that wasn't sucking up to streamers.  I got a post deleted just requesting streaming free servers, wasn't bashing streamers at all.  
---
I hope blizz wakes up and realizes who is going to make them money with classic and it's not streamers.  They will move on when the next great thing pops up.
---
Honestly with the xp boosts you could probably get max lvl in vanilla in 3 days too
---
no cant do
---
Fun read.
---
your point?
---
It wasn't really screwed up, it was just tbc numbers in a few cases
---
In my experience that wasn't even prevalent but I haven't played on a ton of them, only a few
---
I'd like a questhelper that only shows where the quests are. Like yourself I like to find out where to do the quest by myself. There are so many hidden quests though and I want to avoid grinding as much as possible.
---
Or to play in it
---
You're unintelligent and misled
---
I have to laugh at some people on r/wow who are mad when they see post about Classic news and have to write comment about how Classic news belong on r/classicwow.
---
Because those retail fanboys think r/wow = r/bfa or something, completely ignoring the fact wow = world of warcraft. I'd stop visiting that sub if mods would ban Classic news. By the way it was actually suggested.
---
Lmao, even worse, you keep at it, but being just slightly bad each time, just enough to ruin the raids! Tiny mistakes that make them wipe, again and again, and each damn time "oh sorry won't happen again"
---
I hope you know what you're getting yourself into then. If you already play a ton of vanilla ignore me caus you already know this, but in case you don't: 
---
Training every spell every rank while leveling in vanilla is a surefire way to make sure you never have any money. People will tell you that it will make buying mount harder, and it will, but if you train literally everything it will be so much worse than just mount. You will walk away from the trainer with 2silver left every time. Unless you devote a significant amount of time to grinding gold instead of leveling, you won't even be able to afford every spell for most of your levels, because you won't have recovered from the gold sink from the last time you trained, 2 levels ago.
---
If you're a veteran who does this all the time, I admire your insanity, but if Classic will be your first (or first in decades) foray into Vanilla WoW, I strongly recommend you reconsider.
---
Yes, they will. I think almost everyone that plans to play long term on Classic will resub on Aug. 13th.
---
That will give Blizzard a clear image of how many people will STAY after launch period, how many realms to fire up and how many layers per realm (probably 2 layers for most realms, maybe 3 on streamers realms).
---
it's just a joke anyway, relax :') I'm EU I won't be doing that
---
True lol
---
If you have a mouse that has one side button and a clickable wheel you can get 8 keybinds just from your mouse.
---
My mouse is my main form of key binding and I bind a lot of abilities that go together on my mouse wheel. It’s very easy to bind a trinket and a cool down ability to scroll up and down on the mouse wheel and just flick up and down and both your abilities go. 
---
Mouse wheel up, down, click, side button , shift mouse wheel up, shift down, shift mouse wheel click, shift mouse side button.
---
Then other easy key binds I find are ~(tilde) next to the 1 button. Shift space bar is another easy key bind. 
---
I was never a fan of removing strafing buttons (q and e) so I found a way around it in my years of playing.
---
Hope some of these help!
---
Honestly if classic has enough players I’d like more content in 1.13
---
I know what Classic+ is supposed to be, been reading these threads all day every day. "Add this" but no one going in depth... Sometimes having an opportunity to play different game will make you go there, but it doesn't mean you will leave your old one if there isn't another.
---
Ofc some people will quit eventually for some reason, that's natural. Doesn't mean they need to be catered to. There however will be people that want to take their time and not being forced to rush it. There will also be people that will quit for one reason or another, but even if 5 years pass, they know where they can get back to. If there are also fresh servers, even better.
---
"Make servers for everyone", refer to my previous post.
---
that has nothing to do with my "claims", but thank you for making it personal. way to have a discussion
---
One goes bah the other goes moo!
---
i'm torn between wanting to play on the streamer server for the drama or downright avoiding that shit all together. if i do join the streamer server, i will definitely be joining this guild
---
L H is the big vanilla server after Nost. It had 6k people on constantly and over 100k accounts in total
---
I don’t think they would, what if someone else genuinely uses those names before they knew about the streamer? Just SOL i guess.
---
Na what would I do? Grind my way up to level 40 and then what? Grind the same dungeons over and over again? No thanks. I'll just wait for Classic release.
---
I responded to a comment or you calling people idiots and assuming they don't understand something about a man child's proposition.
---
This was never a discussion.
---
U get ur first G around 12/13 usually, then another 5 levels; he’s a warrior so possibly grinded a lot too. So no, not bullshit .
---
Server list will be PRIOR to August 13th. I would say couple weeks prior.
---
Urg but guild leading classic. You gotta have 40 to raid, so you need a raiding roster of like 50, that means your guilds going to be like over 100 with all the casual friends and trials. Man that shits hard work.
---
I don't care what they do after classic as long as classic stays intact and any expansion/patch if a split off where you can copy your char. I think that should be the major idea behind classic, immortalize it.
---
And BC or a 1.13 patch can be great, hell why not both? As long as they're done on new servers, some could be fresh while others let us copy chars. Perhaps we'll get to a point with too many version, but I for one would welcome that idea. Hell, we could even start doing annual classic wow seasons too.
---
Fair points, I still lean toward thinking it's fair game. I wont be streamsniping and plan on ignoring streamers as much as possible.
---
Dude, it's so different it's not even funny. You are really comparing PvP to rape?
---
Your comparison would be fair if said girl was rolling in a "Rape-allowed world" and she entered in that world willingly.
---
Sodah has the option of rolling PvE servers.
---
Not just "difficult."
---
Challenging and rewarding.
---
Not sure about that, cause they'll need to be present or they'll lose their viewership quite fast. It won't be like the beta, people will be playing, so the viewer count will drop
---
If you blindly follow an addon that tells you not to pick a spell and you don't know why, you are bad at the game.
---
Also, if you are a priest on a pvp server and don't pick one of the best CC because you want to save 1 gold... I don't know dude.... Even for Scartet Monaster MC can use useful.
---
Can't invent new pixels, sorry.
---
Why? This isn't against ToS.
---
This sub that been very positivt about player reputation mattering. If streamsniping is gonna get you shunned by the realm community then that is self afflicted.
---
they are saying soda wants to ban gankers, that is completely wrong. meanwhile you said I'm idiot for having different opinion
---
Getting the best gear, like, the very best, will take time. Leveling your character, leveling professions, and combat skills all come comparatively very fast.
---
Getting 99 in a skill is a huge task, getting 99 in all skills is a huuuuge undertaking. Getting to 60 in wow is expected.
---
Just a very different game.
---
PvP happening in a PvP server? HERESY!
---
Zelda
---
You can only track one thing at a time. And yes, mining gives you the ore tracking and alchemy the flower one.
---
Did someone mention [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Great post mate - actually something I have not seen mentioned too often in this reddit - you are right.
---
But surely one of the important things for Classic WoW. 
---
Who doesn't still remember the shouting of his Guild or Raid leader in his ears when he goes back to the first MC, ZG or AQ runs :) 
---
Memory wise the high ranked members of the Guild are defenitely up there!

---
No I called you unintelligent and it has nothing to do with your opinion.
---
That's the beauty of adding new raids and dungeons. No power creep, doesn't affect the rest of the game in anyway. It's just new shit to clear for no other reason than you enjoy playing the game. Gear is not any better, doesn't affect the meta, its just pure content.
---
Druids are great!
---
Good healers - like all healers, have their niche.
---
Good tanks - only the most minmax guilds stacking 33 warriors won't ever take a good bear. 
---
Can deal decent DPS as feral, while providing aura and not competing for weapons.
---
Can do DPS as boomkin, while providing the aura. The numbers won't be too impressive but who cares - Vanilla raids barely have DPS checks!
---
Great and very fun in wPvP. Have their place on BG.
---
Great levelers. Run fast starting from level 20, and even faster after 30!
---
TL;DR: if you want to roll a druid - ignore what haters are saying. The only real downside is that the farming (MCP, runes, PvP gear, few sets of preraid gear) *for semi-hardcore+* guilds is quite time-consuming.
---
The issue is the sense of entitlement on the part of the streamer.  If they choose PvP, and they choose to stream their location to thousands of people, they should deal with the consequences. Who can decide if someone is sniping or not? The streamer getting camped? A system where someone with an obvious sense of entitlement is judge and jury? What could possibly go wrong ?
---
Yeah! Because that's what I was referencing and not the psychology that is the basis for actively hunting someone on stream for the sake of trying to hurt them! You sure did get it!
---
Fucking idiot.
---
Somehow [this](https://youtu.be/asqL-FU_9ok?t=93) sprung into my mind.
---
That is 110% certain.
---
And logical.
---
ah remember when wow was an rpg? can't wait for this again
---
Could propably re-name the title, because thats true. Wether its reddit, twitch, youtube, etcetc.
---
Unfortunately i did also realize im also circlejerking, but in the opposite "side" 🤔
---
Maybe we just post only good memes, so internet could be less of a shitshow dik. Quilty.

---
You don't have to be interested in this post for it to be "viable" to you. It's just my thoughts on models, if you don't like it that's cool, but it's definitely not a troll post.
---
Yeah it's likely going to be a mix of old Barrens chat and Twitch chat. I've seen some of it still go on today like Thunder Fury or Leather Belt. The worst part would be people spamming Trade Chat just to try and get the streamers attention.
---
I'm fortunate enough that there aren't as many big EU streamers. Apologies to the NA crowd facing these problems but I'm interested to see how those servers are going turn out in the end.
---
Yeah, he thinks that until the day he gets mad because he's dying a lot and decided that his ganker SURELY was sniping him.
---
What then?
---
Yeee
---
Eu-Baelgun. Nothing noteworthy except that the alliance outnumbered horde by 80/20 resulting in a very close nit hordecommunity who kicked serious butt in bgs because they had so much more experience with their instantqueues.
---
Is this Soda, like the guy that used to play a druid and then priest years and years ago? (Played RLS 3s, I would botch the spelling of Venruke?!? and the rogue varied a bit). He looks similar, but it has been a long time - might need to watch his streem. If that's him, he wasn't a mean or bad person back in the day.
---
I thought this is about the blacklist and now about intelligence, so again, you are making it personal. as expected
---
I’m trash at PvP but I’m down to zerg Soda.
---
its pretty much the same
---
Someone finally gets it! 
---
To add onto your comment...I'll take my five weeks of vacation time, benefits, insurance,  401k, etc over the unpredictable streaming environment any day of the week.
---
Figuratively*
---
don't give them any ideas
---
I don't know. This sounds like a really fun PvP event.
---
I work in marketing and you’re a fucking idiot
---
Calling Soda a "Communist" is absurd.
---
It's barely viable to raid as a ret paladin

Depending on the requirements for being able to vote it could work just fine. Remember that in OSRS they require a supermajority of 75% yes votes to pass. You also need a minimum number of skill points on your character and hours played in OSRS.
---
Other than the supermajority, the requirements could be something like: 
---
* Level 60 on the account
---
* A max level profession (or maybe two, idk)
---
* Completion of current content on some level
---
This is just of off the top of my head and not at all thought through.
---
100% this!!!
---
Not special treatment, but obvious logical treatment.
---
Streamers are making free advertising for Classic, and Blizzard WILL, 110%, reserve those names before they open the reserve name on Aug. 13th.
---
I don't see it a special treatment, I see it as a logical business move.
---
 Man, he's right, there you go, more:

---
You know you’re playing vanilla wow when you chase people across the map to buff them.
---
yup, its not like i support soda's idea on cross faction collusion either. 
---
but common guys a purposeful streamsniping and just organic ganking is a two different things. get some freaking sense.
---
Streamers are the cancer of videogames comuniy with fanboys
---
they are dealing with it, they are making blacklist... it is people here that have issues with that
---
So new WoW players are going to find it really hard to troll on their main. If Chance thinks this should happen, and the server he's on likes the idea and implements it, then democracy has been served. 
---
This is how classic servers worked. This is how a community works to get rid of problematic players.
---
Yep, it's a different story for the warlock though :(
---
With tailoring that set is BiS until T3. And not only one piece of T3, you need at least two out of these three items; Leggings of Polarity (or kazzak leggings I suppose), T3 chest and T3 boots. The boots are easy to get, drops from Razuvius. Chest is from 4H, not easy at all to get and legs are from Thaddius, not very easy either. 
---
Without tailoring though you can start replacing it in AQ with the SR garb and possibly the full T2,5.
---
Banned by blizzard? No
---
Except there's a difference between ninja looting/scammming.... and PvPing in a PvP server
---
I would guess it can be implemented via addons
---
I think the only way to have fun, is to have fun. Kk Bye have a beautiful time!
---
I don't inherently have a problem with addons, and I never stuck hard and fast with the "no changes" thing anyway other than the fact that any small change you make can have a sizable impact in other areas you don't foresee, so you'd have to be careful about things you change. 
---
I don't have  a problem with DPS meters, or even something like Weak Auras but I don't like quest helper add ons or add ons that fill your mini map with all kinds of icons, to me that takes away from the spirit of vanilla a bit.
---
Oh yes, “humour”. Calling it humour it’s just your label, not the truth.
---
From the private server? Yes you can but why would you ask that
---
There won't be low pop servers.
---
I am kinda amazed that most people don't understand this.
---
So, where do I sign up?
---
You expected someone to point out how unintelligent you are? 
---
Do you really re-read what you type in response to people and go "yeah that's right"
---
The one day I decided to hoof it to Org and just sit outside the gate with a few Hordies. It was neat. And then I got ganked, and they /patted my corpse.
---
All soda does is bitch about how hard the streamer life is
---
Switch "difficult" to "engaging", and I agree.
---
Fuck man. This guy is the biggest baby.
---
L2Google.
---
The issue is, the the streamers, and their ~~community~~ herd believe that someone streamsniping them should be punished by Blizzard, as if they had broken the ToS.
---
This sense of entitlement is the problem, and you are in support if it.
---
Piksaus is a good edgy name for UD rogue.
---
That would be awesome mate. I sent you an email.
---
Put a delay on the stream
---
Yes, and people SHOULD have issues with someone trying to push their sense of entitlement on an entire community.
---
Yep. That can be crazy unbalanced like 4:1 lol
---
&gt;In reality you’re only doing it because you seem insecure and distraught that they are better entertainers and gamers than you so
---
Not true, I will do it simply because I can. Will I do it all the time? No and I probably wont do it on my main even to avoid their 'armies' from spamming me with threats. Just because Ill use information given (stream) dosnt mean they are better than me (it is likely though being they play more). It just means that have a shit strategy when it comes to defense (broadcasting your location).
---
blacklist is not list the blizzard will use to ban people
---
Quel'Serrar. I remember getting kicked from my guild because I wouldn't give the book to the main tank. I had found the book in a Dire Maul tribute run that was 100% pug and they never mentioned this policy before.
---
A top raiding guild on the server was nice enough to let me come in for onxyia to get my sword breathed on.
---
Had that thing for all of vanilla. Even used it and Dal'rend offhand for Fury PvP occasionally.
---
Loved that sword.
---
Irregardless, I think we're done here.
---
I'm with you. Especially with travel times in vanilla. It's so frustrating to spend like 20 minutes traveling from stonetalon to tarren mill only to find everything is being camped and the flight master is dead. World pvp is fun when it's with people the same level, but that so rarely happens, particularly when you're behind the leveling curve because you can only afford to play a few hours a week.
---
I played PvE in vanilla, did pvp on p servers, and I'm headed straight back to PvE for classic.
---
Yes - Retail is hard if you're going to mythic raiding and pushing for higher keys.
---
Yea except there's no way for Soda to know with any real certainty if dude is a stream sniper in the above situation.
---
This "complete asshole" didn't break a single rule doing what he did. Once we start banning people for daring to interrupt a streamer event, were do we stop? Raidlead not assignit item to the streamer? Better prepare for a perma, you nasty person who interrupted the streamers presentation to his audience...
---
Did you missed the part of $15/month? Because I didn't.
---
I can replay the same content for FREE....but PAYING for, AGAIN? And AGAIN?
---
It is not feasible.
---
Without post-Naxx content, Classic is dead.
---
Oh boy...
---
They will have even more viewers, ppl play and watch streams same time
---
so? people kept banning people from stuff back in old days because griefed too, what's wrong? you mad cause it is streamer's list?
---
Fuck streamers honestly
---
Should have been more clear. I mean Holy PvP talents.
---
I'm literally not going to do this, this is just a meme about finding more creative ways to be a dick. If you don't find this funny that's YOUR fuckin label buddy, some people will find it funny, others won't, so I'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back and go browse until you find your kind of humour. Have fun over there!
---
What I've found raiding across a large spectrum from guilds that can't even get passed Vael to server 3rd Kel'Thuzad is that druids tend to do exceptionally well in mid-tier guilds IF he knows what he's doing. A good druid will be on par or better than a similarly skilled and dedicated priest/paladin. I know nothing about the Horde situation though. Unsurprisingly, a druid that stands out like that will likely be poached by the higher tier guilds, hence they don't stay around for long. In the top tier guilds there is usually one druid who is competitive and because HoTs don't stack the other druids will fall behind.
---
The only thing that is more difficult in retail is fresh raids on highest difficulty before it's nerfed. But for the majority of WoW players, you only need to raid on normal or easy level to get items making you a hero anyway. So you can clear all content by pressing 1 button as healer for example, almost being AFK from lvl 1 until the last raid.
---
I mean, part of Vanilla charm was the utterly atrocious gear design. Warriors, hunters needing on leather for being bis, all the way up to AQ40. That's one example. The stats, the way to acquire it... absolute bullshit.
---
Heavy RPG items, with broken OP procs and ridiculous usages. Bis items from level 40 dungeons, carrying you up to MC+. Stats that make absolutely no sense.
---
I mean, it takes exactly one or 2 new dungeons or 1 raid, to shake how this used to work, and we have ToC/IC dungeons all over again... making 80% of the game brainless and pointless once they were released.
---
Can it be done? Maybe, but i'd wager it will require more dedication than making a new BFA expansion.
---
It takes one slip, one.
---
Well.... he might as well be a genius because now I want to watch his stream to see him getting camped. So yeah, he's going to get way more viewers
---
&gt; blizzard reacted quickly as they should
---
No, they shouldn't.
---
The guy didn't break ANY rules set forth in the ToS.
---
The fact that you are defending this, tells me all we need to know about you: You want the rules of the game bending around the whims of your attention-whoring idols.
---
Agree to disagree there I think
---
Alliance side there's always a demand for warlocks. Even in MC having those banishes makes fighting Garr way easier!
---
There is the petition...  [https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases](https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases)
---
ARCANITE REAPER WAAAAAAUUU
---
I'd say it's because the time commitment is hardcore but the difficulty is casual.
---
you seem to be way more triggered by stuff that most likely wont touch you at all. the idiot was griefing, that is bannable since ever
---
I keep seeing this comment on posts like this. It’s perfectly fine for people who want to have a conversation about post phase 6 to have said conversation. 
---
I mean if you don’t like the conversation maybe just don’t waste your time with posts like this? Oh wait it’s reddit nvm continue about your business.
---
Is it really hunting if you basically have a GPS attached to your prey? Personally, i find that removes a big part of the challenge and the fun in actually hunting some one. If im going to watch a streamer and find him in game, its probably just to say hi.
---
In a way, he's promoting griefing so yeah, blizzard can act on it I guess
---
You have streamer culture to thank for this. All anyone is going to care about is blasting through to 60 and "winning" so they can act tough aa if the content hasn't been beaten 1000 times before.
---
griefing is bannable, also beta
---
&gt;small events should get "help", something like special arena to make the tournament in.
---
The game is the same for everyone. The rules are the same for everyone. Once you start bending the rules for someone because he calls something an event, the game goes to shit.
---
I was like 13 years old when this mini game was released - and back then too afraid to apply for a raiding guild. So I just played this version of MC instead. Was pretty funny!
---
Some people have a hard time when their training wheels get taken away.
---
That's Vanilla spirit
---
Fuck this guy, and fuck the weasel looking dude as well.
---
I actually feel the opposite. Since i cant get into beta I’ve been enjoying a few other games more, knowing that i wont have time for anything other than classic after August. Been playing a little Final Fantasy III on snes, Breath of the Wild. And even genres I’m not usually into like grand strategy. Picked up Civilization VI and Stellaris. Stellaris is so fucking good.
---
Its not even that.
---
If you got his bank account you still would be commiting a crime. But PvPing on a PvP server is allowed.
---
OSRS is a perfect showcase of how "small QoL changes" boils down to the community attempting to remove any slightly tedious interaction they can think of.
---
The majority of users don't know or care about what's best for the game, they vote based on personal benefit. 
---
The developers need to be confident and assertive enough to know what benefits the health of the game, and hopefully Blizzard are smart enough to ignore the countless users who will inevitably beg for a trip down the slippery slope of "QoL".
---
OSRS did many things right, but user polls are awful.
---
God you are so lucky. How do I become a European citizen?
---
Nice, I didn't know that. All the more reason to try and get one!
---
Whirl Wind Axe. Easily lasts you a couple dozen levels. If you can get it at 30, it's literally the best DPS weapon for that level range, all classes. You will shit on everything.
---
Than Arcanite Reaper, back before standardized weapon speed was thing. Every warrior had one. Iconic.
---
Lmao. You sure you have seen this happen? I used to watch a guy called Bredar. Used to do gold making, great streamer, chill dude and all, got from 200 to 3k viewers in some months. Legion launched, he dropped to 150. Insane loss. Everybody was playing the game. You don't enjoy Classic watching a stream on the side man... Some will, sure, but most won't, there will be a drop, depends how long it's gonna last but right now the numbers are from people who can't play. Most of them will play without watching, and maybe watch later at work or something, not consistently like now
---
Yeah, we will have time for pvp. If they are on a pvp server they will be treated like every other opposing faction member.
---
You've invented an argument by saying that streaming requires 12 hours a day 6 days a week when none of the top streamers do this. Some people do, but they're probably doing it to compensate for low viewer numbers. A lot of people also may work a desk job for 7-8 hours then go home and play games for 3-4 hours, which is basically doing exactly as you described. I basically do that, I also make sure I exercise 4-5 times a week and I walk at least 30 minutes a day.
---
Are people going on every server to take the name Asmongold? Will people level to 10 on every server to take his guild name? I think not
---
When I joined the subreddit, which was around March or April 2018, these rules were already in place. At the time, r/ClassicWoW was much smaller than r/wowservers. The logic was, r/wow is for modern WoW, r/ClassicWoW is for Classic, and r/wowservers is for private server. So, private server discussion goes to r/wowservers and modern WoW discussion goes to r/WoW. Essentially, it was a way to differentiate from r/wowservers. 
---
To my knowledge, no one on the r/ClassicWoW staff has ever been contacted by Blizzard regarding enforcement of private server-related rules.
---
You need 20 or 21 points in Holy to raid. As long as you have Illumination your fine. Holy raid healing is all about efficiency.
---
Yeah, so a butthurt streamer will accuse a ganker of this made up thing called "streamsniping". And all his mindless streambuddies/minions will also report the ganker. For sure the banhammer will crush him for just playing the game.
---
Do the math and don't claim special privileges for that scum.
---
You're never the *only* one, but yeah, it does feel like the people that aren't ready and willing to sacrifice their firstborn to N'Zoth for Beta access are the distinct minority.
---
Me? I'm content tidying up my backlog some, and of course, PoE's new league starts in roughly eight hours, and will probably my mainstay until Classic launches.
---
Sunshine, I make 70k net a year, that's before bonuses, and I love my job. I have a huge savings account, and I own the apartment I live in. Everything I want to have in my live, I can easily afford.
---
I don't give a shit how much streamers make.
---
But you know what's odd? That you seem to project their income to polish up your ego. Which tells me you are not exactly a top earner.
---
And how can you know if they are sniping or not to ban them?
---
People now will basically be afraid to even engage in PvP with him to not get banned. If all other streamers decide to do something similar, the "streamer server" will basically be a PvE server, except that it's PvP lol
---
So Druid tank stat priority, how important is dodge % on gear?
---
Should i use dodge trinkets or STR/agi trinkets?
---
Also, i see most tanking specs have Omen of Clarity talent but do i really need this for rage management?
---
Shaman had spellpower on everything but the Chest and the Feet. Still a weird set, though.
---
If you can heal, bless, and cleanse people without going OOM you'll be fine.
---
You'd only be raiding as a Ret, Healer or Tank.
---
Ret, you'd need insane gear and even than pull normal maybe high dps.
---
Healer, you're going to be wearing cloth gear.
---
Tank, you're going to be off tank adds/groups, I haven't seen a pally MT raids in vanilla, since they don't have taunt.
---
Focus on minimising time between mobs thanks to your shapeshifting and heals. Remember that tactics &gt; strategy when it comes to leveling as a rule of thumb: you can follow the perfect guide and get a mediocre result if you aren't gunning through mobs. It's a universal truth but way more applicable to druids because efficient mob grinding while leveling is their bread and butter thanks to no downtime!
---
Or just... you know... take a flight path maybe?
---
blizzard said there will be human element to bans so this is not happening. also blacklist and what you described is something completely different
---
I mean, I’ve never heard of Arthas referred to as the Darth Vader of gaming and Tolkien is the gateway to fantasy.  WoW may remind you of LotR, but it would always do so, regardless of the movies, because the guys who made WoW are guys who love Tolkien.
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong, WoW makes references to a great many things, like Congo, Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome, Legend of Zelda, Indiana Jones, Goonies, Dune, Game of Thrones, and that’s what I can remember off the top of my head that was in Vanilla WoW.
---
The best strategy and the one I will be employing is to roll on a non-streamer server. Get maxed gear within a guild. And then have our entire guild transfer over when we're dominant. And then roll the streamers wherever they go.
---
RNG was on my side at birth, but you can try visiting and stealing someone's identity, ezpz
---
Damned kids and their streamings.
---
I also think that most OCE players just go on NA pservers anyway to start with and haven’t left so that also hurt the OCE pservers when they eventually started up. And a lot of people will be returning so there is definitely going to be a massive amount of players joining, 100% agree.
---
No i am not comparing rape to pvp, just how ppl excuse rape to how ppl excuse snipping. How did gou get that comparison? The rape allowed world thing, lol... jumping to conclusions like there’s no tomorrow. You just understood a comment like mainstream media understands facts, twisting words to sound extreme. Reddit is like mainstream media, demonizing opposing ideas to get likes.
---
Shit, haven't heard/seen this guy before, but kinda upset I won't be on his server. Sounds like the perfect dipshit to streamsnipe and corpsecamp whenever possible.
---
Damn, that sucks, are we getting better shadows or what? What is the reasoning behind higher spec requirements?
---
Hi, /u/1M-D39R353D
---
Lmao that's brutal af, I like it! Not sure there will be transfers like that though!
---
You hit the nail on the head here. He wants all the benefits of being a streamer with none of the downsides. Classic WoW is an unforgiving place and he needs to learn that- we all get ganked, we all get camped sometimes, it’s just part of that experience. I wouldn’t be surprised if this type of rhetoric ultimately leads to him on a server by himself and his followers. No ones going to bother in fear he’ll try to use his power to fuck them over.
---
the problem is he has 100 of mindless minions that farm for him. So he benefits massively, yet as soon as he is ganked he cries foul play . He even said that he killed a Level 15 guy over and over (which is no problem)
---
In case you didnt play classic there wont be a Blacklist you can see the upvotes here already for this. Classic PvP was 100 times worse then ppl think it was. I was corpse camped 72 hours in Arathi .....never complained just fought back ...i think Soda is in for a BIG suprise.
---
Do you even know what PvP servers are? Do you know what WoW is? There's two enemy factions called THE HORDE and THE ALLIANCE. These two factions are hostile to one another and can kill each other on sight.
---
YES, WE SHIT-LISTED PEOPLE WHO NINJA'ED SHIT ON OUR FACTION, OR DID SHIT LIKE STEAL INSTANCES, WASTE TIME ON VAELESTRAZ, ETC. THOSE PEOPLE GOT BLACKLISTE, AND NEVER JOINED GROUPS AGAIN.
---
HOWEVER.
---
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BLACKLISTING PEOPLE WHO ARE _FIGHTING THE ENEMY FACTION_. HOW HARD IS THIS CONCEPT FOR YOU TO GRASP LOL.
---
The relevancy of ACTIVE subscribers is what matters here, not the total numbers.
---
r/wow : 1 million subbed, 4.4 k online. That is 0.44% activity ratio.
---
r/classicwow : 130k subbed, 7.2k online. That is 5.53% activity ratio.
---
So, basically, the interest for Classic WoW is 12.5 times HIGHER than the interest for BfA.
---
So basically as long as I have Illumination I'm good?
---
I'd go Mage - Paladin, easy to group up and do dungeons with others with that comp. With the Warlock you're super fast alone, any partner will slow you down - half the xp and more items to pickup for collection quests.
---
More discussion :  [https://www.dual-boxing.com/threads/55413-Duo-Leveling-Class-Comps](https://www.dual-boxing.com/threads/55413-Duo-Leveling-Class-Comps)
---
Luckily they made pve servers so that can all be avoided. And you can pvp on pve servers to if you tag yourself. So its a pretty good solution to this problem.
---
I disagree, i think it'll climb over modern WoW due to being something different. The question is will the mods have enough of humility to allow that to happen and continue developing for it once content gets stale(judging from their previous responses to vanilla "you think you do", I'm going with a big fat no.)
---
As warlock just curse them with demonic so you both speak demonic now, thats how I did it back then before they fixed that in bc I think
---
And like so, The Great Book of Grudges was born.
---
what is surprising. We don't want the game to turn into modern wow.
---
Addon is optional. Literally optional. on the other hand a change made by blizzard is permanent.
---
Who will decide what QoL is okay and what isn't ? 
---
on the other hand, an addon we all can decide. if an addon that no ones wants is released no one will use it.
---
I don't understand what people struggle to understand in this. QoL were added in modern wow since tbc bit by bit until the game was no longer the same. Also Blizzard hasn't been the studio they used to be since 2008. No person in their right mindset would trust them in making the call for what is a good QoL and what isn't for classic.
---
But multicore just means additional cores ontop of the primary 0 core. A potato can and will run classic my man. Calm down
---
I can teabag a corpse all day long.
---
No, it's not.

* People have been sitting on Mailboxes for years.
---
* People have corpse-camped lowbies for years.
---
* People have MCed players into the blackrock Lava lake throughput Vanilla.
---
* People have summoned players into the deep ocean throughput Vanilla.
---
* Angwe spent 16h a day killing people in Menethil Harbor.
---
* People have been MCed off boats forever.
---
* People have been killing questgivers and camped questssites forever.
---
None of that ever lead to any bans, and none of it should ever lead to a ban. Your argument is invalid.
---
&gt;also beta
---
Show me the section in the ToS for the Beta where it says "you cannot jump around during a community event".
---
"Anyway so as I was sayin- Holy shit Cumsock with a 100 dollar donation!!! THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU! Okay, alright, so- Jesus christ RetardedChild with the 100 gifted subs THANK YOU TYHANK YOU THANK YOU. What was I saying?"
---
Gets annoying real fast.
---
&gt;The best strategy and the one I will be employing is to roll on a non-streamer server. Get maxed gear within a guild. And then have our entire guild transfer over when we're dominant. And then roll the streamers wherever they go.
---
Maybe not because the server might be high pop. But, I'm sure there will be an opportunity to roll into one server on their BG. As I 100% guarantee when battlegroups are introduced, Blizz will put the streamer servers in the group with the lowest server counts.
---
If the only content is about streamers, then stop browsing MAYBE? I mean that's the only content there is, so either you go make some content or you accept that's all people have to talk about, jesus... If you don't give a fuck if people like streamers or not, then why make a post about it? Ironic for sure
---
Sadly No haha. Oh man. 2004.
---
Difficulty can be defined in many ways.
---
Classic is difficult in some ways, not difficult in others.
---
Just don't say it's not difficult, because IT IS. Just not in the ways you assume.
---
Boy, that remind me an ooold gamer, The 4th Coming, one of the first gen MMO. Necromancy was prohibited and necromancer was actively hunted by royal guards and player RPing as such. I was a necromancer, but i was always wearing a white robe and a mace, to pretend i was in fact a simple priest. Good times.
---
I mean those addons you mentioned were explicitly in vanilla?
---
Who in their right might is arguing to break threat meter functionality?
---
Nobody cares about his stupid face
---
You idol requested that they do exactly that. Sorry that reality doesn't agree with you.
---
The only real answer.. You can't hide in wow unless you put a 30 minute delay or not stream at all.
---
No. OP is clearly smoking something as his been up for days. Any PC withen last 10 years will run it fine
---
I'm fine with classic as is but let's not pretend like it didn't have flaws too. I mean, I love it, but class design was absolutely a weakness of it outside of the fact that the classes tended to have unique flavor.
---
Who does stream sniping benefit, though? I can see streamers' frustration with getting sniped just for streaming, and I'm surprised to be on a gamers' sub which so massively condones cheating (and essentially getting a backstage look at all the person's shit, and their location, is certainly cheating). In most games I play, gamers self-police against ghosting or hanging out in spectator and spotting enemies.
---
Yeah, I know there are enough assholes out there that it's probably unavoidable, but that doesn't mean we all have to gather around and support cheaters.
---
Who benefits? The streamer is frustrated, because he's trying to entertain his audience. His audience is frustrated, because they're trying to watch real gameplay and instead the person is just getting ganked over and over. The guy ghosting gets free shit for cheating, but it's not like he won any kind of real contest - he has the undeniable advantage of seeing the streamer's whole game.
---
If the people aren't streamsniping and don't know who he is, then fine. But the argument being posed in this thread is literally **if you give me the tools to cheat, then I'm going to take advantage of it and cheat**, and I'm amazed at the level of agreement this has.
---
No, cause private servers
---
If you want to see most efficient ways to run MC, you should search for MC speedruns in private servers. You can see the \~optimal routes of doing it, including what you can skip. I think we have done 23 mins (from first boss pull to death of ragnaros). Since the first trash isnt counted you will spend like 30-35mins inside the instance. But thats with fast looting, you have no way of doing that if you spend time distributing loot via dkp or something like that.
---
There arent "tactics" per say, you just do the absolute maximim damage you can on each boss. On bosses that have adds, you gather them all up for cleave and mage aoe.
---
That started in Shattrath in the central room in BC with portals to the major cities.
---
IIRC Blizzard wanted that central hub but didn't want the old capitals to be completely obsolete at the time, so they didn't put trainers and auction houses there I think, so we got the portals to get to the old world without flying to the portal leading to the blasted lands.
---
we dont even know if RP PvP will be a thing
---
For starters, yes. There's also how you name your character for example and many more things.
---
I think you underestimate the levels of trolling out there
---
Same!  Played TBC-Cata and was always PvE.  Recently played a private server that was PvP and had a blast.  The paranoia and tension in stonetalon moutains was amazing.
---
Can it be annoying? Sometimes.  But I'd rather have the option to murder those alliance scum at will then not at all.
---
You MUST be dumb mate. No offense.
---
So, running a marathon is not difficult...because it only takes times, right?
---
He was a well known csgo pro and supposedly a prodigy.
---
Not as popular on twitch as he didn't stream as often since that was not his job at the time.
---
Making the full time switch plus a new game with a lot more viewership made him skyrocket.
---
Not going to mention his skill because any player that came from cs and is a little bit above average usually stomps on any other fps game with a few days of getting used to.
---
No. Its a different client and connection.
---
Probably faster than storm wind to ungoro crater.
---
With him enforcing the blacklist on players, im pretty sure many many players will hunt him down just to make sure he will never say any bullshit like this anymore xD
---
Yeah but a human can't BE cancer so....
---
Boy, i wish there was some kind of watermark because i really dunno who made this meme.
---
Balance tree for natural weapons tends to speed up 1-20 and respec feral once you get cat form
---
I know, I have signed it a long time ago - but that's exactly what I'm saying - we're not pushing this cause enough! There are not even 1.5k signatures and Blizzard haven't responded...we need to be creating more posts and discussions and actually **demand** it! There is nothing to lose, and there are no downsides.
---
Oh sweet lord 😂😂😂 I love it!
---
I didn't listen to his video in it's entirety, but via the comments, this definitely seems like the Soda I used to play against and then with years and years and years ago (looks similar enough to him). 
---
If it is him, he probably is more right about a lot of things than most in this thread are about the game. He knew a lot back when I played, and most players respected him. I really can't believe he's still playing if it is too - I quit like 8-10 years ago, and played with or against Soda for many years. (Same server or BG multiple times, and played with him and his 3's team in 5's until we had the top 5's in the world on the best BG).
---
If this is the same Soda, he would have like 15+ years of wow experience behind him, including professional experience (and he was good, one of the few that made the game challenging). I would have to think that unless he's changed greatly as a person, he probably has some valid points. 
---
That said, I didn't watch the video for more than a few seconds just to see if I recognized his voice. I felt his voice was softer back in the day, but who knows.
---
Remove Mythic content, which is played by less than 10% of retailers, and BfA is a JOKE.
---
Yes you are completely right. Comes to my mind that maybe this time around there will be more smaller casual guilds, that agree together to form 40 man raids. That was not uncommon in vanilla, but I feel we will see this more often in classic due to so many people having less time to play the game than before.
---
So what are you going to go with
---
streamsnipping is not cheating based retard
---
I don't understand what's going on in the video but I also do play pally. However, the rate at which you kill both enemies doesn't seem any faster or slower than usual. What am I missing?
---
Use the model viewer for vanilla.
---
A simple answer
---
Trinket 1: Smoking Heart of the Mountain, requires Enchanting 265 to create, its a BoP item so you need to be a Enchanter. You do not need to be the enchanter to use this item, so you can always drop enchanting once you have made the item. This item is literally BiS for the entire game
---
Trinket 2:  Mark of Tyranny. This is a quest reward from somewhere is BRD / BRS. it shares the reward with the 2% crit trinkets, this is also a BiS for Druid tanks all game.
---
No other trinket comes close, as these both have +armor therefore they scale with the Dire Bear armor modifier
---
Stop posting this guy. All he does is blank face the camera in half of his video.
---
If your raid is cool with you stealing good and very rare items in order to mediocre dps at best sure.
---
Remember that you’re the most expensive class to raid with as well so you better put in some hours goldfarming.
---
Hmm. Maybe that's where I should be this time around, as opposed to PvP servers. Thanks fella, for taking the time to answer a simple but probably frequently asked question.
---
My brother also played on Firetree and played a pally with the hand of rag but raided holy his name was "myownsavior" also played with a dude named "Timos" I think was his ingame name.
---
We can always dream.
---
I don't really understand your logic here.
---
The game sets the limitations and challenges, the addons are tools to help you mitigate them. We want the game in its original state because that's the sandbox we like to creatively work and overcome challenges in, addons or not.
---
I'm not a fan of addons like WeakAuras, but I would never want the game to incorporate that feature baseline.
---
By the way, addons don't solve mana/threat problems for you in any way. 
---
Do you think a threat meter is going to help your tank when he aoe pulls and you instantly throw out a 3k greater heal on him?
---
Do you think having an energy tick addon is helping your mana when all you can do is spam LHW for 30 seconds non-stop?
---
They're small tools to visually represent things that a good player already has a feeling for.
---
Oh good, something to sign.
---
Sure, stream sniping is a dirtbag thing to do. Will I personally do it? No. Will I support those who do it? No, I don’t care. It doesn’t impress me that someone streams or if someone uses the information freely given by the streamer against them.  If people work against streamers getting things like scarab lord, well , it’s counterbalanced by their sycophants running around fetching them carapaces like good dogs. 
---
What I won’t do is tell people it’s “unacceptable”.  Streamers give their opponents an advantage FREELY. You can feel about that however you want, but please don’t tell others how to feel about it.
---
&gt; streamers might harm a realm and bring economy down with their viewers and do lots of unintentional bad!
---
All the more reason to do it. 
---
Its their job to do it and they are entertaining people who watch them. I have no problem with this at all let people have their fun. But if they roll on a pvp server then they should expect to be stream snipped. Now for their sake I hope its not all the time because I would even sympathize for that if they were hunted 24/7. But thats just how a pvp server is. Ive had people camp my body for hours on end before and they wernt able to see if I logged off or not they just waited. Thats part of pvp. If they want to avoid that they can go pve.
---
&gt;That will give Blizzard a clear image of how many people will STAY after launch period, how many realms to fire up [...]
---
Blizzard has said that the server names will be revealed before we can register our character names. Which would imply the number and type of servers will be set already.
---
Then people shouldnt waste time about asking stuff when the game isnt released yet...
---
And if i remember correctly, blizzard was saying Classic will stay classic .... everything else is reading from the crystal-ball!
---
Don't forget screech! Furious howl isn't terrible either, if you do lots of dungeons. Lightning for your serpent? There's probably other type-specific ones I'm missing.
---
Not gonna lie this is the best art that's ever been shown on this sub xD love it.
---
Doubtful, WoW community is a way too big, conflicted and divided for these kinda votes to be fair :P.
---
Amen.
---
That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read
---
Every single 10k+ streamer would get a job very easily tbh. 
---
You are basically living in the gaming industry and companies send you disgusting amounts of money to play their game for 1 hour. 
---
If you ever get sick of it, it's not really hard to get offers from Esport organisations, game companies, hardware companies etc.
---
Lol here we go...
---
Okay so take a 100% mount and ride from Winterspring to Silithus and record the time
---
What's your god damn point?
---
What if i gank and camp him because i find it fun and couldn't care less about his stream?
---
Random mobs, different drop rates.
---
The chest only drops on Cath from the.. crusaders?? Very low drop rate.
---
Don’t bother trying to collect it all unless you wanna RP at level 60 and even then you can just AH most of it more efficiently than solo grind
---
Of course! However you don't buy these type-specific skills. You train higher ranks by taming new pets thst have them, so they are "free"
---
&gt;It's a courtesy thing. Like players at 60 who don't gank level 20s because they know they can't fight back and it's just cruel.
---
I dont know how lucky you were when playing vanilla/pservers but 60s ganking 20s happens all the time and will also happen in Classic all the time.
---
Who cares they make stream delay for a reason.
---
Stop posting streamer reactions, this is killing the community
---
WoW Classic was considered super casual/easy/fast at release, and everyone playing the other mmos in 2003/2004 used to constantly rip on it for fucking up the genre.
---
Certainly most of the people watching will want to see the content, but you know there will be fans who have it in their head that if they farm and help their favorite streamer bypass the grind that they'll become the streamers new best friend. Streamers will have mailboxes full of stuff that lets them skip every grind possible.
---
Yes, because all classes being balanced to be point-blank-even in all regards, made for a much better game, am I right? And because it did, we are all enjoying BfA so much.
---
Here is a thought:  
---
Not everything in a game has to be balanced.  
---
Not everything in a game has to make sense.  
---
Things that are odd, dysfunctional, absurd and can be tinkered with, make a game interesting.
---
If I want to play a completely balanced game, I play a first person Shooter.
---
Healing Touch (Rank 4)
---
I mean, you can make a name for yourself no matter where you go. Although, I am curious to see how multiple streamers will affect a server. I wonder how crazy it will or won't get...
---
Agreed from what I'm seeing you will use  hot spells a lot more in naxx.
---
LICK LICK LICK MY BALLS
---
It took barely any time to do anything compared to all the other 2003 mmos when it was released.
---
It's even MORE FUN to run around as a Prot Warrior with 73% damage reduction and 10k health...WHILE being a TANK in the same time, and not some wannabe Druid that goes against the GAME DESIGN and MATH, forcing 39 people having a much slower raid progression.
---
&gt; I am kinda amazed that most people don't understand this. 
---
At least take the effort of explaining why then. I can just say "yes there will be" and have just as strong an "argument" as you do now.
---
Fuck me this shit is worse than reailty TV. How the fuck did reactional videos become a thing.
---
After always playing some kind of support role I will be "selfish" this time around and roll a DPS class. After testing I finally decided to go with a Rogue. I like the playstyle and also the class lore and feel.
---
Never heard of him
---
But do you think the big streamers like Soda, Asmon, Swifty, Summit, Quin, Esfand will have less streamers release day than right now?
---
Having a kill team while Asmon is watching viewer suggested videos sounds exactly like something his stream would want/do.
---
Druids can make a spec which gives, feral charge, natures grace as well as furor in combination with wolfshead helm. Maybe not the best dps but amazing at disruption.
---
Reaction videos are the most retarded thing ever.
---
Why are these posts still going ? You’re not allowed to play Classic and enjoy modern WoW? Pushing M+ keys with people you enjoy playing with is fun, and a lot more challenging than Classic ever was, but Classic is a completely different game and atmosphere, it’s harder because it requires commitment, and time, which is also fine.
---
How is using somebody's stream to find where they are, what they have, and what they're going to do not cheating?
---
A streamer made me ugly! And fat! And girls don’t like me!
---
It's just a game lads
---
You don't need the raids and dungeons to drop gear. Just have it be new content to clear. You don't mess with the itemization and you don't introduce powercreep.
---
The actual video is on the front page...
---
lmao, perfection
---
I think we're talking about two different levels of casual. There will be guilds like you describe, and guilds like I describe. High end guilds progress in stair steps; they clear everything quickly, get geared, then wait around for the next content drop. More casual guilds  progress like a ramp, more slow and steady. Given a long enough window between releases or raids, the two will eventually catch each other.
---
That was the alpha
---
You should try and bind as many spells as possible. Use Q, E, F1-F5, F, G, X, C, S, R, T, Z and so on then use shift and ctrl to triple your binds. It'll feel awkward at first but you'll get used to it.
---
This is a really cool idea, like posting a bounty on someone's head.
---
I don't play WOW but would join if I did.
---
Warlocks could not summon directly into the instance from outside the instance in vanilla.  You could summon someone who was already inside.
---
To be fair the thing he didn’t like was someone hacking his girlfriend’s social media and threatening to release nudes. And he said this whilst this was all going on. I can see why it would be tough to remain calm in that situation
---
Haha what? Monetization on YouTube is nonexistent compared to twitch with even just a thousand viewers
---
I did not see this comming
---
If classic is considered hard by todays standards, than we have no standards.
---
Hint: its like vanilla
---
posted one as a response to the other comment.  There was another more definitive one where he talked about the website, but if you're interested just google 'classic wow' on youtube and watch all the videos like I did :D.
---
Anything that gets talked about that they don’t like. The number one thing being “what comes after phase 6” posts, which if you’re like me and browse by new here often, you see the same people getting super triggered. 
---
Anything giving an opinion for a change tends to get the same crowd triggered and giving meme responses. 
---
The “what race for xxxx class” or “what class to pick” posts have kinda faded as far as targets for the gatekeepers. 
---
Idk man, everyone is just ready for release and there’s only so much to talk about. Nobody should be gatekeeping here.
---
And then the server would be basically PvE because noe one wants to be blacklisted lol
---
Shit dude, you managed to not look like a clown in Vanilla!
---
Actual transmogable-level gear.
---
But it is camping, You will have 0 evidence to say it is stream sniping or not, so you can't report it on the grounds. 2nd, stream snipers can get creative to still fuck with Soda for exa, they don't have to B line to him all the time. Its about time streamers stop complaining about stream sniping an take some responsibility for it, stop acting like its a thing the general public should have to worry about it, when its soley a streamers problem.
---
so you're telling me Blizzard's never broken a statement before. Or that they've preferred Streamer?
---
What do you think Blizzard will do if some bigger streamers says they don't want to play WoW anymore because they get ganked all the time?
---
I've never had a problem with streamers getting beta access and other players not. That's Marketing 101 and that's okay. But if you were to acknowledge streamsniping as a real problem, it wouldn't be really effective. Ganking raids were organized at least on my server every now and then and then you specifically selected the most annoying opponent players and searched together with the opposing faction for this player. That was never a problem, because you could log in or switch to a PvE server.
---
But you certainly can't blame the players when you play the game. There will always be false positives and then Blizzard really has a problem. Even a human can't confirm 100% at the end that it was a coincidence or a targeted ganking of streamers.
---
Lol wut? I would kill in my no life times for people paying me to keep playing. I was on wow 15 hours a day anyways so it would be free moneh and socializing. It was nowhere near as stressful as my current job. I mean I became much better and feel much better than I was playing wow mentally, physically and socially and dont regret dropping out but if it was carreer, I wouldn't mind continuing my no life.
---
You're using a relatively new private server to legitimize your claim that open pvp died out after a few weeks in vanilla?
---
I think it's better that people have to go out and get these QoL things by themselves, by not having them from the start it encourages people to at least try the game in its raw form, and maybe some players will find that they don't need/want some of these things after all.
---
Personally I won't play with any addons that dramatically changes the experience like Quest Helper or what not, I'll get some raiding addons because other people will depend on me performing as well as I can, but other than that I'm not that bothered.
---
You have more than one wow account and they both got flagged.
---
You were also a warrior and they wanted you to give it to another warrior? Fuck that, he should buy it himself like I did.
---
Not all the streamers are the same though.  Esfand, Crom and Alodar are all pretty chill.  I don’t really like Asmon much, and Esfand plays with him, so I just don’t watch when they’re together.
---
xD wtf is this outburst
---
oh I member!
---
When Classic releases, I’d love to see a list of servers all the streamers are playing on so I can avoid them like the plague
---
And the economy on the beta realms isn‘t comparable to true classic -  level caps gave gold after quest completion instead of XP.
---
Found it on my paladin, no way i was giving it to some warrior :D
---
Yeah it’s a blessing In disguise really. I want to enjoy it but ill definitely still be trying to get my first 60 fast lol. But at least I won’t burnout around 30-40
---
In case you didn't know, you can use Reddit Enhancement Suite to filter out posts that contain words you define.
---
So they’re like everyone else.  Got it
---
I guess this is what happens when your mind wonders waiting for the servers to come up ( watching the video )
---
I get the feeling soda doesn't entirely mean any of this lol.  He probably had rough day getting ganked and his emotions are coming out now.
---
Either way, being the way servers work ( and WAY less sharding, layering ) it could be a problem, but he'll most likely be grouped at all times.  And if he is still streaming Classic after 6 months or so, then perhaps he has the right to argue it.
---
But like other people said, just go PVE if its THAT much of an issue.
---
We obv didn't have stream sniping in Vanilla, but we had body camping from higher level players, against lowbies, to the point where you had to log off because they just followed you, or you had that enemy with Hand of Rag, with 2 two pocket healers reckting everyone.  So this has been around already, just on a smaller scale. 
---
Oh well, maybe his maid can help keep him protected.
---
This is actually adorable.
---
Reminds me of my Christmas wishlist I made when I was 10.
---
My bad about the link. We have a system of sorting and introducing people as they join.
---
Yea I agree with this. If they have a big enough following for BC servers or WoTLK I think they could have specific servers for people who want to play the game in those states.
---
I’m not sure how much of an undertaking it would be or if it would even be worth it to have multiple expansions going at the same time though.
---
I'm pretty sure viewer counts will actually be even higher than beta during the first few weeks of launch. They'll go down only when the hype starts to wear off.
---
Wotlk was full of "modern wow features" (in addition to LFD) though. Heirlooms, welfare epics, faceroll dungeons that obsoleted entire raid tiers, azeroth being utterly useless..
---
Even without LFD wotlk had wayy too many damaging features for me to want it back.
---
Nice
---
Because there’s no room for different viewpoints or speculation on the internet. Got it!
---
In my experince, holy paladin pvp and pve (raid) spec are pretty much the same talents
---
I've emotionally matured past my teenage years, so hyped.
---
This is funny considering they will most likely just server transfer and eventually people in the guild are slowly going to give up because they don't want to keep blowing cash.
---
Why lotion?
---
Have to to streamsnipe gank
---
Can you imagine the struggle of barely earning 1M a year and sometimes having strangers interact with you in a way that doesn't benefit you in your favorite video game? I feel bad for him honestly.
---
I'll play with a threat meter and probably tukUI.
---
Some enemies in dark souls take me as much time as a full level in wow in order for me to kill them
---
This is amazing &lt;3
---
if you try to avoid streamers servers you might end up on a dead server, being on a streamer server (even with all the red flags) its guarantee player influx and you'll be sure your progress wont be in vain
---
Oh man, I remember helping a friend with that quest chain. So much fun.
---
That's cleared up some of my confusion - Thank you.
---
unacceptable...to you. 
---
All the streamers need to do is tell people before hand what server they are going on so people can avoid them.
---
And/Or roll pve. They have ways around it.
---
To get at least a minute % point of the sense of awe, wonder and friendship I got during vanilla times when i worked loads and played as much as possible. I'll have more time available this time round but I don't the other players will be around
---
i found a loophole, get the wife playing the game as well, works 2 fold, first off you dont need this conversation, they already understand, secondly you always have someone else in your group, added bonus if they are playing tank/healer if you are a dps
---
And the commercial I got before that was some Atlassian ad about some tranny being true to xir-self. No wonder everybody wants to go back to 2004.
---
So you're saying don't go holy/reck if you want to be able to kill people running away.
---
RES can do this. I don't see why all streamer content should be deleted, some is pretty good. Wouldn't mind a "Streamer" flair though so others can filter it easily if they please
---
have no seen the one she done, have seen a few of the others
---
I get Venruki and Soda but Asmongold fucking blows at PvP.
---
Yep, that was it! There was always a ton of drama but it was fun. I'm hoping that classic will have some good RP too.
---

What's up with reddits needs to constantly correct people and go into length explanations?  Your comment could have just been "For future reference it's beck and call not beckon call".  And that's it.  Or better yet you could have just left it alone because we obviously understood what he meant and that is the point of language isn't it?  To be understood?
---
It's the same response you see when someone uses a pound sign without the proper formatting.  #nobodycaresyouknowwhatImeant
---
Que up 100 people telling me how to property format it.
---
The streamer server will be the worst by far for layering. Tens of thousands of people on the same server sounds like a nightmare.
---
Preach was in my guild for a while. It wasn't that bad. Granted he's not huge.
---
Punkrat will main a Horde Hunter and will stream.
---
Ion made a point about this at BlizzCon https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM 41:40 on addons “saying just don’t use it if you don’t want it isn’t good enough because it will start to become part of the fabric”
---
Will be interesting to see where they land on this.
---
Probably private server specs or raiding specs.  I love private servers, not hating lol.
---
Pareto distribution just like everything else.
---
I'm so glad to be on that VIP streamer list and got in on the first round of invites. I'm impressed that Blizzard found my 200 follower Twitch channel that hasn't streamed since July 2018.
---
Ah That Tauren trolling the duel tournament sucked ! But this is completely insane
---
I don't think so. My WoW days and reddit days have been two completely separated times in my life.

took a break from wow when my kids were born, you make the most of them sleeping by you sleeping means not a lot of time for wow, but once they are into a routine your life goes back to normal, mostly, good friends will help you out even if they have out levelled you
---
Which is also what happened to WoW, I guess. Just not in a structured manner like OSRS does it.
---
Benediction.

I can’t wait for my dwarf to hold that staff in all his glory.

Vanilla fortitude*
---
So far it won't be.
---
I didn’t mean on the same server.
---
Ive had that happen to. A warrior would take all my kills trying to get me to tag him. You know what I did? I logged on to an alt and did a few professions for about 30 mins. Hopped back on my main and the warrior was gone. Pretty easy solution.
---
Correct, everything gets downvoted. Nothing makes sense and nobody accept different opinions.
---
Have a great Weekend and see you in Azeroth 😂
---
More like master loot ninja loot that BiS the streamer really wanted then leave guild faction change and gank him :)
---
It's different because IRL you were forcelly born in a "PvP server".
---
In WoW you have the option to play on a PvE server.
---
By the time you get a full set , you will be already using plate
---
Bumping this. We need answers, please spread this !
---
cant say I remember any boss taking more than a few minutes
---
Cuz the whole essence of Vanilla is being ganked and not doing jack shit about other than reaching out to guild members to come bodyguard you.
---
I think PvP server will be more populated than the PvE server.
---
You murdered him OP, let him up for air sometime! Lol this exchange was too damn funny to read
---
you mean super sen'jin?
---
not really a fair comparison lol

Actually this. Hunters are the only class that Asscandy benefits in PvE, after that it's a PvP weapon.
---
You'd have to interpolate between the existing pixels somehow, and in a way that actually improves quality. Not a video guy at all, but I don't think conventional tools can do that easily. Maybe one of the AI algorithms that extrapolate paintings and stuff could be adapted to, but I certainly wouldn't know how to start.
---
Frostadamus was banned for 90 days by blizzard but he was streaming so
---
From what I've gathered, there are not going to be any low pop realms. I think their goal with layering is for there to be 3-5 layers per realm, so that come a month from launch and all of the people who were just sightseeing stop playing, the realms will still have an active population of 3-4k (size of 1 layer).
---
your monitor is not repaired 
---
good 1 , took me a bit
---
As a teacher, don’t remind me. Lol
---
Why? How is it wrong?
---
I heard about this. Apparently you guys had one of the best RP communities really early on, but when other servers were full or down, new characters were being pointed towards Argent Dawn, so eventually it got overrun. I had a friend who played there in early classic then left for better RP. He made it sound like the best RP server ever back in the day.

---
there arent many hunters streamers, but jellybeans might be the best ive seen of them all
---
Right on, thanks for this extra information. Do you have a link where this was posted?
---
But what happens when they both want the same thing (like the unique AQ gates mount) and then they'll need to compete against each other?
---
That will be a tamtrum of epic proportions lol imagine Soda and Asmon wanting the same thing but only one of them can get it.
---
You guys are the reason I love reddit.
---
unfortunately
---
I can see this escalating super fast, in which people who don't like streamers, will stream how they hunt down streamers and will become bigger streamers themselves.
---
&gt;"act retarded to fit in"
---
Yeah... they're not acting.
---
Madseason is a nice guy
---
Virtualization also requires extra resources so
---
sorry i havent played wow since cata, what is BiS?
---
They only usually play for a month. Then get tired of being stomped say the game is unfair or boring and leave.
---
You are one of them...
---
seems pretty fucking weird to justify stream sniping. never heard of that being a legitimate thing, but i guess i've heard everything now
---
Its just totally not worth it, would rather have a cheaper maul from 10 AND save cash not respeccing, than getting natural weapons from 15-19.
---
&gt; Imagine not being able to play the game anymore because everyone's out to get you, or so it feels.
---
Can't you solve that by rolling in a PvE server?
---
The thread is about Holy.

It’s not though. You gotta stop investing so much in the hate and negativity. Just downvote the post and move on if you don’t like something.

Think I'm going to try to set up a Social PvP guild with a specific focus upon AV. Bit of a niche subset but who knows, eh?
---
thanks :) never played retail haha
---
this is an example of one of the absolute geniuses that i'm talking about
---
Back in Classic  you could report people for constantly killing questgivers and things like that, it was considered griefing and people got temporary bans for it.
---
Ohh ok.
---
Imagine thinking Classic will have enough players to sustain more than one server LUL
---
How to dowload it ?
---
we still have so long :(
---
It's going to be funny when the real no lifes show up to fuck up the day of a lot of these streamers. Their viewers haven't seen shit.
---
I'm unironically a fan of Soda, mostly just watch twitch clips never tuned into his stream, but the idea that people hunting him should be blacklisted is absolute trashbrain at it's most pure and unrefined. 
---
Totes down for joining a guild dedicated to hunting down streamers that have this entitled attitude.
---
I wrote a post suggesting this but got downvoted. It seems like this it's a divisive topic.
---
Yes he needs to remember that he made his business around our game, not our game around his business...
---
Because addons are as limited as the game. You can't do a LFR teleport to dungeon addon. You can do a LRG/LRF addon that groups you and you still have to run, communicate etc.

Hes a multi rank 1 tho

yeah thats about it lol

Im actually glad im going out of town for the weekend, it will help me get my mind off it

Ah, didnt know that but its so rare that you wear healing gear as a lock that it doesnt matter
---
What a crybaby
---
Epsecially as the old guy is the young guy's dad
---
Well it's the difference between hardcore and ultra hardcore. In the end a game that requires something like 200-400 hours to reach max level and more than the double then to achieve most of the PvP and PvE tasks can be called hardcore in term of time commitment in 2019 or 2004

I kinda agree with you but Asmongold knows a shitton though. I cant say that I know class abilites well

Imagine struggling with a 15 year old raid (which was easily completed by bad players with shitty hardware) that you need absolute optimal specs and raid composition to finish it. I'd rather play with 39 druids.

&gt; to spend an extra half hour in raids twice a week because someone demands they be able to bring a non-viable s
---
your whole logic is flawed here.
---
If we were to follow your logic then most bosses in t1 and t2 raids would be  composed of 2 prot warriors, 6 priests 5 holy paladins 1 resto druids, 24 fury warriors, 1 frost mage, 1 warlock.
---
other than a few exceptions like mag, we kick lock and mage and get 2 hunters instead for tranq shot.  
---
for gaar we kick 3 warriors for 3 warlocks to banish.
---
For domo kick 3 warriors for 3 mages for poly.
---
In t3, replace the 26 warriors with fire mages and you're all set.
---
I am not saying that a guild should have 20 people in weird specs, but 1 shadow priest, 1 bomkin, 1 elemental shaman and 1 ret pala, that is 4 out of 27 dpsers. its not gonna make or break a raid. i am sorry but if a raid can't do a bosses due to dps being too low just because of those 4 people, then you prolly aren't good enough to make it anw. take those 4 less than optimal dps classes and replace them with 1 mage 1 lock 1 hunter 1 rogue/warrior, the dps difference would be around 1 more extra warrior. thats a 3-4% boost in dps. if this is the reason it will take you 2 hours more to complete a raid. i am sorry to break it to you but YOU ARE NOT PREPARED.

If blizzard is really going to cater towards streamers to this extent, eventually it’s going to have a negative affect on the community and how the world itself.
---
So your solution to their whining is to counter-whine? 
---
Why don't you just roll on another server and save yourself the effort of writing a wall of text? You know there is no CRZ in Classic right?
---
Look I'm not gonna assume anything, I suggest we wait and see, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, there's nothing bad about being wrong, that's life! But I do think with access to the game comes less watching time
---
DDO was like that for me. I led raids when no one else wanted to. I ran newbies through Vale of Twilight content to help them get their base weapons so they could start the raid. NOBODY DOES THIS IN RETAIL. Not even guilds. They're all cliques.
---
Say, you want to gank me.
---
I send you tell in some discord or dm and let you know exactly where i am.
---
You come and gank me.
---
YOU CHEAT!
---
..or maybe I shouldn't tell you where I am all the time. This is the reasons at least most of our people on my pserver raids dont stream when we are moving to an raid, a competing guild could just snipe dispell all the buffs from our MT, hugely reducing our effectiveness in said raid before we even started. There are ways around, like screening the area when moving, summoning the important tanks straight at the entrance, and not streaming while we gather.
---
Congrats!
---
Well, if even BfA is capable of that lol, classic will have it easy
---
I saw that all day today. Not calling names but one streamer was desperate for a healer for Ulda. They finally talk a shaman into it. Then get mad when the shaman simply ASKS if he could roll on enhance gear(competing with group members) since it’s his main spec.

Not gonna say that some people comments are borderline harrasment or cyber bullying. I came to this subreddit maybe 2 weeks ago and I'm already tired of it.

I fully agree. With the exception of the watcher fight in d3 have no idea why that fight was so difficult
---
if the blizzard starts banning people because streamer reported them, the backslash would murder whole classic. it is NOT happening
---
Very True and the fact you didn't lose xp when you died was unheard of. But all in all, I think vanilla WoW nailed the sweet spot for MMO's and altho it went downhill with the later expansions as we approached BFA, classic WoW is just truly something special.
---
Good luck doing that against guilds that contain some of the best pve/pvp players in WoW and against people who will be playing this game for literally 24/7. 
---
People on this sub are fucking delusional to think that they can compete with streamers. By the time the general playerbase reach max lvl, the streamer guilds most likely already have cleared Raids and pretty much BiS. Good luck with that.
---
Nah they make bank dude.

---
I was just giving options not suggesting the optimal path to go down. Distracting shot is potentially skippable. The number of times it will be useful pre-40 is going to be pretty low unless you are leveling mainly in dungeons.

---
I'd rather have wow 2 or another mmo. I dont think 1.13 and classic is going to be the life changing amazing game I've been looking forward to since I fell out of love with wow. I really think were going to smash this 15 year old game and people will get bored at end game.

Hey I5 2500k is a legendary processor that punched several meters above its own lenght and was far ahead of it's time. It could be overclocked to the extreme and just read the millions of "should i replace my 2500k" and see how even today half of them are still saying "no". 
---
It is only just now that it is starting to show its age. I just replaced my 2500k last year with a 8400k, but coupled with a good graphics card I could still easily play the newest most graphic intensive games on ultra with minimal impact. Calling this beast of a legendary processor a potato is an insult to science.
---
Oh, I completely agree. I've actually enjoyed watching Esfand and Venruki. They seem to enjoy playing the game and goofing off with their viewers. I've attempted watching Asmond's stream and a few others, but most of their antics/drama are just not my bag. But from the streamers that I've come across, most of them have been drama queens rather than just entertaining.

It feels like shaman is much more fun to play than paladin. It feels like a true hybrid class and the class fantasy is much more... warcraft-like.
---
Oh kinda like herpes, nice!
---
Because no1 did it properly.  
---
And thats not the point anyway, the point is that only night elves should be able to be druids.
---
\*also licks talent calculator\*
---
False, by Naxx druids are one of the strongest healers in the game. They scale exceptionally well and enough damage goes out for them to land gigantic R4 HTs for the entire fight. 
---
In other words, when healing matters and isn't just sniping with flash, Druids are exceptional healers.
---
Neither did Illidan
---
Those are fair points but tbh playing video games all day sounds miserable. Video games would no longer be enjoyable and being forced to be entertaining all day sounds exhausting. It’s not rewarding or satisfying either unlike my development work.

I guess when you make the money the big streamers do it’s easy to overlook the downsides.

You win today, sir
---
But what you're paying for in a classic server is blizzard polish. It's legitimate so you can level a character without fear that the server will be shut down abruptly for legal action. Hopefully better servers, so less ping. Also OSRS kind of counters this point aswell, it was all old content initially. 
---
People will pay for what they don't have and want, especially if it comes professionally.
---
You have no idea the power of the spergs that play WoW mate. Streamers are dead content to some of the spergs out there.
---
are you politician? because only thing you do is talk shit without any value

thats sexist

---
I'm all for fun but the 37-40 zones are HUGE and not very fun without a mount
---
I get this, but as someone who was intro’d to the warcraft universe through WoW at age 9, I never had a problem with Tauren druids because the class / race just feels compatible.
---
Was much more upset at no:
---
1. Human hunters
---
2. I think human hunters is pretty much it.
---
My guild is going alliance...
---
that makes me sad
---
lol at everyone thinking you mean raiding as ret. It's totally viable, you can pretty much get all important talents for pve healing. The only difference is not getting kings, which for me is kind of a bummer, especially in pvp, but that's your choice :)
---
he said he is fine with people ganking and camping them, he wants to blacklist a complete assholes that nobody would want to play with anyways
---
I think it'd be pretty neat if after 3 years or so, they move the whole servers to TBC, and then start up a new wave of Vanilla servers.  Give people the chance to start over, or move up to 2.0.
---
is multiboxing really viable on classic? isn't it normally used for node farming which unlike on retail only 1 person can get the node and for farming mobs its not really needed as the respawn timers is fairly slow so while you will clear faster your going to be sat around waiting on the respawns.
---
You're going to love travel times in Classic.
---
This is old news. Classic moderators don't allow you to repost. but they allow this to still be up. fuck these mods
---
Yeah, but why even stream snipe someone tho? Is it skillful to have that advantage on your opponent? Do you dislike them so much that you want them to suffer at every turn? What is the obsession with turning on someones stream to find out there locations just to go grief them? 
---
Regardless of how anyone feels about streamers, what mental state does it take for someone to go out of there way to snipe em? Who really has the issue here?
---
World firsts are going to go to the people that actually raid and and have been practicing this shit in pservers. Almost all of the top streamers are known for PvP and are going to get carried afterwards for gear.
---
Lol...the suggestion alone that streamers should be offlimits is hilarious.  If you cant handle faction pvp, you ought to roll on a PVE server at launch.
---
Go make a sammich and come back later. You probably need a break anyhow. Or... git gud
---
#It is okay for Classic to eventually die.
---
They've been banned for a while, because we discussed them for literally a year and a half. Streamers reee is quite recent, so it's probably being discussed by the mods team.
---
The issue is that they have said multiple times that they might not announce their server before hand. They’re expecting blizzard to do the work for them and create a server just for them.
---
For people like myself who is rolling with 30 other people, it makes me nervous that I might end up on a streamer server because they won’t announce their server. No way I can talk my 30 friends into re-rolling.
---
The streamers just need to announce their server beforehand.
---
I don't play wow. But damn i would love to see people hunting streamers like this
---
I get that. I’ve rolled shaman a few times and loved it, the only other thing that comes close to that diversity of play style for me is Druid. Though for some reason, I can’t help but want to stack strength and agi on a Druid with a sick 2H weapon and play it like a shaman....
---
He did say he has no problem turning off his stream to enjoy the game. But of course the hate mongering will take everything he says out of context.
---
soap and water
---
Classic was great.
---
TBC really wasn't.
---
Agreed. I want to be as far away from them as possible come classic.
---
&gt;If you want to argue for perma-Classic, show me a single example of a monthly sub game that survived without new content
---
&gt;&gt; Agree to disagree there I think
---
This just makes me want to kill him more!
---
Why would anyone do it? clout? fame? attention seeking? They despise the streamer so much that they want them to suffer endlessly?
---
When questioned with the motive, it makes you wonder who really has issues.
---
There are plenty of people these days who for some reason watch YouTube videos that take 10x longer to watch than it would to just read an article. Like the other reply to your comment that thinks skilled insight is somehow exclusive to YouTube. I really don’t understand it.

---
Due to the nature of HoT's not stacking they are actually good healer*, they are usually capped at 2 for alliance and 1 for horde. Innervate is not that strong and certainly not worth gimping your raid by brining 3+ Rdruids.
---
Okay ty, also how important is Defense stat for tanking druids?
---
Nah, not in 1.12, blessings are long. You're gonna be the most efficient healer in the game though.
---
Wholesome Vanilla Flavor
---
They probably will be upset given they’ll have a huge advantage in gold/loot donations, an ability to play all day every day, and a supply of people desperate to play with them so they’ll never have an issue filling a raid.
---
These are all great, but some are too intellectual for 14yo me
---
Most of the people in this thread don't realize the amount of effort stream snipers actually go through to grief streamers. It's often not going to be a "oopsie I killed a steamer". People are going to be hunting and killing any streamer over and over.. Not just Soda.
---
Pretty sure its having the opposite effect. People are pissed off and after 3 months of watching retarded streamers play they are going to lose their audience.
---
I cried when Dobby died.
---
"I would be surprised if streamers made up 1% of the population of the beta"
---
So, first, what is the population of a server? THEN, what's a reasonable number of total people that would be invited to play during a Beta test to have a pretty constant server pop? I'm completely guessing here, but I'd say ~4,000 online simultaneously for a server. Let's assume they're all losers who play 8 hours a day and spread out that time perfectly, so 12,000 total Beta Invites for testing. Maybe that number is way off, IDK, but 1% of 12,000 is 120 total invites for streamers. Now, that does seem a little low, but how many total streamers really were invited? 500? 1000? I don't even know any of the smaller WoW streamers, but it's in Blizzard's best interest to have streamers beta test than just normal people so that they get exposure. 
---
The whole blacklist thing - dude any player who is influential enough could do the same thing, they don't have to stream. 
---
&gt; If you do not want people to be able to hunt you, perhaps consider not constantly telling others your up to date location.
---
How tf is he supposed to do that? Not show game stream?
---
&gt; You get the perks of being a streamer, and one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you.
---
Oh, so you immediately contradict yourself and do say that it's impossible for him not to show it.
---
How about, you know, you just don't stream snipe? And if you ARE going to, at least go about it in a way that it isn't totally obvious that you're stream sniping. Stream snipers are annoying and do ruin stuff. Yes, sometimes, someone is called a stream sniper when they aren't really stream sniping. But when someone is playing a game, like a battle royale game, and the same 5 people are constantly joining that game and killing the streamer, it's bullshit.
---
C=Cathedral, A=Armory, G=Graveyard.

AFAIK:

Scarlet Belt drops from Scarlet Defenders (A,C) and Scarlet Myrmidons (A,C).
---
Scalet Gauntlets drops from Scarlet Centurions (C).
---
Scarlet Chestpiece drops from Scarlet Champions (C).
---
Scarlet Wristguards drops from Scarlet Guardsmen (A) and Scarlet Protectors (A).
---
Scarlet Boots drops from all trash in Scarlet Monastery.
---
Scarlet Leggings drop from Herod (A) and Scarlet Commander Mograine (C).
---
The main difference is that a normal person gets camped for 5 min to a few hours, a streamer could get camped every time they play
---
While the others are correct in that you will likely not complete the set before leveling out of it, I still found it a blast to try. My upper 30’s and low 40’s were often leveled just from doing SM and trying to get the pieces. 
---
I did complete the set, tabard and all, but it was after I was 60 and running guildies through for fun. Loved the Scarlet set, and Imperial. Wish there was at least a 60’s dungeon quality set as sexy as these (Valor/Heroism comes close, and given my play time this time around will likely be my armor set goal for Classic).
---
I think there is a mail helm with this model. Will try to find it
---
just as someone joining late in wow doesn't have problem with its role even when its nonsensical shit
---
In Vanilla I leveled NE Druid and on a Pserver/Classic Im doing a Tauren druid. So far Im liking the Tauren more for feral (main spec). Larger health pool and warstomp is amazing!! Though NE is alot easier for the 1-10 bracket being they start off with more mana. Shadowmeld is pretty useful to up until level 20 when you get cat form.
---
Getting ganked isn't being griefed, you're willingly signing up to that when on a pvp server.
---
I'm a purist, I avoid any add-ons that aren't required by my guild. I know people really disagree with this, but imo allowing add-ons in the first place was a mistake, but that's just me
---
A lot of people are also not taking their own advice. If you don't like the streamers, they have already said they are all going to be on the same server. Just don't play on that fucking server. A lot of doomsday "everyone on Sodas screen will get banned" type shit in this thread.
---
Yea, that's a totally normal thing to do. You don't have to spec into prot to tank dungeons until higher levels really
---
I would absolutely love a druid spec without shapeshifting, only melee skills.   
---
Playing as shaman is a struggle but if you are into soft-RP (totem quests and such) and don't mind unstable DPS its sooo good. Seeing and feeling those 2-handed windfury crits is pure gold
---
This is an argument for...?
---
Brilliant.
---
Young Jamie pull that duel demo up
---
How does such a co-op work out loot wise? And if the guilds raid together week-by-week, then why not merge into one anyway?!
---
Down with anyone who says “down with ______”. Think he’s annoyed with stream snipers obviously but his suggestion isn’t a good solution. Also camping isn’t the same as stream sniping.
---
One single character on the server ? You didnt even had bank alt ?
---
Oh I know SW and IF are both more PRACTICAL, no doubt about that. I just love the aesthetics of TB, and how different it is - shooting up into the air, looking all un-city like, unusually peaceful. Little elevator ride. I don't know, I just value the little things.
---
Orgrimmar, in my opinion, is like SW and IF. A good image for its faction, and very practical. But yeah, I do find it a bit dull, and I'm not a huge fan of its look.
---
It's about the attitude though. A hardcore guild will be cleaner on everything, and will not take hybrid dps. While the guild that would accept them is probably gonna be messy.
---
Dwarf. Benediction. Full tier 1. AV Ram.   
---
Peak Vanilla aesthetic imo.
---
He's meme-ing, warrior is THE tank class and the best dps come AQ40, while still being top before that even.  
---
The problem is, if you're solo, you're not worth as much.
---
During the events of classic, illidan was running a profitable ice-cream truck business.
---
stop projecting : )
---
technically it is all metzen's fanfic
---
it's those kind of times my friend, streamer persona is crying about everything and blame it on everybody else. its weird and i just hope it die's down
---
I hope to fucking God all the streamers play on the same fucking server!
---
If it was anyone else nobody would give a damn. They only hunt him because of the way he acts/reacts to it. Up until today I had no idea who he is, from now on he is on my KoS list, if I ever end up on a server with him (Which i hope wont happen).
---
again some of these apply to pve servers not just pvp. Also I agree but if someone is camping you it could be considered griefing especially by people coming from retail. These are just tips for them. I welcome anyone trying to camp me (slippery druid :D )
---

Most people would drop it. The only viable option is new content for classic. The rest just lead to the game getting worse and then restarting which isn't something most people will want to do.
---
&gt; Why would anyone do it? clout? fame? attention seeking? 
---
Fun.
---
Players are the content in MMORPGs.
---
I'm gonna answer your Questions while having played Rogue on P-Servers myself and hearing and seeing a lot of Mage stuff.
---
\- The 1.12 Talent Tree is great since Rogues got their Talents reworked pretty late into Classic. With 1.12 Talents stacking Melees in MC and BWL is very viable, it falls off at AQ40 but not that hard.
---
\- As a Rogue you want to be Human. The Sword specc is just too strong and you'll wield Swords for 90% of the Game. Even if you switch to Daggers with Kingsfall.
---
\- People love taking Mages as DPSers to Dungeons, mostly because of the Utility they bring. You still always find a Group for a Dungeon as a Rogue, which still brings more to the Table in Utility than a Fury/Arms Warrior.
---
\- Mages play in Arcane Specc for MC/BWL (beside 1 poor soul that has to go frost) and Rogues Combat. Both could be more effective in PVP with a different Specc.
---
\- Theres a lot of Competition for Swords, you won't take Maladath as a Human Rogue, because with Talents and your Racial you'll sit at 310 Wep Skill already. So its BIS for Furys, taking them to 309. Dagger isnt viable in comparison to Swords, this also depends how Retail will work. If Poison Proccs and Shadow Oil Proccs aren't normalized and scale with Spellpower maybe a fast Dagger Rogue with Shadow Oil and Flask of SP will outdps a Combat Rogue. I wouldn't count on it, since no one in Beta tested that already.
---
\- As a Rogue you absolutely NEED Engineering. There's no way around it, you'd gimp your dps too hard if thats importan to you. As a Mage its debatable, you'll still lose dps from the Sappers and Grenades are BIS for PVP, but the difference is a bit lower compared to Rogues.
---
I'm blind not deaf!
---
It has to ;-;
---
I cant see any AU guilds making that mistake with official servers. Most of us lived through than pain of no oceanic flagged servers. The old "oceanic" servers like blackrock have long been dead since wotlk. Low ping and higher pop in your local primetime is too attractive.
---
The comment never claimed to be in direct response to anything said in the video. Regardless of the opinions of the video, given the topic of stream sniping, almost everyone would be interested in Blizzard’s stance on the matter.
---
I like the starting over and the new TBC idea, however I want my Classic server char preserved forever this time. When I log on 5-10 years from now, I want it to be just like it was when I left. That is missing from BFA or anygame that will constantly force new updates. 
---
At the end of the day I just want a classic server that will always be left how it was. Even if the server is dead, that's okay, because it'll be more of "trophy" server anyway. I know MMO want to be an ever evolving game that last for numerous years, but I'd love something more akin to booting up my 15 year old zelda game and everything is just how I left it. Sure there is nothing to do in that save anymore and why "new" games/server should exist, but it'd be nice to just log on out of the blue years later and reminisce about all you did in classic.
---
Whirlwind axe.
---
I would take pserver guides with a grain of salt.
---
On retail, mobs will have different Argo ranges and actually fully working AI and pathing.
---
I doubt you will be able to do what you do on pservers.
---
The post is about if you get camped by a ganker, which definitely is griefing.
---
Dead servers? You are underestimating Classic and RP community overall.
---
Would people actually RP on the RPPVP servers? That wasn’t 95% of my experience the first go-around on one in vanilla. I am wondering if that is why Blizz hasn’t made them a priority, weighing it against more servers/server types to divvy up the player base (although I think there will be enough players that this shouldn’t be a problem, but is the only reason why I can think that Blizz wouldn’t do RPPVP severe).
---
Nothing gets past you m8
---
Yeah the logic gap of the hate hive mind is pretty astonishing. Deep down there has to be a sense of jealousy for people who get to sperg out on video games for a living.
---
Just a sub
---
Call in a guildie is always good, that's how huge PvP battles start.
---
you can always ENHANCE
---
Any biker can be my daddy, they know how to clean exhaust pipes the best.
---
most of the streamers are the spergs you autist, they are the retards playing wow 16 hours a day, you cant out sperg the spergs
---
It's jsut a random number but since a layer is about to hold 3-5k people it is not unreasonable to expect 4-5 layers per realm.
---
What’s up with the f5 meme what are people anxiously refreshing for?
---
Quality over quantity!
---
Lemme say people are shit at PvP in the wild. I got attacked by people 5 level higher than me while I was half hp and had a mob at my ass and I still won. Then you go onto a battleground and suddenly people know their shit. I think I never lost an encounter in the wild.
---
Just a sub, but you would've been invited before you needed to actually pay the fee.
---
Also don't get your hopes up, looks like basically no-one else is getting in at this point.
---
I think the only reason everyone hangs out in Orgrimmar is because the Zeppelins leave from there and not Thunder Bluff.
---
Do you ask for an invite or do they randomly offer one ?
---
OK but when can I get that pink hair?
---
Im still going pvp server but just rolling a class with stealth. Gonna live that feral druid life.
---
&gt;On a PvE server they would have a case in some scenarios where it could be considered griefing under blizzard's own existing TOS.
---
Griefing rules are indeed VERY different between PvE and PvP servers.
---
This is what I'm going to do:
---
1. Herbalism/Skinning during leveling, dropping Skinning for Alchemy (Fla$K$), selling the gathered skins for money (you'll kill a lot of mobs and this will help you fund your mount). Use the gathered herbs to level Alchemy later on.
---
2. Banking alt for DME DE since you can DE anything with 1/300.
---
4chan is funny at least. Reddit is just salty.
---
I don't think you understand what that word means lil dude
---
10 to 20 would be a brutal sitting.
---
Yeah it’s world of war craft man. There is a literal war between both factions going. When the game is fresh and te world is booming, it will feel like the war is very prominent.
---
It’s a great part of the game, and if you enjoy pvp and roll on said server it’s just something you have to deal with. Everyone gets ganked, camped, harassed on pvp servers at some point. It’s just something you have to fight, or be a victim and complain about it.
---
Although complaining about it like you, and soda do is only going to conspire negative feedback, especially when you can do something about it and not play pvp.
---
ugh, don't remind me
---
They shouldn't even bother with progression servers or servers based on later expansions. Them mentioning TBC servers as a possibility was really dumb on their part.
---
My toughts exactly lol
---
I don't know how to make it more clear that I don't value your opinion. I would have thought the two posts saying pretty much exactly that would have clued you in.
---
Fortunately I intend to quit my job XD
---
Your ex guild.
---
Who cares about streamers seriously. Just put a delay or stop streaming.
---
Go gank other faction lowbies. Though I guess that could be considered 'Go to another zone'.
---
And I agree, ganking on a PVP is not griefing.
---
Take a shit.
---
Unless he linked it, that actually kinda sucks for OP. He went through the effort of making this video and only gets one view for some dude showing 30k people.
---
They got into beta...the masses didn’t.
---
Asmongold has said that he thinks he will be playing on a pve server. Said last week don't know if he has changed his mind since then.
---
I’ll be the one to say it: you’re a loser
---
Hahahaha, his response to what his ELO in LoL is: 
---
&gt;I don't do ranked, people are too mean.
---
So griefing others, particularly players who stream where they're at giving the griefers an advantage they wouldn't normally have is fun?
---
At what point is it okay/fun to make others experience worse? Is it okay just in a virtual world but not the real world? Is your time worth more than others? I think trying to equate this action to fun speaks volumes about someone mental state.
---
Scarab Lord. It ain't gonna happen. Not unless Blizzard collectively strokes out and makes it a recurring event.
---
Those "spergs that play Wow" you mention are literally what those streamer guilds are. Exept for the fact, that those spergs are the best of the best in those guilds. Soda's guild is pretty much going to be 50% players from Method and 50% Multi rank 1/super high rated pvp players. 
---
I just don't understand how some players here get so triggered about streamers (and btw misinterpreted what Soda said about the blacklist) instead of just enjoying the game.
---
Mhm, many people have various reasons for anything, I'd say the most heard is their attitude towards stream sniping: they don't accept this downside of a job where you expose your gameplay to thousands of people and you make a good amount of money playing games you like. There are consequences to having a streamer on your serv, but that's mainly due to their dumb communities of sheep, other than that they're "fine", people will have their reasons though, I'm just here for the memes
---
Soda who?  Never heard of her.
---
I don't consider it griefing, you're saying "Yes, I would like to be killed whilst grinding/leveling/afk and corpse camped." when you make your character on a pvp server. If it has a PvP solution (get some friends, ask for help) it isn't griefing.
---
Why don't they just put a delay on their stream...
---
No one likes playing Alliance warlocks on a PVP server because every single rogue is undead and you're a free kill to him!
---
zoomer mad because his favorite streamer got put on blast lmao
---
It’d be cool if I did, don’t care if I don’t. I wouldn’t mind exploring a bit, and trying to test things, but hard to get excited about toons and progress that’ll be wiped in a couple of months. Don’t understand why others are so rabid about it.
---
But there are plenty on both sides of this, to each their own. The ‘don’t care’ crowd simply is quiet by its very nature, don’t care. Nothing to say. Doesn’t mean that crowd doesn’t exist. In fact I imagine it is the larger crowd.
---
It's just during leveling
---
&gt; if someone is camping you it could be considered griefing especially by people coming from retail.
---
Since Warmode was introduced to Retail and plenty of people, even on PVE servers, enabled it, I would hope that they would understand this before rolling on a PVP server. Of all the differences between Retail and Classic I think this is the most minimal.
---
Jellybeans just switched over to Alliance a few days ago on the Beta Relm.
---
Have u ever been to a lan where people tried to cheat by looking over someone else's screen? It's kind of the same thing lol
---
&gt; Why would you skip utility spells that give you new and interesting mechanics that increase the fun of your time playing the game?
---
Because if I have to choose between utility and faster levelling I'll choose the latter.
---
Whatever you do: Remember their names. Write them down. 
---
Ask around: Does anyone know them? Befriend the people who know them.
---
Find out their adress.
---
Go to their house at night.
---
Watch them sleep.
---
Smell their hair while they sleep.
---
Take some of their hair while they sleep.
---
Take some of their hair.
---
Take all their hair.
---
Take a shit in their mailbox.
---
That'll teach them.
---
Problem is, that's not the moderators fault. People are just &lt;think of my swearwords here&gt;....
---
I mean they keep on upvoting all those memes and stuff, so apparently there's a mindless audience that enjoys this kind of stuff. Nothing the mods are doing is wrong. It's just people being utterly mindless beings.
---
no only F&amp;F which means streamers
---
Not going to work. The progression idea is out of the question unless they do it alongside normal servers which just splits the community up. Anything that isn't Classic+ is a waste of time imo.
---
This is so wholesome &lt;3
---
Oh good, can we stop spamming the forums/reddit with this streamer crap now?
---
Thanks Kyle 
---
See you over at r/kyle
---
Soda is a retarded man-baby and should be treated as such.
---
it actually makes perfect sense to me
---
Paladins definitely have an edge over shamans when it comes to supporting the raid. One paladin can give everyone in the raid a blessing while one shaman can only buff one group. And I don't understand why blessing of salvation is more powerful than tranquil air when it already has the advantage of bring raidwide. It is certainly about 90% of the reason why my warlock will be alliance. We already struggle with threat, don't want to make it even harder.
---
Absolutely fucking jealousy. I can’t tell if 80% of the people here are 45 or 15.
---
Great retort
---
no im going alliance....
---
/cry
---
As far as server fragmentation, once naxx has been out long enough and the content has been cleared, I don't really see the issue if those servers start to dry up anyways. Blizzard has their mega-server tech and could join the servers back together if classic's population drops low enough to be a problem on any one server. I'd be fairly certain there are enough people who would be interested in perpetual evergreen Classic that at least one server would still have guilds running raids. 
---
I'd argue the same for TBC and WOTLK, especially since TBC and WOTLK actually have fun raid content compared to Vanilla.
---
Every expansion is 1 step forward, 5 steps backward.
---
That said, we have basically identified the big mistakes in every expansion so if we could just avoid those and stick to what makes MMO RPGs great... that would be great.
---
There are over 7 billion people on Earth. You are never the "only one" anything, ever. ;)
---
No. You also aren't the only one making a post like this to feel special.

Also the sub is just plain content starved while we wait for release. There are only so many topics to pick from and streamers are one of them.

Yeah, I noticed

YA and not only that, you get to know them, become really good friends IRL, then they ask you to be best man at their wedding, and you say YES, and on their wedding day, you go, but in the envelope you only give them $175 instead of the standard $200 lmao GOTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMMM
---
This sodaguy idiot, WILLLINGLULLYL is streaming for the entire world... and it's the stream snipers fault?
---
I could definitely see a spike in druids from watching Soda. I understand he irks some people but he is definitely a very good druid. Makes me kind of want to roll one lol
---
It was a joke bro. Chill out.
---
For classic I want to go hybrid balance/restoration. I know it won't be the best thing out there, but I just have a desire to do it. I like the idea of being able to do a little bit of both healing and damage, whichever is necessary at a given time. That and the class fantasy is cool to me.
---
I know that I'll be using a lot of mana pots and demonic runes for mana, what's it like farming them? Easy or not? Time consuming or not? What other consumables should I be expecting to use?
---
Is bloodvine from tailoring going to be BiS still? I know it's BiS for straight balance, but what about hybrid? Are there any standout BiS items I should know about?
---
I'm planning on using [this 23/0/28 talent build](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMxcZZxxckgq). Feel free to critique it and give me some feedback. Cheers!
---
nah I'd wager to say general douchebaggery a la sodapoppin and tipsout
---
Oh fair enough. I havent played BFA so Im not sure how Warmode works. Havent heard many good things though most things I hear come from this sub so that could be why. Eitherway a few tips never hurt.
---
Shit reddit app won't load the image.. Ah yes, I'll open the link in the browser, works every time.

What the hell, same black screen.

&gt;\- As a Rogue you absolutely NEED Engineering. There's no way around it, you'd gimp your dps too hard if thats importan to you. As a Mage its debatable, you'll still lose dps from the Sappers and Grenades are BIS for PVP, but the difference is a bit lower compared to Rogues.
---
Excuse me? Can you elaborate on losing major dps in PvE as a Rogue without Engineering? Don't remember too many engi rogues from my guild in Vanilla days and did quite well in raiding.
---
I think there is a possible solution for that. Reset servers every x year, give ability to transfer your end game character to upper tier expansion and make an end game server that will never reset where you can make a copy of your end game character. That way people who wants to experience vanilla and people who want to have vanilla trophies can do so at the same time.

He literally just indirectly spawned a mob of people to form a &lt;STREAM SNIPERZ&gt; guild because of how much of an entitled brat he is. I was avoiding streamer servers like the plague - this one video makes me want to reconsider that and grief him via camping all fuckin' day.
---
Good job Soda, you brought this on yourself ya brat
---
&gt; Aside from a couple of completely arbitrary locations where flying could pretty much be replaced by a staircase (Elemental Plateau, Skettis, Tempest Keep, probably something else that I forget), the only thing flying does in TBC is let you take shortcuts.
---
Fuck no, having no flight in TBC or WOTLK would be insanity.
---
It's like those people who post photos of the whole family going on vacation. You know you're gonna get robbed while you're away.
---
By dropping your wallet, you are aware there's a decent chance people will steal whatever money it had. If you drop your wallet intentionally and expect nothing to happen, you're dumb. You're right that it's not morally okay to just ruin someone else's experience, I agree with that. 
---
But a game should NEVER ban for stream sniping. Ever. Streaming is a choice. The person that streams must be aware of the risks of doing so.
---
Yes, instead we can care about what /u/FlexMasterBoom is saying. He's really important!
---
If you can't muster a larger army of followers to bodyguard you than the stream snipers can to snipe you, what does that say about who watches your stream?
---
We didn't have streaming back in '05 - the closest we had was large well-known EQ guilds picking servers.  We had a few on Stormreaver.  I'll tell you how world PVP organically started.
---
&lt;Domain of Pain&gt; wants some PvP action.  They start attacking Southshore.  News travels in faction chat that DoP is ganking.  Some 60s come out in larger numbers and counter them.  Soom news travels in faction chat that DoP needs reinforcements and more and more 60s come out and before you know it you have 40v40+ world pvp war going on.
---
Streamers have the ability to catalyze this same organic PvP gameplay.  They need to embrace that, or they need to roll PvE.  It's that simple.
---
Yeah this is true. In fact pvp brings the community together even more. When your getting camped, call upon the high level hero’s of your faction to come help. Or start a raid with people of your level to take em out. I honestly hate the I’m a victim so ganging is considered harassment argument.
---
God forbid the guy making a million+ each year and constantly broadcasting his location gets hunted by some random. We better ban the random person who saw the stream and wanted to see if they could kill the dude for fun, right?
---
Why do you play any PVP game? You realize killing the other players in Counter Strike ruins their experience, right? How could you!!!
---
You’re a fucking baby and a loser.
---
He is. I am in the beta (don't kill me, not a streamer, just got lucky as hell), and grouped with him briefly last night. Now, I usually avoid streamers like the plague (hard to do on the beta server but possible at times), but didn't know one was in the group I joined. He was just a cool, laid-back guy. Would definitely party with him again. Wish the others were more like him.
---
Sharding's in the game. Shit is actually fucked up now.
---
I don't stream and I have beta access.
---
This is 6 piece.  .5 makes them workable, but only after pushing through a chunk of the questline.

See... I just proved my point
---
Kids just naturally want a pack to follow while adults are developmentally way past this for the most part. You’re probably spot on with your assumption.
---
Ah so you have no ability to take a joke
---
Nodes at launch will be impossible to get, this is my thinking anyway. I will go skinning and tailoring. Still get leather for everything you kill, also bags gear while you level.
---
How about you simplify it by defining the word "charactical" for me?
---
That’s good, to be fair in recent memory I can’t recall it happening in end game for myself.
---
It only ever seems to be through levelling dungeons.. which is silly because that’s probably where you would expect others to be more lenient but instead people have a “get it done incredibly fast with 0 communication” attitude which leads to these random votes.
---
Even in the official rule book this is not considered griefing. I dont think being camped is griefing at all. I just kind lumped all of it together for the sake of the post.
---
Ganking is just ganking. Griefing is when you stay on that poor lowbie instead of ganking others. I don't think it should be punishable though since as you said, it's a PvP server.
---
Most streamers aren’t those guys...
---
You specifically opt-in for Classic beta on the website.
---
Assuming they "don't fuck it up", the ideal solution would be adding more PvP/pve content by filling out the original azeroth map.
---
Half the map is inaccessible or incomplete zones with even more " present" but inaccsible areas.
---
I honestly think it would be a no brained to extent the game with horizontal content applyapplying tbc's dungeon progression and attunement quests combined with vanillas "all raids are still relevant at all time".
---
I love listening to him. He has such a likeable tone to his voice.
---
Down with soda? Lmao fuck you.
---
Without that reference the meme makes no sense tho ?
---
Why do they have to be poor? Why do they have to be a typical kid name like “Billy”?
---
Absolutely. DAOC did this very well - you hated the other factions. I've said this in other threads, but I'm sick of people pushing this "kumbaya" narrative. War is literally is the name of the game - **War**craft. Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. 
---
Also letting people communicate to their enemy is just toxic in general, there's no gain to immersion and all downside. Horrible idea. So many players really have no idea about what makes a game good.
---
100g an hour at least. I could farm more in less time.
---
Hype. If I had the beta I probably wouldn't play it. Don't have time to spend on a character that will be deleted anyways. Saving my energy for release.
---
Just snipped it in the butt.
---
Imo, the Paladin helm should have been a golden version of the helm the Scarlet Crusade warriors wear. The one with the wings on the side.

I was always so disappointed that helm was not available to players.

Please level as enhancement shaman.

You thank me later...

Oh thought it was 4. I have considered playing a hybrid and going for the second dungeon set but its doesnt seem worth it with my limited time
---
Yes, please excuse the horror that is me enjoying something that you don't.
---
ive never played rp-pvp, do people behave differently than on regular pvp servers?
---
So wait until level 5 or 10? Level 1 and your initial armor is short lived.

Wanna try some of that Gamer Meth?
---
PVP can and does happen naturally, however opening someones stream in order to hunt them down is the problem, if you can't see that then I feel sorry for you.
---
And then you resort to name calling, just wow, absolutely incredible.

I'm only salty about the potential money I could earn by selling my beta access. I have absolutely zero interest in any form of beta for any game. I'll play the finished product when it releases thank you very much.

Would you rather hang out in the industrious capital of Ironforge, the idealic gardens of Stormwind or in a bunch of mud huts surrounded by spikes and raptor feces?
---
It's entirely up to you of course, but I know where I'll be going.
---
I love being down voted on Reddit. Thanks man, I agree 100 percent with you.
---
Naw, I don't give a shit. Seeing people no life a beta that is getting wiped is hilarious.
---
Soda did not jump on the hype train that's for sure.
---
Anything with Streamer in the title isn't going to be content, it's all meta whining.
---
I'm not a Soda fan but I'll still probably get downvoted for this but here goes:  
---
You're a stream sniper. You choose to play on a specific server so you can actively ruin the experience of a a player or players by using the power you've gained through having the ability to know where they are and what they are doing at all times. I'm actually fine with that - if you have that power use it and have fun with it.   
---
But when a streamer who has the power to actively ruin your experience by using their influence(power) to "blacklist" you, that's somehow wrong?  
---
" If you do not want people to be able to hunt you, perhaps consider not constantly telling others your up to date location.  You get the perks of being a streamer, and one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you. " 100% agreed. But I also feel it's pretty fucking entitled to think that the streamers shouldn't  be able to do anything to stop or discourage the hunt.  
---
The grey area in the whole situation is what if it's just a random dude who ganks the streamer? If you just happen to randomly kill a streamer in the world and camp him for a while and get "blacklisted" because of that, that would be pretty shit so hopefully he's talking about people who are obvious snipers and try to hunt him on the regular when he's streaming.   
---
TL;DR: Sniping and hunting down streamers is all well and good but don't cry when someone whose fun you're trying to ruin ruins your fun in retaliation.
---
It’s viable. You a little less control, but more damage. You’ll find yourself eating while you drink (many times frost doesn’t take enough damage to warrant using free food while drinking). Because you will likely take more damage while killing mobs, you’re arguably more vulnerable to being ganked. Conversely, Pyro is a satisfying opener on that rogue that’s been bothering you. 
---
Arguably you’re 3 talent points behind Frost, because +hit. Up to you how important that is.
---
It never said ret to begin with
---
furbies in felwood. sofun.
---
Is this the new "what comes after Naxx" post?
---
Eventually they become one guild - it's just easier that way. Early in MC we had a shared loot system and ran co-op raids with another guild (shoutout to Short Bus on Gorefiend for doing this with us). After about a few weeks, we were making real progress, getting a decent amount of loot, and decided merging guilds would be the best. They remained as a bit 'clique-ish' for a while, but it really made life easier, especially being able to look and see how many raiders we had on.
---
This sub and its crusade against streamers is getting ridiculous
---
You know it!
---
It would be like walking down the street waving a band of hundreds around with your eyes closed and wondering why someone would have the nerve to steal it
---
I had already planned to hunt him down on my hunter. Not even stream sniping. Just kill on sight. Ezpz. He’s not that good.
---
This would be such good marketing for them dude... They should 100% do this.
---
But it won’t be the 27th for me. So maybe it is for him but It’ll still be Monday the 26th where I’m at.
---
I thought my country bumpkin internet wasn't loading the picture at first

"You think we do, but we don’t." This reminds me of some Sodapoppin audio clip back in the day :D
---
if one person can steal the name asmongold on every realm ! i will spend a lot of money ! if you give me the evidence, i will pay ! how much ? we can talk :)
---
So much this... "I want the real experience" "... but without the real inconveniences"
---
maybe
---
I cant see the future
---
KeK
---
We’re probably both going to get downvoted to oblivion but idc.
---
I honestly couldn’t agree more. Addons like this is exactly the kind of shit that killed WoW and brought us to current day retail.
---
Reading through the comments of all the praise for this makes me so fucking sick to my stomach to see what this subreddit has turned into...
---
Looks like the retail scrubs are jumping on the bandwagon and not only bringing their garbage along with them, but polluting this reddit with it.
---
If you can’t take 3 fucking seconds to read what an ability does before training it, why are you playing classic? The game is just probably not for you.
---
alright great argument buddy
---
Yeah, this is a good idea. It's sounds something akin to Diablo 3 seasons where players get to keep their seasonal chars on the "main" server. That "main" server would be the "end game server that will never reset" and after every season, players would get their characters copied to it to preserve forever in a Classic realm.
---
Honesty I hope that the top guilds and leaders on classic servers with be private server guilds, not neck beard bears beta boy streamers.
---
Private servers get a lot of hate, but they are honestly the people who are die hards, and have been supporting and pushing the vanilla scene for over a decade now. They aren’t just playing the game because of the hype, and doing whatever gets them views. There are low key, and passionate about the game.
---
Well thats basicly what makes a good character. An ability to have something that makes you attractive, likeable or relatable etc.
---
People like that succeed in this kind of business. People who dont have those kind of abilities fails. The solutions are to give up or start creating bullshit content to leech of from other peoples lives. Such as "content creators" of today, who make shitpost videos about other streamers.
---
Beeing a **Guildleader** is like taking on a 2nd fulltime job, nevertheless im still going to do it again.   
---
With some of the people i played with back in vanilla. Im looking forward to this. But since ive done it before i feel like it will be easier this time around, when things are not "new".  
---
I even managed to get some of my old classleaders to join me again in Classic.
---
Then don’t watch. How hard is that?
---
This is the best comment I have seen.  We need to make a list of servers that streamers are rolling on so we can all roll on a different one.  I dont personally mind streamers but I dont want to deal or even see giant groups following 1 person around.  Also dont really want to hear people bitch about it anymore... but...
---
You mean kill them :)
---
... except no, because addons were a pretty big part of Classic and I'm sure most people who played during vanilla used them (I did.) 
---
Nothing ironic about it.
---
I don't remember vanilla that much about druid, but i'm really concerned about the viability in wpvp.  
---
I mean, ok you can survive / escape a lot, but i want to kill and chase too.
---
Everything i read tell me that every classes will laugh at my kitty. :/
---
That's a fine spec for PvP. But realistically you won't ever be casting damaging spells in raids as a druid and if you were, you'd want Boomkin form for the Aura and ask your raid leader to put you in a group of Fire Mages and Holy Paladin who love that 3% crit buff. Even then though, you usually wont see a boomy until AQ patch when it makes sense to bring one because of not only the gear that becomes available in AQ but also mages are frost up until then and paladins are starting to scale really well. 
---
Is it easy farming demonic runes? Yes. Time consuming? Yes. If you do Scholo runs you'll get prio on Dark Runes as a healer which I would recommend using instead. Major Mana potions and spamming rank 4 healing touch (your primary heal as a druid in raids) should keep you in most fights long enough. Additionally, you'll want to be saving innervate for your priests so don't be stingy.

As of today WillitClassic website bugged off and became unresponsive. Tried out on different computers, with different web browsing programs - result remains the same. It opens up with initial page and request to confirm usage of cookies. Neither confirmation nor denial is possible and no other functions on website work.
---
You really think your gonna have raiders turn up to clear a raid with no gear upgrades?
---

---
People are just too toxic in TCG's. I played MTG back in the day and also Hearthstone when it came out and I can totally understand why they took away the chat option. You probably need a whole army of people either monitoring or working on tickets in regards to people misbehaving in chat. Take that option away and they save a boatload of money. Easy decision for a company...
---
If you have played on a Pserver you would notice that there is a lot of social interaction between players because you simply can't play the game properly on your own. It is the same in the beta as far as what I have seen.
---
So I tink you will be very happy when Classic comes out and we can all socialize in the wonderfull world of Azeroth again!
---
There’s a difference though.  Happening upon someone and camping them will happen no doubt.  Maybe they’re from a particularly annoying guild and you take your frustrations out on them.  That inspires rivalry which in some cases can actually turn into healthy world pvp.
---
What OP is talking about though is something else than just world pvp.  He’s talking about finding where one particular person is via their stream (server, zone, possibly quest line) and purposefully hunting them down and camping them.
---
There’s not a massive difference, but the extra steps turn it from natural wpvp to actual, hate-based harassment.  While there’s not really anything in place to prevent something like this (unless they start doing something like sending the messages from another account as well), it sucks the life out of both players’ experiences.  For the streamers viewers too.  I’m not pro or against streamers, I view it as someone who is doing a job and attempting to entertain people.  Hating them for that is a really weird concept to me.   So hunting someone because of who they are outside of the game Is not, as you put it “treating them like any other player”, that’s just hate.

The areas are way too large and layered. Questing across Outland or Storm Peaks would be an absolute pain in the ass and make the already lengthy grind even worse.
---
And your argument isn't great either, you just said we can use ledges when that's not the main issue. The main issue is that they built Outland and WOTLK for flying, and you'd make the questing process even longer, when TBC was already grindy af.
---
That's why the voting system exists.. downvote posts you don't like and upvote posts you like, if you end up liking more posts in controversial than hot, this might not be the sub for you.  
---
But in all honesty, what do you really expect to be on the frontpage? The 15.000nd post about what happens after naxx ? The what should I play ? The what professions should I get ? There's no better content because the game isn't out yet.
---
I mean.... this is kind of retarded.   
---
Anyone can make a "Blacklist" for any reason... people have to actively agree and follow that blacklist for it to work.  
---
Sooooo if it works... then enough people feel the same way, if not, then it won't work.   
---
Either way who the fuck cares.   
---
This sounds like some shit back in the day on the playground when some kids wouldn't let you play with them so you go home and cry to your mom. Who the fuck... cares..   
---
And I can somewhat agree with his point also, why play on his server? Go play on a different fucking server.   
---
if you are there by accident then you won't be stream sniping so it won't apply to you.
---
No I will gladly avoid the server they are on. But Im not picking the server my brother is so hopefully he avoids them to.
---
You will be able to reserve names before launch, and I bet you that streamers will be allowed to reserve them even earlier.
---
imagine going on reddit, reading like 3 comments that have similar opinions, and then basically saying that ALL classic players are represented by this tiny subset
---
I aggree. I use addons to help me, but I'd preffer if WoW didn't permitted addons at all.
---
I 100% disagree with what Soda was saying and I think it's ridiculous that streamers want to "take action" against "stream snipers." But my point is that just because a select few of the really popular streamers say something, doesn't mean all streamers are bad. Most of them play the game like everyone else. 
---
Also, my point about preferential treatment was more referring to them all having access to the beta, not benefits in the actual game.
---
It worked with DKPs as well IIRC. It can be more complex than it seems at first glance. For example, sometimes it was 30 raid members from guild A, 10 from guild B. Maybe guild B was 50 member, but just 10 of them will raid, or whatever. Guild A won't lose it's name, neither guild B. Sometimes they will merge, and those merges sometimes went well but, in other cases it meant a lot of people leaving the new guild because didn't like the "new" enviroment.
---
It was quite challenging to run a guild/40 man raids in classic, will be interesting how it works nowdays.
---
A day without a streamer post is a day wasted apparantly.
---
I don’t mind the cosmetic UI addons but I really don’t like addons like Weakauras or Dpsmax that tell you what to do and when. 
---
It makes it feels that instead of playing the game you just react to what the addons tell you to do.
---
I usually have a stream on when I am casually gaming, not a wow streamer but still.  At launch I will def have my 2nd screen up for Google searches good upbeat music and maybe a quest map because I'm trying to get ahead of the average player in the first 24 hrs.
---
Nah, the arguement is if they've been screwing up for so long, what makes people think they won't screw up 1.13
---
Thanks, that's very helpful!
---
Thats a no from me, dawg
---
The loss of the social aspect is why I couldn't get into retail, so I definitely get where you're coming from.
---
With that said, hop onto a private server and go to the barrens. It's not just the "occasional" toxic player any more (there are still tons of good people of course).
---
The number of people there are out there who are filles with vitriol and hate and want nothing more than a chance to spew it are astounsing, and it's bad enough that you'd need a massive moderation team to handle reports - and a lot of companies aren't willing to pay this cost if they don't view it as a necessary part of the game.
---
Lol right
---
Happyminti was always entertaining
---
https://youtu.be/YvQoYMq8_Ng
---
Nerf sap 8 in particular was my favorite
---
You know they actually found bugs in SM?
---
RP players are usually more mature and behave better while still playing the game, enjoying it in various way. There is less serious competition but good players and serious guilds still are still there. I would say that you can give it a shot.
---
id like rppvp servers but not if its only 1 per continent, i dont wanna play so far spread from my timezone
---
To expand upon this: mail add-ons are fine because they don't take away anything. Quest add-ons are not alright, because the point was to read the quest and understand by yourself where to go. It gets your immersed. Making it easier is taking away from the original game, so it's not the same as UI add-ons, but I find people who go for that pretty hypocritical.
---
I never understood this rant on it. I plan fully to have add-ons just like I did in Vanilla. Fuck searching for a ambiguous location of a monster or searching a website for it. Tell me within the product since I don't want to waste 10 minutes looking for the same info. It's also the same issue that I don't see an issue with a lot of the things people complain about for BFA. It's quite nice and enjoyable and pleasant to look at. Dungeons are super cool and interesting, the quests are fun and unique, the 'dailies' are easy to do, and the add-ons aren't anything different than what I'd use normally. The only thing I have is a Alt + healing add-on to make that life easier to manage.
---
I always vender my starter gear. Don't equip anything until it has stats.
---
And why is that?  I wanna hear honest opinions
---
Who is going to make a streamer black list? So we can kill them and report them for ruining the game.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Head to the official forums and add your support to the post if you haven’t already.
---
Silithis to Darnassus
---
Can someone send me the link for this please?
---
thanks :)
---
9/10 vanilla, didn't immediately charge the dying rogue on sight
---
The healing kind.
---
Actually, I am an enhancement shaman and already farming for lvl 40^^
---
They should instead do this: Once they have been reported for stream sniping by a certified streamer, they are unable to join that streamer's server, thus eliminating getting stream sniped but also allowing them to play normally
---
Cause they sad when I stunlock them in beta, kill them, spit on their corpse and camp them. They think it's stream sniping. Hate to tell them, it's just vanilla wow.
---
Going to copy and paste from a comment I made ages ago: 
---
Avoid at all costs:
---
Warlocks. They will eat you alive. Even in full t10 gear I would avoid green geared fresh 60 warlocks. The fear will lock you up something fierce and the dots melt through you, ignoring armor.
---
Shamans. Don't counter as hard as warlocks do, but generally bad news bears. They can self heal, like you do, and damage like you do, but they don't have to change forms to do so (shapeshifting is a huge mana sink, so going toe to toe with a shaman you will probably oom faster).
---
They also move quick enough to stay on your heels (ghost wolf), and if they apply their frost shock well, they are basically the only class that can stick to you. Avoid equally geared opponents, but if you have a significant gear advantage you can just power through them with superior tank and damage.
---
You're strong into:
---
Mages. You hard counter one of the most overplayed classes in the game. Crit double-firing ravage into a Furious Bite to open from stealth WILL one shot a mage if his shield is down and he isn't ready for you. If he gets his shield up in time, he will likely blink away but be crippled at very low hp. You can shift out of / are immune to all of his lockup. They simply can't kite you like they can other classes.
---
Warriors (low power levels only). You don't rely on gear nearly as much as warriors do. At low levels, and at low-gear 60, your bearform is basically a better version of them, plus you can heal and kite. However once they have good gear this matchup swings in their favor HARD. I had about 10k hp and I was at the armor cap in bear form, and a top-tier warrior could still cut through me like paper.
---
Rogues (high power levels only). At low levels, and low-gear 60, you don't really have the HP requires to survive a rogue's opener. However once you get some equipment, your HP will outscale their damage. Stay in bear form and watch them tickle you, while you keep them from vanishing with FF and laugh.
---
its viable
---
https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
very viable. Dps classes have very little or no self heal in vanilla, so just is+mf and then focus on ctrl and kiting.
---
Very strong, very high skill ceiling.
---
Yep level 5, still the same few items from quests, level 10 still same quest items unless you got a lucky drop.
---
Because is Nostalrius, thanks.
---
Can you go ahead and link the definition, not what you think it means, a dictionary definition of the word "charactical"?
---
Yes, babies get called babies. I hope your fee fees are ok.
---
It seems to work fine for tons of other streamers.
---
Doubt you will be able to copy character.
---
I however see them upgrading classic servers to TBC
---
Sign me the fuck up
---
I think an addon like this is generally bad for the spirit of the game.  Those looking to min/max gold while leveling should already know what not to purchase, which tells me this addon is aimed at new players.  New players should be encouraged to play as they wish and experiment with everything, imo.  I know the addon is only a recommendation for level 40 mount money efficiency, but newer players may take the non-recommendations as a hard line "don't ever get this spell because it has 0 use".
---
All you need on a mage is frost bolt and blink till 60.
---
This is why I will never play on a pvp server unless I’m a rogue. Played a rogue to 70 when BC came out and ganking was a blast.
---
And what would we call someone who makes a reddit post in attempts to defend a streamer against slander?
---
Hadn’t seen the petition. There is also a forum post on the classic discussion forums.
---
Does deactivating error speech affect it? Cause they definitely don't play with it.
---
He's talked about how he never had a competitive mindset, which was something he had to learn when playing CSGO professionally for Cloud9. Some people are competitive by nature, but if it's a learned skill it may be much easier for him to let those kinds of things go.
---
My guild wasn't stream sniping when we killed him last week. He was being an ass and messing with low level guildies. He got wrecked for it. Screw that guy. 
---
Besides, you don't even have to stream snipe in the beta; just ask in world chat and someone will tell you where they are.
---
Sodapoppin is an entitled asshole.
---
It wasn't supposed to be hostile,  lol.
---
Hope you're doing okay.
---
dont ask me 4 ninervate ok?
---
There is a domino effect to every change.
---
Or put at least an hour delay on the stream. Can't get streamsniped if your stream shows u are in arathi while you're actually in stranglethorn
---
m8 the mods are watching 24/7 with eagle eye to delete any of my posts which aren't "related to WoW classic" or whatever.  they just have stupid rules
---
Release is the day after our students come back... I was bummed that my summer plans fizzled so quickly.
---
Blizz QoL changes have a much large impact on the game, and addons can never be that powerful
---
such as looking for raid and dungeon finder or wellfare gear
---
Also you have to consider any of the long lasting addons that exist, are basically what Blizz intended when they made there API.
---
So while a threat meter or an auctioneer is a QoL, Blizz has gone and broken certain auctioneers that automated the process.
---
Nah streamers are mediocre places. Top guilds are going to be the same top guilds on pservers. They've been farming this content for 10 years waiting for this day. I bet most streamers don't even make it to 60.
---
For tanking or damage?
---
The "community" will accept anything if you're good. Random pug raid leaders aren't the community though.
---
make sure you go to your beta preferences in account management and tick the box for classic beta. however, blizz said they've drastically reduced the amount of invites they're giving out at this point
---
what exactly do you want posted if not memes?  we gonna discuss hit cap for the billionth time?
---
Honestly 90% of the people I will be playing with want to heal...
---
Popular streamers will definitely make the game weird. They'll have such a cult following it'll be unreal. Or they'll just get pooped on. idk. It's certainly going to be very different for a game like Classic compared to Vanilla when streaming was unpopular/improbable.
---
I love this. Soda says shit, about something this sub is hurt by, they care. Until now, no sub bitched about soda. Even tho he was....special
---
I dont hate streamers though. I like ganking. Most people dont broadcast their location otherwise I would screen snipe them to. Im using whats available - the internet. 
---
Why would I go after a streamer? Well because I want some pvp action and I know going after a streamer could make that happen. Maybe they will call in their 'army' and I could get a raid going and boom pvp battle. 
---
I dont plan on spending day and night going after them at all. Only on days Im bored and dont want to work on professions or anything like that. Or if they gank me then yeah Ill use their stream to come back and gank them. 
---
I also dont camp people as I find it boring and a waste of time. Only time I camp is if I think they deserve it I.E they camped me or in a streamers case, his fan boys start harassing me after I do gank him and leave.
---
It’s too long
---
Boomers rise up!
---
But like imagine getting paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to play a game and then having anything to complain about. Soda is, and always has been, a spoiled petulant child.
---
Will they offer you a realm transfer after you've been shunned by the entire server for daring to kill their autistic godking?
---
Try using the search feature.  Its all there for ya.
---
It's always darkest before its dawn so to speak. At some point this mediocre slot machine visually overloading games are going to hit critical mass and things are going to calm down again. Once the younger generation demands something more in depth as they mature.
---
Lol good lord.
---
no one is gonna wanna go to a dead sub.
---
The mods if they really have banned this topic perhaps should just make a meta thread here or someting. Cuz its obviously on a lot of peoples mind
---
Can we all just agree Asmongold sucks?
---
 Will they offer you a realm transfer after you've been shunned by the entire server for daring to kill their autistic godking?
---
Priest benediction staff...
---
TRUE IM WRONG GG
---
&gt;I feel like this could be resolved if streamers simply streamed on PvE servers and when they wanted to play on a PvP server, they could just play an undercover, unstreamed character.
---
Exactly this.  I played until Cata and a little MoP but if your playing on a PVP server YOUR GOING TO GET GANKED!  It's no ones fault but your own for playing a PVP server, it's part of the game.  There's tons of arsesholes who get off on killing people in the game and camping lowbies to repeatedly kill them over and over with their max level character like they are awesome for it or something.
---
This is the exact shit I've been worried about. I'm not a fan of streamers but I'm not part of the anti streamer hate gang that roams this sub. But this shit, this shit is not okay, plain and simple if you dont want to get stream sniped, dont stream. If you dont want pvp, play on a pve server. There are solutions already in place for the problems this guy is whining about. This "blacklist" shit is the most toxic idea I've ever seen. In edition to the streamer being able to abuse the shit out of something like that by saying any ganker is a stream sniper, it's also not an official part of the game, meaning anyone could just say someone is blacklisted just to fuck with someone
---
TLDR; there are already ways around stream snipers this guy just doesn't want to use them since they dont cater to him perfectly.
---
Oh I’ve read a lot of the posts.  But why come in here if you’re just gonna be tight lipped?  Just asking an honest question.
---
Unlike the Naxx posts though I am somewhat interested in this topic.
---
hah. cool.
---
Maybe he needs to play on a pve server then.
---
I'm genuinely glad this thread has gotten traction. There is definitely a conversation that could be had when it comes to the amount of influence a streamer has on a locked server. The thing for me is that I don't watch streams and I don't know any of these streamers aside from some of the R1 PVPers, but even then I didn't realize they had such a massive following.  I wouldn't even know if the player I ganked was a streamer, for the most part. Soda's clearly speaking out of frustration, but also from a pedestal. He doesn't want to play on a PVP server because I can only imagine how he thinks that would look to his fellow PVP streamers. Being a successful streamer, like most other things, comes with its benefits and hindrances.
---
Ofc they can. Find a proper job and play anonymously? If they dont want to quit they could hide name, server delay recording etc.
---
My unpopular opinion is that they just just blanket ban any and all addons. That's the true vanilla feel while ensuring everyone is also on a completely level playing field. Some addons give incredible advantages over players that don't have them.
---
Isn't camping someone just because you're triggered that they're a streamer 'special treatment'?
---
Well, you deleted the post so I guess you are ashamed
---
Every spec is viable, not all viability has to do with raids.
---
#Subbing to them ironally for years
---
I wan't to add on that the minmax guild general DO take a good bear, albeit usually only 1. It's good for their cleartimes to have a mega-threat tank. 
---
It's the B-tier wannabe's who generally get judgmental about Bear tanks.
---
I'll be honest... I stared at it for a while [waiting for the fade-in](https://preview.redd.it/j55h6hyvgwl21.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=ed73a0a69b5e3235efa469883d50c3f007199e34).
---
I'll be using the same kinds of add-ons I did in Vanilla:
---
* Unit frames (to move them and better see buffs/debuffs)
---
* Enemy cast bar
---
* Cooldown bars
---
* Boss mods (for situational awareness in dungeons/raids)
---
* Atlas (for dungeon maps and to know what items drop)
---
* Bag (improve organization and make items easier to find)
---
* Wardrobe (to quickly swap on mount speed enchants or get naked to save durability)
---
* Mail (to speed up sending/receiving items for my bank alt)
---
* Auctioneer (to speed up listing items)
---
Al this stuff was available in Vanilla, so I don't see how it's not the "true" Vanilla experience.
---
I agree with the filter. It's the best option. Allow the people to choose what they want to see.
---
Last time they did this they managed to remove what made classes unique...   
---
 - Mages: Now have invisibility and a pet (???)     
---
 - Rogues: Anti-magic immunity shield!    
---
 - Prot Warriors: A heal(!)     
---
 - Shadow Priests: A heal   
---
 - BM Hunter: It isn't about your pet, YOU now gain more damage     
---
 - Demo Lock: Now better to sac your pet then use it    
---
 - Etc etc etc    
---
That's one of the core mistakes in later expansions. They wanted everyone to be happy so they gave everyone everything. Classes weren't really unique, bringing unique staff and LACKING certain things. Rather everyone had the same abilities in different colors/styles, and nothing felt important anymore.
---
Specially targeting and griefing people continuously is a pretty shitty thing to do, whether they are a streamer or not.
---
Play the game, if you see someone and wanna spawn kill them great, go for it. 
---
Don't be one of those people who monitors a streamers every move from when they wake up until they go to sleep.
---
Monkeynews is now a streamer in his own right, and his plan will always be r14. Not a great example
---
Holy fuck you lot are petty.
---
Why ask the question if youve seen all the reasons?
---
Oh right... Man, it's only  been like a year since I've played a hunter on a p server, I should really know this lol
---
That was every server.
---
Don’t want to get yanked? Play on a PVE server. I remember there used to be mercenaries for hire, pissed off someone gabled and corpsecamped you? Hire a rogue from a top guild to exact revenge.
---
Same faction mob tagging used to be a thing too, it was just something you had to deal with, just because you stream doesn’t mean you get exclusive access to mobs, don’t like people stream sniping you play with a delay. Wow isn’t the only game with these “problems” there are ways to combat/mitigate them but it means making sacrifices.
---
&gt; if streamers don't like being singled out, that's their business to figure out a solution and not Blizzard's
---
Soda is planning to make a blacklist as a deterrent. Some people don't seem to be happy with this player solution. People also seem to forget that it wasn't uncommon for guilds and individual players to have KoS and Blacklists back in the day. Personally I think this is better than trying to get blizzard involved.
---
I agree,
---
Why are his and Asmons fanbases so shit???
---
I would say they're a bunch of "edgelord kids" but i don't know if thats true :/
---
Im just going to stick to watching Crendor and Preach :)
---
Yeah this is getting redicilous.
---
Joana
---
Yes. My answer came from a while-you’re-leveling standpoint, which on reflection is not precisely what the OP was talking about.
---
Almost positive blizz would assist.
---
Like there is no possible way someone takes a prestigious guild name or streamer name by coincidence.
---
For the health of the community, Blizzard should just assist.
---
Sodapoppin wants China's social credit system in wow.. oof
---
Of course there is a lot of truth to the comments in the thread. But with all of that already being said, the best advice i could give is: Play the class/race that you want to play! 
---
If ur not a hardcore, world first neckbeard, i wouldn't make big compromises, just because the class/spec is higher demanded, the race has a slightly better racial etc. 
---
There will be hardcore guilds, and there will be casual guilds, and I'm sure there will be a guild for you, whatever you are going to play.
---
29? My sweet summer child.
---
You've made up my mind. I've ummed and arred for 3 months about healers. Realistically I love retro druid spells animations sets and class fantasy in vanilla &amp; I've always wanted to heal. So i will play that.
---
I've been waiting for this thread for ages! Druid in vanilla is sleeper op. Very strong in a lot of forms, and its shitty reputation means that no one plays it, which means you are in high demand for basically everything you might wanna do. I wanna drop two resources in this thread for everyone thinking about or planning on running a druid:
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#dps
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
I’ve read a lot of the posts,  sorry for asking a question my dude.  Have a nice one.
---
I didn't see anyone saying that.
---
Atualy, it's kinda obvious that the minimum req will be the same as legion/BfA minimum req, since classic is using the same "client".
---
You don't even have to add any raids or dungeons. They could just finish fleshing out the vanilla world and keep naxx as the highest tier raid. A new raid is only going to be fun for what? At year, at most? It's not the type of additional content I think they should prioritize. That's what they do with each expansion, why should Classic+ make the same mistake?
---
Enemy castbars instantly removes a huge amount of skill and outplay potential from PvP.
---
Didn't they explicitly say that melee leeway is working as intended? It's omin one fo the blue posts.
---
LOL just wait until some max level character will come and camp you even though your 40 levels below him.  It WILL happen on a PVP server.
---
Yeah.. Soda is an insane player, but the four you listed are literally some of the best players in the history of the game.. They've been consistently rank one for years and years, and have won tournaments against the "nobodies" out there that are supposedly better than them.  It's crazy that people down play them just because they stream the game.
---
To anwser your question typical wpvp would be fine still. If you saw him and ganked him you would be good. It's the repeat offenders. The guys that he knows by name now because they have attacked him so many times. It's very easy to tell the difference between actual world pvp and stream sniping.
---
what about something like this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=16&amp;v=OaEgc46FNWE
---
Beta access is attached straight to your account so you would have to seek your account to make any money.  It's not like the old days of beta codes.
---
There aren’t going to be THAT many servers but there will be thousands if not more people who want to troll them by taking their name etc
---
His stream when he first got into the beta was just a whole lotta wholesome. Same tone, but with just a dash of giddy excitement.
---
I think part of the charm of classic is that everyone cant do everything. Its not a homogenized game where every single class and spec has a similar amount of utility and dps etc. its an actual rpg where the class you pick matters and they all have their niche strengths and weaknesses. I plan on playing a pally and i know that i will be healing raids, which is part of picking the class. Paladin also have great aoe threat with consecration for 5 man dungeons if i wanted to tank a little. I think it would take a lot away from the game if everything was balanced.
---
Lmao.  Ok, guy
---
They absolutely will
---
you're fucking idiot
---
Nobody will be making a list until a day or two after, because streamers don’t want you either. The last thing they want is a huge crowd harassing them when they’re trying to level. So they will keep their server a secret until they’re level 10 or so. 
---
If you’re okay with waiting for that, you should have no worries,
---
That's what I'm thinking of doing.
---
You have my sword!
---
What an entitled jerk. Play PvE Classic Wow or stream and make millions. What a difficult choice that boy has to make!
---
The goal is to make a name for myself being a good player - not a streamer.
---
these fools are deluded!
---
Yeah some addons are cool, but there are too many that do too much (questhelper, the auto-auctioneer stuff). I'd rather they just remove them all because of that.
---
Yes go 31/20 pvp and pve never respec unless you're bored
---
We know for a fact OSRS was dying without new content and it wasn't until they launched OSRS+ content that it really skyrocketed in users.
---
You sneaky bastard....
---
That last line was a nice touch 👌
---
Ha! [Blind jokes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7E-D1KvXxE&amp;t=37s)
---
&gt;Classic seems 100% unbalanced as it was.
---
Yet people miss it. And they played while it was current content and enjoyed it. Of course there were people that wanted their class/spec improved, but that's to be expected. There is no game as far as I know where every class/spec is viable. So there's always going to be someone crying for a re-balance. Making changes to classes will just change what class is better/the best and more people will lean toward it. Nothing will change there.
---
What stops a streamer from creating multiple characters on multiple servers, and why should they all say where they go?
---
Unlike some people that played vanilla (I was in beta/retail launch) and played up until a bit into TBC, I didn't play on any private servers so I am several years removed from my WoW experience. I am cool with not geting a beta invite because I am taking that time to brush up on some leveling techniques, gold farming techniques, duo leveling/questing strategies, BIS items, etc etc. Even though I am 100% set on my race and faction I am still going back and forth between 3 classes to play.
---
August comes fast and I have things to research in the meantime.
---
They will always have enough bodyguards to kill you in a gcd, if you can even get near them
---
A very fair point,  I had no clue this occurred.   
---
Do you think there would be a possible way to solve  the glaring issues of certain specs without losing the individuality?
---
“Get ready” they said. “Summer release” they said.
---
In europe we are good.
---
I'll have my people call your people...
---
I see where you’re coming from, but OP is talking about forming an entire guild with the explicit purpose of constantly finding streamers and ruining their experience based off of their hate for “streamer privilege” which I think takes what you’re saying to an extreme level.
---
Yeah but then he can’t give commands to his chat when he’s stream sniping asmon. He’s a total hypocrite.
---
No jokes. He is trying to deal with it in this way. Not the best solution but the real problem is that people should enjoy the game how they want to and when stream sniping prevents that beyond normal ganks its a toxic problem. That's a pretty easy concept to understand that I feel is being missed just because they're streamers lul they aren't real people.
---
Someone has zero understanding of capitalism...
---
Notice that the 3 you mentioned are also the most toxic streamers too
---
none of crendor/preach/madseasons fans are like this... dont put us in that same light.
---
and fuck you too buddeh!
---
Hard no man.  I know a lot of people don't like to hear this but changes like this simply *aren't vanilla*.  For example, prot paladins simply never main tanked for raids, making it so they can completely changes the dynamic of the game and how it feels.  That's no bueno.
---
I don't know bout you guys but even as I was playing TBC I was nostalgiaing for Vanilla. During Wrath I wasn't yearning for TBC I was yearning for Vanilla. I always thought that going back to Classic was more about going back to the fundamentals of what made WoW so addicting and fun, not doing a replay of Vanilla&gt;TBC&gt;Wrath all over again. It was cool when we did it back in the day, but I'd have no appetite for it. Even if we did do it, what'd happen after Wrath? Cata? Mists? It'd just get kinda convoluted.
---
Streaming has ruined games and has just has given people who do not fucking matter a platform to be an asshole. Sodapoppin is nobody, the only reason you think he is someone is because he talks to you over the internet.
---
I know how you feel. I never liked the change to the Valor helm. It was just a generic brown plate helm (same shape as old Lightforge helm), but then they recolored it and gave it dog ears. Little curly things pointing up on each side. EARS! Like wtf is the point of those. To this day, whenever I t-mog my valor set I have to turn off show helm. They really messed with the looks of the T0 plate sets by changing the helmets.
---
But it will be reality.
---
The difference is that people have gotten way more conscious about the downsides of qol changes. Having portals everywhere is a qol change. Not needing to hold shift to auto loot is a qol change. One of these come with heavy downsides, one doesnt.
---
good luck out sperging the mega spergs lol
---
Stream sniping on a pvp server isn't toxic.
---
You can do anything with a window with a script. Size it to 1x1 if you want.
---
Oh yeah, I wont be joining anything like that as after a week or so it would get boring to me.
---
Unless they really do (effectively) blacklist people who gank them then I will have an alt dedicated to that blacklist.
---
Big groan here.  I get the salt, Blizz should be transparent in that providing streamers with access is a marketing practice (a super effective one at that).  On the other hand, the incessant whining isn’t going to make them more transparent.
---
Sure. But that wasn't Blizzard's goal when they made these decisions. They just asked people what they hated about their class then gave them that, rather than ignoring what people think and naturally building on what a class already is (both strengths AND weaknesses).   
---
It ultimately boils down to: Are you ok with classes being bad sometimes? If yes, you're building on classic, if no then you're building on retail.
---
Hell yeah brother. Going to be frothing once classic is released, show these beta boys how we do things!
---
Well, they did not lie
---
Still, just watch. They’ll inevitably claim that legit random corpse camping is stream sniping.
---
Changes the dynamic of the game,  I wanna understand what that means.  I don’t see how prot pallys being an option for tanking raids would be a bad thing?  More diversity of tanks?
---
It's interesting how we've gone from wanting Classic, to now wanting progression servers as well as + servers. Basically demanding Blizzard maintain 6+ different variations of WoW.
---
Love your name - choices for your characters.
---
M. 8
---
Jealous much? Not a good look either.
---
When you get MS it feels a lot better, though, which is at 40
---
Being 35 I have no issues socializing online. I also don't look down on people a decade or more older or younger than me. My hope is that the average age of WoW classic players will be roughly 30-40 after a handful of weeks where the influx of people go back to BFA or somewhere else entirely. I also do hope that some people in their teens and 20's find out what makes WoW classic so great because they have a lot to bring to a server as well.
---
Should be fun. I think the community will ultimately be pretty decent. People will be far more knowledgeable this time around compared to 2004.
---
I hope he's a troll, it was painful to read
---
No they didn’t, but still. ;)
---
Here's a list of the abilities I don't think you need as a shaman while leveling:
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 2
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 3
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 4
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 5
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 6
---
Rockbiter Weapon Rank 7
---
Reason: The best way to level your shaman is to go enhancement. To be an effective enhancement shaman, you will most likely level two-handed axes and two-handed maces (shamans can't wield swords), which are some of the slowest weapons in the game. For these Flametongue and Windfury are better than Rockbiter and Frostbrand, as Flametongue Weapon's power decreases with the weapon's speed.
---
Flametnogue Weapon Rank 4
---
Flametnogue Weapon Rank 5
---
Flametnogue Weapon Rank 6
---
Reason: At level 30 you will get Windfury Weapon Rank 1 so you don't need Flametongue anymore.
---
Frostbrand Weapon Rank 1
---
Frostbrand Weapon Rank 2
---
Frostbrand Weapon Rank 3
---
Frostbrand Weapon Rank 4
---
Frostbrand Weapon Rank 5
---
Reason: This weapon's effect can be compensated with Earthbind Totem and Frost Shock. Additionally see the Rockbiter Weapon.
---
Healing Stream Totem
---
Reason: You're a shaman, you can heal yourself and your party members and you will most likely want to use Mana Spring Totem or any other useful Water Totem instead of this one.
---
Fire Nova Totem
---
Reason: Fire Nova Totem deals a reasonable AoE fire damage, however, it takes about 5 seconds to activate and it immediately causes mobs to attack it when cast. Also has a 15 seconds cooldown. Magma Totem is better, albeit costing more mana.
---
Frost Resistance Totem
---
Fire Resistance Totem
---
Reason: There aren't many elemental caster mobs so these are not overly useful outside of PvP.
---
Far Sight
---
Reason: Very cool ability but not overly useful outside of PvP, also can only use outside.
---
Flametongue Totem
---
Reason: Has the same effect of Flametongue Weapon. Useful only for the melee in your party and mostly for the slow weapon wielders, which is highly unlikely you will have in your party. You get Windfury Totem after four levels anyway.
---
Nature Resistance Totem
---
Reason: There are rarely any mobs that inflict nature damage.
---
Sentry Totem
---
Reason: Not overly useful outside of battlegrounds, you probably won't need it while leveling.
---
Windwall Totem
---
Reason: Useful only against hunters.
---
Yeah, this post is extremely lore breaking.  It's the entire wrong view!
---
[Here is a picture](https://i.redd.it/y0jr9du58w231.jpg) of his view from Black Temple in Outland.
---
It just makes me wonder why they need a beta for a game that was released how long ago?     \*facepalm\*
---
You're missing of how he's leveling up Unarmed very quickly.
---
Arenas and the talent/specs revamps were pretty good.
---
Also, the idea of heroic dungeons and good reputation rewards were awesome.
---
Flying sucked tho
---
I just want QoL to be an addon choice. That way the "pure" ideal of WoW can be kept, and players are in the charge of what they prefer etc.
---
Don't force it as the standard, but let it be an option. That is my prefference.
---
Because it takes a long time, the parent post said they'd reroll if they don't do 10-20 in 1 sitting which is easily 8+ hours pending who you are and what you're leveling. Not everyone can dedicate 8+ hours a sitting, therefore it was be brutal.
---
If you died as a horde in STV Vanilla it was b/c he was max level.  STV was created for the horde back then, they had all the best spawn points and it was practically a horde zone, the alliance only had a few spaced out areas.
---
I really don't see what the problem is
---
The problem is not that people are dumb. The problem is everyone thinks they are not. "I am dumb too" is not a very common thought. Yet it is something you have to remind yourself constantly. "No, I am not smarter than anyone else because I accept that I am dumb too" is the next hurdle.
---
For tanking your #1 best friend is white armor. Your bear form multiplier is almost 4x, making it possible to hit the vanilla armor cap which sits somewhere around 17k for level 60 mobs and 21k for raid bosses. You should hit armor cap if you are bear tanking. 
---
2nd priority is stamina, which is also multiplied in bear form. You can easily break 10k hp raid geared and buffed. My root comment in this thread has a couple resources addressing itemization for bears.
---
That's cute
---
They make money doing something that most people here assume they themselves could do. This launches people into a fit of nerdrage. That is quite literally the only reason.
---
I totally agree.  I don’t think that every class needs to be good at everything.   I just felt like it would be more fun if a class had a spec to do a job it should do it fairly well?  And then the “best” of anything would be based on what each spec is good at and the player playing it.  Not just weird stat balancing.
---
Yeah that'd be nuts, but I read chat and comments from across multiple platforms, including (and especially in-game) and that's what I base my opinion off of.
---
Yes, whatever you want to go for. There were always at least 2-3 hardcore guilds on each side which were competing, many semi-hardcore guilds (I was in one) which cleared content at steady pace  and even more casual raiding guilds.
---
&gt;We ain't in the wild west of the internet anymore.
---
RIP 4chan :P
---
It will be...
---
&gt;it is mean to punish complete assholes
---
that's your opinion. blacklisting people forever for disrupting a fake tournament on a beta server is extreme as fuck. Soda literally called for Trollgod to be banned by blizzard, not blacklisted by his friends.  get off this dudes nuts man. 
---
[video clip that shows how much a fucking douchebag and hypocrite soda really his](https://youtu.be/wRzJDDxyZqk?t=265)
---
You don't have flying in tbc before you are lvl 68-70 anyways.
---
I know, literally every solution to the streamsniping problem is right in front of him: pve servers, a non-stream alt, long stream delay, etc. Yet he refuses every single one because he wants all the priviliges of streaming without any of the down sides... Can go fuck himself if you ask me, let him be streamsniped 24/7. Clearly, streamsnipers do it to see the streamer throw a tantrum, and this guy will throw tantrums left and right, so he's just putting a giant target on his forehead with this shit.
---
It's pretty fun dude.
---
A blacklist would never be feasible and would frankly be unwise on their part.  Unfeasible because, all those people would just go make other guilds.  They can’t realistically have any server-wise pull.  Unwise because you’d be ostracizing potentially good players.
---
As a note, I absolutely understand the frustration with the outlandish claims of basically anyone, but posts like this which are just as outlandish as extremely groan worthy.
---
None of those characters reached 60. I did end up with an orc warrior- metsu, an undead- rogue- sevun, and an orc hunter- extis all at 60 before TBC.
---
everyone will still watch clips of streamers weekly, just wait. you cant overcome the sperg hive.
---
this will be bigger than anything WoW has ever seen. And even an exponential amount of streamers will start up. We aint seen nothing yet.
---
RIP Game FAQs, Newgrounds too lol
---
Why are ppl assuming this? Ok they will have the little cock suckers..but classic aint no bfa. To get gear you will have to work for it. 
---
I feel that streamers will either use it to create content for themself or will leave the servers . Because yhea..they will get the shit ganked out of it
---
Paladins didn't main tank in vanilla... making so they can changes how the game is played...  You are looking at classic as a new game that can be changed and tweaked to fit a gamestyle you think is best, where everyone is balanced around all fields so they are decent at every single aspect of the game.  That's not how vanilla was, period.  Changing things like this is NOT good.
---
Like if you think boomkins needs buffs in order raid, then you just messed up how they play in pvp and they would be grossly OP considering they are already 1v1 gods.  Same as shadow priests.  There doesn't *need* to be diversity of tanks my dude, this isn't retail.  This is vanilla.
---
Something I can agree with. A lot of people think the game is easy and never actually realize that they are the ones trivializing it. Yes its a simple first iteration of a franchise, but once you turn off enemy castbars, threatmeters, all the fancy stuff the game actually becomes a challenge. You really have to pay attention and watch cast animations to figure out each spell or think twice before casting that 4th shadow bolt after 3 crits. That was what vanilla was for me and that's how I'm planning on playing again.
---
What the fuck is wrong with this dude?
---
If I end up on a server with one of the boys agreeing to this just makes me want to harass them. Who cares about their blacklist when you already have a guild?
---
If they want to release TBC then just copy all of the Vanilla servers as-is at the time of launch and make them TBC. That way you can have your character go to outland in TBC, but still raid Naxx/AQ40 in vanilla.
---
Even with requirements like that it could work out horribly.
---
Either way I hope they leave some classic servers as is and have separate servers they add on with. Be that new content and cap still at 60 or expansions.
---
The whole reason we are here is cause you can’t get this experience anywhere else and blizz finally caved. Once you add to it you remove the experience again and we’ll end up asking for WoW Classic:Classic in a few years time.
---
Sure, but if there are 8 Asmongolds, 2 are level 5, and only one has the same armor as the streamer...
---
Not everybody could do everything either in classic, but classic has specs that can't even do what they're supposed to do. It has nothing to do with balance and everything to do with fixing that which is straight up broken and incomplete in classic
---
Who the fuck is he to decide who are the assholes? He is an asshole himself.
---
Haha thanks for the laughs guys. I'll be sure to extra gank this time around :) hope y'all have a good day
---
Name checks out.
---
Really though its all part of the game and I look forward to receiving and giving ganks/camps/griefing.
---
Mana is tough, you should learn to incorporate more keybind shift-1, shift-2, r,f,c,z,x,' with shift modifiers. You don't need every totem bound. It's good to be quick with them if you plan to pop, but in PVE it's not required at all.
---
I disagree, I never stream sniped on nostalrius and just hearing about this blacklist idea... I think I'm gonna get into it now lol.
---
haha
---
They've already added a ton of QoL stuff. You can auto loot without holding shift, which means it's the only way you can auto loot pick pocket. They've made macros easier so no more 200 character macros for a simple start attack. I'll bet they also have auto dismount so you don't have to macro that in to your charge or stealth.
---
Love the RayCharles Traced rays.   
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Blizzard will do this to a point for us already. Look at the realm population when you first choose one. If its high to full go with something less populated.
---
Imagine reading a generalized comment regarding the obvious sentiment of a number of posters on reddit and assuming the person thought this sentiment was common among all people when they never implied that.
---
No such thing. You broadcast your position to the world, don’t shocked pikachu face when people know where you are to gank you. Expecting anything else is the kind of entitlement that makes me go from wanting to stay as far away from streaming servers as possible to now choosing to make my progression meta around disrupting soda.
---
The recent hate towards Streamers are because of things Soda said on his stream. Most of this "hurr durr I will make the life of streamers miserable" is obviously targeted at soda.  I should've said "sodas guild" instead of "streamer guilds" and the players in his guild are definitely not mediocre.
---
But my point still stands. Most of the playerbase will not be able to compete with a guild that consists of top players. And those top pserver guilds will have better things than to cry over something a streamer said.
---
For sure!  And you’re right that’s precisely what my perspective is. Other than making everyone good at everything.  I still think there is a lot of diversity to be had making classes balanced and keeping the things that make them unique.  But I didn’t experience classic,  and people are just as particular about their nostalgia as I anticipated.
---
Should be a sign about how classic will end up if they add to it then.
---
This took me a second. I hate you haha
---
I'd take all those values with a grain of salt, they are from private servers. Values like armor, dodge%, parry% and resists are most likely wrong.
---
&gt; You don't have flying in tbc before you are lvl 68-70 anyways.
---
You're not doing dailies until you are lvl 70 anyway. But once you do you want them to be over with asap.
---
I'm gonna go ahead and give this post a 9.3/10
---
Cheaper than it was I guess
---
LET ME IN
---
LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
Why would you need an dictuonary fefinition, when i just explained what I ment with that word.
---
Calm down man, no need to resort to attempting to paint some social psychological picture of me because I like to roam around and gank as a rogue. Lol. I have fun doing it. Sorry it hurts your feelings. I hope you have a good day today friend
---
A lot of truth there
---
Yeah, because everyone's posting the same shit here every day instead. The link should be the standard response
---
Good article. Not sure exactly what to think about only gathering but I think the spirit of that article is right on. If you want to make some headway even as a casual or semi-casual make sure you have a laser focus objective, know how you want to spec, how you want to play and just focus on that singular character. You can get really far doing that.
---
The big problem with that is from what ive heard a lot of the streamers arent going to say what server theyre on ahead of time (to prevent griefing on launch, and probably to help prevent guild names being stolen, etc).
---
If you want to play on launch day you might be screwed for finding one of those realms :/
---
Its even harder for guilds that are recruiting now.  Expecting 50-80 people to reroll because you find out a couple days later that theres a streamer there isnt going to go over well, especially since you might not get your name on the new realm.
---
Thank you! Great mindset for classic. I would also like to play on no drama servers. With "Blacklist" guilds and stream snipers and  bourgeoisie streamers.
---
Streamers can turn off their stream. It really is that simple to stop the grieving.
---
Too much to ask, you say? It is their conscious decision to broadcast. They do this knowing full well that in an open world game like wow it tells people where the are. 
---
So that's the trade off.
---
I kind of disagree with that you're implying. Because he has benefits where people are willing to give him free stuff, he should accept griefing; I wouldn't call it "PvP on a PvP server" -- Not in the general sense. Sure, technically it is a pvp server and yes getting ganked/camped is pvp. But it's still griefing -- not that I agree or disagree with it. But no one likes, wants, or enjoys getting camped; so I think it's fair to assume that someone would (if given the possibility) avoid it as best they can. In this case, threat of being outcast from a larger community.  
---
But I will say that because he does benefit so greatly in certain ways, it's kind of obnoxious for him to complain about getting griefed. I can't fault him for not enjoying it even if it can be kind of 'eye-rolling'.   
---
My understanding is that Soda enjoys the random encounters in world PvP whether he loses or not; it's the deliberate attempt to grief him that he doesn't like, which we would expect, right? Obviously people don't want that. I would ask why people would be so accepting of bad behavior. I think Soda camping 15's is scummy as hell. Why not petition the community to blacklist that behavior? We can all act collectively how we choose, if you don't like that community, find another one. I don't see this as a problem. I think it's reasonable for Soda and others to create their own type of community. If people don't like it, they won't be a part of it.
---
All this still goes back to the original point I was getting at: if a community of a server decide to act in a certain way, who am I or anyone else judge that?   
---
I remember the ganking in Vanilla. STV was an absolute nightmare for me. I remember the corpse camping as well. But I don't want that to come back, why would I? Getting griefed isn't fun. PvP at low levels can be fun but there is a distinction between world PvP and griefing.   
---
And I also remember guild blacklists. They 100% absolutely existed. We had a shared list on guild forums of people and what they did. To get added, it required at least a Screen shot for proof and we all had access to them. And because of DKP requiring you to invest in a guild to get loot, guild hopping was horrible. It was an amazing deterrent to 'misconduct'. It wasn't just ninja looters, it was also a blacklist for people who did really scummy things like harassing other players (usually verbally with racist comments) and even guild member poaching. I remember that being a really big "no-no". Certain guilds were even labeled as "avoid" because the GM/others poached top-geared players with stuff like DKP incentives.
---
Then accept the consequences and don't be a little baby snowflake.
---
Soda’s a fucking tool.
---
I agree. Community is the foundation of Classic, and a good guild makes an enormous difference. 
---
We need people with a lot of spare time, preferably an adult that works 20-30 hours a day and is experienced in WoW and community building. Someone who will be able to sort out issues rationally (because let's be frank, there's no way in hell there won't be discord in any big guild).
---
If you think you can do that, please do. We need people like you to make Classic great. Thank you.
---
or blizzard won't release post Naxx content and you get to enjoy classic
---
I'm all for that type of ideas but the most obvious solution is not to mess with the classic game and let it be
---
I've read the opposite.  There are lots of resources that say Druids can easily tank dungeons up to level 60 and are fantastic off tanks in raids.  A feral off tank has higher DPS than a prot warrior and doesn't need as high of stats as main tank since they're just dealing with adds.
---
&gt; Either way I hope they leave some classic servers as is and have separate servers they add on with
---
Oh for sure!
---
It is fun to craft, but the article is putting it in the perspective of needing to get all the rare crafting recipes to complete your crafting profession and that will take a lot of time. If you are just crafting to make some gear, it's easier to save gold and buy said gear from someone else. I can see why it can be a reasonable option for some people. Maybe Enchanting is the exception if all they use it for is DE in dungeons.
---
I'd say Shadow Protection and Mind Soothe are both very useful while leveling tbh. Shadow is a fairly common damage type you'll encounter while leveling, and mind soothe can help you loot quest items/gathering nodes without aggroing some mobs.
---
Ik denk dat ik bedoelde dat je het dan niet kon dragen ofzo haha
---
Im not sure about auto loot but the other stuff is just results of the new engine they are using for classic. Macros might be easier to make but also way more restrictive compared to classic. 
---
You could argue they should've used the old engine but there probably is a reason why they use the newer one.
---
Stream man bad
---
wow classic had over a million subs. You truly believe blizzard needs this? You are a fucking moron. This is like pretending Microsoft needs to invite people for beta testing windows 11 because they need the exposure.
---
[here is a video of your god actually contradicting you with own voice.](https://youtu.be/wRzJDDxyZqk?t=265)
---
Very attractive women performing a sensual dance, forgive me for being attracted.
---
Not the only one....
---
You say that but without knowing how many servers there will be that becomes harder. One big streamer is probably enough to screw up an entire server with just their "Fans" and the others who will be on there to troll them. At a standard cap of 2500-3k after layering goes away that server is stuffed with their people and ruined.
---
How many big streamers will there be? Even if we figure only 2 or 3 that is 2-3 servers that are unplayable for the regular playerbase. Unless we get a lot of servers, allowing the majority of the playerbase to play somewhere those idiots aren't there will be people suffering on those servers with no way out.
---
Half the fun of dealing with toxic players is beating them and watching them get even saltier. Or just ignore them if they bother you that much. I don't think more moderation is the answer because when you start silencing people it makes them even worse (maybe even in real life.) Games are an outlet for some people, and if they can't be shitheads online they'll be even worse IRL.
---
Hey guys what's up madseason here, back with another video for you.
---
Armor is a stat.
---
The next step up from casual would be making a bunch of level 35 alts for profession CDs to sell for passive gold earnings.
---
Is it just me, or is that kind of weird?
---
The ideal solution would be to leave a few classic servers as is. Then have different servers you add on with be it expansions or new content.
---
People are worried about a forced TBC. A forced change to classic would piss off people just as much.
---
Whole reason we are here is cause you couldn’t get the experience elsewhere and blizzard finally caved. Would be dumb to just make it so you can’t get the experience again.
---
But that's not an exploit? Or at least the exploit mentioned in the title.
---
Using a .5 speed weapon that levels unharmed seems completely fine to me, I mean, what do you really get out of it anyway.
---
Duhh, just start talking with an accent.  Bam!  EU.
---
I think of him as the Bob Ross of WOW.
---
Idk ive never known shockadin to be ret... considering its deep holy
---
If you're American, look into the Dutch American Friendship Treaty. It's a path to citizenship.
---
Clearly, left to their own devices, the majority on this sub are too retarded to do this themselves, so probly
---
I'm not sure if intentional, but midmax is my new favourite word
---
Love the use of old school OCC for the meme, brings me back.  Thanks for the laugh
---
I think it’s hard to remember how pigeon holed the classes were - there were not 3 viable raiding specs per class, and respeccing is expensive.  
---
On one hand it’s ironic that there are 40 raid slots and fewer options, but my memory at least is balance druids, shadow priests, elemental shaman etc are few and far between (for raiding).
---
There also aren’t DKs, monks, paladin (horde) or DH so for tank you have warrior, paladin (alliance) and bear and I mean...well, show me the guild that had 3 bear tanks and I’ll be in shock.
---
Cragfist of...
---
It's a random enchantment obviously.
---
Great, now i want to play priest to be able to do that!
---
This was sparked by sodapoppin's comments about stream snipers, saying they should be blacklisted from enjoying the game since they ruin his time, in essence. Super entitled mentality.
---
Well I know they aren't only inviting streamers because the nobody I work with is in the beta. Super tired of they cry babies and the streamers only nonsense.
---
Wait account services will exist in claddic?
---
Bear in mind streamers will be announcing their servers AFTER they've created their characters. If you really want to avoid them you're going to have to wait until the popular streamers have announced them.
---
I like to keep it homogeneous between classes to, x and shift X are always my defensives, r is my interrupt, shift+space is my mobility. Not that these makes sense but as an example kick on rogue and rank 1 earth shock would be my R, it helps with learning binds.
---
I know it's just a joke, but assuming you're from the US and have a skill, you can probably get a job in an EU country without too much hassle.
---
Which is stupid, because the demand for RP-PvP is much bigger than RP-PvE. We've got a pretty sizable community trying to push for at least one RP-PvP server per region.
---
I completely understand the desire for many fans of the game to want to make minor changes to fix issues in the game that everyone knows are prevalent, like class balance, but that is not the spirit as to why Classic WoW came back.
---
Nostalrius, and other PServers, showed that there was a large interest in Vanilla WoW, with all its imbalances and flaws.  People wanted to play that game again.  Its one of the reasons why popular PServers that emulated Vanilla the closest were the most popular, rather than the ones that tweeked drop rates, stats, and gear.   This is what people wanted, a true Vanilla experience.
---
So, Blizzard decided to give it to us, knowing that if you bring people back maybe they'll stick around or even get some other games they see on the launcher.   Its a business so right now its little work (in the grand scheme of making a full game) to maybe pull in a few hundred/thousand subs for a few months.
---
That means, for now, lets enjoy our Vanilla experience, the good and bad, then in a few years when people start unsubbing because they've seen it all, or are bored, heck even they want something new then maybe we can look at changes like balancing, classic+ content, or TBC.
---
Classic will bring it back. Anyone who started wow post-vanilla will crumble under the strain, and all that will remain will be spamming Barrens chat with Chuck Norris lines, [Dirge] &amp; Anal [Backstab].
---
The glory days will return before we are too old.
---
Because wow has always attracted a fanbase of mostly neckbeards, that's it. That's the reason.
---
I might download a questhelper down the road, but my main will level without one.
---
One addon i would *kind* of like to find is one that shows a '!' on the minimap (not world map) when you get within...say, 20-30 yards of a questgiver, kind of like how its been in retail since....what, BC or Wrath?  I dont want to be told where the next quest is all the time (or where the weird ones are off in the middle of nowhere) just by looking at my world map, but i would like to be able to see if theres a questgiver in some random building standing in a spot that i cant see from outside.
---
Unless you do it knowing you are on stream, then it literally is stream sniping, am I wrong?
---
Wow an original post.
---
It is still broken at 60 (for dueling) but I can see what you mean now :) It's over the charts at 30!
---
Macros are a big thing. It was so complicated to do a simple mouseover macro back then.
---
&gt;You have no idea the power of the spergs that play WoW mate. Streamers are dead content to some of the spergs out there.
---
DansGame
---
&gt; The numbers have been set in stone for this for 15 years.
---
lol yeah dude nothing changed since retail vanilla
---
That's not Classic/Vanilla. The game was never balanced, it shouldn't be. There are consequences with rolling a particular class, there are consequences with messing with certain classes as a certain class.
---
That's the Vanilla experience, that's one of its quirks among many that give it the charm. No changes, there are effects to the game people don't comprehend. Everyone wants to improve that pie until it's unrecognizable.
---
That is really funny and out of the ordinary! I like the idea - and that you actually managed to do it!
---
Take my upvote Sir
---
Yeah but you get BFA, too! That could be fun! Maybe... probably not...
---
Not if those certain streamers could reserve the name a day before, you won't know if the actual streamer has the name or billy from reddit snatched the name really fast.

---
You really are a fucking idiot. Streamers can easily implement a delay if they wanted. Everything is in their hands, including not broadcasting their own location.
---
There's a reason why 21% of people play warriors in classic.
---
But you're right, warriors have very little "cool" abilities.  They make up for that by being good at DPS and amazing at tanking.  They're top charts for DPS.
---
My tip for leveling a warrior... Get a good pair of green or blue boots at level 25 or less and put 3% move speed enchant on them.  It's not much, but you're literally running around 95% of the time in WoW.  It really adds up over time.
---
With baiting sit-crits you level pretty quickly with minimal downtime.  Take fishing as a skill and use that to make a ton of gold while leveling.  You'll have enough for a mount and extra gear which matters for warriors a lot more than other classes.
---
This is actually pretty awesome dude. Well done lol.
---
PvP holy should be fine for raid.
---
help them have a happy life. Help them grow into a happy person. Watch them marry for love. Watch them have a child. Help them raise that child at a healthy world. Let them love their child and life.

Murder their offspring. T baguette mercilessly as you do.

UD rogue is going to be overused regardless of gender. I've honestly seen more UD female than UD male as of late.

have a fun summer kids! get some exercise and sun, cause its all gonna come to a screeching halt.

(and right before school starts. how many are gonna miss the first fricken day of school lmao)
---
and as expected, even something you cherry-picked off the internet confirms exactly what I said:
---
&gt;"Camping at a corpse or spawn area to repeatedly kill players as they resurrect, to prevent them from being able to play, **when this behavior is not intentionally permitted.**" 
---
And what a surprise: On PvP realms, killing the enemy players is intentionally permitted.
---
Having dismantled you thoroughly, I could stop right here, but given your attitude, I really see no point in letting you off to lick your wounds that easy. Scrolling down on the very page you yourself linked, we find this excerpt from the ToS, posted by another player:
---
&gt;_C. Rules Related to Game Play._ Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. **Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game.** Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race. Nonetheless, certain acts go beyond what is "fair" and are considered serious violations of these Terms of Use. Those acts include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
---
You may read it for yourself here:

---
Do this discussion a favor and stop trying to spin this any other way. You have been debunked, dismissed and disproven, any attempt to pretend otherwise, would only serve as ridicule.
---
Not really. Anyone competitive will use add-ons, but they'll function poorly. So why not just add them into the settings.
---
&gt;  That's not how vanilla was, period.
---
Do you think Vanilla stayed the same from launch to 1.12? Vanilla changed multiple times during its run. There isn't this "one-true" vanilla state which is just how it was and anything else isn't vanilla.
---
&gt; Like if you think boomkins needs buffs in order raid, then you just messed up how they play in pvp and they would be grossly OP considering they are already 1v1 gods.
---
You can easily circumvent this by making the changes separate for PvP combat and PvE combat. Or just balance in very small incremental changes that are extensively tested in both PvE and PvP.
---
I disagree. Due to the market size for mobile games and MTX being far far far larger than PC games.... mobile game domination is an inevitability. Just look at how many people play candy crush and how much Acti-blizz makes from it.
---
I dont understand how ppl like soda tbh. Of all the wow streams he is the stupidiest one. Sometimes i wonder if these realize how fucking lucky they are with the money they make ans the way they make it. Because some of this guys are as dumb as they come
---
How many of their friends streamed the game? Soda would have to not play with any of his friends to stay anonymous. I said it was possible, but it would mean Soda would have to basically just go of on his own server and try to not voice chat with people.

The current F&amp; F Invites are only Streamers I critize the behaivour of blizzard by saying on one side we wont invite much any more while inviting  100 of streamers with F&amp;F Bullshit
---
Yes I still use that one as a gaming tag as well as metsu.
---
Yeah seriously if I was on his server I would genuinely enjoy making his life a misery just like I did to other big names back in the day.
---
Fortunately I am EU so I dont have to worry about streamers pvpolicing.
---
If you want to die, stream where you are so you can make money off it.  I dont find you entertaining, so I will get my entertainment when you rage quit.
---
Please stop
---
There is no auto dismount.
---
You can easily kill the rogue with death coil and tidal charm tho and if you got engineering it's even better. But yeah normally it really suck being ally lock against rogues.
---
I personally could care less about streamers. I just wanted to make sure your commented was corrected. Streamers will not be the top players, most won't even make it past 60 once the hype dies down. Pserver top guilds will be the top players.
---
Rogues or Ranged opponents. They tend to open up from a distance while you're fighting stuff.
---
Look, it's not about nostalgia at all at this point.... This is the issue here.  It's not like we wouldn't like a version of WoW similar to vanilla where you could make balance changes that are vanilla like and still make the game fun.  But the issue here is that the changes that you are asking for will 100% change vanilla and possibly in a way that ruins the feel of the game and make it feel more retail like.  
---
It's not that we are looking to relive experiences, that's long dead.  It's that we KNOW this version of the game is fun, we KNOW this version of the game doesn't get boring after 2 weeks like the retail mindset of 'everyone needs to do everything'.  Unfortunately there is very little you can do to 'balance' the classes the way you want while also keeping them unique while ALSO keeping the classic playstyle.
---
No, its not 24 silver here and there. We’re talking about these skill training costs. Im not justifying 24 silver over there, im talking about this one. But meh I mean everyone should just do what they want lol
---
I’d consider druids pretty great farmers when Dire Maul comes out. Either for duoing DMW or solofarming lashers there.
---
I'm pretty fucking sick of Soda. His streams have been slowly mutating into this bitch-fest and he's constantly turning his nose up on his fans.
---
I agree with the original sentiment of this post, streamers don't get to play in anonymity if you're as popular as this, your fans are gonna hunt you. It's apart of stream culture now. Play any game, ESO, Wow, Eve, fuck even the new City of Heroes private server had stream snipers. The difference in reaction would be a few villains hunting a steamers Hero character. It looked fun and he was having a blast when he got jumped the first time. No hate. No malice. No "Block these guys from content" reaction. It was fun, funny and entertaining.
---
Instead of being a dickless moron about it, cheriah that people are going out of their way to snipe you, turn it into a positive, post clips and have fun.
---
From the great words of Joey "CoCo" Diaz: "Pull yer head outta yer ass and just have fun wit it. Fucking momo."
---
what do you feel? 14 years have past(
---
Thanks! It was not easy I finished MC as a 59 pleb and was very close to leveling so I decided to try it but severely overestimated how much xp you get from discovering new zones and wound up running around most of eastern kingdoms first until I had enough to ding by entering stormwind
---
I won't be playing whatsoever if they don't have any RP realms of any kind. 
---
That's where I get the most enjoyment out of the game, it's a much slower and less hardcore and more social place to play.
---
Well when I played Vanilla I leveled on a PvE server with my brother and friends. I’m doing PvP this time. I know it happens, but there are people out there who aren’t going after people who can’t fight back simply because they can.
---
Some people go after lowbies. Some people go after only people who are 8 levels or less lower than them. Some only fight around their level. It’s all different. But people who intentionally camp lowbies as a higher level player are trash.
---
It's not that you need great dps, the question is why you would bring a shitty dps over a decent one?
---
As an undead rogue, I treat all alliance the same streamer or not. You're getting the knife, spit, and camp no matter who you are.
---
It won't ever.
---
As expected elsewhere in this thread, gaming culture is different over here.
---
Straight to hot posts with you. Awesome.
---
You can kill stuff faster if you rush down to Feral Faerie Fire before switching to another tree. Personally I would take the natural weapons + omen DPS boost before Furor as well.
---
Perks of being famous it's the same online or in IRL except IRl you get sexual stuff too oh who am I kidding this guys probably get gnome nudes daily
---
Let’s not. OSRS is just a shell of it’s original self. The game is slowly being voted into a RS3 direction just without EoC and the “improved” graphics. It all started with some small QoL, then they added the grand exchange, which (let’s be honest) saved the game, but also changed it drastically.
---
Going to play with add-ons just like in vanilla. Only difference will be that I can actually see what is going on during a raid and not have 1/2 my screen full of ctraid boxes so I can decurse on gehennas.
---
Tng dng dng dng dng dnnnnnnnng...
---
Maybe in some American third world countries, but they are definitely well paid in EU
---
Let's be real here, while there are tons of streamers who actually have interesting content, or interesting personalities that keep a following that way.  On the other side of the coin, any idiot can be a screeching retard like sodapoppin, most people I assume, have some level of dignity, so they don't make a persona around being an obnoxious moron.  How being an obnoxious moron is even popular in the first place is beyond me, but that's not the point here.
---
TL;DR twitch is a cesspool of idiots with a few diamonds sprinkled in the mix
---
And this is why (despite playing on pvp servers plenty in the past on retail, and playing with warmode on quite a bit earlier in BfA) i'll be rolling on a PvE realm.
---
Ill be within a couple weeks of 30 when Classic is released, and frankly work way too many hours to deal with coming home and getting camped for most of my night.
---
&gt;I personally have no fucking idea why people devote so much of their attention to how much they dislike streamers, but hey, to each their own.
---

“I have sprint too”😂😂
---
If someone was able to make that streamers name and posted a screenshot of it with the server name you could be assured that streamer won't be playing there. Do that for enough servers and stramers and you'll have a good list of which servers to play on.
---
I've seen some bug reports about players' PvP flag falling off immediately when they rezone to a friendly zone, which I don't remember being the case. Maybe try to set up between a contested and friendly zone to check if this is still the case.
---
i.e. alliance player zones from Dun Morogh into Badlands and back and loses the PvP flag instantly.
---
overlord , thats really great)
---
Hunters.
---
Definitely less, yeh.
---
Oh no I can't use my Athlon 64 for this game anymore!  
---
Oh wait..
---
That was like 8 pcs ago.
---
I don't know if it is a small balance change, but like just give paladins a taunt.
---
I understand perserving vanilla, but feels bad that certain class trees are near unuseable. They don't need to be top tier, but don't make people fight the masses just to get into groups.
---
&gt; Decent healing spec though.
---
understatement of the century
---
I see your point, but they often seem to provoke a lot of ppl by their comments intentionally. Polarising the community. 
---
A good example to me is frost, i pretty sure noone wanna streamsnipe corpsecamp him 🙃.
---
Must streamers just het the attitude back they bring up themselves. 
---
That reflects in all those posts and comments in here 🧐
---
Undead Rogues with Purple Mohawks...IRL name Chad. Says bruh way to often and often spends his out of game time “Getting Wasted”, “Burning Down”, and/or “Bangin’ dem hoes”.
---
Yeah but saving time to do what?
---
Your a casual. Usually you can onky dedicate 2 hours at most on 1 sitting
---
I'd argue the ways that most people waste time is the casual way
---
Exploring
---
Gathering 
---
Crafting
---
Finding rare shit
---
&gt; xD wtf is this outburst
---
the sign of a mature person giving up hope of making a kid understand reason?
---
people should stop bitching about streamers. Just play the game and have fun and stop giving a fuck about who else is playing.
---
I guess you just wrote out what a lot of People in this subreddit are Feeling.
---
Hence why everyone is so hyped about classic and hopefully being able to revive this Feeling and type of gaming in General :)
---
It is not that you are too old to Play games. I feel like there is much more younger Players that have their "child rages" rather than nerd rages just shouting, screaming and swearing at everyone. 
---
Due to that People just stopped caring for Chat and voicechat because it is just a real pain to have "Kids" go wild. (that may Sound like I have a Problem with younger People doing that, I really don't - it's just not what we are used too... it's different)
---
Just Keep your hopes up for classic :) I think there will be plenty of People happy to connect with you and Chat a bit!
---
Just while leveling to 30 on a private Server I made a lot of friends I chatted with for hours when we just wanted to do a quest together quickly :P
---
It'll be just like it was :)
---
I just replaced my 2500k with an amd ryzen 2600. I concur
---
&gt;  But if you resort to streamsniping in order to do this that is not acceptable at all. 
---
streamers have tools to mitigate this. they can delay their stream up to some 15 minutes. or they can not stream at all. if it's a valid thing for streamers and their fans can tell people that they should just roll a different server. then it also valid to tell streamers that they should put a delay up or not stream. That is fair on both sides.
---
Roleplay w/ open world PvP 
---
Duh
---
Tauren Priests would be annoying... Holy cow.
---
He was banned from streaming, not from playing the game lol.
---
Mana rationing will 100% be a thin for all mana classes, so i wouldn't worry to much about it. If you decide to roll mage, yeah the mana will be less of an issue but now you will have to deal with people whispering you constantly for water.
---
You do not absolutly need to bind every totem but i would because you never know. Instead of doing something like binding each totem to an individual button instead try using modifiers for your totems. Shift and control are great as well as any mouse buttons you have. That way you could do earth totems as say E/ shift E/ Control E/ Mouse button E/ put water totems at R so its close and you can just repeat the process. and so on and so fourth. it will be awkward at first. But with it being classic and having to start from 1 with no abilites shouldn't be to hard to master.
---
Full resto would be pretty awful to level as but you could go ele/resto and do just fine. As far as raids, it is true that most hardcore guilds don't bring ele shamans. But there will undoubtly be some guilds that will still bring you. especially if they like you as a person. 
---
I personally plan on playing a Cat Druid and i know most guilds don't bring them to raids, but i don't really care. I'll be raiding as a cat in classic no matter what.
---
I'm assuming this now because I saw a post about someone getting Staff of Jordan and another poster suggested giving it to a few different streamers to get more use out of it. I'm still fucking laughing, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxe48r/staff_of_jordan_drop/eq5obc9/).
---
Best reasoning to not play on any servers with streamers.
---
And i don‘t get your downvotes on ypur opinion 🙈
---
Sounds like jealousy
---
I think most people who go camp lowbies are hoping for a pvp battle rather than just for the satisfaction of camping lowbies. At least thats what I strive for if I do it. 
---
Going for level 8s dosnt happen often being they have to be tagged for pvp. But camping level 20/30 towns will happen. The flight masters and quest givers will be dead from time to time. Almost 24/7 for some towns unfortunately (Like TM and that horde base on the beach in Ashenvale.)
---
That takes me back =)
---
We had people in our guild who tried to do that on purpose, carefully, carefully aligning their xp with the discovery.
---
with tradeable raid loot you could have the master looter pick up everything and distribute it after raid, right?
---
No need for stopping after bosses.
---
Just goes to show how much players have improved at the game. Back then people wouldn't even thought of that.
---
ye i rly dont get it either , pvp would still happen, and STV ganks would also happen, so idk  
---
mb someone open my mind :D
---
This is it chief
---
Warlocks are pretty ruthless. Dot you up like crazy and watch you die to the mob you're fighting
---
You can put “sea lion thing” as well as “owl thing.”
---
That sea lion face is nightmare fuel.
---
You won’t even get an invite to raids as a prot pally, not even as offtank. Better off having a warlock tank. People would literally laugh at you. 
---
Healing you wear whatever you can get, but there’s plenty of non cloth healing gear.
---
Haha that makes it even better xD The dedication behind it :P
---
I can imagine you riding around for hours just so you could get that screenshot!
---
Imagine pressing the wrong button in that Moment :D
---
Probably, but that’s like being jealous of meth heads.
---
In many situations mana efficiency isn't the thing you want to optimise for. Good druids spec for regrowth and innervate themselves, especially in the early raids, so they can stop getting their heals sniped (since HT has a slow cast).
---
Streamers are giving up their position at their own risk. The Blacklist for stream snipers makes no sense.
---
Well, there would also be RP.
---
I have new goals now...
---
You're going to be the MT and the GM but you don't really like tanking ?
---
Recipe for guild disband in 6 months max !
---
hey so uhh.. where do you live and what's your name
---
It's also probably going to help with the characyer creation issues on the actual launch. A little less "character creation has timed out" hopefully.
---
People do care though. That's the sad part.
---
It's almost like there is more than one person in the world... Hmmmm.
---
Twitch chat is flowing into Reddit.
---
Seems like being an asshole is cool again.
---
Finally an opportunity to ask while not being completely out of topic...
---
Hunters!
---
... About hunters, do we know if Lupos is going to be broken in Classic or if he'll be fixed on launch?
---
Lupos was a level 20 something pet wolf that dealt shadow damage instead of physical, which means he could go right through armor on any target. Had anyone tested it yet?
---
Yeah but you want of the 🐻
---
Opinions my dude, all it is.
---
but not the delicious sandwich kind
---
hating streamers is one of the pettiest thing I've ever seen in online gaming
---
It originally looked like the iron feather set but was vibrant blue.
---
Vanilla &gt; TBC &gt; WOTLK 
---
Repeat every 7 years or so until I’m dead.
---
Life’s good 👍
---
That FCT is insufferable. Nice smack though.
---
they will have RP-PVe for "sure"   
---
But why is so much different on a RP? I played also on a RP in TBC, and couldnt see any difference compared to a normal one
---
&gt;Yet people miss it.
---
Yea people miss the game overall, but there are tons of parts to it that people _dont_ miss, like the crappy itemization that forces a Paladin/Druid/Shaman to massively break immersion and start wearing cloth dresses and shit to heal. Or the fact that those said classes had absolute _trash_ specs when it came to something like raiding which hate it or not is a massive part of the game (prot pally is just a nonstarter in raids even more so than ret, boomkin is an absolute joke and ele sham is pretty bad).  Adding say the class changes that _would've_ been added in 1.13 but were kept off due to Burning Crusade isnt a bad idea.
---
I sincerely doubt most streamers or sodapoppin are literally sitting there for 8 straight hours while they stream screeching like a retard. I'm sure that perception is mostly hyperbole and cherry picking from this sub
---
Streamer guilds are gonna make it a lot harder to do guild recruitment for real. Make Azeroth great again has like 1/6 the alliance population on the beta.
---
Im saying rppvp vs pvp
---
good luck with APES
---
&gt;neither is blacklisting them.
---
if blacklisting is done on the blizzard forums. That is against the code of conduct. blacklisting is the same as naming and shaming here on reddit. If it's against the TOS/COC of blizzard forums. You best believe it's not allowed in game. this is why any blacklist anything will have to be done on a 3rd party website. so you are very very wrong.
---
Hey man, super late reply, but to answer your question, yes this is a very very viable spec. You will NEEd gear in this spec. So be ready for some pve action before heading into world pvp during phase 1.
---
"Haha got you, I was only pretending to be retarded!"
---
I don't see the problem.
---
The PC game market doesn't go away (I remember people doomsaying it ever since the first XBox launched, that was almost 18 years ago :P). And even tho it's smaller than the mobile market: A small fortune is still a fortune, and someone want's that dough.
---
they do flips when they use certain skills
---
Unless the streamers made multiple characters because they aren't all dumb.
---
People start doing this for views guess what i'm 100% sure it's from a private server  you have 0 alts ? what a coincidence this is the third guy who pretend he have a pic from 2005 and have 0 alt LOL
---
i think its just this recolor addon

It's the authentic classic experience - players getting salty at other players for experiencing content they don't get to experience.
---
Yes. Did you? https://youtu.be/wRzJDDxyZqk?t=266 "During that tournament, Trollgodx and Trollgody... I wish they were banned within 15 minutes. At that point you've seen what you need to see. Just ban them, right there and then. Just iron-fucking-fist".
---
Considering inflation, it's actually cheaper now than it was 14 years ago :P
---
just punt them
---
Only thing I hate with classic WoW is that these guy will play on NA servers thinking they know PvP
---
&gt;In one you are cheating, in the other you are exposing a cheater. It isn’t an argument over apples or oranges, one of them is blatantly wrong.
---
wrong. even if they are cheating. You are not allowed to name and shame them on official forums, aka official blizzard infrastructure.

Clockwork is a reformation due to the release of Classic WoW. We are an AU based PvE &amp; PvP guild. We are looking to revive the sense of community we have had together in the past with our core of experienced officers and fresh new faces. Our focus is to be a competitive PvE and PvP guild.

He's trying to run some meme build, I straight up told him the only builds people are willing to take. There are raiding ret paladins, there are raiding tank paladins. They aren't in flavor but they exist.
---
one implies RP the other doesn't 🤔
---
would you hunt a druid in game called "chance" while you are levelling if that druid wasn't a streamer?
---
I know, that's fine with me.
---
Caster = male. Meele = female.
---
Im using these last 2 months to make sure ive done everything i need to do before classic launches lol still spending a hefty amount of time pining in this sub though :(
---
Quite possibly the most underutilized ability in vanilla, and very helpful when playing with newbies
---
On opposing factions. On a PvP server. This isn't being blown out of proportion, it's exactly as scummy as it sounds.
---
Base jumping the cliffs. That vendor with the parachutes. :)
---
We know he is normalized
---
A fair argument to be sure. I just think the bigger companies are all going to flock to the bigger market - as we currently see happening.
---
Just as once MTX started in one game, it spread like a disease to almost all of them.
---
I remember in my vanilla guild there was only one of two druids, and they had so much dkp because they were a shoe in for tier gear. Over the years I always thought if i could go back to playing vanilla, I would make a druid. Right now i plan to make a warrior, but I might have to fire up and druid on a pserver and have another look, thanks.
---
What's the cheap class mount?
---
You have a free one at lvl 40 and a almost just as expensive one at 60 after diremaul comes out
---
Chad is going to play an Orc Warrior. Undead Rogue is the typical virgin race/class combo.
---
Well, this sure looks nice, but to be honest my Classic experience is that when an enemy priest Mind Controls me, I fall from a cliff and die soon afterwards.
---
Learn to read.
---
Look at TF then at Atiesh ...
---
The Chinese call it "chicken staff". Most accurate description ever.
---
Most streamers will be on PvP servers, yes?
---
This. I never cared for streamers and streaming in general. But now that I see how it really is, I am kinda worried. Streamers can easily coordinate large numbers of people. Avoiding a streamer is one thing, but avoiding the mass is another. I suppose it means A LOT more pvp raiding and ganking, since a streamer can declare war and people will follow. I also think the layering will be more problematic on servers with streamers.
---
peopleget butthurt if you tell them they can roll different server than the streamers btw
---
Dodge is good, but not as important as armor and stam. So you will be using armor trinkets for the most part.
---
Omen of Clarity is a marginal increase to rage but the pre-requisite natural weapons is very useful for the extra threat and there aren't many other good places to put that 1 point.
---
it was a stress test....
---
have you ever known them to be very long...
---
&gt; I can think of a million things I’d rather be doing, like playing the video game myself. 
---
Like shitposting about people playing video games...
---
&gt; Must be a gen z thing.
---
Must be an incel thing.
---
Idk if the lack of rp in the server title means there is no rp in the server
---
he's asking, because warlocks get a free mount, what's the actual value of that since warlocks have to spend extra gold to invest in pet abilities
---
Couldn't he just hide his fucking screen when going to hide somewhere in stealth?  Maximize your camera or whatever and just go hide somewhere.  Keep your stream on a 20 min delay and no one will ever find you.
---
killed me
---
right? lol. so much pettiness
---
When I see one I’ll tell you
---
&gt;  Look at how stuff like this worked in legion. 
---
Why? Is the way they did it in Legion the only possible way to do it? There is absolutely no other way?
---
&gt; All they did was duel each other and get into pvp combat and then use their pvp skills on world bosses.
---
This can easily be fixed and made a non-issue. Do you know anything about programming?
---
&gt;Give me an example of what you are talking about, and I'll explain to you how you just fucked up classic.
---
I mean if you think 1.12 is perfect and the end all be all of how Vanilla should be forever, be my guest. But thinking there can't be any positive improvements made that still keeps the core values of classic unchanged, seems extremely narrow minded.
---
streamer sycophants are way more prevalent than the "haters" it is incredibly telling you felt the need to insult in your opening post. Not surprising in the least, though.
---
Slow mount is basically free, fast mount still costs hundreds of gold and won't be available until some time in 2020. For a lot of players it'll just be an aesthetic thing they chip away at.
---
Yep. All hail the 0/30/21, king of the hybrid specs.
---
&gt; You already have stealth so shadowmeld is useless to you
---
Except you can shadowmeld in combat.
---
It may not go away, but it will be severely diminished. There is such thing as market domination.
---
There might still be people making new games for Arcades, but that market has so severely diminished to the point of near non-existence.
---
(People doomsaying PC because of Xbox were morons haha - mobile domination is significantly different and has already been born out)
---
cringe at dudes who play female chars.
---
downvote me
---
&gt;Isn't PvP on a PvP server.
---
PvP = Person Versus Person. The act of engaging in attacking another player is literally pvp happening, while on pvp server. Are you slow?
---
How is buffing the enemy Vanilla spirit though? We used to gank eachother whenever we could :)
---
Going to disagree on a couple points...in Vanilla, downrank healing was a thing and rank 4 Healing Touch was pretty mana efficient.  Set that up with a couple oh shit macros and druids play was pretty good.  Hardest part, learning to cancel healing touch when someone healed the target before you.  
---
The actual play wasn't that hard, but did require focus.
---
Same answer as above:  
---
"Now turn that logic around - don't want to get "blacklisted", don't stream snipe. Stream &gt;&gt;&gt; get sniped. Snipe &gt;&gt;&gt; get blacklisted. Action &gt;&gt;&gt; reaction. Don't be surprised when your actions have consequences. It's a pretty simple concept. Like I said - I don't think it's wrong to snipe(it's a dick move imo but point still stands that by streaming you choose to take that risk) but I also don't think it's wrong for streamers to take active steps to protect themselves from sniping."
---
i've seen 15-20 man shaman/bdudu obliteration combos
---
The real galaxybrain play here is to mindcontrol and then use you to buff someone entirely different
---
Worst videos are "random retard streamer reacts to... " that reacts to.. kills me
---
Link isn't even available yet and you're talking about how it's being marketed?
---
Who are these new players you're thinking of anyway? Either they're new to Classic - but not vanilla, in which case they already will know enough to understand the premise of the addon, or they're new to the game, and probably aren't downloading a bunch of niche addons like this anyway.
---
This made me tear up well done
---
You must be the type to follow a streamer around in-game.
---
Most normal wives aren't going to want to play WoW. Mine hasn't played a video game since Wii sports or Mario Kart.
---
Although I don't see a problem with a RP-PVP server if Blizzard doesn't make one I'm quite sure the RP community can find a way to make one o the PVP server the "ONE FOR RP"
---
groups mostly. They've seen plenty of deaths already, some dumb, some funny, some tragic. Their best geared rogue clicked on the horde flightmaster in Booty Bay for instance. RIP Spy.
---
Stop banging on about Ret he asked specifically about healing you fucking nonce
---
Personally I believe what the players really miss is the community vibe and the open world in which you have to explore, farm, gank, get ganked, and engage generally speaking. LFG/LFR , joint realms, char transfers / renames are what killed the community. QoL is fine up to some extent. Just my 2 cents and humble opinion.
---
I don't get why *that* is your sticking point over "they already provide free entertainment". You give money to billion-dollar corporations every day. You purchase and consume media from multi-millionaire singers/writers/actors.
---
I really dont care for most of his points
---
It seems like its aimed at HC players with very little time rather than casual players
---
It creates a home where those that are into RP can gather, instead of a fractured community over different servers. Especially for RP the community really matters and when a proper home is appointed by Blizzard there is a much larger chance of success.
---
Starting at the august 1st :(
---
Just so I'm clear, you specifically went and watched a bunch of footage of this person you don't like, to confirm they are in fact retarded? I'll just, ya know, not do that, and continue to not care if they actually are or aren't retarded
---
[Alllllllrighty then](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkhEOkdCQAASCNf.jpg)
---
&gt; and just talk about the god damn game? 
---
Not that im enjoying the constant arguing about streamers, but tbh there isnt much to talk about at this point.  The vast, vast majority of us arent in beta and there hasnt been a ton of new stuff to talk about since the hit? cap blue post....unless you count the FP pathing stuff (which was actually really neat to watch, but that lasted...what...10 minutes even with reading through the post?)
---
controversial opinion: this game does not require talent
---
"Playing on an RP" and participating properly in RP are different things.
---
Social interactions are much more immersive since they take place in the world and character. 
---
It's just a better way to experience the world of warcraft the world/lore and it normally brings mature players/serious players. 
---
No lame drama, no memes, no kids and not immersion breaking because everyone is playing as if they are that character in that world like a single player RPG.
---
The Dutch are good people. I'd be quite alright with them.
---
Considerably
---
Move anything and bartender are the only addons I"ll have.
---
How do Druids fare in PvP vs casters (particularly Warlock and spriest) and what is the general strategy outside of cat form for these match-ups? I feel like PvP vs melee is much easier to work around than casters.
---
400 gold damn bro. You were rich as fuck
---
Orc warriors. Any other race is fine and I say that kmowing that they all attack on sight but for some reason orcs always corpse camp in my experience.
---
The add-ons allow exactly that. But the problem with the classic add-ons was it couldn't tell when casts were stopped. So it would carry on showing a spell cast after the fact. 
---
You can still use add-ons to tell exactly when someone casts and what spell. Maybe not when they fake it. But it's not too hard to see when someone stops casting and if the spell is green/yellow for heal, or an attack spell.
---
It would be good if there was a blanket no add-on for cast bars, so everyone had to just go off animations. But that's not what it will be. So why not add a working cast bar in.
---
👀
---
&gt;misinterpreted what Soda said about the blacklist
---
No, we just didint change the meaning to support him, you say something dumb, you say something dumb. If you say something dumb his community cannot say "it was not because i'm fanboi."
---
&gt;Those "spergs that play Wow" you mention are literally what those streamer guilds are.
---
People who play retail 24/7 are not going to be compareable to people who played classic these last 10 years 24/7. Their piles of fanbois will barely reach 12, because theyre too busy just following them around, people are going to be tag stealing from them all day every day, people are going to be going after them via pvp all day and they'll likly be much higher in lvl due to not being slowed down the whole way by 100s of people
---
You're almost certainly correct.
---
&gt; Why? Is the way they did it in Legion the only possible way to do it? There is absolutely no other way?
---
Then tell me how they would my dude.  Please, go ahead and give a better option that the company who made the video game can't seem to figure out but you think you can.  So please tell me how they would.
---
&gt;This can easily be fixed and made a non-issue. Do you know anything about programming?
---
LOL then PLEASE tell me how they would all knowing genius.  Blizzard themselves didn't seem to figure it out so please let me know how they would.
---
&gt;I mean if you think 1.12 is perfect and the end all be all of how Vanilla should be forever, be my guest. But thinking there can't be any positive improvements made that still keeps the core values of classic unchanged, seems extremely narrow minded.
---
Did I say this?  I'm asking you to give me an example of how you think you would fix the game, and I'll tell you how you just fucked it up.
---
You seem to think there are these fix-all do-all changes that can happen to the game and act like you know exactly what they are, how about you tell me what they actually are smart guy.
---
People cry when certain streamers opinions negatively effect them when their own opinions are very negative of all streamers. Sound logic
---
The shockadin build he’s talking about is basically just a holy build. The only difference is he’d swap out healing gear for spell dmg gear. He’d be totally fine raiding with that build. Plus, in vanilla nobody can see what build you have. Plenty of people lie and say their spec is optimized when it isn’t. You can heal on most classes completely fine without optimal spec. 
---
Some guilds would take ret pallys for buffs and to fill spots. I’ve NEVER seen a prot pally in a raid.
---
That's actually very impressive.
---
People talk about HoT's not stacking and that's true but what many people don't realize is that only one druid should be specced to HoT, and he will run them on the tank in case of an emergency swiftmend.
---
The rest of the druids will shift over into moonglow as they accumulate T2 gear and get some spell crit. This spec increases the efficiency of healing touch and allows them to spot heal very well.
---
IMO thats the kind of change that makes sense, and i would welcome them in classic.
---
Theres honestly not really a good reason why paladins dont have taunts. Giving them one doesnt even make them stronger tanks, it just makes them not useless.
---
Warlocks who are serious about PvP also tend to buy regular mounts to save the mana cost and since your mount cast can be silenced.
---
That is from BC.
---
No, I'm not slow. Apparently you are. Stream sniping isn't PvP on a PvP server. It's cheating.
---
Imagine your King being a bratty little boy and your kingdom secretly being run by a dragon. Imagine your own people openly revolting against your faction because they're fed up with the corrupt "nobles".
---
Imagine instead serving under the powerful and honorable Thrall in his glorious prime, fighting to establish your own epic legend that will be echoed for ages by the warriors of the Horde. 
---
(TBH Alliance are plenty fine but Horde are way cooler, let's be honest. Orcs in Vanilla are by far the best race to play with the best overall story arc.)
---
Learn to present argue by making arguments.
---
If instead you rely on silly insults, no one will take you seriously.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Ranking starts in phase 2, and is done within a couple of months - depending on how coordinated the brackets are, it might not even take them that much playtime.
---
Besides, MN is just one of countless poopsockers in their guild/social circle.
---
An aspiring scarab lord streamer was recently completely shut down and denied by APES just for the lulz, and he was basically a nobody.
---
Sure thing buddy.
---
you  feel like :" Nooooooo i got accepted to a Job just before classic releases" ?
---
"Content I'm not interested in is instantly awful" lmao
---
no one is here understanding what the OP is asking
---
He's talking about a cross-faction blacklist though. On a PvP server. You don't see anything wrong with that?
---
I don't like most of his stuff, but when he goes over a video about a subject he is more fair than most I see.
---
He’s the ONLY streamer I want to see in game, ever.
---
Hunters after lvl 40 did when I was leveling a Warlock. I managed to burst down a few of them before ther red kitten of doom burst through my void sac shield, but most of the time they’ve only attacked while I was in combat and relatively low on health.
---
Lemme know when you received the downvote
---
Your real competition for those boots is fury warriors. Those are listed as BiS forever on some of the lists for fury warriors, although I think chromatic boots have similar value and have the advantage of being plate.
---
Well geared SL lock.
---
It is like more wild west than ever in some regards, I feel
---
A lot of people are way angrier than ever. It used to be wild west in regards to rules, but people also felt more relaxed back in the day.
---
Anyway, I think moderation is required, a lot of people are just shitheads and the only thing keeping them in check is fear of repercussions. If they feel untouchable they will act as such.
---
Hahaha mhh no I like the new job. 
---
I will play wow on and off just for fun and relaxing :)
---
Who cares if someone does this, don't stream if you don't want to be hunted.
---
Both are fine as long as they are on a separate server than the base classic game. My dream is that after classic has been around for a while they do “season servers” where people can race to clear content and they can experiment with post naxx raids.
---
The concern with 1.13 isn’t so much what they are going to add flying or dungeon finder, but that the gear power creep will begin to invalidate earlier raids. Raiding guilds getting new members will just opt to gear them up through AQ40 or Naxx and skip earlier raids all together. Blizzard will also want people to play their new content, which will mean new catch up mechanics at some point. Eventually you aren’t playing classic anymore, just the new 1.13+ content. Put this on a different server and it’s fine, but don’t screw people who want to experience the original content.
---
Madseason is the only wow content creator that i enjoy watching. I don't watch live streams, though. I will go back later and jump through the videos.
---
The only drawback I found playing one on a pserver this past year was people trying to boss me around. Like, yes, I have healing spells but I sign up for raid as a tank so don’t say I’m the wrong spec, relegate me, etc. 
---
Then when our main tank rage quits after 3 attempts at Majordomo, who comes through in the clutch? Hint, it wasn’t a warrior.
---
&gt; . There is such thing as market domination.
---
In competing markets.
---
The mobile market is not competing with the core of the PC market. People like me will never sit down to play idiotic clicker-games on the tiny screen of a phone. And there are enough like me to warrant an entire industry.
---
yes, you'll be fine with a job, especially if you don't have a wife and kids. plenty of people in my hardcore raiding guild had jobs in vanilla/BC.
---
I'm salty but not because of streamers streaming it, just salty because I really want Beta and I think I fit in the normal requirements (besides being CC).
---
Cringe at humans playing any other race than human.
---
I'd do some light but pretty significant QoL stuff like bala buffs duration up to 10-15 min and giving them taunt so they can tank, gear for a few specs which would be viable (feral dudu e.g.)  etc.
---
I'm in full support for changing itemisation tho specially tier sets. But that might just be because im bored from the vanilla content after a decade.
---
Wrath servers would be my dream, though i think i'd even play BC servers, at least to see what the game was like.  I started in early to mid Wrath, though...and being able to experience that again would be awesome.
---
I wouldnt mind if they left the dungeon finder out, though....granted, that didnt come in until...what, 3.3.5?  It was quite a ways through the final tier already.  I think it might have come out with the quick Halion raid.
---
World PvP is my deciding factor right now between a few classes.
---
I’m heavily considering rolling Druid but I see a common point brought up on this sub that druids are really only good at surviving and running away. And that picking favorable matchups is a major positive for druids.
---
How good/bad are druids in 1v1 world PvP in terms of getting the upper hand and killing an opponent?
---
What are favorable/toss-up/unfavorable matchups for Druid?
---
Probably leveling to 60 and raiding since the article already crossed out pvp.
---
&gt; charactical
---
What fucking word is this supposed to be.
---
Holy Shock can be used as DPS/Heals. If he's healing, he's gonna be wearing cloth and not be able to PVP DUR DUR retard. If he's DPSing he's better off using ret as it'd do more DPS.
---
Almost a 1000 thruths if you will.
---
Look at the mature adult here hyped for a fucking video game
---
I really hope i can get into the same mindset!  instead of thinking that the job will reduce my wow time i want to be thinking that it will the experience i have in it by gently limiting it
---
we want vanilla not BC and beyond
---
I like that classes have strengths and weaknesses
---
Some addons may give to much of an advantage, that is true.
---
However blizzard unit and raidframes are really awful for healing and I really love having the option to customize those to show what I need and hide the rest. Same with action bar mods for classes with different stances/forms.
---
Some parts of the vanilla ui are just not really practical.
---
I think some addons just add to the nostalgia of wow classic, most of us used them so I don't see the big deal, use them if you want or don't who cares
---
So explain how humor is not subjective?
---
Or pvp
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XmDt5obtHo
---
Damn, that's the best thing I saw from Classic!
---
I disagree, I really like the female UD casting animations, especially for healing.
---
It depends. If there's some slob that seems to use the majority of their time online to attempt to camp a streamer, as in, you never see this person really doing anything else or camping anyone else, but they try to pretend it's just a coincidence the one person they camp constantly is a streamer, I think that person is a bigger waste of oxygen than any streamer could ever be. If those people are blacklisted, that's good.
---
Streamers are the medium through which we currently experience the game, and they excel at creating viral content that is intended to get reactions. It's axiomatic that a great deal of the conversation here is going to focus on them, good or bad, simply due to the dynamics of the current situation. If Blizzard didn't want to make this summer's marketing campaign all about streamers, they should have handled this differently.
---
*added the word enhance lol
---
🧂
---
we still do, just "abit" older
---
Sure.
---
This sub needs to ban threads about streamers, it's making the community look like a bunch of socially stunted awkward dweebs. Most of these guys are putting on a character, like Esfand and Asmongold. You are actually getting upset about people acting silly for entertainment, being satirical and trolling their audience. The worst part is that many of these threads and sentiments come from actual adults.
---
Cringe at people playing gnome
---
Lol what makes PvP carebear compared to RPpvp? Are u somehow better because you're pretending to be a video game character? To clarify, I think it's awesome people can RP on WoW, but you came off as a dick head tbh
---
is this what you call classic community? I think blacklists would be abused but they are just a modern interpretation of what forums were back then, if you were labeled an asshole, you wouldn't get invited to content.
---
Assholes will be assholes, people just want to enjoy the game.
---
&gt;Can you play Classic efficently even tho you work fulltime? 
---
Yes
---
C&gt;an i "compete" with the School/College/jobless guys ?
---
Define "compete".
---
Given same skill, same determination and same goals, someone who doesn't have a job and plays 16h a day will have an advantage over you. There is nothing you can do about that.
---
To kind of explain I’d say it goes more in depth as who are you on the server. You develop a niche (maybe a Lone Ranger w/ an out to kill certain players in a certain area) and when you return to stormwind/Orgrimmar  people KNOW you by that. Ah here comes Moktar! The fiendish orc who has brought peace to the land of tarren mill. Or you can just rp as a weird thing but when pvp events go on you’re invited to be a soldier. It feels more attached to your character. Can be fun, can be weird, can even kind of a lot of work staying in character, but it’s very specific. 
---
I think it would be cool in classic but I’ll say rp servers love xmog and that isn’t in classic so I wonder if it’ll hold the same weight if you can’t xmog.
---
If you're watching someone level from 1 to 40 in beta right now, it isn't to watch the exciting gameplay. People that watch these streams are there for the streamer and will continue to have it open while they level themselves.
---
Or run into a pack of elites..
---
That was not humor for me, when OP stated that I should go an find something i find humorous i clearly undorstood that he is level headed and did not argue with him. Saying humour between quotations did not meant i labelled humour as an objective thing, i was just saying what it means for me, or I have to put that stupid “imo” after each word now?
---
&gt;Also what the fuck kind of paladin doesn't wear a libram?
---
Because librams came out at 1.9.
---
You kinda just lost all credibility there buddy.Anyway I'm not a ret paladin fan boi or anything, I just saw the vid and it seemed somewhat decent, needs more testing of course and comparisons.
---
Given that most warlocks don't train anything but their Voidwalker while leveling, there is essentially no tradeoff.
---
if only they could craft a sword from such truths
---
No I haven't, I don't care who he is.
---
Or just go Troll.
---
I thought Blizz was going with Vanilla-esque server caps of 3-5k people. The Beta is the exception, not the rule.
---
i would never throw my career because of a game. Im addicted to wow but in a healthy way - if thats even possible lol :D 
---
ill try to enjoy work ^^
---
I repeat, I don't get why *that* is your sticking point. I'm hoping to get a window into your mind to see what you're going on about.
---
i would say male nightelf shadow priest, because that would be the most infuriating thing to lose against, but anyone who would play such a combination would have no hope of beating anyone in pvp.
---
Im going fem woot, i love the laugh and cry and the awesome flip finishers and i even like the sound of fem ud dying lol
---
So you're saying that person versus person, can only happen with restrictions, which eliminate possibilities of person versus person because of outside forces? This seems incorrect, as, by definition, person versus person is occurring. Which is, pvp happening, on a pvp server.
---
If you can detail how it's not pvp, in that people are not engaging in attacking other players while simultaneously attacking other players, I would be interested in hearing your explanation.
---
Nah bro, flying is not fine. Sounds like you want retail
---
&gt; cringe at dudes who play female chars.
---
You once tried to e-bang a dude who was playing a female character didn't you?
---
Isn't a dozen people following you around and carrying you through everything 'special treatment'?
---
I can see xmog being important for being a soldier
---
Like wearing the sw guard uniforms 
---
If blizz doesnt announce rppvp servers we can designate one
---
I mained a warlock back in the day and druids really weren't an issue to deal with.  Maybe a well geared balance with good gear but feral,... not really. It's just that, you have no real way of dealing with fear. Sure, bear form has the stun thingy but bear form doesent really do damage :P
---
There's no clear boundary to define between these things, and that's why you shouldn't change anything at all.
---
You can technically argue for almost anything - for example, how many players do you think **want** 10 minute respawn timers on quest objects? Or a relatively trivial thing like being able to remove sharpening stones?
---
It all opens a slippery slope of vaguely defined gameplay changes with no clear stopping point.
---
yeah I can live with being able to see quest giver, that's a good one actually, I think it was introduced in TBC.
---
I'm well aware that it could happen and it's a valid concern, but people on this post were talking all his words out of context to shit talk him because they blindly hate streamers, that's not okay. Obviously that idea he had has plenty of problems like false reports for streamsniping.
---
Maybe if you keep it up and return and seek out that player over multiple days. Sure, that's harassment but pretty hard to do/prove. Otherwise, red is dead and all that. It's the enemy faction and all that. Why wouldn't you want to halt their progress?
---
well houston we got a problem here
---
Shes used to me playing video games alot but she hasnt experienced me on a wow launch.
---
We'll make it honey - we'll make it.
---
I’m pissed I can’t hate bread anyone anymore!
---
Don't get me wrong I still play but sometimes it sucks to pay but at least if i make enough gold i get a free month or two these days
---
&gt;  I don't watch his stream when I do bother with twitch now.
---
Good. Now from this point until the end of your life, you never need to talk about or think about him again. Problem solved, you're welcome
---
First off, congratulations!!!
---
Now, the thing is, you will of course have less time to play games then when you were a student/living off your parents. That just comes with being an Adult.
---
However, if you plan out your free time and have the discipline to still get good rest each night for work, you will have plenty of time to play/get 60/raid.
---
The thing about raiding etc. Is that all those raid schedules are built around working adults times (you are here) and not around people who can play 12 hours a day. So that is 100% in your favor.
---
An added bonus to all this, is the gratification you'll get out of achieving again. You will soon realize that the little time you have now is precious to you. Putting it in little by little every now and again into WoW, means that when you DO finally hit 60 it will feel SOOO great and is a legit big achievement. You probably already know this, but the reason I bring it up is to focus back on Retial WoW and other games that cater to instant gratification and rewards. Classic WoW makes you earn it. Now that you are a full time working adult, it is going to be that much sweeter when you do.
---
Goodluck out there adventurer, and srsly, do get to bed at a good time, you'll thank yourself later
---
I will start out without ANY addons, just to repeat my original Vanilla experience. What I won't do: Being a "clicker" again. I am very sure I am unable to just click abilities anymore, like I did when starting with Wow. I was such a noob...
---
Good thing im a Smoker. Thanks for your input buddy :D
---
No changes, default UI, final destination. I always got shit from guildies for using the default UI and a damage meter. I don't like a bunch of clutter, and I was still better than 90% of people playing the game. Addons are crutches for dummies who can't pay attention, don't @ me.
---
Not sure why but WoW seems to attract the worst kinds of streamers.  To the two you listed you can add Asmond, Ziqo and Venruki.
---
Preach is by far my favorite.  He knows the game inside out and isn't a complete asshat.
---
Pretty much this. There aren't very many exclusives from other professions for rogues
---
True but I can see why blizzard won't open that can of worms. You make a spec useable but there is still very little tank gear for a paladin to actually collect, it's almost misleading.
---
My pipedream is a vanilla+ where they keep adding content in a way that is true to what separated vanilla from other expansions. Lean into class identity, forsake balance, more fun crazy items. It will probably never happen, and I would probably trust a private server team more than blizzard to stick to that, but fun to imagine.
---
1. RP is a social activity. Just like WoW, it's not much fun on a server all by yourself. You need people to RP with, and the more RPers around to enrich the atmosphere, the better. The RPPVP server marker points everyone interested in both RP and PVP to the same place, creating a like-minded community. That alone is very important.
---
2. RP realms have some rules about naming and griefing that are enforced more strictly than other servers. They're not very limiting, but you can't make your name, say, "shootyaface" or something like that. You also can't Trollgodx people's events for hours on end. (PvP based disruption is okay of course) Basically it only stops people from long term griefing, but it's important.
---
3. If you're not an RPer, RPPvP servers can still be appealing if you like a more chill and mature community. Think the opposite of a streamer server. One of the things that makes vanilla great is how every player creates their own story. Well as you can imagine, RPers are especially interested in that aspect of the game, which results in a tight knit community.
---
There are probably some other differences but I'm at work. Hopefully others can chime in.
---
It's sad actually.
---
Very sad.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BMDDPHAABM80gcA this is a good healer build
---
And here's the tanky druid caster with healing capabilities https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BMDHPH0AA88wgA You can aoe farm by having improved thorns up, using barkskin, shapeshifting into moonkin form and channeling hurricane. The channel won't be interupted because of barkskin and you take ridiculously low damage because moonkin form has 75% physical damage mitigation cap and barkskin reduces it to further 20% and hurricane reduces mobs attack speed by 25%. You can cast one and a half hurricane during barkskin which kills most mobs you would grind. There's 1min cd with barkskin so use that time to lot and drink/eat
---
Nice dude. I actually dinged 60 on my human rogue by discovering Orgrimmar! I had a screen shot but it's on my old PC I would have to dig up. Plan on doing something similar in classic.
---
&gt;not the truth.
---
No, but if you talk like a senator in absolutes you should make it clear in some way or form.
---
I will play with addons because that's what I did in vanilla. I don't see the problem.
---
Hey I played both these classes at 60. The others have fair answers but my contribution is gearing. Raids are one thing, but when you need to hey gear in order to get accepted into a raid, you'll have a lot easier time with mage.
---
People love the polymorph in 5 mans, and most of your tanks will be fury warriors with shields. Poly goes further than sap. They also will avoid bringing in rogues because they want the gear uncontested. I can tell you from experience, building groups as a rogue was the absolute worst. Getting geared up was a struggle. You see posts talking about how you can two or three man a lot of bosses with rogues/druids combos, we know that because we had to, and didn't always have another option.
---
Mages always have that other option. We have food, water, and ports. These make mages a very desirable addition to any group. Their competition with tanks who run most groups is effectively zero, so tanks won't say "I'm out unless the mage leaves" like they do with rogues. They do they a lot with rogues. That was a huge part of my vanilla experience was hearing that.
---
Raiding wise, rogues have a little harder times with mechanics. Think if Baron. You need an escape route in range of a healer while mage just runs back a bit. Complicated if your range spreads out way too much, as rogue you'll be spending 80% of the fight trying to find your clear spot. You're also the highest risk for a wipe since you're standing on the tank. Even though we were 3rd Rag kill on server and never saw a rogue wipe it, my guild and any pug I've helped had a distain for rogues on that fight and tells them to make sure they don't wipe it, as though we all were planning it as a joke or something.
---
Raids also don't heal their DPS well. In MC days we were told to bandage ourselves and not get hit ever, even when there are a lot of damage events. This is where "bandaid spec rogues" came from. Mages are more likely to see a chain heal within a group of healers. Chain heal was not often used for the tank for some reason so a lot of melee DPS would go entire boss fights without a single heal. Things may change 14 years later, but don't expect that. You may need to adapt to little or no healing.
---
All and all, they're both a lot of fun and both easy enough, but you're going to experience a lot of annoyance as a rogue and you'll need to be more creative in your playstyle.  Gearing up to even see the raids will be a struggle and a let down. 
---
Final word of advice, don't let your warrior tanks lead in 5 mans. They'll say it's to mark targets, it's really because they're going to change loot rules at some point to ninja gear. Trust me on this one. It was more common than you might think. If you're a mage, you should be leading as you know CC best anyways.
---
way to put a target over your head
---
on my server in vanilla there was a female undead warrior.
---
My poor dwarf priest didn't stand a chance. And I met her A LOT.
---
In BG she would spam emotes all the time, /spit /laugh /dance.
---
So annoying since she looked so weak.
---
Are you in the beta with a paladin named Raidboss perchance?
---
So glad im EU and wont have this issue, although we get a rubbish launch time so mehh
---
 /r/classicwowplus
---
you are in the wrong sub buddy
---
Thank you for your concerns.
---
now thats what i wanted to hear! Yes im a nobody - and im happy about! Much respect to you Sir!
---
Nope, got introduced in tbc if I recall
---
Clearly you and Blizzard dont because it's dumbass decisions like these that got us "You think you do but you don't"
---
ooohhh boy. Well, just don't get more involved than you already do and I'm sure it'll be ok.
---
&gt;why people seem to talk less and less to each other in online games
---
Because the game design over the last 10ish years or so, took extreme steps to abolish the NEED for social interactions in games.
---
When I can Auto-Queue, Auto-Guild-Find, LFR, Dailyquest, etc. my way to all game content and the best rewards, why would I waste time talking to anyone along the way?
---
I agree with this. Been leveling a mage for a week now on a pserver and it’s helping me figure out my keybinds and professions etc. only level 14 but it’s scratching that itch and hopefully giving me a good start come launch.
---
It's really not hard to raid without addons unless you're a total mouthbreather.
---
You can set up your own server with http://www.ac-web.org/forums/showthread.php?230227-Light-s-Hope-Vanilla-Repack
---
Just use the standard mangos commands: https://www.reaper-x.com/2007/09/21/wow-mangos-gm-game-master-commands/
---
So when you want an item, you just type .additem and it's itemnumber, for thunderfury that's 19019, you can find the item numbers by looking up the item on a database like wowhead of classicdb, the item number will be in the webpage name.
---
Probably easier said than done 😂
---
There's a lot of streamers...
---
...uh you clearly misunderstood me.
---
Carebear servers are pve
---
Thus rp players want rppvp.... because normal rp are pve...
---
I am guilty of that i admit, a stupid habbit to enforce an oppinion.
---
Yep, just like when League of Legends became widely available the interest in streams for it completely died. Or Fortnite, Dota 2, Hearthstone, etc. Makes total sense.
---
Some of the most viewed games are completely free and available to anyone.
---
If WoW Classic is a huge success then the biggest streamers will grow. The only scenario where the popular streamers become irrelevant is if the game is either a flop or they personally slack off and cause themselves to drop in popularity.
---
We're like Eskimo brothers? Kinda?
---
That second image could be used for Diablo Immortal.
---
It's either an undiscovered dinosaur, or some sort of advanced military tactic.  Either way, we must improve our skills in it.
---
"Classic summer".. yeah if your a streamer that is....
---
So in Vanilla and BC, a group of friends and myself purposefully tried to be assholes to the other faction to try and develop a notorious reputation on the server we played on. We were two warlocks and a shadow priest typically. We would go to low level areas and MC or fear people into bad situations where they would die to mobs and take repair costs. We would basically camp someone until they took a res sickness. At that point, we would already have another person on our team camping the graveyard waiting for them. 
---
Good memories, for me at least.
---
(+3 stamina)
---
Thanks mate!
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
I'm not concerned with the tradeoff while leveling, I want to know the tradeoff in general :)
---
I feel like this is the same reason to go Troll female instead of Male, the proportions are just better visual IMO.
---
The only addons I need are:
---
1. MoveAnything! - Rearrange my UI
---
2. Onebag - Combine all my bags into 1
---
3. Immersion - It changes the quest scroll into something like an RPG.
---
4. Some kind of bar mod.
---
I highly suggest everyone check out Immersion it is a really great mod overhauls how quests look.
---
You won't clear naxx, why are you asking for post naxx content?
---
No I have not played wow since WoD.
---
If they can only make 3 characters like everyone else you'd be able to narrow it down to all but 3. That's the majority of servers.
---
Go eat a tide pod.
---
Thing is he doesnt even mind if a stream sniper constantly ganks him by himself. In MOP there was a guy named "Coneofcool" who constantly ganked him and Soda never minded his attempts. When it was too one sided towards Soda. Coneofcool bring only a single guy to help him and soda still didnt cared about it but when there is 10 people knowing your exact location and harass you its totally different thing. His opinion is flawed? Yes it is but that doesnt mean he doesnt have any right what he is talking about.
---
Every. Single. Day. Holy moly
---
Cool names nonetheless! AC/DC fan?
---
I did see the video.  And if you think him making a blacklist as he said is wrong then "lol roll pve server".  Even in the video he mentions the difference between ganking people, killing quest mobs, etc "cause I'm an asshole". And he thinks that's fine.  He isnt talking about the rogue that stays on the docks ganking everyone and making your life hell.  He is talking about those people that pick out the streamer and try to make the streamers life hell.  Not the other faction's, just the streamers.  And he didnt say blizzard should do anything.  He said that he would let his alliance friends know who should be blacklisted and that they wouldn't play with him.  Frankly I thought that that was a brilliant way to handle it.  Social status on your server is important. Some people are famous, and some are infamous.  Ninja loot a few times and all of a sudden you'll find that no one will invite you into a group.  This is the same thing.  He is saying that if you decide to go past what is normal pvp server stuff and start stream sniping, etc. that he will tell others and ruin your reputation.  Genius.  I really dont see how any reasonable person could find this a bad thing except for those who want to stream snipe etc, but dont want to suffer any consequences for it.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
&gt;  Sure, that's harassment
---
No, it's not, and Blizzard said so in the past.
---
but what about the "yes Dom, I'll lick your boots" type of sub?
---
&gt; Then tell me how they would my dude. Please, go ahead and give a better option that the company who made the video game can't seem to figure out but you think you can. So please tell me how they would.
---
Do you honestly believe every choice a company makes is always the best one? There is no alternatives that could have been better? A company like Blizzard can't make mistakes in how they develop something? It seems extremely contradicting to have to discuss this on a Classic WoW sub. When the whole reason for Classic is how horrible retail turned out.
---
Have you ever worked on a project at any company? Do you know how decisions are made? 
---
&gt; I'm asking you to give me an example of how you think you would fix the game, and I'll tell you how you just fucked it up.
---
I would prefer to go through the game from the launch patch and have a natural patch progression just like Vanilla had. I would also like the game to continue after the 1.12 patch with new changes.
---
&gt;You seem to think there are these fix-all do-all changes that can happen to the game and act like you know exactly what they are, how about you tell me what they actually are smart guy.
---
No. I'm saying change and improvements are possible. I never claimed to know what they are. But I for sure know it is possible to improve a game like Classic. Just like Vanilla got improved and patched. Classic can as well.
---
the pants and chest are fine but other pieces are just trash by 40.
---
I'm not asking about the epic mount. I am wondering from how much of the money you save from not needing to purchase a level 40 mount do you then spend on your demons abilities
---
Can you refer me someone? I don't see anyone doing even 12+ EVERY DAY
---
Different strokes, mate. I couldn't imagine classic without world pvp or the danger of getting ganked, the adrenaline of spotting the alliance and seeing they already have you targeted. Still, if you find PvE servers better then all the more power to you, I hope you have a fun experience.
---
I like polimorphing dying horde to heal them.
---
What are you on about dude? Anyone can die to a sudden Rogue gank in literally any place in the game. Rogues can literally stealth into enemy cities and kill players inside an inn or something.
---
*resist*
---
&gt; fark
---
US get such a good launch time frame, in EU it ranges from 11PM-2AM, sad times!
---
Try every half hour
---
Not sure why but WoW seems to attract the worst kinds of streamers.  Tips, Soda, Asmond and Ziqo and  are all aweful.  Venruki is really good but can be a bit of a douche.
---
possible if you wanna spend like 6 months to level up all of your 40 chars :D and spent 600€ each month  
---
pc needs to be kinda good, not the best. but i tryed on a p-server 40x multiboxing and i have to say its a lot of fun  
---
i would max go for 5x group. so you can do dungeons by youself, or do some ganking
---
But then how would be able to read this message as it contains that word?
---
Masterpiece
---
Even streamers I like I dont want them to do yesterdays show again, it would be boring. Theyre just going to mostly talk about the same things, and do the same things. 
---
&gt; People that watch these streams are there for the streamer and will continue to have it open while they level themselves. 
---
This isnt an opinion like the other comments, you have proof on this?
---
Is anyone keeping count of these posts? I think we're over 250 by this point.
---
Who gives a single solitary flying fuck?
---
orc hunter with opening advantage is pretty much bye bye for anyone open world
---
I have it and am not F&amp;F.
---
How will you be able to reserve names before launch?
---
You got married and didn't have a job? Holy shit women wouldn't even talk to me where I am if they even sniffed a bit of unemployment.
---
Fuck you too!
---
&gt; That's why the voting system exists.. downvote posts you don't like and upvote posts you like
---
That's not how the system is meant to be used at all, and this mentality is probably the main cause of the big problems of reddit.
---
Downvotes should not be used when you simply disagree with the comment/post, that's not what they are meant for and I think it hurts the whole site that a lot of people see it that way.
---
Downvotes are meant for:
---
* Demonstrably false statements
---
* Incoherent nonsense
---
* Personal attacks
---
* Racism/homophobia/sexism/etc.
---
* Uselessly off-topic comments
---
Depending on sub rules, reports may also be appropriate in some of those cases.
---
Another way to look at it is that the downvote button means "this shouldn't be seen" not "I disagree". Should make it pretty easy to see how downvoting someone for simply giving their opinion is morally questionable.
---
Similarly, upvotes should be used to say "This is useful", not "I agree".
---
Strength is the worst stat for tanking, you want to prioritise armor&gt;stam&gt;dodge/agi. For pre-raid gear its nice to get a few pieces of +hit like the devilsaur set, mask of the unforgiven or blackmist armguards.
---
No way dude, i will create my undead mage male anyways.
---
Stream sniping is watching their stream so you have the advantage of knowing where they are, not simply killing streamers.
---
.... you do know you can have more than 1 armor set ... like 1 cloth set for raid healing and another set (plate) for pvp healing ...
---
I know what you're asking my dude, and if I could access wowhead at work I'd look it up for you and give you a total.
---
(It's pretty dead at the moment and I'm just trying to kill some time)
---
We'll need the sword of 1000 truths USB drive.
---
Get rekt by logic and reason son
---
&gt;EDIT: for some reason people are having trouble understanding what I'm asking here. What is the amount of gold SAVED from having a cheap class mount vs the gold SPENT on their demons abilities.
---
You are under the assumption that warlocks spend hundreds of gold on their pet abilities?
---
It's the same shit - why would you upgrade abilities that you aren't using.
---
Can't use every pet at the same time, so why is this a question.
---
Stranglethorn Vale, an area where pvp is rampant as well as leveling and questing. When you go there you better be ready. Fun as hell!
---
exactly. Good mindset. Will appreciate the earnings of the grind even more. 
---
A Buddy of mine took all his remaining vacation days throughout classic launch - good for him.
---
Absolute mad lad!
---
Streamsniping blacklists will have the opposite of the intended effect.  it will likely promote sniping and camping of streamers for all of the notoriety it would garner.
---
Also the blacklist would likely only be honored or used by streamers and their fanbase, and those are people you won't want to be around anyway, so... win-win?
---
Same
---
Im pretty sure Fel/Dreadsteed are Shadow, so if it gets CSd youre pretty boned. I know from having to by an Alterac Ram on my Paladin for 640g because I was tired of Mages jumping out and CSing my Charger and getting killed because I couldnt use Holy spells (all of them).
---
Dark edge of insanity.
---
Because the absurdity of paying for literally nothing is strengthened by how the patrons are generally worse off than the person they're donating to.
---
If you want to present an actual argument, feel free to - but I'm not really interested in being dug further into random semantics while you pray for a gotcha moment.
---
Oh I mean I could deconstruct this line by line, its a pretty indefensible opinion.
---
I just don't care to argue with the minority of players that won't matter once beta is over.
---
All of that is still pvp happening on a pvp server. PvP and cheating are not mutually exclusive as you want to treat them, it's not an xor. 
---
Additionally, the arbiter of rules that actually matter, Blizzard, has said that it is not cheating. So again, you're incorrect in that it's cheating. You might consider it cheating, but you don't matter.
---
Yeah, I don't like this addon because some people are not going to be excited when they discover a new spell at their class trainer. I had so much fun playing with Eagle Eye on my hunter.
---
It was long what did it say.
---
Heard you were talkin shit about kodos.
---
we did that just before i lost my job. we met in school actually. Shes with me for 6 1/2 years now. 
---
 she the best
---
Wish the male didnt waddle like a fucking penguin.
---
Female has a graceful and very undead gait, but the male just...waddles.
---
I feel like the amount of assholes is the same. There's just more hate groups now. Social media and "influencers" that have taken control, as we lose more anonymity, create too many hiveminds and yes men. Much like the sub reddits here.
---
I'm still waiting for the creepy future where we log on with our social security numbers and absolutely everything is tracked and can be reviewed.
---
Streamer wars could be fun
---
&gt; but user polls are awful. 
---
Depends how you actually make those polls.
---
If the only way to vote for some Classic feature is to have a lvl 60 character, like 50 days/played and at least Ony and Ragnaros killed, with at least Rank 6 or 7 in PvP at some point,  I think that those players will have a solid grasp on the game.
---
Sure, if you let ANYONE to vote, the result will be a disaster.
---
This can't be real. I refuse to believe it.
---
I thought classic will ship as 1.13
---
You didn’t say that at all lol. Maybe stop being a dick and re read what you said to that guy
---
A lot of that is just that it's beta, so people aren't really taking anything serious in a long-term way.  That pretty much means people feeling like joining a guild just for something like world chat.
---
At launch, there may be cliques for a little while carried over from beta.  However, I'm hoping that people generally decentralize and diversify like normal.  ...I hope.
---
Oof, harsh but true.
---
How are you this stupid? It's called a joke. Read up on what those are and educate yourself.
---
Yeah, you definitely could:  
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowmeld
---
What a total non point. You all know exactly what's implied.
---
Not well against those classes. When I was flag carrying my worst enemies were warlocks
---
As someone who's still subbed to BfA I definitely not recommend to play Warlock or any other class there if you want to play something before Classic.
---
As someone who wants to play lock in Classic too, I decided to try some Wotlk server for the first time in years because I'm sick of BfA. Wotlk is my favourite expansion so at least I have something to play until Classic. 
---
Also I won't get burned from levelling that much because I started as Blood Elf, and altough Wotlk locks got few changes from Wotlk to Classic, their playstyle is still pretty much same, unlike BfA locks.
---
When I am level 60 I plan to have all my demons abilities along with every other warlock? I am not concerned with levelling I was curious at what the difference in gold is
---
I did said every day so I assumed you also meant it. But yeah staysafe is actually going hard but I do believe they are also motivated by growing as much as possible in this period!  
---
Private neckbeards are moved by a much stronger force...depression!
---
This is why people hate streamers. Self entitled twats and Blizzard loves letting them ruin their game. ROFL
---
Don't play a fucking warrior man.
---
That's like a genie will conjure any food in the world and you choose McDonald's.
---
I really don’t understand why they can’t just make ONE and see how the demand goes.  
---
Even though I have no intention of ever rolling PvP again, I respect other peoples choice and feel like they should have an RPPvP option.
---
Go Horde if you want a real adventure.
---
Female UD has the best animations in Vanilla for most things
---
Balance is viable in nothing lol
---
undead rogue or undead mage. 90% of hardcore pvpers pick those classes and there is something annoying about them for this reason. If a troll warrior duels me, man Im so happy to see such unusual combo, that I even let him kill me
---
bruh...
---
So, you're salty you're not in the beta. Lol. Sounds about right.
---
For streamers like Soda, they have the viewers whether beta exists or not. It will impact streamers who have viewers only because they are streaming the beta, but a lot of the streamers mentioned don't rely on this game to get viewers and their viewers aren't going anywhere when the game launches.
---
I'm not salty cause streamers got access, i don't care about that.  Just slightly salty that i didn't get access lol.
---
The only thing I don't understand is quest-helper Add-ons. But to each their own I guess. Otherwise I'll be using a ton of addons
---
Games are no longer about experiences and making it to the end.
---
It's achievements and small quests all over the place. When you complete them you get a big star on your screen, and then the next mission pops instantly. 
---
So everyone is just running around doing small labor tasks to get stars. No star to get a friend so no reason to do it.
---
Listen to the community is what got us where we are with retail wow.
---
What about Bacon Call?
---
Did you ever find anything reliable? I'm trying to do something similar myself.
---
I think people dont know what youre talking about because "demon abilities", do you mean compared to the cost of grimoires for your pet abilities that are irrelevant to your mount? Because thats not a connection most people would make when discussing mount costs.
---
Look up the Demon Trainer vendors on a database. Just add up everything have, I think its under like 40g
---
If it's red, it's dead!
---
Probably cause these people are trying to wargame Vanilla instead of having a fun time. I've used the shit out of both of those spells for PvE and PvP, I bet at this rate Priests are gonna not learn Mind Control because it "doesn't contribute to leveling."
---
Hey, atleast it's not just fanarts and crappy memes (both reposts) like /r/wow
---
Oh nice. Pretty sure if I lost just one of my jobs for even a month the entire community would pressure my GF to abandon me.
---
Blizzard will 100% not allow it. If streamers don't get their names, they lose brand recognition. If they lose brand recognition, they're less likely to stream the game, and Blizzard loses exposure.
---
I can almost guarantee that Blizzard will be giving early name creation access to top streamers in order to secure their participation. Maybe they'll do it publicly, maybe they'll do it on the down low. I mean just look at how EVERY streamer got Beta access. It's going to happen.
---
After the early access, any streamer with x amount of viewers will be able to petition Blizz to obtain their streamer name if someone else has it, and Blizz will comply.
---
Guild names though, I don't think Blizzard will do anything about that. I'm sure those streamer guilds will change/merge a dozen times before the end of the lifecycle.
---
"True vanilla feeling"?  
---
Yeah, sorry mate, not quite sure which Vanilla you played, but the one I played absolutely REQUIRED at least SOME addons: proper raid frames, threatmeter, adequate unit frames that don't make your eyes bleed and actually allow you to see buffs/debuffs and an enemy cast bar.  
---
Without at the very least those, anyone in a raid or PvP group would be pretty useless. I mean, I guess you could clear LBRS/UBRS without those addons or get stomped in BGs, but I'm afraid that's about it.
---
I always got kick out of the undead rogues who would ambush/stucklock/gank the grap out of me while levelling and then use cannibalize to consume my corpse.
---
Always found it pretty annoying yet metal at the same time.
---
Yeah some crazy people out there for a game that has been conquered numerous times over the past 15 years.
---
But considering classic launches on 8/26 which is a Monday for me - and the following Monday is labor day, I took 6 days off to get a full week and a half :)
---
I had someone in front of SM do this to me last week when i was helping them kill mobs. Classic is just the best version of this game
---
well since shes the best, she will let you play as much classic as you want.
---
Can't wait until they release realm names so I can pick a realm as far away from popular streamers as possible lol.
---
Maladath: looks awesome and has decent stats!
---
I'm not entirely sure how you will do it, but it will be around August 3rd if I recall.
---
I'm not doing the math for you but you can do it.   
---
A - cost of every single demon skill.   
---
B - Total amount saved in mount.   
---
C (tradeoff) = A-B.
---
He's asking what is the total gold cost of training the pet skills of all pets to max.
---
even having a wife is fine. kids are the problem, damn kids!
---
Not that big either.
---
I cannot give you exact number unfortunately, but the sum total of demon training was definitely less than the discounted price tag for basic riding.
---
30, 3, 0 lvls above you or below, doesnt matter. pvp is pvp mate. get over it or roll pve.
---
Same. He's my WoW version of VaatiVidya.
---
In my experience Elves attract the worst types of players. In Vanilla this makes the Horde clearly the best choice.
---
Blizzard can say whatever they want. I don't really care.
---
&gt;cheat
---
 &gt;  1.
---
 &gt;  act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, &gt;especially in a game or examination.
---
Sniping someone to see where they are stealth-ed is clearly an act of cheating.
---
&gt;All of that is still pvp happening on a pvp server.
---
Please see below comment
---
&gt;I'm saying that "pvp on a pvp server" is a term that desribes normal pvp on a pvp server.
---
&gt;Ya, obviously they are engaging in PvP. Way to miss the point .The person is also cheating while engaging in PvP. That isn't "pvp happening on a pvp server lulz". It's cheating.
---
Why would classic be free? If it were free it'd be full of MTX.
---
the hunter tier sets are literally bis throughout the entirety of vanilla with the exception of pvp gloves at tier 3. And even then the gain is minimal over the tier set
---
Oh gotcha, yeah 60 is a different story, so you won't be able to get the warlock mount until phase 2 when Dire Maul releases... that being said I think we'll get phase 2 no later than October so depending how much you play, you'll have plenty of time to learn all abilities.
---
WoWwiki is full of shit. You couldn’t shadowmeld out of combat until Wrath.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shadowmeld
---
I got a buddy who is hell bent on going onto a RP-PvP server, but if I go with him I feel my guild will end up dying. None of us really care about RP and recruiting will be a pain because that would force us to do more RP events, which none of us want to do.
---
Looks like I’ll have to say goodbye to him if he goes.
---
Thin Kardashian
---
So you think Classic is worse than retail due to auto loot? Is that a slippery slope for you?   
---
Yes, life requires you to actually think about stuff and come to a conclusion.
---
Yet you can output as much damages as the tank is generating threat.
---
And if your tank is parried 9% more he's generating less threat and you less damage.
---
There might be other mechanics that we still don't know yet.
---
I'm not too sure what people would think I mean when referring to paying extra for demon's abilities. Thank you :) I probably should have done that in the first place
---
WHAT IS A SEARCH FUNCTION
---
That sounds like ligma
---
So finding him stealth under a tree equals being a complete asshole. According to what you said, it should be blacklisted, so somehow they're equal.
---
Moreso since most of the peolpe making these posts, won't clear Naxx in the first place.
---
I understand. They shouldn't have done anything is the point. They never would have in classic. Soda's sycophants out in force again in this thread. Hopefully the teleport shows they aren't willing to interfere too much and only did it cuz it's the beta and they are having fun. But it does indicate a possible negative impact on Classic Live. That being streamers crying outside one side of their mouth about 'harassment' then talk out the other side about how corpse camping is part of the game.
---
If you think you guy jumping around is harassment when it's interrupting what you want to do in the game at that moment, but you think that you camping a guy for an hour just because you are in a bad mood is fine, then you are a hypocrite. Which is Soda. Bunch of people mad they aren't in beta bitching about something that no one would have ever batted an eyelash at during Vanilla.
---
You mentioned it on the OP so I said that I'm salty but not because of a reason you listed I never said anything about you mate :)
---
I don't have a YouTube account so shut the fuck up
---
I don't know if I'm more jealous of the cape or vintage moog synth.
---
Man i'm so glad someone posted this.
---
I'm currently Managing (not leading) a group of 18 people. It's so exciting to all hype and plan together.
---
I can see a lot of worrying in the comments about management and how much effort people put into it etc.  
---
The good thing about starting with quite a large group as that we are already assigning roles that means the Guild leader will not be doing the majority of work but we're looking to spread the load as much as possible.  
---
For those that are potentially interested we are a primarily London based guild that are looking to do IRL socials before we go live. Adding that real community feel. It is not a pre-requisite, but a nice to have if you're local.  
---
Feel free to reach out if you are interested in joining a good bunch of people who want to enjoy everything WoW.
---
Billy is the name of the hunter that Wowcrendor has used since original Vanilla.
---
No it shouldn't be free but $9.99 or $7.99 a month or something would be nice
---
There is atiesh, I suppose.
---
Gonna be so funny when they announce X server and plan on rolling Y server
---
just play orc
---
They changed it in part to stop automation. Things like decursive and the original version of healbot basically played the game for you and were very boring.
---
Quality argument. I know you try hard to understs d the little things, but i need you to try harder. I know you have it in you.
---
There's no getting through to these fuck wits. They'll quit playing Classic after the first time they get camped and blizzard doesn't come in to save them from the big mean harassment campers.
---
I realize this guy, somehow, says he thinks camping isn't harassment, but they also seem like the kind of person to change their mind when it actually happens to them.
---
You realize that the webpage you linked is almost Verbatim the same as the one I linked, right?
---
&gt; they even had to remove 'sorry' because people were only ever using it sarcastically.
---
Why? Who is putting pressure on them to remove a sarcastic "Sorry"? That's fucking stupid.
---
What’s wrong with Ziqo and Venruki? Their both great at the game, funny, and actual wow AWC commentators.
---
I will play with old addons, not new ones.
---
Or you could stop giving a shit about streamers and just play the game. 🤔
---
Were trash drops worth it in MC?  Been so long I cant remember if those were still important by 1.12.
---
Speaking for myself, I married a German.  I have to be more punctual, but it's totally worth the benefits.
---
Check the patch notes at the bottom
---
You know that guilds don't have to organize RP events and not everyone on RP server is RPing? : O
---
If anyone wants to be galaxy mind but doesnt know. Human starting zone a pally can tag like 4-6 wolves at level 1 and live through it, not to mention the people who will think you need help and attack them even though you dont
---
+1
---
I love World PvP but yea, if there's no RPPVP I'll probably simply move on to RPPVE. RP community is the best community, hands down.
---
Stick of Truth was good fun. Never got around to buying Fractured.
---
&gt;Ideally I would like this to be a constructive place
---
You know what isn't constructive?
---
Making the same godamn, discussed to death, useless thread over and over and over again.
---
If anything macros make things easier for noobs?
---
 **Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian** \-  [http://classicdb.ch/?item=22589](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22589)
---
Super senjin lawlers
---
Do you have beta access to test this?  The classic client is pretty much the retail client.  Doesn't that allow multi-threading?
---
I’d imagine that works
---
Woooa "the best" isn't even THAT good. Come on now lol...
---
Yes, but it won't work that way in Classic. Because it's using the modern API.
---
As for people just using addons, they can easily just disable that function, afaik.
---
Are you missing the point of the topic in purpose, or just utterly uncapable to understand the meaning behind this written story?
---
They won't have any effect of worth, just like in retail wow for years.  
---
They don't affect crap for the majority of players in most games either. Nobody outside of this bubble even cares about them.
---
Tbh i watched some this past days since i was doing some work stuff at home and asmongold seems qay different then soda. For once hes legit comedian. And thats the way his stream work. Guy doenst seem to take things that hard and doesnt strike me as an intelectual bitch like soda. 
---
Soda is a kid that thinks he is smart. 
---
How he end being that big i dont have a clue
---
Nothing like a good gank fest mate, maybe just not your thing.
---
It's alright.  I was a moderator in his youtube live chat when he got banned for streaming TBC.
---
People yell "no" and dont give any reasonable answer why. Yes, balancing out all the classes would be boring. Making weak classes a little stronger in certain talent trees, just to make them viable enough, wont make the game completely balanced and boring in any way. TBC wasnt balanced and yet, every spec had its use. Im all for it, but people are here are not ready for these changes. Its a shame. I think, it will be possible to talk about it once naxx is out and blizzard will discuss either tbc or 1.13
---
If TPS is a problem you switch to fury tanking and there is no problem
---
We ended up on the scuffed timeline.
---
What is the plan fr
---
Classic isn’t even out yet. Why is everyone talking about what comes after?
---
Took me way too long locate your debuffs.
---
How can you play with them overlapping your ability icons? That would drive me bonkers!
---
we need a /r/freefolk for wow. Main sub is all art and this one has a lot too.
---
&gt;Maybe a well geared balance with good gear and some crits but feral,...
---
Do those really exist...? ;-)
---
Reminds me of a time when I dated a guy for a few years as a prank. You should have seen  him when I told him I wasn't gay at the end.
---
/classicwowplus
---
way to completely take it out of context, he said the person ran across the whole map to do that. it was not "found that dude randomly" and it was repeated issues AND the dude was griefing only when he was streaming to get attention from the stream. it was just an example where they MAY use the blacklist
---
Waste of perfectly good ammunition.
---
Put a Warrior T2 helmet on their head and load them into a cannon.
---
I definitely agree with you on that.
---
This was so frustrating with BFA. Playing a meme spec with good results but still not being invited over a drooling mouth breather meta players that performed at 60 percent of my level.
---
A guy who puts in effort has other aspects to him than just the numbers.
---
&gt; Propably noticed, that my native language is not English, its Finnish.
---
How would I notice that? You don't mention anything about it in your post, how would someone notice?
---
You assume they in this case SODA doesnt (PvP gank etc_) not only do they do that but they do it viciously. I played on a PvP server back then in Germany .....it was hell and while there was a Blacklist for looters it never ever was one for PvP and here is the problem. All the streamers agree and that is bullcrap (Asmon already said wow thats great)...all they need to do is to put ur name out there and baem ur done on both factions...did u gank him really over and over? who cares ur name is on it ur done ...THAT is what
---
Plus that sweet sweet rep bonus
---
Will I have to heal raids and 5 mans to gear out in order to be effective in PvP? I want to play the 29/11/11 build but I’ve heard its gear dependent and boomy doesn’t get taken to raids.
---
Yeah, the prices aren't too bad for the Ryzen 3.  I was thinking about getting a 2700x (or even 2600x), but after I saw the prices for the 3600x being 250 I was happy I didn't buy in.
---
I mean, really the WoW sub is two in one. So it's probably the best deal anyway. Besides, if Blizzard kept raising prices, the WoW sub would be 20 bucks now, so really it is closer to $9.99 comparatively.
---
Yea, I remember us bringing in some VC/BV/Overpower people to WF raids as well when numbers were low. Names are so hard to remember beyond the 4-5 people you were closest too.
---
Doesn't phase me either way, didn't expect beta, just ready to see where we are st the end of phase 1 with no layering + server queues.
---
I feel like your recruiting pool is much lower though. They’ll ask me what events I do and I’ll respond...none.
---
Also, we plan on going Alliance this time around from horde and alliance heavily out weighs Horde on RP servers, which I don’t want.
---
I’m not disagreeing with you, just stating that RP ain’t my thing.
---
He was talking about getting ganked, not getting engaged by a raid boss.
---
*I'll not ask you to return to our side, but I demand you cease your attack.*
---
I get you though on some level. There was definitely a massive tonal shift between Warcraft 1/2 which were basically just aping Warhammer Fantasy with skulls on spikes, blood gods, demon worship and all sorts of nastiness, and Warcraft 3 where Warcraft established its own identity and started doing its own thing but definitely chilled out on the violence (even the few demon-worshiping Orcs we do see in WC3 are pretty tame by comparison). If you came into the franchise because you wanted more of the feel of what Diablo was, but in an RTS form, you were probably disappointed when they shifted towards a more generally-appealing aesthetic.
---
That said, WC3 and TFT are 10/10 so while I get you, I feel like calling WC3 fanfic is like calling Star Trek the Next Generation fanfic.
---
Private servers are  closer to what Classic will be like, population mentality wise, than 2005.
---
&gt;However, you still used a private server from the late '10 to prove your claim that spontaneous large scale pvp in vanilla died out fairly quickly
---
Because it did, lol. Once the vast majority got to 60, and with battlegrounds out, there was no reason to waste time in Hillsbrad. That's a horrible way to farm honor, and people had better things to do than gank lowbies.
---
Yeah, I kind of regret putting it now...
---
It was late and I was irritated... Not so much now.
---
But fuck it I guess :)
---
I don't agree, I always T-bag or stuff like that the dude when I kill someone. And I never tried to streamsnipe anybody (giving them that much credit would make me feel poorminded)
---
I remember when levelling on a private server, I'd go out of my way to buff warriors. What goes around comes around, folks!
---
wrong sub 
---
Haha, yeah, he really took ownership of that soundbyte!
---
You obviously haven't watched soda in about 6 years. Where the fuck do people get the idea he's a screeching idiot? Are you willingly oblivious?
---
When you make yourself a target by being a streamer and advertising your location for all to see on a world pvp server:  That's what you get.  
---
Complaining about it then just makes you a hypocrite.  If he wanted to "just enjoy the game," then he could play pve, not announce his location to the entire world by streaming, or put a longer delay on his stream.  Easy solutions.
---
YouTube --&gt; StormX
---
So yes you can make it work, but need a hell lot of tools and items.
---
Even I myself would not agree with you :)
---
People are suggesting that he should play on a PVE server instead, but wouldn't sniping be just as bad or even worse there, with people killing his mobs and quest givers with no way of fighting back?
---
You were just waiting all day to use that word weren't you
---
That's so late game I don't think it will ever actually matter. Stuff like PvP at that point will be long dead, or in its dying breaths, as AQ and Naxx gear will have completely eclipsed the PvP rewards.
---
it helps identify you as a bad person, so yeah, it helps.
---
I must admit, I have never actually watched him...
---
I just see him get posted a fair bit.
---
&gt;Because the absurdity of paying for literally nothing is strengthened by how the patrons are generally worse off than the person they're donating to.
---
Then make your point that they're not *paying for anything*. Not "poor people giving to the rich", because that is happening in almost every facet of society today, and that they are instead paying for something that was free before they did it, and continues to be free afterwards.
---
Gaming is a hobby not a job. This is like asking if I can watch your favorite tv series now that I work full time.
---
4 days 20 hours (49 minutes but not sure about that one) so we're more in the 5 days territory than 4.
---
Joana said he should be able to make it 4 this time, we'll see.
---
I'm not sure about it, as I heard a few minmaxers saying that a good dw fury war won't have threat issues.
---
The kids can't play 16 hours both on saturday and sunday and 3 hours every mon-friday :)
---
the painful thing is they so clearly were all clearly a little off growing up so now with their power they don’t quiiiite know how to wield it. same as the tech industry. run by a bunch of man baby’s with money
---
I've spent so much time thinking about what I'm going  to role  and my leveling specs that I'm already burned out on the game. I need a break.
---
Not vanilla, but when I first hit cap level in TBC it was from a candy bucket during hallows end lol
---
Very true
---
I'm gonna go ahead and give this reply Silver.
---
Why even talk about it? Game isn't even out yet and with the phases they have planned, there is at least 2 years worth of content.
---
if people can get in trouble to stream sniping then streamers should be able to get in trouble for having my characters in stream without my permission
---
We could make a server list that specifies which server has streamers and which dont

It was released during vanilla, June 2006.
---
&gt;I'd say the most heard is their attitude towards stream sniping: they don't accept this as the downside 
---
You're saying this in response to the thread yesterday. It's interesting though, since people seemed to have a problem with Soda creating a blacklist for people who streamsnipe him. You preach about streamers not accepting the consequences of streaming, yet you have an issue with the consequences of stream sniping.
---
Does RP still exist? I resubbed at the start of BFA and took my free leveling boost on the most populated RP realm.
---
In those 3 months I've never seen a single person RP.
---
This is probably why they are attaching the sub to retail.  Its like leaving a cookie trail leading straight to retail and hoping if people get bored/finished with classic they will at least check out how retail is since they are already subbed anyway (and can play up until most recent xpac).  They don't need classic to be successful forever, they just need to have WoW as a whole be successful whether that is retail, classic, classic+, TBC, WoW2, etc.
---
Yea but this spreadsheet is vs shield tank. Dw tanks are different.
---
No one got a bad reputation in PvE for corpse camping or griefing the opposite faction in pvp. Thats what soda is talking about in this clip.
---
We already know streamers get partial treatment by hundreds if not thousands of people who play with them (i.e. people lining up to give them gold), its reasonable to assume that same partial treatment would happen with a blacklist.
---
Seriously, back in the day why would ANYONE care if you griefed some random from another faction? they wouldn't
---
Hey that was my main realm back in the day
---
Cho'gall represennnnt
---
I kind of get it. Imagine trying to go to school, work, the grocery store, the gas station, wherever, just trying to go about your day. But everywhere you go, there's motherfucking George Clooney. Causing traffic jams, making the lines 5 times longer everywhere, paparazzi always blocking the bathrooms and hallways so you can't just get through your day and go home. You can deal, you can get around it; maybe you just go to the store tomorrow or get a different job where he doesn't show up. But still, and some point you really start to hate George Clooney. One of his movies comes on, Syriana or something, and your eye starts twitching, you wipe away the foam starting to drip from the corner of your mouth. You start posting online about how Clooney is overrated, review bomb his work.
---
I get it.
---
&gt;I'm saying that "pvp on a pvp server" is a term that desribes normal pvp on a pvp server.  
---
Please see below comment.
---
\&gt; All of that is still pvp happening on a pvp server. PvP and cheating are not mutually exclusive as you want to treat them, it's not an xor.
---
The person is not using an unfair or dishonest advantage. They are being provided an advantage by an individual who chooses to expose that information publicly without any recognized or enforceable restriction. It's no more cheating than me telling an opponent "I'm going to pass the ball to my right wing", and then doing just that.
---
I mean it’s an amazing level 35 weapon. Best caster weapon for like 10 levels. Usually sells for hundreds of gold. What is there not to like?
---
I was thinking about this too.  I feel like they'll slowly choke the layers out.  Say there are 10k people between 4 layers.  When they decide they want to turn layers off, whoever logs out on layers 2, 3, and 4 will log back in on layer 1.  
---
They could also do it during a Tuesday reset.  One day you're on layer 3, realm restarts, and then there is only 1 layer.
---
It is, at least on NA. Go to Moon Guard or WRA at the Mage Quarter in SW. For Horde either the Valley of Honor inn or Silvermoon.
---
But like most aspects of BFA, it has been in decline over the past two years.
---
Right? I feel there will be ups and downs, like with most things. I just hope it doesn't dominate a server in a bad way.
---
once classic launches it will have a lot more actual content I'm sure. Just 99% of ppl aren't in beta so they have nothing to do but shitpost
---
OMFG Photobucket, that's where my screenshts are!!
---
Thanks a lot /u/extis83
---
Character name: Asmontrolled. You're welcome
---
Organically created faction rivalries are great and of course no one gets bad reputation from that.
---
If you are however camping someone just because they happen to be a streamer then that's an entirely manufactured reason that exists outside the game. You aren't doing it because they griefed you in game earlier, or their guild ganked your guild on your way to MC or whatever, it's because you're triggered that someone makes money playing a game on the internet.
---
That's not part of the game, that's just people with personality disorders taking it out on other people trying to play the game
---
He never asked for that..... maybe watch the video next time
---
They need more time
---
A good reason to have a Guild Leader (HR) and a Raid Leader as separate people. And then Role/Class leaders below the raid leader to delegate managing their smaller group. Honestly its... a lot like an office.
---
I mean just play without addons, I'm assuming you feel like they give others an advantage which you don't want
---
The most funny/enraging one I had was on Nost where a bunch of Alliance players camping outside of the horde flight point in Felwood which just so happens to be on the edge of a cliff overlooking Darkshore. See screenshot of the Cata variant to get the idea (couldn't find vanilla one) https://gyazo.com/2f05d7aa1b6344307377a1823a54f324 
---
They would then mind control anyone who landed there and MC them and then proceed to jump them off the cliff which results in you dying and spawning your wisp in darkshore. You then have to run from Darkshore all the way back around to felwood, jump off the cliff, spawn again and then try to make your way down the rest of the cliff without dying again which was pretty tricky if you're a class without slowfall. It usually results in another couple of death runs before you reach the bottom of Darkshore alive.
---
People actually do care. That’s why there’s like hundreds of posts about them daily. I think you’re talking about yourself not caring. So say that.
---
xD :P:D
---
Server queues won’t be fun though.
---
I'm going to be facing similar circumstances - full time job, freelancing on the side, and newly engaged. The fiancee is pretty patient with how often I play LoL, so here's hoping she doesn't mind me heavily playing classic for the first few weeks. 
---
That being said, guys like us are going to take 5x as long to hit 60 as the grinders. Just the reality of the situation.
---
Thats just false
---
you missed the point tard
---
I've never used add-ons, so...
---
I agree. People here have such a hate boner for streamers. Using ad hominems to attack their ideas and whining about stream sniping just because of this. Seriously, theres no reason to be mad unless you yourself planned on spending 20 hours a week dedicated to stream sniping. What a life lol.
---
Yeah cause you know me and what I have or haven't cleared.
---
&gt; I've never seen great mage PVP because rogues cut 'em up in one shot
---
Then you have been either willfully blind, or you didn't look.  
---
Well played mages were monsters both in Vanilla PvP and every Private Server:

---
Well im relating it back to the topic at hand, saying that soda didnt claim he wanted that to happen, players beeing banned that is
---
They can just start fresh TBC servers, everyone starts from level 1. Keep classic separate.
---
Who the fuck don't have a job that played classic or BC? Gratz to you if you're not full time but I'm pretty sure 90-plus percent of people have full-time jobs that are going to play. There's probably quite a few on disability
---
I AM NOT PREPARED!
---
You will be more in demand as healer and most groups won’t mind you rolling on gear in dungs, but there will be opportunities to dps.
---
I would recommend making a healer friend and bringing along, no one will mind a balance dps if you have a healer in tow.
---
Rank 13 pvp gear for less blink cd for flag carry, full t2 because it's fun as fuck to use. Naxx gear like everyone else.
---
The true mage end goal is to the rothschild of the server and secretly own everyone due to how rich they are, and how ridiculous their gold per hour rises with gear.
---
Yeah... because it was like 4-5 in the morning after long streams and they were fucking around for hours before hand and talking shit between 6 streamers.
---
That's such an ignorant thing to say though. If somebody goes and watches his stream and then forms a group or a guild and spends all thier time following around a specific player just to ruin the game for them, that is toxic. "Play pve server" does not work as this is his job and his viewers most likely want to watch pvp content. The issue isnt with dying in pvp, its groups and guilds targeting one person just to ruin thier enjoyment.
---
Also why is everybody ok with this kind of targeted harassment? Ya hes streaming, that's his job. Just because hes streaming you should be allowed to harass him? This isnt classic world pvp, this is a bunch of angry jealous people that spend hours upon hours camping one person just to ruin thier fun. Do people seriously lack the empathy to put themselves in the streamers position? Sure he makes lots of money streaming but that means he should deal with hundreds of people using an advantage to camp him? The arguments people are using like "play a pve server" or "just dont stream" are as ignorant as if I were to say to not play on  a server with streamers. Its idiotic.
---
Don't forget: Lame dance.
---
There are a lot of interesting items that are BiS for tank druids, like any ring with +armor, Smoking Heart of the mountain etc. You won't get near enough def rating but getting those rings/necks or the Warden's staff help a lot! After that get stamina and agi (=dodge + more threat)
---
Well many reasons. Makes the game more challenging for everyone thus more skill based. I hope i got people with a less rushy mindset that can take their time. I hate it as a healer that as soon as my mana reaches 80 % the next mobs get pulled in a dungeon. Maybe sometimes i want to write a sentence have to take a shit or roll a smoke. 
---
For me dungeons are to hectic. 
---
New players will be used to addons from day one which imho is a bad thing. It changes the diffuculty of classic and the way you play it for sure. 
---
Like without addons iam raiding.
---
With addons i just stare at 40 healthbars and get nothing on the screen to be seen. 
---
As i said many many reasons. Thats why i just made a neutral little poll to find out if enough people are interested.
---
Seems though like people dont even like this question asked so the downvoted will make sure this doesnt reach many people :(
---
:3
---
Your video is burning crusade era paladins.
---
As someone that pvped like 90% of the time since vanilla to cats as warlock, it really want that bad.
---
They'll probably allow you to make your characters with the names, but you won't be able to actually log into the game.  It's perfect for Blizz, they'll get you to sub a month prior to launch to get your name reserved than sub sometime before or shortly after launch again.
---
I like how you sided the fact that they know your location in stealth.
---
You say that like you can't have a fun time optimizing your leveling.
---
This one was it for me.
---
&gt;The person is not using an unfair or dishonest advantage. 
---
You're objectively wrong. They are gaining an advantage that is not possible inside the game.
---
&gt;All of that is still pvp happening on a pvp server. PvP and cheating are not mutually exclusive as you want to treat them, it's not an xor.
---
Not convinced that pvp will die. Both sides will have über-geared monsters and blue canonfodder. Nothing new.
---
Lowest you can get is the guy who swipes the guild bank and transfers off the server.  Next lowest is the guy who ninja loots raid bosses (before master loot or if they forget to change it, etc).  Stream sniping isn't great but it isn't that horrible either.  It is basically a more advanced version of /who to find the zone someone is in and go kill them (EQ), or just being informed via chat someone is present in X zone and then going there and looking.  Just takes less effort because the streamer is giving them the information directly and painting a target on themself.
---
Okay, so my point still stands. Everyone will be using an add-on that works perfectly for enemy cast bars. So why not just have the UI option?
---
Nah i just wished for a server with no addons. Just vanilla. The way it was ment to be played.
---
No idea what this is for, but not taking blessing of kings is a surefire way for groups to hate you.
---
You might not be able to switch to fury tanking with so much parry : it increases the boss attack speed, might melt your tank.
---
If u dinged 60, why do you still have exp bar?
---
Fuck addons in classic. Let's just automate everything. Half the magic of classic was no handholding.
---
For some farming you put on thorns, round up all your mobs, pop bearskin and maybe a hot, then use hurricane as they melee you
---
I think there are more streamers than there wil be realms. No not every streamer will play together
---
TRAITOR!  All G-nomes are scum and need to die.
---
Leave then. Byeeeeeee
---
This ^
---
The point is that it’s apart of the game. There are tons of things you can do instead of just running around getting taken advantage of. 
---
Lvl a profession
---
Do a diff quest 
---
Go to another zone 
---
Lvl an alt
---
Log off and do something irl for an hr
---
Call upon some higher lvls or group up
---
Post on Reddit and complain about it
---
I personally enjoy watching him (granted I've only know of him for a few weeks) but lately I've seen the behavior that causes people to be upset with him. I'll probably entirely stop watching twitch once the game launches
---
Carbonite was also in Vanilla but like fuck ill be using it in Classic
---
Obviously they shouldnt ban players for PVP.ing and no one as far as i know asked for it. Just like they didnt ban people for ninja looting, but those people had a haaaard time getting in guilds and raids.
---
The reason why people do it is because if they don't, other people will have an advantage over them. You can't just give players the option to do something way easier and they'll choose to do it the hard way, Blizzard has to limit it themselves in order for it not to be possible. Just because you think something shouldn't be in the game doesn't mean you aren't going to abuse it as long as possible. In my honest opinion the only addons that should be allowed would be purely cosmetic UI addons like dragging your bars and easier keybinding, the rest shouldn't be in the game.
---
Um what? I agree with what your saying but what does bfa have to do with blizzard helping community events?
---
Virgin Night Elf Shadow Priest vs Chad Orc Warlock
---
I don't see a huge issue with them finding exploits, mostly because I believe Blizzard will patch them out relatively quickly if they are found in advance.
---
&gt; No, we just didint change the meaning to support him, you say something dumb, you say something dumb. If you say something dumb his community cannot say "it was not because i'm fanboi."
---
Exept the fact that most people DID base their opinion around this whole topic because of a post that contained a heavily edited video called "COMMUNIST GAMER SODAPOPPIN UNVEILS PLANS TO RUIN THE SPIRIT OF CLASSIC WOW" (how the fuck can anyone take a video with that title 100% serious): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk) instead of watching the whole vod where he actually explains what he means by "blacklisting a stream sniper".
---
He wants to blacklist those wo OBVIOUSLY stream snipe (following him around, killing him 24/7 even when he's in stealth, doing what that one tauren did in the tourney and so on...). He has absolutely nothing against world pvp, getting killed or people camping him because he will do it himself.
---
And by blacklisting he means he wants to alert his friends, who most likely will also be in top guilds to not play with said stream sniper. People talk about that Soda has to endure the consequences of him streaming his gameplay. Stream snipers need to accept the fact that they have to live with the consequences of them trying to ruin someones experience in the game.
---
If you think blacklisting is something that shouldn't exist you most likely weren't around when classic was released.
---
&gt; People who play retail 24/7 are not going to be compareable to people who played classic these last 10 years 24/7. 
---
I clarified this in another comment of mine https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxsmnd/hating_streamers_is_alright_as_long_as_youre/eq9o5em/
---
This is so sad Alexa play despacito

why the hate on streamers?

---
nothing eclipse the legendaries
---
also considering this is a Classic server why would people not farm the hell out of Naxx?
---
Can't we just keep Classic?  I'd like to be able to take a break, do my life things, come back, and have the same game.
---
Well the way it's meant to be played is subjective and there have always been addons since they were discovered and given the green light
---
Funny how people get so triggered over shit and feel the need to bitch instead of just continuing to scroll past a post they aren't going to contribute to.
---
Clearly you didn't read my post.
---
Because Blizzard can just disable the ability to create ECB addons via the API.
---
Nice one :)
---
All of this is major yikes.
---
Mages had Invisibility in Warcraft 2 before Rogues were even a concept. Water Elementals were also a thing in WC3. Mage Invisibility also works mechanically different than Stealth. 
---
What you call a mistake, I call healthy progression forward. WoW's biggest downfall wasn't adding more stuff, but pruning stuff - once they started pruning, they started removing flavor that made classes unique. Adding Cloak of Shadows didn't make Rogue less unique, it made them more unique. In fact, it made them so unique guilds wanted to stack Rogues when possible because being able to Cloak of Shadows out of mechanics was a huge utility to raids. 
---
Your post is a perfect example of how players know how they feel about things ("modern WoW classes feel too similar to each other") but they're absolutely terribly wrong about articulating it.
---
Two weeks of play time is the equivalent of $7.50. I’m going to spend more than that on lunch today. If you don’t want to, don’t. You’re not getting an advantage by having the name you want...
---
It’s to better recognize how many players they’re going to have on release day and have a better understanding of how stressed the servers will be. 
---
I’m not sure how you can say this is “disgusting.”
---
You've thought a lot about this topic, but couldn't be bothered to use the search function at least once to check out ten million fucking posts about the same thing. Way to go champ
---
I know that's a saying, but what's so amazing about sliced bread?
---
You didn't say that.
---
[Bolt And Screws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chc9DwDkWn0)
---
There is no fundamental difference between an addon that tells you where to go to kill quest mobs and the same functionality being built in.
---
&gt;Questhelper from Blizzard --&gt; Noooooooooo, it will destroy WoW classic, I will not play it if they make it
---
&gt;Questhelper addon --&gt; Cool, great addon, used it back then also
---
Pretty sure we won’t have loot have the window to be traded that’s present in retail.
---
What about barkskin ? That would be huge.
---
Yeah but if enough people would want it why not make a server with them being disabled? Hurts noone you know what i mean?
---
Most people won't step foot in naxx. Most people won't down a boss in AQ40
---
Not really, I know that the base game with no changes is good and works and isn't intrusive, I also know I can download addons for the things I think make the game more enjoyable.
---
I don't trust Blizzard not to add in bad features if given the go ahead by the playerbase, so by screaming like a autist for no changes I know I can fill in the gaps myself and don't have to rely on Blizzard not to fuck it up (Which they would)
---
I am not sure why I torture myself and continue to read these posts, I never thought of myself as a sadomasochist.
---
Is the primary income of this farm spot gray items then?
---
He's also recruiting people that were in top guilds on private servers.
---
There is no such thing as "the definition of harassment".
---
What constitutes harassment is determined by the rules governing a society. In most western nations, slapping a female waitress on the ass is considered harassment, and is likely prosecuteable. However, there are plenty of countries with underdeveloped female rights, where such behavior is perfectly normal, and completely legal.
---
Similarly, what constitutes harassment in a videogame, is determined by the rules set forth by the games provider.
---
Yeah I was asking purely dungeons and maybe gold farming. But maybe world pvp should be considered, too, since I’ll play on a pvp Server and pvp might occur while happening.
---
I can kill a whole group, as long as everyone is 5% hp. Im just saying this guy acts like though, but i think he would get whooped by soda.
---
Who is the monster forcing you to click those posts discussing streamers? You should to something about that!
---
I have PTSD of only white hit / wanding forever on Onyxia. We had a shit MT though.
---
You cant have it both ways. You cant say a change is good while advocating for no changes. I mean, technically you can, but nobody will take your opinion for real. Which id exactly what I am going to do now. Good day sir.
---
Nothing better than stomping Emote spammers in HS or MTG:Arena.. even better to Elderspell 4 Planeswalkers and then start spamming Good Game! myself.
---
I played with addons in vanilla so realistically if I want a similar experience I will have some add ons.
---
Classic is a calling. no more no less.
---
I am a huge fan of Frost and a couple other streamers that really show they have a passion for the game and don’t give a fuck how many views they get, or fans they have. I have seen Frost get help from other players in the beta (not that it is a bad thing) and when other streamers, lets say Tipsout, gets help, people make a huge deal of it and through this somehow justify streamsniping against these people.
---
Conversely, when Tipsout gets streamsniped (not necessarily just his whereabouts, but other information that gives the ganker an unfair advantage) it is completely fine for some people. I don’t like the double standard when it comes to a point where blatantly cheating against some people is justified because you dislike him. This amount of hate and toxicity is just as bad, if not worse, than the amount of toxicity that people attribute to streamers.
---
I noticed it now, though the restrictions were higher than later on.
---
If subscribers go up largely in part due to Classic, I don't see why they wouldn't at least look into moving into the expansions, TBC and WotLK at the very least considering WotLK was their ultimate peak in the eyes and minds of many players. Keep in mind, they said they have ways to track what game subscribers are playing, and they plan on tracking that data.
---
I'm not a game developer, but I'd think that TBC and WotLK would take less time and work to get up and running at an acceptable state considering the content/worlds for each of those expansions went somewhat untouched when compared to the vanilla content.
---
I agree 100% though that whatever they do, as long as they run new servers or allow character copies of some kind, I'd be on board. Progressing a character up through expansions has been nice over the years, but I know it's not for everyone. Some people want to play only vanilla forever, and I respect that.
---
UD female allows you to loot DM books in two locations without aggroing mob packs
---
Holy moly people are obsessed with streamers in here
---
Can confirm. Leveling a druid in retail now hoping to curve some of my hype. It has only gotten worse.
---
Hootie the legend
---
A friend and I have played Druid / Priest for years, both realizing we’re going to be stuck healing for a while but it’ll be worth it once we’re geared.
---
But this will result in the same rotation of spamming frostbolt with the exception of POM+AM every 3min, wouldn’t it?
---
When did I state that changes were good?
---
Wow is literally unplayable without the Peggle addon.
---
This is the same guy who when after Classic was announced went on the podcast with Hotted/Asmon/Rich and was proclaiming such ideas as "phasing for streamers" because it was going to be impossible to level with the amount of people following him.... as well as other subtle tweaks to the game that more or less benefitted him entirely.
---
Love the guy but it's pretty obvious he is just like anybody else who wants the game catered to his needs and (I would hope) Blizz knows better than to cater to anything like this.
---
Yes, streaming wasnt prevelant in classic but that's not a problem for Blizz to worry about it. 
---
Asmon makes similar complaints but I'm pretty sure he does that 99% of the time to bait chat which people dont get about his stream that he is just a big shit disturber.
---
There is a petition on change.org and a forum post. Add your support to both. Let’s make some noise and get us an RP PVP server.
---
I’d play shaman if you’re looking for a healer. Windfury is always sick with a warrior partner and there will be a ton of shaman brought to every raid for buffs and raid heals. Priest is never a wrong choice either though, I just always loved the tribal horde feel of shaman. Just don’t get that with a priest.
---
the way you think it was meant to be played 
---
addons have always been around
---
It was a Vanilla bug. Until you zone or reload or relog, your exp bar will remain.
---
The first ever time I've seen it..
---
thanks for the challenge!
---
propably about 50 times. but the best was the stair-event 😍
---
What? I'm saying the naxx and AQ gear eclipse the PvP items.
---
No dps or threat meter? no thanks. Other than those two addons i see where you're coming from. There needs to be measurements to ensure the players that need help improving are identified
---
You can’t search characters under level 10. GZ.
---
Nothing. I mean we got pve/pvp and rp- pvp/pve servers already. Dark age of Camelot once had a server where the opposite forces could play together but that went BAD.
---
Maybe you know, just enjoy the game? How much of your life you actually want to dedicate for this
---
Barkskin causes a GCD so unfortunately you can't instantly pop it and shift back into form. You can still take advantage of bosses with slow swing timers to use it though.
---
I think thats when the slippery slope arguments appear.  If you think about it current wow is the 15 year summation of player feedback.  Sure many things were original ideas added into the game but there are a lot of quality of life stuff that probably started as a forum post somewhere.
---
It's more of a lynch mob but you do you
---
just dont use addons???
---
I think I might have run it after this lol
---
A good solution to the "power creep" would be to add side raids to each tier. Players will have option to do whatever raid for that tier and still have progression viable for established guilds and having more raids to gear up new players without having to make any of the raids obsolete.
---
Oh I thought the Reserve character name was on August 3rd like you said, I guess it's the 13th.  My bad.
---
So any rogue or druid, walking around in stealth looking for random people to gank will always be called stream snipers? Nice to know.
---
I think its just like modding? They just need to close access to that part of the game.
---
Stop arguing about this as if it's factual, these are opinions you dingus. My opinion is not wrong, you just disagree.
---
Decurse was a huge part of vanilla what are you talking about?
---
Haha and I leveled as protection mainly because apparently I hate myself
---
whats the addon at the edge of the screen??
---
&gt; We can talk about what should happen post Naxx. What is the future of this game.
---
Good luck with that. People will be mad at you for discussing the same stuff they allready discussed. Like, how dare you
---
They won't have issues holding threat, but by putting one in you are sacrificing an entire fury warrior worth of dps. Meanwhile, the OT prot warrior that you brought instead of a druid goes into a dps slot, and does piss-nothing.
---
If you bring a druid though, he is tankier than the fury warrior, and does more damage than the prot during fights he isn't tanking. Combined with the 3% crit for all your top melee, this is massive net gain for the raid over time.
---
23/0/28 build is also a decent healing raid spec, because of the mana regen.
---
I would consider myself accomplished if I can get double trinket and hit 5k ap pom pyros in warsong gulch.  I want to be a god every 3 mins and a free HK the rest of the time i dont care.
---
You'll probably have a hard time getting raid gear for balance stuff regardless of what you play, but an easier time seeing raids as a resto.
---
Think of it like this; why should the 8 mages pass on loot theyve been waiting weeks for so a druid can take it? or a resto druid? Yea druid can get that loot and should have a fair shot at it too if they show up and do their shiz, but being realistic and fair - that look is going to be much harder for you to get.
---
&gt; You're objectively wrong. They are gaining an advantage that is not possible inside the game. They are dishonestly using a means outside of the game to gain an advantage that you cannot gain fairly within the game. It's literally no different than installing a bot.
---
&gt; 
---
I'm sorry but you're factually incorrect, once again. For the third time.
---
If you provide your playbook on a public dropbox, it's no ones fault but your own. If you have information you want kept private, you keep it private. If you expose information in a public forum, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The same as having your picture taken walking down the street, by willfully engaging within the public domain you give up that right within the legal and social constructs of our society.
---
&gt; He's not telling anyone anything. People are seeking out the information.
---
He's literally broadcasting publicly what he is currently doing and talks about what they would/will/could do. There are tools to obfuscate this, such as delays, and they are choosing to not utilize them.
---
&gt; If I'm holding cards and my opponent walks behind me and looks at my hand, that the same as someone going out and seeking his stream.
---
Your analogy is incorrect. It's you holding your cards out for everyone to see and then getting mad when people use information that you provided to give themselves an advantage. They didn't have to look up, but they did, and you're responsible for exposing that information to the public.
---
you need a healer
---
priest or shammy will do
---
Its not just about me its about all on the server. Otherwise i wouldnt ask for a server ?
---
I don't think that it is an unpopular opinion that the game peaked in Wrath. Not every change was a positive one, but it was still better overall (at least imo). Especially when Arena in TBC+Wrath was the most fun I have ever had in WoW.
---
Therefore, I think progressing to Wrath would be a very viable option. The only trick is do you go 1:1 to wrath and then do you abandon the game after wrath? Restart to vanilla? New wrath content?
---
Is an elemental spec maybe viable in dungeons? Usually doing fire dps but also being able to do good frostbolt dps against fire resistant mobs?
---
If you put your steam online for people to see then you are fair game for stream sniping, don't stream iclassic wow if you cannot handle streaming classic wow, idk what is so crazy about that.  Stream snipers need to accept the fact that they have to live with the consequences of them trying to ruin someones experience in the game. No, because one man gets but hurt we have to change the rules for everyone else playing, thats fucking stupid mate... You don't change the hight of a basketball net because you have a short guy on the team. It is exactly how great games become shitty, people like you who think that the few top should represent the whole of the community.
---
Your argument for the second consists of, they are good at this other game so they will be the best in this other game, would not hold up to a 5 year old. 
---
Thirdly I will just quote these three points soyou can refute them instead of ignoring them.
---
&gt;Their piles of fanbois will barely reach 12, because theyre too busy just following them around, people are going to be tag stealing from them all day every day, people are going to be going after them via pvp all day and they'll likly be much higher in lvl due to not being slowed down the whole way by 100s of people
---
can i ask what professions u think is good in classic for a shadow priest? and with money with it :)
---
&gt;I've never seen a high warlord/grand marshal (can't remember alliance rank 14 title) that was a mage. I've never seen great mage PVP because rogues cut 'em up in one shot and warlocks shut down their offense completely. And shadow priests, of course, melt their face. It's even more dire if they're an alliance mage going against OP horde racials. And their endgame gear is terrible.
---
&gt;So you can't be the best in PVP and in most raids you're gonna be a water and food vending machine who hits frostbolt over and over.
---
&gt;So with those truths self-evident, what IS the endgame goal for a mage?
---
What am I even reading? Is *one word* of this based on personal experience? XD
---
to clarify, i don't have any intention of doing this. Fully intend to be as far away from streamers as possible :)
---
I've been waiting for this thread. I left WoW in TBC and when I came back guilds had basically been rendered completely pointless.
---
Former Vanilla guild leader of a top 3 Horde guild on a high pop server. At one time we were running 3 MC raids, 2 BWL, and 3 ZG with Ony here and there every single week. We were, in my opinion, the top Horde PVP guild on our server although another guild did have one set group that was objectively better. I hosted/adminned our website, forum, DKP site, and ponied up for the Ventrilo. My tenure was only a year but I was drafted into it and came away with some lessons. Take all this with a grain of salt because it's been 15 years and my intention was never to be a leader. I did enough of that in the Army and I just wanted to enjoy the game.
---
1. People don't understand the hours that it takes to make a **successful** guild and when you explain it to most people they think that you're doing it wrong even though they've never done it. It's a lot like doing a show on radio/TV in that what you see when a guild leader logs in is just the result, not all the hours behind the scenes preparing for when you log in. I would spend all day shooting emails back and forth or on our guild forum(also used as a defacto server forum by other members of the Horde) while going to school and working. It did not stop until I quit the game.
---
2. People in games get a lot more personal, and as you would expect, much less professional than real life. When you have a full guild, an alt guild, and multiple sister guilds that partner with you 95% of the people will be reasonable but that's still a significant number of issues every single night.
---
3. The problems are not simple. Try explaining to someone in your guild that they need to take a backseat to another person in your sister guild for a raid because those people put in the hours it took to make it successful. People can get livid. We had amazing PVPers in our guild. The grind for High Warlord back in the day necessitated account sharing and afk'ing in AV. We had rules against both and enforced those rules. I guarantee you there are people reading this who think that's pants on head crazy and don't understand why we would punish that when "everyone's doing it". A little pro tip: everyone on our server who did make High Warlord/Grand Marshall was so burnt out and disgusted with the grind that they quit permanently within a month of making it, most within a week. It was not worth the headache. I would never tell anyone how to play a video game and I would not let someone dictate me or our officers how to run our guild. If they wanted to do something against the rules they could do it someplace else.
---
I will not be a guild leader or officer again. To the people who will sacrifice their time to make the game a richer experience and much more fun for others: thank you.
---
It's happened on quite a few private servers. For some reason people don't enjoy getting smashed by guys in full epics, for rewards that are worse than the ones they are getting owned by. 
---
Weird.
---
That's so evil
---
Isn't letting the BFA crew make new content for classic more than just going down the path that got us BFA? Or are we under the impression that the tiny classic crew is enough to make new content from scratch? Once we start adding new content, the whole nochanges thing goes out the window too. 
---
I just feel like there is so much they can fuck up with new vanilla content that they just couldn't by making faithful TBC. I don't trust blizzard to navigate that minefield.
---
Impressive in scale, novelty and challenge!
---
No oops, just mixing up dates.
---
yes lets all get a server with our own personal rules....
---
Most guilds wont get past Vael in BWL. A guild that clears Naxx is cool and all, but at that point you should go find another game
---
... you mean Saltridge?
---
Yeah but specially DPS/threat meter i dont like very much. I play lots of older MMOS and people just know when they cause to much aggro or simply have to wait a few seconds more before they can join the fight with their legendary weapon =)
---
I'm serious too. Vanilla was about swinging your dick around and saying you were the best, showing off your gear, you're deluded if you don't think cosmetic rewards wouldn't matter to people.
---
cool story really, but emm what's the point exactly?
---
Waited wayyy too long for this to load
---
I'd put at least one point in Nature's Gras´p and one in Nature's Grace if you want to PvP as well
---
Exactly. Any new content would be 1.14 or in that case when a new expansion comes out 2.0.
---
Well that was the only other option given by the OP besides "being salty for not receiving a beta invite."
---
Sounds like the people running behind live TV reporters
---
Amazing
---
This post is obviously a troll. You guys posting "umm... Atiesh..." you fell for it.
---
&gt; The way it was ment to be played.
---
Addons have always been a core feature in wow and Vanilla and Vanilla had way more powerful addons than you can make in Classic.
---
I dont see myself enjoying leveling on the beta just to restart in august
---
Dude where are you from ? \^\^
---
Yeah but when WoW came out and the way quests were designed and all that they didnt have addons in mind. Or in other mmos getting aggro is a skill of knowledge. Now just looking at a threatmeter. In other mmos you know when its time to make damage and when not in terms of aggro. Makes people way more aware to their surroundings on their class.
---
Ok, so you would arbitrarily draw a line at what you want and everyone else be damned? Let's all get polls up for the kind of server we'd like to see.
---
Sorry if I'm being a dick, but I'm sure you realize you sound pretty darn silly right now.
---
WPL
---
&gt;Wouldn’t it be more fun with more viable specs?
---
No, it wouldn't.
---
Classic was a great game precisely BECAUSE not everything was balanced, streamlined and optimized to a degree where classes are just differently colored variations of one another.
---
Look at what we have today. [BfA is probably the most balanced version of WoW](https://www.noxxic.com/wow/dps-rankings/) we ever had.
---
Is it more fun? No.
---
When everyone is the same, why have classes in the first place? In Vanilla, I could play my Warlock and feel completely different from a Mage, even though we were both dps casters. Nowadays, my Warlock and Mage are so completely similar, that I have the same keybound layout for them, because they have almost exactly the same set of skills.
---
----
---
Bottom line:
---
Not everything needs to be balanced.  
---
Not everything needs to make sense.  
---
An RPG game is not great because of perfect balance.
---
That specific spot in Desolace is SOOOO vanilla WoW. So much shit goes down there due to it being a bottle neck for Horde and Alliance.
---
Tailoring is always nice for clothies to make your own gear. Plus you make a shit ton of money off of selling bags. I believe the two specializations you can choose are moon cloth and ebonweave? I think moon cloth was more for bags and practical stuff and ebonweave was more about gear. I think moon cloth was the money maker though
---
Why would we not have the classic crew making classic + content? who is suggesting we use the bfa team to make classic + content? Like is there literally a single person suggesting this?
---
Why exactly do streamers who decide to play WoW get so much shit exactly?
---
Doesn't matter if they're "normal."  
---
Who dates/marries for "normal?"
---
[Yea where do people get the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naZxqOIbyps)
---
Cosmetics in a game without transmogging. Well that already sounds like a waste of bag space to me.
---
subverting the topic of this post, are we?

The jealousy is insane, you are literally lying. Is it because he makes more in a month that you make in 5 years?
---
Great list, thanks!
---
Thanks so much!
---
you cannot read? RUN ACROSS THE WHOLE MAP TO GRIEF YOU just cause you turned on stream. it is NOT RANDOM at all
---
mage is the strongest class in pvp, pve, gold farming and boosting capabilites. your view of mages is really uninformed. Also the strongest racial against mages is escape artist, hence why some hardcore warriors are opting to roll gnome come classic. idk why you even made this post, it's as if you've never actually played the game.
---
Thankyou!!
---
You’re right, this isn’t rocket surgery guys.
---
To be fair, D2 was never a monthly sub game. It is still played but nothing was done about the bots and item selling. Even with no new content, D2 would have been stronger if Blizz actually cared about the bots, op items, and overall spamming that goes into that game.
---
&gt; Just cuz you stream doesn’t mean you should get different experiences.
---
sure, except they can just NOT stream if they want the same experience
---
really sounds like a you problem....
---
we dont need a server for your hang ups
---
To use your paladin as an example:
---
Prot paladins have mana issues, no taunt and no good itemization.
---
So you want blizzard to introduce some sort of mana regen that doesn't fuck with the already OP holy paladins, you want a taunt, and you want raid gear changed so that you have competitive gear?
---
That's a buttload of things that needs to be changed.
---
Soda was first taking off? U mean like 10 years ago? When he was 14 year old and you complain about hims screenching like a kid, not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
Well most guilds did not get past Vael back then.
---
Right now we have people that played the same game for 15 years. There's going to be quite a difference between people that will play Classic then and people that raided in the years the game launched. Just look at videos back then and be amased at the amount of clickers.
---
It's already not the same as it was engine wise, so those purist are already kind of fucked, and no it wouldn't hurt, cosmetics only hurt snowflakes
---
So jealousy?
---
Well my point is this: if you go out of your way to monitor someones stream to specifically grief that person, you are doing something wrong. No matter if he is choosing to or forced to broadcast it. A lot of streamers do this as a living, so it is more than a choice in reality.
---
No changes
---
Not happening in Vanilla / Classic though.
---
I just don’t see how it could be harder. Boss damage is seemingly much lower as is health. Unless something changes in the next few months, theres no way it’ll be harder than pservers. Nostalgic players yeah, everyone sucked back then so it all seemed hard
---
Vanilla is meant to be played with addons.
---
No, I have a knife ;D
---
I mean nobody asked you or cares why you're on a PvE realm, but thanks for the blog post
---
&gt;Just vanilla. 
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
Not only did we have addons in Vanilla, the addons back then were so incredibly powerful, they would get you permabanned for cheating in 2019.
---
Want an example?
---
"Healbot"...a must have for raiding healers back then. Things it could do included, but were not limited to:
---
* Auto-Targeting
---
* Auto-interrupting casts based on target HP
---
* Automatic spell selection based on target class and current HP
---
* Auto interruption and re-casting if priority target HP fell below trigger %
---
And those are just the ones I remember.
---
Essentially, it was exactly what the name implied: A bot. You configured it, bound the activation macro to a single hotkey, and then spammed that one key for the entire raid.
---
And no, this was not illegal back then.
---
Personal preference.  Its going to come down to introverts vs extraverts I would guess.  If a socially awkward introvert has to “perform” at work or with friends all day they are most likely not going to want to be social in their down time.  
---
It could be a comms vs typing thing.  I have never had an issue with typing in a game but I don’t always want to voice chat.  This is more apparent in console games, bosses with 1-2 mechanics people freak out about coordination, its dramatic.
---
Maybe just bad experiences overall?  90% of my warcraft play was pleasant in regards to human interaction but the few years I was into league of legends?  Same team chat made me not even want to play most days and it generally wasn’t even directed at me.
---
Yeah it is, but you can post your idea in /r/classicwowplus if you want. Don't know how active that sub is though.
---
&gt; DPS is when a warrior wins
---
You don't replace a fury warrior with a druid, you replace a prot warrior OT. In that context, druid does way more dps.
---
Not entirely but should be fine.
---
Yeah I agree. Advertising and drawing attention to your own product will only harm your product. It would be better if their product would be kept secret for the producers only.
---
Which isnt enough as evidenced by everyone leveling in SM instead if out in the world. They’re literally ‘sharding’ themselves so they dont have to deal with others.
---
Here to support the cause!
---
Blizzard should have RPPvP for the loyal fanbase!
---
You personally think making the original Classic raids unavailable for guild progression was a good thing?
---
Are you also under the impression that people that will play Classic now will not want to do Molten Cire?
---
There's that guy who currently has a $1500 bid to rent his account until August 27.
---
um your poll has 4 yes votes total so far.....
---
Here is the thing i never used addons in classic and i went through all the content. I never wiped anyone or anything in that regard. 
---
Iam as far away from a burden as you can be.
---
The second photo is from early Warcraft 3 artwork. Figured why not include it. First photo is from early launch..was probably not even lvl 10 yet.
---
Ahh, the zone where I'll be grinding my last 2 levels probably... good times
---
Pretty much yeah. I purged and deleted all my social media accounts 3 years ago. Still, the regulation of the internet cannot be avoided it seems.
---
It takes all of 2-3 hours to hit 10. Will we even get in in that time? Considering Blizzard gives early access to streamers (heavy /s)
---
Any Rogue and Mage/Warlock.    Mainly cause you'll be happily doing your own crap keeping the mage/lock in your eyes when suddenly you hear the sap or cheap shot  of the rogue that you failed to detect, then while youre sitting there, stunned and at their mercy the rogue circles around you jumping and /lol while the mage powers up his massive fireball or the lock starts loading you with dots.    You know you're already dead and  just waiting for the inevitable corpse walk back.
---
I was looking at this way to long waiting for this to load.
---
&gt;It's you holding your cards out for everyone to see
---
He isn't holding cards out f or everyone to see. People have to SEEK OUT THE INFORMATION. Why are you acting as if he is forcing a broadcast of his stream into every single persons computer who plays wow lol
---
You're being very un-charactical right now buddy...cut it out
---
Hell, I should rent my account
---
I’m sure on launch there will be a group of valiant soldiers who log in to every realm and /who streamers until they find them, coming back to report on Reddit after.
---
Are you a friend or family memeber to a Blizzard employee? They may have submitted your account for beta access. 
---
There are a few people who got access this week on Blizzard employee F&amp;F invites.
---
Thank you u/Forenx 
---
Haha we just can't have anything nice, cause there is always some ass who will complain.
---
Under 10 posts there unfortunately, but i'll do that, thanks.
---
Use that money to get a life
---
Who da fuck is this sodapoppin and why do we care ?
---
&gt;undergeared and unprepared
---
great name for a guild ;)
---
No problem. A lot of people pair it with enchanting but usually enchanting is a bit investment before you see some returns. If you want money quick I'd say go with any gathering profession and just sell all your ore, herbs, skins etc
---
Good luck on your server with 7 whole people on it.
---
But why?
---
You stay in darkshore from 12 to 17. Not just a level. Then you do Loch Modan from 17 to 18.
---
Also on launch that will be even better, as less people will be there. Westfall and Loch Modan dont scale well right when you finish Elwynn.
---
I will be going for something similar.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqLuMgkxVGzI0u
---
I'm not too bothered about not having holy shield as it can be quite mana intensive I believe and is not necessary for 5 mans
---
I'm primarily focused on being a heal/support class that can do some tanking 5 mans and heal in pvp. I picked up improved wisdom and kings for support, got BoSanctuary and threat/shield talents for tanking, and then reduced interupts and improved Concentration Aura for PvP.
---
I don't think I'll be playing this spec until battlegrounds come out in phase 2, so I'll probably be something similar without the PvP talents until then.
---
Hell, I should rent my account for that kind of money
---
The looking for group channel being used warms my heart.
---
I love how people don’t understand that Private Servers aren’t the same as Classic in a lot of ways.  Population density will change the way people act.
---
I think you are ignoring the fact that some people have fun min maxing.  There is no wrong way to play the game.  
---
If you like to take your time and explore it all and just experience it, more power to you.  If you like to rush content and go for world firsts, that's cool too.  If you like to hide in the tram with a dwarf and a night elf female priest, getting naked and sending E-RP tells, that's cool too.
---
People have fun doing different things.  I personally will be skipping some spells until I can afford my mount.  Then when I'm 60 going back and picking them up.  I like having my mount asap, because riding a raptor is more fun to me than having binoculars.
---
I hate when that red arrow pops up on my head. Hunter.
---
It actually doesnt even take that.  I sometimes log in from a different PC than my main one, and the stress test ran waaaaaaaaaaay better than the game did in Legion/does now.  The assets just arent nearly as 'complex' (much less detail).
---
Only decent raid tanks in classic are Warriors tho\*
---
&gt;cosmetics only hurt snowflakes
---
Is this really how you speak? Do you notice people around you not taking you seriously?
---
Sketchy memory of course, but in Vanilla it was most definitely not worth hundreds of gold by a long mile (on my server at least).
---
I would say with that combo go with an elemental shaman. You won't be fighting over any gear with any of your friends.  As a bonus you won't have to carry a healing set. Plus it seems like you want to roll a shaman anyways.
---
&gt;we are just having a bit of fun
---
Yes, and I tried to participate in that fun, that's why I used the word "**SUB**verting"
---
Thanks for ruining it.
---
Dark age of Camelot but i stopped retail there too. Iam on a private server now =) Daoc Phoenix.. its similar to what classic wow does. 
---
I played eve online a lot. Freeshards for WoW. Rift a bit of LODRO/jumpgate.
---
Tons of warhammer online =)
---
Lots of other too but only for a bit because they lacked what my classic games offered.
---
It is known.
---
WPL was mentioned but you can go wherever you have mobs that drop what you need, even things as wool cloth that may be in under-supply or farming that winter night chest piece recipe in Winterspring from elites. It's mixing single target with AoE farming but still :)
---
They already said they will be on the same server, dont be on that server problem solved, dont have to whine about it
---
people are weird man,
---
they want to go back in time and not everyone wants to do that
---
almost everyone wants to experience the old way which i think a lot of people agree is more about the community aspect and the lack of ease that creates that atmostphere and forces you to explore and interact.
---
if they completely recreated the game in the unreal engine with modern graphics I would be perfectly happy in fact I would prefer it as it doesn change the game feel at all just lets new people enter the game.
---
Always, there should be a toggle for new and old graphics, wouldn't hurt a soul
---
So you still decided that you had to call people that are "salty" immature to make your point? That seems very mature, very.
---
you so dumb haha
---
I can give you few links for couple good schools, because it seems you are utterly stupid or just trolling.
---
What part of the conversation you didnt understand? I explained what i ment about the word and you are stuck on ''give me link from a dictionary'' I dont have a link from dictionary, because as i stated before the word is not correct. 
---
It actually kills me inside when trying to explain this over and over to you.
---
If you think gold is going to be that easy to come by you're going to be in for a rude awakening.
---
Hell yeah! Chuckknoris of chogall here too!
---
Cries in rogue
---
yeah everything he said not to do are things I think of when I think of a casual player lol
---
Actually I have a lot of friends that enjoy TBC or Wrath more than Vanilla and I myself would enjoy playing up until Cata. Then you need to count the people where TBC or Wrath were their first time playing WoW and they too want to go back to that nostalgia, in all there are probably arguments for doing all expansions but myself I can only see the up to Wrath being successful.
---
Literal autism is why
---
Honestly I'd love to make hundreds of thousands a year streaming at 20 and retire at like 25,not sure how anyone would prefer a real Job over that
---
Priest means armor drops will be pretty clearly defined, and you maximize your group’s chances of using drops. (If that matters to you.) You guys could form the core of a 5 man group, and could elect to 3 man dungeons if you wanted.
---
Hope they enjoy the several guilds dedicated to stream sniping, which they created by being such vocal babies.
---
I know that you could at some point pay for your character to stop levelling. Does someone know if that was already part of Vanilla? What did it cost?
---
I love all zones in vanilla
---
Isn’t voting on stuff like this kind of a divisive tool to say look this many people don’t like A or B? Is it really necessary to have an entire server to feel comfortable and secure?
---
Isn’t referring to a website with info on the quests, or dungeons, or what ever you can’t find when your stuck, a little similar? Why don’t we find away to remove all the info on this game from the internet? Kind of ridiculous huh?
---
How does someone using a mod on the server you play on effect you? Why not just make a guild that uses no addons and only play with them?
---
How I will look
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WgvTgV5EoGY/maxresdefault.jpg
---
So far my poll is in the yes area though and iam for certain not the only one. So its not a ME problem.
---
Its not even a problem overall. Either there is enough people interested and blizzard thinks its a good either or not.
---
Its not like we guys wont play classic if there is no such server.
---
im a dumbass....
---
Subhuman really
---
It might seem with your IQ that OP murdered him, in fact he didnt.
---
You took me seriously enough to respond, and it's not my business as to what others think of me, now is it?
---
There is no shame. And as an original vanilla player i can confirm that good world pvp is largely a myth.
---
World PVP is basically one of three thing
---
1) getting ganked by a rogue when you're on 50% hp fighting a mob
---
2) getting ganked by a large group of enemies
---
3) getting ganked by a much higher level.
---
In most scenarios it's an unfair fight where you basically just get ganked. Sometimes you get awesome world pvp but it was rare.
---
I seriously hope not. 
---
All names should be available for everyone at the same time.
---
Anything else would be some disgusting privilege shit.
---
People here seems to be alergic to non-addon mindset. Prepare to receive lots of bad manners lol
---
I'm divided, because I like some addons (the ones to make your UI clear and alike), but at the same time I agree that game would be more challenging without Meters and Raid alerts and more inmersive without all those spell alerts weak auras.
---
If you really believe that then you might have trouble playing and working. Just need to accept it for what it is, a game for your enjoyment.
---
Mush
---
Private servers aren't an absolute carry over I will agree. They are more than likely a good estimation of how the playerbase will react to things tho. 
---
You may be right if we consider cross realm battle grounds being a thing. PvP will have a large drop off towards the later end of the game tho. I don't see how anybody could argue against that. The rewards won't be updated.
---
Firstly, LOL to Prot Pally in Vanilla, secondly without taking blessing LOL to getting into any group ever as a Pally.
---
Don't underestimate the power of internet trolls. For every player who wants to help a streamer there could be one that wants to see them fail miserably.
---
Just because it is a video game does not mean you don’t need to hold moral responsibility for your actions in the game. With your rationale you can spam hate speech and offend people because “iTs jUsT a ViDeO GaMe BruH”.
---
"Here ya go, pawtner."
---
Ditto
---
I should have clarified, not on Twitch. (I do stream there, of course, but it's just a hobby for me). Instead, I made my living on another website. You'll notice there's almost a full year of inactivity in the year 2017 on my twitch channel.  
---
So what site was this? There used to be this site that was up in 2017 &amp; 2018 called StreamMe. They had a monthly contest, and 1st - 10th place for that contest would get anywhere from $400 - $2500 each month. For about a year straight in 2017, I was placing 3rd or 4th consistently, so I was bringing home an extra $900ish every month in addition to the job I had. The contest factored in how long you streamed, how many people were watching, how active your chat was, and a bunch of other stuff. It was a lot of fun!  
---
From there, in November of 2017, I tried doing it full time because I had a bunch of money saved up in case anything went south. It payed off for the first 3 months, I made $2000 solid each month, and the cost of living &amp; food where I resided was very cheap. Given my monthly expenditure was $800 total, I was able to budget this and live very comfortably.  
---
About 4 months into this (February 2018) they changed the way the contest worked, and to put it bluntly, there were people "farming" this contest by setting up AFK radio station streams and chat bots. I was not able to place nearly as high as I did because of these two factors. The admins didn't step in, and just kept letting the contest go.  It was at this point I began to seek other career options. I had a good net of funds saved up in case this happened, so I wasn't too worried about it.  
---
Soon after, the site got invaded by some crazy alt-righters and almost every single stream on the site was an afk contest farming stream. It was April of 2018 when I left the site and had found the career I'm still at today, and I've never been happier.  
---
StreamMe doesn't exist anymore - the site actually got shut down because the site owners got in some legal trouble for being a money laundering front (How else would they fund their contest? It all made sense!).  
---
If this sounds a bit crazy to you, I'll be happy to DM you any proof you wish to see, including paystubs I received from them, video proof of the site, streams I have done on that site, and so on.
---
In purpose yeah mate.
---
Just checked out some of his stuff, thank you!
---
&gt;  its shitty reputation means that no one plays it, which means you are in high demand for basically everything you might wanna do. 
---
I agree that druids are much better than the conventional wisdom seems to believe. However, I have not yet been entirely convinced by the quoted arguement, which I have seen floating around on this subreddit in various forms.
---
The "true" strength of a class is far less relevant than its *perceived* strength. It does not matter how good a class is as a raid tank if your guild never lets that class tank. The "shitty reputation" of druids may mean that fewer people play it (ie. the class has a low supply), but this perceived weakness also leads to a lack of *demand* for it.
---
Is does not matter if your class makes up only 8% of the server population if people only want a maximum of 5% of their raids to be druids. Fortunately the 40 person raid sizes help as many guilds just need warm bodies, but that is not the same as "high demand".
---
I love druids and am excited to play one when Classic is released. However, be under no illusions that you will be highly desired simply because there are not many people playing them.
---
If you are ok with registry changes, you can bind caps lock to another key. This will make it so using caps lock as a keybind won't force you into all caps typing when you forget.
---
I consider myself a purist, but as long as it has zero effect on the gameplay, I would be completely fine with that.
---
I trust these people who are complaining about the graphical updates will be playing in a 4:3 resolution and on CRT screens then.
---
Barman Shanker, just a broken beer bottle. Stabbin people.
---
I'm okay with most addons, but boss mods really should not be a thing imo.
---
Yes they are. But over saturated as fuck.
---
and having to properly rotate them , plan ahead what you'll use on every aoE with others healer... otherwise you just won't keep up with the damage and die. Also every small mistake you may do for any of that plethora of mechanic may cause the healer to fall behind.
---
but I wouldn't expect a non-CE raider to understand.
---
And they get Dire Bear form. I think they are going to do insanely well at 40.
---
And there is some people who will say Preach is dog shit, whats your point? Wasnt he nay saying vanilla all the time and now suddenly loves it?
---
Right, but what if they find 10 Asmongolds on different servers?
---
Tell that to the questdesign and that everything is easily doable without a single QOL addon.
---
As if blizz relied on fans making addons so their content is doable.
---
Because, as I already said in my other post. It often leads to much bigger, more epic battles. I'm all for world pvp of any kind. And if me ganking a zone leads to a giant world battle, then mission accomplished. You all bring out your pitch forks on me for enjoying pvp, it's ridiculous. There's literally pve servers you can play on if you don't like it.
---
I recall it working that way in vanilla. I used it as a rogue since it's the only 2H weapon a rogue can equip (literally just posted about it lol). Pservers got it wrong.
---
What will the streamers do after being stream sniped after Naxx?
---
That would be an incredibly stupid idea based on the obvious outcome, theyre already leaveing a social group of about 40 people do you think theyre have a good stream personality for wow if thats the case? Do these streamer guildies ever really get famous like the streamers, a very small % might get a raid once in a bluemoon.   You look on the these top guild discords and they talk about this stuff, mostly about how bad they think it will go for these steamers and people who try and throw their lot in only to be rejected based on stream personality not thier gameplay ability. The people who move over to these guilds are not going to be the best of the best, theyre too smart to do somethign soo poorly planned, theyre going to be the worst of the best, the people who do well in pserver top guild but sit near the bottom.
---
You’re not wrong in saying there are risks in streaming, and the streamers themselves are aware of that. There is no way you can expect to play a game while streaming as if you were playing anonymously. But streamsniping should not be an acceptable behaviour, if people have the decency to not do it then there would be no need for threats of blacklisting or of some sort of punishment against something that is wrong.
---
Like others have said, I don’t care as long as it doesn’t inpct the gameplay.
---
I think people are confusing the Soda Rank 1 Player with sodapoppin, they are not the same person
---
You're such a Troll !
---
stop the streamer hate. make love not warcraft
---
Least we can do since have all this added anxiety picking a server now
---
And it was ludicrously overpowered. So much that they had to change to API functions to nerf it.
---
You're not exactly refuting my point, lol.
---
Oh god your right 😮
---
Alliance - Ironforge.
---
Hmm weird for me it shows something else. But as i said in my first text.. 25 % yes would mean 1/4 th of the playerbase.. That would at least varrant 1 tiny server imho.
---
its at four lol
---
Hunters gonna hunter
---
I made a spreadsheet for [all mage spells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AOaUrcqD2VACC3faoIEl0DJWhXCbyDtY8vtMjRkhmAI/edit#gid=0) with their cost in gold so I was able to calculate the possible savings. Here's the quick summary of total gold spent:
---
|For all spells 1-60|209.32g|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|All spells 1-40 |53.31g	|
---
|Careful selection from 1-40|16.72g|
---
If you 'just buy everything' until you hit 40, you'll be \~36g poorer. Now, of course, what you actually buy is a very personal choice, I don't expect all mages to agree with mine. The point here is that if you want your mount, just think carefully on what you buy as it does add up, especially for spells after level 30.
---
Imagine if they had a sexy NE dance. That would be ... confusing ...
---
" People who play retail 24/7 are not going to be compareable to people who played classic these last 10 years 24/7"  
---
You are delusional, classic is much easier than retail, pserver players are terrible and for sure not batter at PVP than a rank 1 or tournament player.
---
because once everyone can play the game, people will still watch other people play instead of playing themselve?
---
and I mean actually watch them, not run-in-the-background / stream sniping to corpse camp the dude.
---
QQ another person jealous they aren't a streamer.
---
no that would mean 25% of the tiny poll....
---
very scientific lol
---
talking about streamer obsession makes you obsessed about stream obsessive people.  you have turned into what you had, you obsessive OP
---
&gt;  Like it was intended back then.
---
When was that ever intended?
---
Why do you think Blizzard incorporated a LUA interpreter into the game, and made the interface API public? Because they didn't intend people to use them?
---
Play whatever you prefer. Your enjoyment comes first.
---
You could play City of Heroes, there is a Dark Melee powerset that does exactly everthing you described.
---
Having 'hardmode' servers where simply addons are disabled would actually be kind of cool, only change the meta slightly but change the gameplay significantly.
---
If this was a thing I'd roll on one of these.
---
Srsly why did they ever prune this from the game?
---
hate the player, not the game.
---
To take from my own personal experience, I found it difficult to maintain my warrior at 60 when I had time restraints. I was dps but was required to have tanking gear and resist gear to assist. If I had more time on my hands, it wouldn’t have been an issue at all. Though looking back I think I would of “enjoyed” it more playing a rogue, hunter or mage. 
---
This time round I am playing holy Priest. 
---
Do what you ENJOY!! Even if it’s hard at times. Play the game you want to play mate.
---
Lol ok
---
Yeah but if you argue about this addon would be ok this addon would not we would be discussing here until the next wow classic reboot launches =)
---
Seems like though a good fraction of the community would want such a server. 
---
How would i go on about probosing such an idea to blizzard? Make a thread on their forum?
---
Seems like at least a good enough chunk of the community would like such a server so i guess asking wont hurt.
---
Except you, you since you published a meme with straight up incorrect information on it. But please get defensive over your own mistakes.
---
Never did that one! Is the fight at the end of the questline difficult?
---
&gt;He isn't holding cards out f or everyone to see. People have to SEEK OUT THE INFORMATION. Why are you acting as if he is forcing a broadcast of his stream into every single persons computer who plays wow lol  
---
&gt;He isn't. People specifically seek out the information to gain an unfair advantage they otherwise couldn't get. This is called cheating.
---
He is literally posting his position in a public forum where no reasonable expectation of privacy, legal or social, is granted. You can't be in public and ask for privacy. Sure someone may have to turn their head to see, but you're the one putting it out there.
---
He'd just play on Asmongler, it's a better name anyway.
---
But, but.. us adults are more mature and well-considered. We have our mortgages and bills and we're proud of our shitty job, we come home tired all the- Aw, fuck. Well *at least* I'm not a follower /s
---
Why? Why does having an experience have to do with whether you stream or not? Why are you so anti streamer lol? You jealous or mad or something I don’t get it?
---
There is a post with over a 1000 replies on the forums. 
---
Make sure you reply and bump that too.
---
In EVE Online, Mercenary corps are a business. Why not transofrming it for WOW too? of course without traspassing the abuse line
---
Hero of Azeroth
---
You said camping someone was okay. What made him an asshole, other than the camping? We already discussed how someone could find someone else without watching a stream to do it. So explain the asshole part. He was sniping because Soda said so? So just ruin his character because Soda acted as judge and jury, without proof? Which person in chat was this "sniper"? Where's the proof?
---
Great vid!
---
I agree that it's probably not a good idea, but I can definitely see some of them trying.
---
Since your going horde and will have windfury available, you could easily go something like 31/5/15 and be able to pvp and pve(5man tank, offtank in raid and dps with windfury). Fury is ofc better dps but if your guild isn't too hardcore and wf totems are available it's viable.
---
I think **everyone** would have happier if Molten Core never existed in the way that it exists in the first place but was instead an entirely different raid that was actually fun. There will be people who want to raid Molten Core again for the gear and because it is the first full raid instance in WoW, but almost nobody wants to raid Molten Core truly for fun. And the prospect of raiding Molten Core again at level 70? Don't make me fucking laugh. What a god damn joke.
---
Maybe people like warriors and they are amazing too?
---
You're right. You can still make moon cloth but it doesn't require specializations. I just remember leatherworking and blacksmithing having specializations so assumed tailoring did too.
---
Well that's true, I mean some might be but in general yea. Once I see a reporter say POG or LULW I'm out
---
You should play an Orc War.
---
I personally believe that the old graphics do look better and are important to the old school "feel."
---
I just think he's the last remnants of the shitty react trand on youtube from 2015 - man should make his own content...
---
no bank alt? disgusting.
---
Look if you want to continue this at least put effort into your replies.
---
&gt; mix between enh/ele gear 
---
Why a mix and does it work well ?
---
My experience so far with beta is this: The first two weeks or so, I was getting invited to stuff all the time, arrive in an area, and people would invite, or I'd invite and we'd do those quests, and then continue on to do more. 
---
My experience since then has dwindled down and down to a more retail like experience. Still a bunch of people about, but they're declining invites to groups, and of course also not throwing out invites either. 
---
Is this reflective of how it will be? I don't know, I can only say how my experience is so far.
---
Cringe at men playing video games...
---
Wait.
---
People were getting absolutely blasted on two I’m in, people are being very aggressive about it atm, sorry if I came off that way too
---
I think the question was more about the client being removed from the launcher. I assumed it would stay and the stress test servers would just be turned on/off as needed.
---
My plan for Classic is to duo level with a warlock to 60, what should I put my points into? Should it be straight feral to help with damage, or should I start into deep resto to make healing dungeons smoother?
---
It's doable even with a spouse.  Just make sure you have time that doesn't conflict as much with your time together to raid, and play on a schedule more or less.
---
So you are implying that feeling upset is lack of maturity? I could agree if he said people are killing others because of no beta, salty or a bit upset is perfectly normal when things don't go your way no matter your "level" of maturity
---
I believe you're right. I don't necessarily remember the details on who was killable/who wasn't etc., but yes it did take you to Theramore. 
---
&gt; I am hoping that all the great old, long quest chains are still there and I look forward to completing them all 
---
Same!
---
good story. 
---
take silver.
---
&gt; He is literally posting his position in a public forum where no reasonable expectation of privacy, legal or social, is granted.
---
What is your point? That doesn't mean what people are doing isn't cheating LOL
---
&gt;act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.
---
If I know someone is streaming, I have 2 options. Ignore their stream, or use their stream to gain an advantage I otherwise couldn't get.
---
Just because he is streaming doesn't mean they're not cheating LOL
---
He isn't forcing anyone to watch his stream. He isn't shoving the information into the face of everyone without their consent.
---
Yeah that's a great idea. All the time spent on your character? we'd like to delete it for you so we can try to make you do it again because we are that petrified of trying something new.
---
How are they trying to change people experience ? By playing a game? It’s not a restriction or penalty on 99% of players most ppl do not devote their life to trying to kill s streamer in wow. Some do though l.
---
And okay why shouldn’t it be an option ?
---
Brilliant, thanks!
---
Idk if you’re choosing not to read or what but there are plenty of perfect reasons in this very thread
---
That is why if Blizzard takes action against alleged streamsnipers it would make the situation even worse than it is. If we as a community acknowledge that streamsniping is a form of cheating, and refrain from doing it and implement our own measures against streamsnipers there will be no need for Blizzard to do anything.
---
If your going to attempt to make the argument that organic world pvp, guild rivalry and body camping is the same thing as forming whole groups and guilds for the sole purpose of following a single player around and camping them, then there is no point in discussing this. I dont care about people body camping, or guilds trying to slow the progression of rival guilds, that's what classic is. 
---
I honestly dont really care about stream sniping as I dont watch streams and it doesnt effect me. I just find it annoying how much anti streamer bias there is here. If people cant see the difference between organic classic wow pvp, camping and guild wars and targeted harassment on a single player from hundreds of people they are either so far gone with bias or too stupid to understand.
---
I'm using tilt controls!
---
Streamers is a really good thing for classic imo, they cause drama and keep people more invested in the game, however they should not have any special privileges what so ever in-game, if they want to ruin their own gaming experience by accepting gold and what not, who gives a shit. But don't allow this retard PUBG shit where streamers basically serve as GMs and can just ban whoever the fuck they want.
---
Blizzard also probably needs to remove the right-click to report function, as probably 100% of hardcore gankers/griefers and 'negative' community figures will be mass reported and banned although they are not breaking TOS.
---
Let's just wait for confirmation we even have OCE servers first before we start making demands haha
---
Dungeon rules?
---
That stormwind guard was having none of your shenanigans
---
You clearly missed my point. Might be because of my weakened english. Ill try again: Would it be wiser to choose a less gear dependent class if I wont end up in a raiding environment?
---
Are you personally interested in Classic? 
---
Because by your logic, you should be constantly agonising over the grind that is Classic leveling. 
---
Leveling then was not fun. It was fulfillig. And Molten Core would be too, no?
---
I would be all for transmog on RP servers and would probably roll Alliance just for it. I'd make an entire guild of Stormwind Knights.
---
could say the same to I guess lol
---
&gt; How is this even a fucking discussion? It's fucking cheating, I knew it was cheating when I was a kid and some fucker I was playing with tried to look at my screen to know my location.
---
They deliberately make their every move public. Thus they give their opponents advantage. Do you seriously see here cheating? Because  in my book it's stupidity on behalf of these cult-of-personality figures.
---
Obviously no one can predict the demand of Classic. Attitudes and class supply, in addition to an individuals ability to make friends and form connects are all just too variable to speak about this with perfect accuracy.
---
However, in my personal, and anecdotal experience, I always found playing a druid to be something in very high demand. Far from being unable to find a raid spot as a bear, I regularly was contacted by other guilds to PUG tank a raid for them (usually ZG), and several times guilds attempted to poach me for their permanent roster. 
---
Flagrunning was even more extreme, as I've said before on this subreddit, I was B-tier on my best day, but I got to farm R10 with the bracket 1 pvpers simply because they only had like 3 options for druid FCs.
---
Combined with what you said about guilds mostly just needing warm bodies, I don't think its unrealistic to say that Druids won't have a hard time getting into groups for content.
---
Thank you so much for the respond. Is rogue easier to maintain?
---
he doesn't research anything on his own.  most of his insights is from playing blemished versions of classic on private servers.  he is not very good or competent playing the classic game himself.  most of his criticisms on the current route of classic wow I don't agree with in any sort of way.
---
I’m just saying this behavior wasn’t uncommon back when streaming didn’t exist yet, any sort of notoriety would cause you to be a target. And by mob tagging I mean unfriendly people stopping you from getting tags on mobs you needed to kill for loot, quests even hunter pet gaming, there used to be people camping named beasts just so hunters couldn’t get them tamed, sure it’s a dick move but was a part of the game and arguably part of the reason people look back on vanilla so fondly, both the challenge in achieving your goals and the “griefing”.
---
Warriors are fun..but if you are going to go casually you're going to have a hell of a time leveling as they are some of the slowest levelers.  
---
If you want to raid you will be either fury or prot and in PvP Arms is the best spec so get ready for the respec fee to quickly rise to 50g per respec meaning 100g a week minimum on just respec fees.  
---
Honestly if you want to be casual and not have a frustrating time I'd play a hunter.  If you cant play 15 hours a week which amounts to just over 2 hours a day I can't see you making much progress in end game honestly.
---
Haters gotta hate :D
---
we just need the real hard dicked warrior NEETs on /r/classicwow to make 1shot ogues on the "Streamer Server" and not give a fuck about blacklists
---
blizz already said they dgaf, and the blacklist would be meaningless...why not?
---
Gnome... Warlocks hiding in the trees in STVietnam.
---
&gt; I don't think I've ever in my life seen someone banned for sharing an account
---
Doesn't say much when you don't pay attention. Blizzard doesn't really care about it, except when it gets reported. In PvP account booser where occasionally banned for that though when it was too obvious to others.
---
UD Female has that sweet jump animation too.
---
See, nobody cares
---
Rogues have *very* callused hands.
---
This ain’t pubg
---
Are you the committee on proper stream watching? I'm saying their viewership won't drop (much, if at all) because of the launch. However viewers choose to do it is their prerogative.
---
It’s like a proud dad moment, but a proud fellow horde moment instead
---
Yes and actually it can replicate the past as far as your gaming experiences go
---
Shadowpriests are strong in pvp.
---
Streamers should think of streaming as a job, which it is. Getting streamsniped is part of it. Once you're off the clock and the stream is off theres obviously gonna be less streamsniping. Normal people have shitty jobs too sometimes. It's a work hazard, deal with it.
---
&lt;You're just jealous derp.
---
I love seeing this take over and over and over.  Quite literally the only reason, except for internet celebrities siccing a mob of followers on you or abusing their privilege and power in numerous other ways that have negative effects on average everyday players just trying to enjoy something they've waited a long time for.
---
I only watch the things related to classic wow atm, don't know of the other types of videos he watches.
---
Playing a warrior is fun even if you're not in a top tier position.
---
People on average use less addons than back during vanilla.
---
Yeah I figured that’d be an issue, mainly just with rings and neck though correct?
---
Sure sure. I personally like the fact that they banned it because it was half the posts here, and for now they want to concentrate on the actual release, not what is 2 years down the line.
---
A new guy coming to a sub should always do a quick search before asking questions and trying topics. I'm quite sure Évry possible idea has been discussed already. 
---
Finally, I don't make the rules.
---
Oh god. I wasn't worried until you reminded me about twitch chat. My eyes are already bleeding. The Barrens is gonna go from "ok, but some of this at least gets a chuckle" to "fuck, shoulda gone alliance."
---
Female undead, now that is a man of culture
---
Warlocks and Mages are also relatively low maintenance.  You don't need to really respec for PvP and leveling is very very quick. 
---
Really the only class you NEED to respec for in PvP to be competitive would be warriors...
---
Yeah. y2k all over again.
---
It’s the same game, but the player base is obviously different. 
---
Players and guilds are far more sophisticated than they were back in vanilla, they’re used to complicated boss mechanics, they use add-ons to their advantage, they use the now endless supply of online content to problem solve. 
---
The game itself will be the same and if you can find your niche you’ll likely enjoy it. 
---
It probably won’t have that initial feeling of discovery and exploration given you and everyone else is so familiar with the setting, and there is probably going to be a large community that revolves around min/maxing, speed leveling/raiding, and just generally squeezing the thing for everything it’s got. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
That's the thing. He reacts to rain Dom arguments and stuff. Why can't he just make videos about the topic instead of lazy content? It's why I like preach/madeseason/crendor
---
How do you decide who's legit ganking and who's stream sniping. There are streamers who jump to that a lot. So every time a person kills streamer he goes to blacklist.
---
Well I would say that we would just have to agree to disagree, but you keep insulting me personally by saying that I am ignorant and stupid.  
---
My point is simply this:  You can't penalize people for engaging in pvp in a pvp server.  If they want to target a guild or a person, so be it.  If that person makes themselves an easy target by broadcasting their location when they play, who's fault is that?   
---
I could care less about streamers in the end.  We are all playing a game here.  I have no bias for or against them.  What I do have a problem with is people choosing to play on a free for all pvp server, and then complaining about it.  Just don't play there.  The choice is simple.
---
Drops are important, but I'm also looking for the optimal combo in terms of leveling speed and effectiveness, as well as some nice synergy.
---
This, but Fortitude.
---
The way it was ment to be played is with addons, which is why Blizzard included it in vanilla.
---
You think you can, you can't. You were at X stage in your life and you will never recapture that time in your life when Vanilla experience and your feeling/knowledge of the world meshed
---
Unless you were 40 years old back then and are now 55, then I guess it's kinda the same for you.
---
I think it's gonna be a blast but It's going to be a lot different. There won't be a constant influx of players. There could even be a die off. There won't be any class changes to wonder or worry about, or any mechanics to discover.
---
It's going to be awesome don't get me wrong, but exactly the same? Not even close.
---
&gt;I'm quite sure Évry possible idea has been discussed already.
---
Ok lets pack it up boys.  Shut the subreddit down.  We've talked about every possible idea already.  See you guys on the 27th of August.
---
I would like right-click ignore, and a huge ignore list
---
That sounds great and all, but then I'd have to use Orgrimmar. 
---
As we all know, Ironforge is the best city.
---
That's really stupid, i cannot count the times i used mind control on an enemy when he fought a dickhead ally of mine, but not just used in a prick manner, i mced enemies any time someone helped me to thank them.
---
??? We do that all the time.
---
Don't be a visitor.
---
I like your response. But which class would a somewhat high skillcap be suited with. I would guess a caster would, since they are not weapon dependent. A Warrior would become so weak without the raid weapons.
---
It works perfectly in HOTS. Why change it?
---
It's the same game, but we arnt the same people.
---
Nostalgia is a trip tho, if I boot up a link to the past right now I'll feel like a lil kid again.
---
Everything is subjective.
---
No
---
Lol I feel the same way kinda, but then I think, "what would young me think if they knew I was chickening out of a pvp server because I was scared?" screw that, and screw the alliance.
---
I’m pretty sure there’s a slider, so you can play with updated graphics or old school.
---
Probably the best 60 ding I've seen.
---
Alright, find me something we didn't think about for post naxx. Gl gh.
---
You not all there in your head huh? :D
---
Play what you want, no one cares.
---
You can heal pre-60 dungeons as feral, no issues.
---
&gt;He is literally posting his position in a public forum where no reasonable expectation of privacy, legal or social, is granted.  
---
&gt;What is your point? That doesn't mean what people are doing isn't cheating LOL
---
Being given information by an opponent and utilizing that information is not cheating. Sorry that you're incorrect again.
---
&gt;act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.  
---
&gt;If I know someone is streaming, I have 2 options. Ignore their stream, or use their stream to gain an advantage I otherwise couldn't get.
---
Willingly providing information to the public. Don't hand out information you don't want to be used against you. If you give it out, you're at fault, not the receiver.
---
&gt;Just because he is streaming doesn't mean they're not cheating LOL
---
Again, he's providing information to his opponents willfully and freely. Someone telling you their plan and then you acting on that is not considered cheating. It was neither dishonest or unfair since you did not utilize any information that was not available to other players.
---
&gt;He isn't forcing anyone to watch his stream. He isn't shoving the information into the face of everyone without their consent.
---
Neither am I walking down the street. However, when you enter into the public domain, what you broadcast there is at your discretion to be used by the public. This is the legal and social contracts you choose to live with when you participate.
---
&gt;Sure someone may have to turn their head to see, but you're the one putting it out there.  
---
&gt;And it's still cheating.
---
That's like saying photographing you in public is an invasion of privacy. It isn't.
---
I am pretty sure you can already do that, or you can just click their name.
---
And ignoring people is a much better option that solves 99% of actual issues in-game, and it only affects yourself and not other people.
---
Dofus did something similar more than a year ago. (This MMO is as old as WOW and was very popular in France)
---
They released a monoaccont server. People have been asked them for years to do it. The big issue with this game is its turn-based so people made multiple account (2 to 8) to play with themselves (Social aspect right down the drain)
---
When they annonced it there was a lot of hype but didn't have a beta. A lot of people came back, it was also a fresh server something they didn't added in years. They were suposed to only have 1 server but then added 5 or 6 because there was just too much people joining.
---
A couple of months later the population dropped so they merged all the server together. Now this server ''Ilyzaelle'' is the most popular server in the game. (Also it is an international server but half of it is french)
---
Because of the succes they also created temporary server that last a few months for people that like server rush.
---
Classic leveling can be "chill". It's not exactly fun, but it's not exactly agonizing either if you do it right. I made a post on another thread about it - it is something you can do while listening to a podcast or playing meme Hearthstone decks. 
---
Molten Core is different from that, it's just bad content. There's no equivalency between them. It isn't as if there weren't fun classic raids, Molten Core just wasn't one of them.
---
yes it's delivered. there are some minor QoL changes, like increased terrain detail, the client itself is from live (it doesn't use the actual 1.12 vanilla client), and you can auto loot without having to hold shift, but other than that it's virtually identical to how 1.12 was
---
&gt; except for internet celebrities siccing a mob of followers on you or abusing their privilege and power in numerous other ways that have negative effects on average everyday players just trying to enjoy something they've waited a long time for.
---
Examples?
---
You will need someone else to give you input on that as I didn’t play one in vanilla. But looking at it on paper - no raid buffing, pure dps, can play sword spec forever and raids can take plenty of them. Dime a dozen in PvP servers though
---
Just give us open beta PepeHands
---
It is very common for streamers to take up early access or limited beta games, so they can get a lot of viewers and keep earning high dollars.  So many times streamers play games they don't like because it is part of their job to earn their keep.  Many of the wow classic streamers will stream a new beta test for a new MMO two weeks after classic's launch since the hype will be dying down and they want to earn the most of their money.  Sure they may come back to play classic wow when they are offline, but that is just the way streamers make their money by streaming limited access content to a wide audience.
---
Yh I get what your saying. Guess what I'm after is the feeling that your in a world that vanilla had. No games have that these days and was the main reason I was drawn to an mmorpg.
---
tbf, every one like bitching about streamers
---
&gt; Being given information by an opponent and utilizing that information is not cheating. Sorry that you're incorrect again.
---
He isn't giving anyone anything. They are seeking it out. How hard is this to comprehend? They have to make the active choice to seek out information they know is unfair.
---
i played with him too around that time. he was an officer in my guild on sargeras. he was a duelist and streaming to 200 people on xfire. I remember playing with kaska and nahj too who were also around the duelists and are now multi rank 1s. I think over time they just improved a lot  but had the luxury of having really good teammates also.
---
This is a way for Blizzard to reduce GM cost, just be happy we're getting the game. 
---
Abusing the system will have severe consequences. If you report gankers left, right and center, you'll be looking at some good old involuntary time away from the game.
---
What a savage
---
Someone should start an appropriately named guild called Stream Snipers.
---
Honestly 15-20 hours a week you'll have a blast on anything, but if you are looking to be challenged and have fun you can't wrong with mage/lock, easy to press their buttons and there will be tons of them, but you can take the classes far if you want to get great at playing them :)
---
KO
---
My thoughts at the moment is how weak Ill be in pvp if im a raid tier behind. Say I start to do MC while others go for BWL. I guess I wouldnt be too weak.
---
&gt;You are delusional, classic is much easier than retail, pserver players are terrible and for sure not batter at PVP than a rank 1 or tournament player.
---
Oh you have no real points just ad hom lol....
---
Show me any proof or examples where this is in anyway this is true lol.. people who have been studying how a specific item effects each class vs someone who plays a loot pinata lol, you have no idea what you are talking about in the slightest. Just go back to your stream and fanboi there... 
---
talk about delusional - 
---
&gt;characterized by or holding idiosyncratic beliefs or impressions that are contradicted by reality or rational argument. 
---
So basically you called be delusional then proved it fit you, god I love people on reddit, they fall into their own word traps so often
---
is this private server ?
---
Is it against the rules? Then it's not cheating.
---
Morally ambiguous? Sure
---
Don't get me wrong, I fully think you should be able to have the old graphics. Which you can to an extent if I am not wrong. But for us non-purists the old game with the same mechanics, but in HD with detailed characters and environmental would be amazing.
---
What does that have to do with going out of your way to be worried about a hypothetical scenario in which a streamer is playing with some group of people... How is that necessarily different than a group of friends leveling together?
---
I spent a couple of hours wiping in SFK last night, and it was way more fun than I had facerolling SFK in BFA last week.
---
Forgot saggy tiddies as a pro on the right
---
I like that nobbel guy. Haven’t watched a ton of his stream stuff but popped in here and there. I like him cause his YouTube content keeps me connected to wow even tho I don’t play anymore (will play classic). He’s that guy that brought more nuance to a game because I never really payed attention to the lore. Played wc3 and vanilla to cata. Knew what was going on but didn’t really KNOW what was going on. Good guy.
---
oh you are right, I was referring to the content
---
not the experience
---
Out of interest, what would you say the druid's healing niche is?
---
Speak for yourself, all I plan on installing is Gatherer (sans dataset), OmniCC, and my homebrewed stock-UI-inspired actionbar/minmap addon.
---
Totally hyped for classic -- the nostalgia is strong, and I miss that gameplay and that community.
---
I don't watch streamers.  I don't get the appeal of watching someone else play a game.
---
Yh my niche was PvP, loved that shit. Gurubashi here I come!
---
You forgot reason number 6 to roll female UD over Male, they got an ass that just won't quit!
---
Another Mage!!!! Call yourself Boombox
---
Seeing as how you can't even understand the language of the opposing faction, cross-faction communication for the purpose of effecting the in-game world really seems against the spirit of the game to me; much more so than getting killed because you broadcast your location. I'd say that, while both things seem to be griefy, the streamers idea is the worse offense of the two, particularly given that there's no controls in place to prevent false accusations.
---
I just personally like the old animations better. I would play the game anyway though
---
:( you make me sad. I caught a bad case of the hype last week, and here I thought I was gonna be able to wait for August without following this sub obsessively.
---
You cared enough to comment. Im actually chatting with quite a few that has relevant input.
---
&gt;Enemy cast bar (for interrupting)
---
these don't really work in vanilla though do they? like they always just show base cast speed, don't take into account spell pushback, improved casting speed buffs etc.
---
Says the guy who keeps getting defensive over something he claims to not see as a problem :thinking:
---
Classic already have updated graphics.
---
Its an historical recreation of the game as it wqs so its kinds a big deal to keep the original feel of the game and graphics.
---
The whole point is they are changing their own experience. You cannot have an open world mmo and stream for a massive audience but expect the same exact experience random dude #47264 gets. How could you? What can you actually do to create the same exact experience besides hardware banning anyone who's ever both viewed the stream and logged into the streamers server. It's a different age and if you have an audience, that audience will interact with you. Play a single player game or at least a pve server if you want to mitigate that?
---
You know it's legit 2004 with the fraps logo and only has 3 pixels
---
Then there is me, planning on a casual 6 months!
---
No problem, I'm a little sensitive when people on the outside (not saying you are) say that people just want to play Classic for "nostalgia", while some people do - I feel that's misguided...
---
Your answer right here is 100% the reason I'm playing Classic and the reason why Classic will he ever successful! No mmorpgs will be able to offer the same experience as Classic WoW in 2019 😃
---
I am pretty sure their report system is based on an accuracy system that detects if players gets lots of reports or few reports, in which case if they get more its consdered more accurate. And if you report people who are getting multiple reports your reports will hold a higher value.
---
So what we all have to do as a community is just report anyone who ganks us (as the system promotes) and make the fragile system implode, so everyone can see just how bad such a system truly is.
---
that's some sick keyboard turning skillz right there
---
love when pw shield didn't have a debuff too
---
Thank you so much for the replies. I might be allowed to join my guilds raids with arms gear. Just maybe.
---
Most of the weirdboys play female no matter the race so im guessing the female is going to be overused.
---
Remember people.... make Sodapoppin, and it's variant's on every fucking server Aug 13th.
---
Thanks alot for the reply m8.
---
I was going to mention that, but I don't even know if you can find them these days.
---
[Here ya go!](https://www.cardkingdom.com/images/magic-the-gathering/ice-age/forest-a-37872-medium.jpg)
---
Male dance is better
---
Warlock or even a second shadow priest
---
Thanks for the replies m8.
---
And I never said that's wrong. Hell, I plan on playing a rogue and ganking people as much as possible. But I'm not going to be mad when people retaliate.  I'm just repeating myself at this point - yes, by all means be a dick but don't be surprised when people are dicks back. Punch someone - get punched back. Simple concept.  
---
I know what mob tagging is but I was referring to what you mentioned about streamers having exclusive access to mobs.
---
Sitting on their totems.
---
Good read
---
Oh my god the amount of times I doodled bloodfang armor back then...
---
It works in hots but there’s only 12 people playing the game lol.
---
Getting Tidal charm on a new server is TOUGH. Anyone that manages to nab it in the first 3 months totally deserves the kill they get with it.
---
Yes. Blade of Hanna, Flurry Axe are both good, just not as amazing as MCP - Depending on Ironfoe's proc chance, it's either very good or on-par with MCP.
---
And if you're spamming regrowth, don't be afraid to innervate yourself. If you can top HPS by innervating yourself, then giving it to a priest so they can top HPS brings no extra value to the raid.
---
Warlock ridic, if mage being focused, ice block + fear gives that utility :)
---
Nothing wrong with that. I like TB because of how different it is than every other city - the layout, overlooking the surrounding area, its uncity-like appearance, etc. Ironforge is awesome, and so is its music. I just like TB most because it's something I generally don't see in MMOs/RPGs.
---
You can get improved inner fire and improved Mana burn to further your supremacy against both forms of dps
---
If what you desire is that core Living and Social world that was present in Vanilla/TBC, then YES it's worth it. Vanilla wow has a slow, but wonderful formula for an mmorpg.
---
Hey, you're finally awake...
---
The best raid tanks in classic are warriors*
---
Just because you're not first doesn't mean you can't do the job well.  If we only took the absolute best theory class for everything we'd have a group of 40 people made up entirely of warriors, mages, and priests with 1 of each other class.
---
That's fucking sweet
---
Just being realistic here...the scums won't give a shit if they are blacklisted or have a bad reputation, they will snipe streamers and grieve them, especially on PVP servers where the sociopaths and toxic players tend to play. Streamers will need bodyguards (it's already the case anyway). I guess that's part of the risk of streaming, I mean hey...the money is good right? can't have the cake and eat it.
---
Apparently you missed the story of medivhs massive raptor dick staff stopping the burning crocolisk vagina invasion
---
Just throw BFA in the trash and start fresh
---
Sounds like so much fun. I mained a rogue after vanilla and am heavily considering it as my main for classic
---
its reddit, down votes dont mean anything...
---
I got in so having a server full of streamers I have played with is kinda cool. 
---
Oddly enough it has hit me in the nostalgias real bad. When I played in Vanilla there were “famous” people on Illidan server. Running into one was cool. Playing with streamers has brought back that feeling pretty hard. 
---
Instead of man our group ran into Tipsout’s group today it was, “dude we got into a pug BG with Splug and his crew. Got totally wrecked” Shout out to Splug from Illidan back in the day. Been 13 years and I still remember that dude.
---
People joke about the ways women treat men when some of those ways are toxic on the part of the woman. That's why when I see a man throw acid on a woman's face, I have to ask people "man, what did she do to him to deserve it?"
---
Not really related to your comment.
---
Dude when did you start playing wow? These guys have been making videos and streaming way b4 BFA lol...
---
This, this is what I want. Good to hear.
---
Nope this is probably around 2005
---
Delete toon and try again
---
"Best finishing animation" Oh my, OP. Female UD probably wouldn't be my first choice.
---
Just pretend the pet is another set of skills you can use. They do barely any damage in PvP so just macro/bind their abilities and you're good to go. 
---
Then suddenly you have the ability to cleanse CC off of yourself and counter spell people after they counter spell you.
---
I dont mean to be an ass or insult you but you seem to either not be reading what I'm typing or just cant understand it. You absolutely can and should imo punish people that organize guilds and groups to constantly camp a single player. What I'm talking about is not two guilds killing each other on sight, or people ganking, I'm talking about hundreds of people forming whole communities that only play the game to watch a streamer and kill them 24/7. Can you just for a second imagine that one day an entire guild of say 20 people constantly camped you. Followed you everywhere you went and played the game just so you couldn't. This isnt organic pvp, this is targeted harassment. That's been my only argument in this thread.
---
Sodas idea is stupid and would not work. There is no way to prove a lot of stream sniping and it would 100% be abused a lot of the time. There is no good solution to this and yes saying "dont play" or "dont stream" is 100% ignorant, I apologize If that offends you. People saying there is no issue with this and talking about making these communities  is mind boggling.
---
Pictures you can hear right?
---
&gt; while one shaman can only buff one group. 
---
You obviously never played the Shaman shuffle during boss fights, lol!
---
Hey, thanks for the mar...hey! where are you going!  Come back here and take my damn Int buff already. Hey, stop, hey! Damnit...
---
Fuck streamers and fuck anyone who defends them.
---
Or accidentally dinged when discovering GoldShire or something
---
They did a video on this as a video and a balance/resto hybrid is what they went with, with omen of clarify specced to get free heals so the lock can tap.
---
12 points in balance for Omen of Clarity - Then resto to insect swarm - then spend how you want
---
Yeah, and next you'll tell me that a fisherman wrote a book about where the real Ashbringer is!
---
The video constantly cuts between scene's, be nice to add a link to the original streamed content to see what he is said without it being edited. 
---
On another note regarding the issues people had with the duelist tournament being interfered with and the constant remarks back that people should be allowed to play the game the way they and ,players should resolve these issue's themselves and blizzard should have no involvement isn't what he is describing here exactly that?
---
Creating a system that like minded people can play the game the way they want to?
---
As op has the right to want to create a guild with the sole purpose of hunting streamers down and ganking them. Soda want's to create a community that doesn't associate with players that want to hand him down and gank him?
---
Oh wow avoiding your own capital city for the entire leveling process. That would be something else
---
&gt;He isn't giving anyone anything. They are seeking it out. How hard is this to comprehend? They have to make the active choice to seek out information they know is unfair. They make the choice to gain information they know they cannot gain otherwise  
---
&gt;He isn't forcing people to watch his stream and know his location. This is the most basic concept.
---
They are seeking out publicly available information, such as the color of your shirt. It's the same as going to a library and reading a book on econometrics to gain an advantage in the stock market. They are not dishonestly or underhandedly gaining this information. An exception could be made for China, since they have to use a VPN to access Twitch. 
---
He isn't being forced to provide his information to anyone and everyone who chooses to watch a free and public stream. This is the most basic concept. If you don't want people to know something, don't broadcast it openly. If you still choose to broadcast it, and are given tools to protect your privacy but still refuse to use them, it's on you.
---
I don't think most people would drop it but you would lose a good chunk of the playerbase for sure.
---
Man, the BfA drones are downvoting me like crazy :D
---
I guess they really don't like what is coming...
---
Thing is that those games are not time consuming so if you're just gonna chill you might tune in and watch but with wow you can do plenty of things just chill in in the game.
---
Classic will carry until next year when they release their next wow expansion, and the cycle begins all over again :)
---
Might sound like hyperbole but, with Classic releasing - I see zero reason to play modern wow.
---
Only reason I played wow after Wrath was because there were no other mmorpgs worth getting invested into... Classic is endlessly replayable for me :)
---
Which class could be more casual and less gear dependant in pvp
---
You are taking it way too literal and completely different scenarios. It seems you are totally anti streamer and are just using that as a tool to rationalize.  I am explicitly talking about people who long term camp or grief streamers. Nothing else
---
What if they gave us tbc/wrath without flying and dungeon finder? Just add a teleport option for locations inaccessible or better design a way to reach them on foot.
---
&gt; Please, let's hear it. You can be condescending all you want asking me what I know but all I'm asking is what you think would be better. You seem to think you're pretty fucking smart so lets hear it. Anything at all.
---
I think you are either reading too much into what I'm saying or taking this way too personal. I am not trying to be smart. My whole argument is that good changes and improvements can happen. The whole circlejerk of #nochanges is stupid and illogical.
---
&gt; You love dodging questions don't you? I was talking about how balancing the game to allow everyone to do everything is a terrible idea, you talked like it's very easily done. 
---
**I don't know.** I never claimed I knew. I am not a developer at Blizzard, why do you put the burden of perfectly balancing the game on me?
---
I also never claimed to want "everyone to do everything". You do understand that there can be a middle ground? Making some careful changes will not turn Classic into retail.
---
&gt; An actual answer is what you need.
---
Again, I am not a game developer for a multi million dollar company, why are you holding me to the standard of the developing team at Blizzard?
---
&gt;  Blizzard tried multiple things and they failed at it, so please all knowing wizard boy, tell me what you think they should do.
---
What did they try? Blizzard tried to keep the Vanilla design philosophy for later expansions? I mean we can see a clear shift in their design philosophy throughout expansions.
---
&gt; That's funny because you sure have acted like its a fairly easy fix. So if you don't know the answer, and the experts working on the game don't know the answer, then why would you suggest they do it? That's just dumb. 
---
Never ever claimed anything to be easy in this discussion. Only that it is possible. It seems like you either misunderstood my whole argument or my English is horrible. 
---
We don't know if Blizzard have tried to keep their core Vanilla philosophy and make changes to Classic. Comparing their development of retail to whatever will happen for Classic doesn't seem fair as these are two very different projects based on different design philosophies.
---
&gt; Because every single time they have tried to fix balance issues it lead to the retail playstyle we have today. If you think that it can be done differently then voice what you think should be done. If you don't know what it is, then don't ask for it you moron.
---
Is the playstyle of every expansion from tbc to bfa the same? That seems to be what you are implying. I'll take you back to my initial point. **Vanilla saw balance changes as well. If Vanilla saw changes in balance and also kept the original core design philosophy, why can't that also be true for Classic?** 
---
Having developers research what made Vanilla so good, don't change the underlying core concepts of that, only improve/fix broken stuff etc. could possibly achieve this.
---
So if I don't have the experience of a Blizzard game developer, I can't raise my opinion of changes to the game? Seems fair...
---
They said in an interview that the report system will still have a human component. If you "implode" the system by mass-reporting someone to trigger an automatic response, a GM will step in and review, and that review will end in a suspension and/or ban  for the offenders, it really is that simple. Can it be abused? Yes. Is it worth it? Very, very likely not.
---
Yeah, clearly the guys in the Jewelry are in the wrong.
---
But the mass report auto-ban function won't be in classic, so the mass report will be overlooked by a GM before an actual ban/mute/whatever happens.
---
Hey i dont care, i dont stream so its whatever to me. IMO its as much cheating as multiboxing and since that isnt against the ToS somehow its allowed so i dont see why stream sniping shouldn't be. Except for money i guess so thats a pretty good reason in blizzards eyes.
---
Side question as you seem to know rogues well, I plan on playing one as I didnt during vanilla. Do you know when, if at all, they will add end game pvp gear as an alternative to dealing with the pve loot issues?
---
thanks
---
Well hope you enjoy it. I wouldnt mind a PVE server at time but I love Wpvp and the danger it brings to much to leave. I do appreciate you going to a PVE server rather than just bitching about camping and such. Have fun in Azeroth fellow player! (unless your alliance..)
---
They are dealing with it by doing that blacklist thing and turning their legion on fans on the stream sniper
---
So play retail for gold and earn a sub that way.  I'd much rather go do a minimum wage job for two hours than play retail.
---
Rip server community and stability.
---
Hi, /u/Heliodjent
---
You think any of that was serious or malicious? You think any of that was beyond streamers making content? You having this video ready to go is exactly what they want. They're fucking around and having fun. Everyone there is laughing. You people have a stick up your ass taking everything literally and seriously. Grow up
---
Well for starters content drives business. And I’m not talking about the average joe mcstreamsniper, although anyone that will long term grief anyone for clout is an absolute fucking loser
---
Welp, better start streaming.
---
Jk, I'd never want my gaming and enjoyment to turn into a job/chore.
---
Stop it.
---
How do you know if they run across the whole map in stealth? You wouldn't be able to see them.
---
What if /1 or a guildie says "I just saw asmon outside tarren mill when I was going past" and you are grinding Naga's, you go all the way to there and kill him, holy shit your stream sniping.
---
The majority of this community is honestly so fucking dumb. Do they not realize that streamers tend to be streamers because they are exceptionally good at the game? Also, if method streams pve content or cares even the slightest they will get world firsts.
---
Who can do better than front flips?
---
Yeah they talked about that, I can't remember where though. But they said they won't be naming realms after the old ones.
---
Im actually curious what you think balance does well
---
nope
---
*Well this is how we gonna do this
---
Fuck Asmongold, fuck StaySafe
---
Fuck Sodapoppin as a player, and as a motherfucking crew
---
And if you want to be down with Soda, then fuck you too
---
Quin69, fuck you too
---
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too*
---
I read some, but pretty much all of them are about the same - people complain, it would broke the game and mistakenly think, that any balance would cause "everyone has everything" effect, which is just retarded. Or another one: "its just not vanilla" and it would completely change the dynamic of the game and how it feels - wrong again. But if you post here one good reason, im really happy to change my mind
---
PvP will always be gear dependent in classic.
---
Like I said above I'd pick Mage, Warlock, or Hunter. 
---
Easy leveling = quicker to end game to get your pre-bis
---
Quick TTK = more ability to farm for gold which equates to buying gear off the AH to gear up quicker if you don't have the time to run dungeons
---
retail wow will be fine. classic will also do well. i think blizzard will learn some things about what people liked about classic and put it into bfa+ but the problem is once you give someone something, like aoe looting and LFG, you can't take it away from them. blizz could remove CRZ and come up with some better solution as to me, CRZ is the biggest thing wrong with live today. other things like gameplay issues such as feeling like you're doing tedious tasks all day and dealing with an RNG slot machine for loot can be fixed
---
I think they confirmed that they'd be new names, to avoid confusion. Shame, as I wanted to do the same.
---
Right but you know that's not the case with the crowd that is rolling them just because they are strong.
---
Never been fan of masses. Always prefered slightly smaller guilds but where people know each other and are eager to help / spend time with members in game.
---
I’m pretty sure chromatic sword and maladath is way better than fang of faceless for rogues. Of course that’s for sword spec though
---
I'm liking this....
---
This seems like it would be a more interesting spec to level in, might try it out, in terms of gear should I be more focused on the int spirit side or the agil crit?
---
rogue
---
Imagine being that triggered over someone choosing a different faction than you.
---
Can't wait to see him getting camped for hours.
---
We truly agree that skipping strait WoD style auto play,  and its garrisons are what we need, rather then engaging content. Truely, "We thought we did, but we didn't" /s
---
The most popular streamers are going to have a good time getting ganked 24/7.
---
I can see sodapoppin getting ganked on every opportunity :D
---
Yeah I like some things TBC did and even wrath.  But flying, daily quests, badge vendors, arena, and resilience were all negative to me.
---
But there's no other option.  Realms will naturally decrease in population with or without TBC launching.  If there's no more content then there's no reason for people to keep playing.
---
Must’ve been a RP PvP server :)
---
Stop it
---
&gt; I read some, but pretty much all of them are about the same - people complain, it would broke the game and mistakenly think, that any balance would cause "everyone has everything" effect, which is just retarded. Or another one: "its just not vanilla" and it would completely change the dynamic of the game and how it feels - wrong again. But if you post here one good reason, im really happy to change my mind
---
If you think these reasons are dumb or don't make any sense then I have to ask, what change do you think would be 'ok' and accomplish what you want it to accomplish. 
---
This is all pointless anyway considering they already said they won't do it, but just out of curiosity what do you think would be ok?
---
Wooa that's not how you treat an innocent trash can.
---
You cleared naxx with no addons? I find that hard to believe a guild capable of clearing it was cool with you not running dbm/bigwigs or a threat meter
---
&gt;He isn't being forced to provide his information

We literally just went over this. He is streaming a video game and these people are making the choice to act dishonestly. He isn't GIVING them anything. He is streaming a game. That is all. Nothing else. They are CHOOSING to obtain information they know they shouldn't be allowed to have by normal means. That is dishonest. It's unfair. It's cheating.

I remember there were assholes that the server didnt like as a whole, but it wasnt because they tanked the opposite faction.
---
They were toxic to everyone
---
During leveling the servers are gonna be swarming with players. Everyone is talking about a classes ability to solo level but to be honest just whisper whoever is farming next to you and group up easy.
---
100% what you said here.

Aww you can help, just open the occasional newbie lock box for free.

witch-hunt  /ˈwiCH ˌhənt/ (noun)-  a campaign directed against a person or group holding unorthodox or unpopular views. 
---
literally what all of you are doing. Look I realize Soda isn't a saint either but by definition, he isn't witch hunting, its more of a totalitarian rule, where he gets his way and essentially runs the server, though his views are actually different they are equally stupid. But you people clamoring on about streamers is ridiculous. It will be easy enough to avoid the servers they are playing on if you really care that much, and also servers will big enough that there is a good chance that if you don't care about him he won't affect you much. Back in the day, there were TONS of very popular and influential people on servers. They got that way because they either became popular through random memes (Leeroy Jenkins) or through Skill, (Maydie, Pat, Drakedog, etc). Also, I realize that the compounded effect of streamers in comparison will also factor it in, in the sense that there will be a ton of fanboys and also haters (apparently you) running around. You guys act like there will be 3 servers to play on at launch when there are potential MILLION of players waiting to get in. I think people see the beta, and see the interactions with the same 10 people and assume that's how it will be at launch, which definitely won't be the case. Avoiding streamers will be easier than people think, relax. At the end of the day, this is my opinion though, and you will probably disagree with it, which is fine, because we live in a world where people can have differing opinions and view things from differing perspectives, so see you in Azeroth.

What’s wrong with LFG? We won’t have teleports. Seems to me like some addon putting people together would be fine. We’ll still need to talk to each other, run to the instance, and we’ll all be from the same server so we can add to friends and see them around later. Not really any different from the LFG chat channels that go serverwide.

Are you actually defending this?
---
Sounds to me like soda will at some point get really upset when PvP happens on a PvP server and blacklist a totally innocent person who doesn't even watch his shit stream.
---
Sounds alot like ninja lol.
---
I agree with you but I did wanna say that I started playing WoW when I was 14 and met a lot of other kids my age. Of course that was before fortnite and a lot of other games came out.
---
Hell half my guild was my age along with my three friends I played with all the time.
---
But on whether these people grew up or just got older is 100% up for debate.
---
Man this is fucking genius!
---
You can 100% tank as a dps/pvp spec. It’s what most people did/do.
---
It's not that uncommon to be honest for 11 year olds to not join. 
---
Below age related but not uncommon.
---
Somewhat true in that yes he could see.
---
From what I remember he was never "blind", his eyes were burned out and replaced with a "gift" from the legion before Warcraft 3 took place. You're right that he sees magic and the world differently now but he got that right away.
---
Bullshit, they have been clear that they will be hiding that info as long as they can to avoid their toxic fans for as long as they can. Meaning until a day or two in when enough people notice them in the game and report it to the public any server could be a streamer server. 
---
Now you have lost time invested into a character when you have to reroll away from those morons. And you have to hope that all of them are revealed at the same time or you might wind up with a different one when you reroll and have to do it all over again.
---
I just want a release of server names, locations, and PvP/PvE. I got s ton of people to coordinate and that will make my life easier.
---
New names, will be announced before or by August 12 for name reservations.
---
\&gt;bunch of midget bois?
---
What in the name of Mimiron are you calling us?
---
Funny, never heard of him.
---
Everyone who fucking posts this thinks its as simple as "just tune the numbers on them so theyre viable." If you played and did research you would understand that classes like Prot Pally/Feral tank etc arent just bad because of their tuning. They don't have access to great gear to their counterparts. What you're asking wouldnt make them viable for raiding the only way they would ever be super viable is if blizz added new items to loot tables which is a NO.
---
NGL I'm one of the biggest retail haters you could find and I'll probably try out BFA just to fuck around. You're paying for it anyways, yknow?
---
&gt; All 4 of us took off a week for launch and have a schedule already laid out for maximizing rest/playtime without getting fatigue.
---
You may want to consider taking the week after launch instead.  Then you're not wasting (as much) time competing for boards with hundreds of other people.
---
anyone who is dumb enough to broadcast their location deserves to get sniped.
---
 Addons were part of the game since the very beginning so when you say vanilla experience that includes addons
---
In dungeons yes, raids no.

Why wouldn‘t he?

I guess I'll go to Chinenumberone...

---
I'm living the future, and it's fun!
---
Fair enough. Healings tough in its own way, but you dont gotta worry about aggro unless you are renewing in like the first second of the pull. Gz to you then, but youre in like 1% of players that can be remotely competent without them
---
Oh wow, Ty
---
Start Feral, end Feral/Resto hybrid.  Until around level 30 or 40, your spec doesn't matter too much (i.e. you can tank or heal in any spec as long as your gear is appropriate).  At 35, you can start getting Heart of the Wild, which is a 20% boost in Intellect in addition to similarly-strong bonuses to Bear and Cat form.
---
After you get 30 points in Feral you can go Resto, and end with Nature's Swiftness.
---
Alright, I guess that's worth creating a post to submit the idea. Good find.
---
\&gt; I feel bad because their classic experience is going to be so different. 
---
They know what they're stepping into and they're used to sniping or otherwise find creative/inventive ways to handle it. One is an unknown/unshown character, that is never streamed, and the other is for streaming all the "terrible" snipes and other shenanigans. If not, then they better not stream it. That's their responsibility when it comes to games. They can also EASILY set up something to blur out their character's name and the server list they use along with their guild tag. It's annoying, but it's a start of how to handle shit like that. If Blizzard is super duper nice, maybe they'll include a way to mask their name to everyone else on the server via a twitch login and approval, verification, and toggling the option. Even-still, the creepiest of creep people are going to find out one way or another lmao.
---
It's not that realistic, it's more like playing a tabletop game. You can talk OOC, but in general you try to speak like a real person in that world and try to act appropriately based on the background you invent for your character.
---
As I said, even Swifty isn't that good.
---
I chose Swifty because out if all the popular streamers today he's the only one I vividly remember was popular back in Vanilla.
---
Mage warrior and rogue have never changed from being the top 3 in classic...
---
Dw tanks are going to get ruined by the parry rate increase
---
&gt; Blizzard, even if they like it or not, they NEED Classic to simply overtake BfA by a LARGE margin
---
Oh the irony.
---
Yes. Activision/Blizzard basically have nothing else significant planned for delivery in the next 6 months+. I don't count BfA patch 8.2 as 'significant'. It's not getting a good reception on the PTR and all it's likely to do for the vast majority of players is introduce even more mindless elements to grind.
---
Your arithmetic on subs is likely under-counting the subs though. I'm subbed right now, but I used Blizzard store balance to pay for it. I used gold to buy Blizzard balance back in December when I unsubbed. So the 1.3 million would be PAYING subs. There's probably in excess of 1.5 million actual subs.
---
My dude, how the hell do you know if someone "RAN ACROSS THE WHOLE MAP TO GRIEF YOU just cause you turned on stream" and it isn't just someone that enjoys walking around looking for people to gank?
---
Xp bar stayed until you reloaded ui or relogged it was a very common bug
---
You spelled "me and the boys"  wrong
---
Never heard of any of those players. So clearly I know jack shit lol
---
With this I want to see an all priest and paladin raid.  Holy fire and smite would be viable damage with 1500 bonus spell power.
---
Don’t you have to be 60 to walk into Molten Core?
---
Or maybe not I guess? Idk I never played vanilla
---
I love those clean frames, so nice.
---
There used to be a 5-6 box shaman that would defend IB Tower and Graveyard. Still have PTSD 14 years later.
---
Man, I feel like I've lost my mind... I could have sworn auto-dismount was there back in vanilla.
---
Yes, that's what i meant
---
This is a great idea. What is the easiest way to find streamer names to camp?
---
&gt; they need to survey players and find out for sure.
---
And every survey I've seen shows that RPPVP is even more popular than RP. Obviously these servers have some bias that won't represent the eventual population, but I doubt it would have much effect on the results.
---
thats a lifegoal
---
WotF didn't deserve to be nerf'ed as long as Fear Ward had a 30 second cooldown
---
&gt;  it's hilarious how butt hurt people are getting over streamers. Just shows their emotional maturity. None of this is a big deal at all. So they got in the beta. Who cares? 
---
*I don't really have a dog in this fight since I'm not an active member of this sub, and this is entirely my opinion that I can be wrong on, so please don't send downvote/harassment armies after me.*
---
But this sort of shade I think is why streamers get so reviled. Their content gets spammed here, and complaints are met rage from the followers. Then a spat happens, and then said followers are always "man they're just playing the game why do you care".
---
I think people care because the followers keep stirring up shit and then getting indignant when others take issue. It's like the "I'm not touching you!" think siblings would do to annoy each other and then running off screaming when the annoyed sibling snaps at you.
---
If you don't want streamers to be the target of negative comments, *stop making them the focal point of all discussions*. The fans are the ones bringing them up all the time.
---
It's less about "butt hurt" and more of "God damn whatever just leave us alone".
---
I’ve got some bad news for you if you think the first three will be tolerated by Blizzard. They’ve already said intentional and repeat sniping/harassment will be bannable, and multiple streamers have suggested on stream that Blizzard has told them their names are most likely reserved for them when servers open up pre-launch. Plus you have no idea what server they’re picking.
---
As a teacher I tend to see a lot of following from children. I speak only from my experience. So this ummm yes is what I am currently on about.
---
Yeah, for the record the last time I think I did a leveling dungeon that wasn't current content was Burning Crusade (to be fair, I stopped pre-Wrath and only played small parts of Cata and WoD, didn't play extensively again until mid-Legion).
---
There's a post somewhere about vertical content expansion and how it ultimately hurts the integrity of the game, and I think that's symptom of it. The amount of emphasis on level-cap content and the presence of items built to expedite the leveling process fertilizes the idea that things *must* be done quick to reach a meaningful point in the game. To some extent, that might just be the bane of MMOs in general. I would love to be able to peek into an alternate timeline where Blizzard explored horizontal expansions instead of progressing the level cap. Weapon skins, high-level dungeon or raid questlines that unlocked an additional talent tree, while also introducing mechanical complexity to their dungeon and raid designs, and their art direction.
---
Full raid of paladins and holy priests for dps.
---
I hadn't seen anyone talking about this so I quickly made a clip of myself doing it. I'm not sure what causes the 21 energy ticks (although I've heard it's also happening to Feral Druids.) The double tick is easy to replicate and is a weird issue, it's kind of like the Schrodinger's cat of energy ticks. The game treats me as having 40 energy until the double tick goes through, as it won't let me Sinister Strike (which costs 45 energy,) so it's clearly not just a client-side display bug. So it seems like the server has decided that I was at full energy when the tick was meant to happen but then goes back and changes it mind. My guess is that this is similar to some of the other slightly odd things that happen with spell batching, but I don't recall this happening in Vanilla.
---
Is rogue as gear dependent as warriors
---
Thank god people keep talking about this spec being good.  That's what I'm planning on going for level 60.  You can tank dungeons, heal raids, and do a good bit of DPS for solo.
---
I can't wait for classic to launch and people realize how irrelevant a handful of dudes broadcasting themselves playing is in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of people who will be playing the game and never heard of them or could care less.
---
Streamers =/= the dictators of a server 
---
They're just loud ass guild leaders.
---
Why would it stop anyone from experiencing these?
---
He was, it is, it should have been “Black Temple”’ instead of Hyjal
---
He was very popular as a PvPer in Vanilla. That's all I was basing his name drop off of. I don't think any of the OG Vanilla popular names are still playing.
---
That's why I said Swifty.
---
Yeah Molten core. You could enter at 58 and back in the day finding 40 level 60s when you just started raiding was not easy so they'd take some 58+ if they had to
---
fixt

---
What's your reasoning? You might be able to convince others to agree with you
---
I just want my FPS to be high and stable. The game runs pretty horribly in retail for 25-man raids, 40 would be a nightmare if it ran that badly. Not to mention open-world PvP would kill the server like BfA.
---
Yes in raids, lol. You think you’re running around with 5 warriors all specced prot? No. You have dps warriors offtank as needed, just like OP would be doing.
---
58 iirc
---
You should just make both classes. You will have plenty of time to level them each to 60 over the course of Classic. Plan to level one of them at the start and then the other one a bit later, during the downtime you have between raid days.
---
You should level the Rogue first, they are pretty strong from the get-go and don't require much gear (aside from the weapons) to do good damage.
---
Mages on the other hand really need a lot of spellpower gear before they come into their own. They won't have access to good gear until ZG releases, and really need AQ/Naxx gear before they shine.
---
So level the Rogue first and focus on him early. You won't have to put that much time into him. You can level the Mage up on the side. When ZG releases you can start gearing up the Mage.
---
This will also allow you to do more professions. I suggest Tailoring/Enchanting on the Mage and Herbalism/Alchemy on the Rogue. You want to keep Tailoring on the Mage because Bloodvine set bonus (ZG craftable) requires it. Tailoring isn't bad either, it allows you to craft bags and transmute Mooncloth, both of which can earn decent money.
---
Implying there will be a ton of pvp servers with layering.
---
But Blizzard has a lot higher standards you know. They just put hots on live support last year and im pretty sure Hots made more money than Everquest.
---
Show me in the rules of WoW where it says stream sniping is not allowed.
---
&gt;witch-hunt  /ˈwiCH ˌhənt/ (noun)-  a campaign directed against a person or group holding unorthodox or unpopular views.
---
actually, that's precisely what which hunting is. You are all condemning him for his unpopular views about how servers should be handled. Do I agree with him? No, not at all, just to be clear.
---
In a way Soda is kind of like Frankenstein's monsters, people created him, and now the people want to destroy him, it's actually pretty funny when you take a step back and look at it.
---
I'm talking about main tanking
---
That's awesome! Did you ding in specific locations or just general explorations?
---
Oh no please no transmog on a role playing server. If you want to roleplay will certain gear, just keep an outfit in your bank.
---
I'm honestly ok with either. 
---
BC was my favorite expansion. But also I'll be excited for 1.3. If they go BC I hope they make new content after that though, I'd rather not play wrath again
---
I didn't said it is going to die. I said it is going to be canceled, which at this point is become clearer than ever. We are talking about a multi-billion dollar company, and if BfA falls under profitability rate (the layoffs point that this already happened months ago) for too long, they will cancel it.
---
The best you can hope for, is Retail WoW on mobile.
---
Oh I figured it would of been like warrior shaman and then something else.  I knew rogues were awesome in PvP back then with locking someone down,  I kinda don't want to play one because I feel like everyone will again just like last time.  Only reason I was contemplating warrior is because they look fun too,  but to me not as fun as a mage.

Nothing else. They are CHOOSING to obtain information they know they shouldn't be allowed to have by normal means. That is dishonest. It's unfair. It's cheating.
---
We literally just went over this. He is providing information to the public without any restriction or protections for his information to be remain private. He is literally putting information about his location on a website, that provides that information for free to the public with no express or implied legal or social restrictions on how it's used. He has the same protections for creating content as one does for publishing a book that is put into a public library. In fact, he's actually providing fewer restrictions than that and lowering the barrier for people to be to access that information. It's the equivalent of walking down the street with a yellow shirt on and being mad when people see that you have a yellow shirt on. If you don't want someone to know the color of your shirt when you walk outside, put a jacket on. There is nothing unfair or dishonest about it when the information is being handed to you by the owner of that information.
---
I am an officer in a guild on the PVE Alliance .. &lt;Ancient Dragons&gt; We are recruiting day 1, btw..
---
We have 1 partnered streamer, but hes pretty quiet in the g chat, and in fact was invited because he was  a healer in a stocks run.  The other 180 of us dont stream, work for blizz, or any thing. As far as waves go, there was new waves the last 2 days. And none of them have mentioned  being streamers or working for blizz (that m a ware of). They ALL are 2004 Vanilla players tho
---
Omen of Clarity only procs off of melee attacks. It wasn't change to spell casting until late BC / Wrath cant remember when.
---
Enchanting is a money sink for probably 99.x% of players. If you don't grind out rep with timbermaw/argent dawn, or manage to become your guild's enchanter there's a snowball's chance you'll recuperate the investment it took to level to 300/300.
---
You'll always be able to earn money from disenchanting, but there's basically no skill restriction on disenchanting in classic since you can disenchant any item starting at character level 5.
---

"is it just me or..." And "am I the only one " and another fucking druid thread, I usually leave after I've seen about 3 of these on new. They are all exactly the same and the last one had all the replies you need and more.
---
This is insane! Thanks for sharing the links. Good on them for making bank for playing games. Cant believe it!
---
 Sodapoppin got rank one also.
---
This is exactly how we did it. Guild Leader handled big picture stuff (events, meetings, promotions, overall guild stuff) from there we had seperate PvE and PvP leaders who handled scheduling of those events (plus stuff like Loot distribution, and recommendations for promotions), and then Class Leaders who handled recruitment and inspecting performance. 
---
Very rarely did the PvE/PvP leaders need to worry about looking at the meters to see who's underperforming, the CLs would handle that. They could focus on the raiding.
---
GL didn't need to worry about scheduling content besides meetings or guild events.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
People see streams of fanbois ZERGING to be on stream/fuck with streams. So they assume this will apply when streamers want to do a world boss, everyone will zerg it.
---
Afaik, you could enter as early as 57 or 58. My first alt, a night elf rogue, was part of an AQ20 run at lvl 58. Good times...
---
&gt; over sautéed
---
Not sure if this was a typo but it's sick.
---
Ele shaman, purge, offheals, short interrupt or short slow. Can fit a healing, dpsing or more support niche depending on what's happening
---
The raids had some weird level requirements. You had to be lebel 50 to enter MC and AQ and i think 55 to enter BWL
---
So you’re talking about 1 tank out of 40 people, completely gnorkng the 10 other warriors in the raid (one of which OP would be)?
---
MMOs and MOBAs are different genres and different standards of success. Even if WoW only had one million subs, it'd still be the second most subbed MMO.
---
Ya I do, but is there a way of recovering deleted or unavailable clips?
---
Heh, that's preety sad, but i think i still don't care ;) with consumables and enchants you can get 6 procs on auto attack, to that you add a shitty firestone and it could do fine in dungeon with higher gear, which is enough for me (doing also DoT damage). Thank you very much for answering anyways, i couldn't find anyone to tell me if it did
---
I was a bad raider, admittedly, but I didn't use add-ons and did fine... that said, I was in a pretty chill guild back in the day
---
For some reason I had 55 in my head.
---
And part of that truth is that the 2005 image of gaming actually exists. I can literally stand in front of a T-Rex in an Oculus Rift demo. Now that the Rift S and especially the Quest are arriving, that image is even more of a reality.
---
Still going to play the *shit* out of Classic WoW over VR, just thought I'd remark on the state of gaming a bit.
---
The first time I did it was just the first place I could find that would give me exploration experience as it was only half way through the level when I got exploration idea that I thought "man would be cool to ding 60 from exploring of all things" Was terrified of killing mobs and dinging and actually died a few times trying to get there. The one I planned a specific place was actually in TBC as I had this thought in my head of arriving at back temple just as I dinged 70. That one was my favourite.
---
&gt; No guild that wants to be even relatively competitive will bring an arms warrior to a raid.
---
In what world do you think the OP who WANTS TO PLAY CASUALLY is going to be in a competitive raid environment?
---
The layoffs were customer support and esports people, nothing to so with BFA development.
---
Imagine thinking you can make an anti-streamer guild to combat 10+ big streamers and their 100,000+ followers. They’re all rolling on one server. It’s going to be 95% streamers and followers against 5% bad players who can only gank if they stream snipe. It will be a slaughter.
---
Noice
---
insane bro you did this on a warrior nonetheless
---
I'd like this add on, even if I know exactly what I'm going to buy or not, just so that I can hide the spells I don't want yet to clear up the space in the menu.
---
As someone who mains a Resto Druid in Retail, should I focus mostly on that tree in Classic? Or should I hybridise somewhat?
---
Could be, i ran it back in 2005 so I could be wrong
---
Add TBC content as a 1.13 patch, scaled for lvl 60
---
He's right guys! Mages are bad at pvp, and their raid rotation is boring and low dps. Atiesh is a pipedream since everyone knows that Naxx is too hard to ever complete. No one should even bother playing this glorified water-dispenser.
---
Sincerely,

Pvp warrior

Typical low intelligence answer that completely miss the point, moving on.

For someone that says they don't care, you seem to care quite deeply about this.

I started MC on 58 on my priest :D
---
Why not also avoid top end hardcore guilds?

Lol if you think you have a shot at world bosses kn their server
---
Man, I wish I played on your server back in the day. Sounds like good people... I mean, if you like pvp at least, lol
---
handsome as always
---
Leaving the unarmored mounts out of the game removes a level of depth to the timeline of a server for me, hugely disappointing choice.
---
It's nice to see the OG toons on their OG mounts in cities :(
---
That's not what vanilla means to the Wow community what it means hear is #nochanges
---
I've been camped for many an hour. It's unpleasant. The difference is I didn't have an army of zoomers working the virtual sweatshops to make it easier for me to progress in the game. I couldn't call in the calvary to kill the people camping me. I wasn't making a great living while it was happening.

Basically he's encouraging his fans to harass people. It's indefensible. He's exactly what I knew he was.
---
I am thinking about a druid but I have no interest in cat form other than stealthing to objectives and using the utility of it out of fights. 
---
Will that be gimping me majorly in PvP if I want to be a hybrid Healer/Bear in PvP? Basically healing when I can but going into bear to do damage 1v1 or to survive melee more. 
---
I don't plan on tanking raids but I'd like to tank 5 mans and possibly heal raids with this char. Mainly I want to be able to heal well but also PvP without using Cat form. 
---
Idk why but I just never liked the combat of rogues and close range quick strikes like that. If this is a huge issue I might wind up going priest instead.
---
play whatever has better racials and model swap
---
Nah, more so bitching about their fan Bois hanging on every word they say and posting about them 100x a day.
---
Your misunderstanding the context. I'm not saying ganking him in the game is witch-hunting. I'm saying everyone in this thread saying they are going to do that is witch-hunting, 1 person going out of his way to kill a streamer, yeah okay cool, whatever floats your boat, however TONS of people up in arms saying they are going to do it is a little different IN MY OPINION  (I have to say that in caps, because at the end of the day that's, what it is, an opinion, on an anonymous internet forum.)  I 100% agree with your statement that people broadcasting their location are practically begging for it, and I am in no way taking Soda's side. I think everyone involved is equally stupid.

Have you ever had some one come up to you, and start emote chatting, and RP walking to you in an PVP server? People get made fun of for that. 
---
On an RPPVP server, people -can- treat thier own faction with awesome In character respect. While still having the fun of STV wars.
---
Why does the blame/responsibility fall on a streamer for sharing his gaming experience instead of the player using that shared experience to cause grief to that player?

I just can't wrap my head around that mentality. There are plenty of things/people that I don't like in this world, but I don't go out of my way to punish and make things worse for those people.

People have been banned in Blizzard games for using profanity (Blizzard email confirming this). In games where a profanity filter is pn by fucking default. Its embarassing really. Those guys asked why they were banned and blizzards reply included parts from chat, none of it was toxic, just cadual use of shit and fuck. Its embarassing, and the worst part is that some people were defending it saying that just because you can disable the profanity filter didnt mean you were allowed to use profanity. Really?
---
We live in a day and age where you cant say anything. And blizzard is the worst company when it comes to this. The example above, forbidding the ok sign, bragging about their anti toxicity system in overwatch being so good that you can get banned without even getting reported. Smh
---
&gt; He is providing information to the public without any restriction or protections for his information 
---
That doesn't mean they aren't cheating LOL
---
He isn't forcing the information on people so your argument holds no weight. ***They*** are making the choice to seek out information to gain and advantage they shouldn't be able to have. That is called cheating. IT doesn't matter if he's streaming LOL
---
How about testing the Minimum and Recommended Requirements for Legion since that's the backbone of Classic.
---
Streamers are good for classic, tho. They make the world alive with battles and other events and stuff. What gives with the hate?
---
I think you underestimate the amount of people who dislike these dudes. I'm don't care, but there will be plenty of people pissing em off if they continue to bait it.
---
At least they suggest giving it to the streamers that aren't huge piles of douche. Idk how people fan boy and give handouts to Sodapoppin
---
Well, it seems it doesn't scales, but that would have been crazy indeed, i was thinking of a imp ds build which could have been great if it did
---
Nostralia was awesome, i mean there was only like 150 of us, but it was still awesome.
---
stop it
---
With a million+ subs they won't ditch retail.  They may decide to halt further development and move it into maintenance mode but they won't ditch it.
---
I think you're going to be hard pressed to find any guilds that bring hybrid or non-ideal specs to raids. Casual or not.  OP wants the EASIEST solution.  Playing a non ideal spec, trying to find a guild, not having pre-bis due to time constraints is going to be an uphill battle. That's all I'm saying.
---
Is this supposed to relate to the live game or beta?
---
I mean that happened in the past anyways depending on the server and guilds. There were plenty of occasions where both sides clashed during a world boss. It'll just happen slightly more often now. It doesn't mean everyone will be level 60 and can actually hurt you either... a lot of those fanbois you're talking about will be &lt;60 or crap geared. I don't see it being much of an issue until many months after classic releases anymore than it was when world bosses first started popping up and were getting farmed constantly by multiple guilds on the same server. 
---
The creepy cult following though... is creepy.
---
This is the biggest change that still needs to be fixed on beta
---
Fukin awesome
---
Definitely what I was saying. I bet you believe the line any publicity is good publicity too.
---
They can't answer that, anything relating to classic right now is regarding the beta, so they'll answer it like that.
---
Once classic launches you'll have to do exactly the same thing you'd have to do today in order to play in a different region. 
---
I only have an NA account and can not join EU realms unless I make an account and sub.
---
&gt; I feel bad for Streamers
---
Oh those pooooor babies.
---
need a wetwipe?
---
I get being passionate about wow or a hobby. I do. That's why I've played wow for over a decade. Being a little bitch and crying about something that doesnt matter unless you're a complete douchenozzle is annoying. Just dont stream snipe and camp people or wait and see which 2 realms all the streamers make their toons on and go to a different realm. Problem solved. I'm not trying to be cool. I'm trying to be a normal rational person in a sea of man children.
---
Ehhh not really. The streamers will still be hogging the reddit spotlight because their followers are cult slaves. Fanatical to their last breath.
---
Right, he basically called on his followers to harass and blacklist anyone who kills him. That's much better.
---
We can probably assume that with the new engine in classic,, better cast speed detection will also come with it.
---
Tho we all know what assuming does
---
Came here to say this, glad I got distracted by the comments and didn't dupe your post.
---
&gt; If you put your steam online for people to see then you are fair game for stream sniping, don't stream iclassic wow if you cannot handle streaming classic wow, idk what is so crazy about that.
---
Okay so let me get this straight. You think stream sniping is ok because people like soda stream online and therefore they should just accept it without being able to do something about it/defend themselves? 
---
&gt; It is exactly how great games become shitty, people like you who think that the few top should represent the whole of the community
---
Social dynamics like putting people on "kill lists /black lists" were there way before this whole streaming topic and is one of MANY things what made classic wow so incredibly good: An involved community that are actually playing the game instead of just lurking on reddit/forums.
---
And for some reason you act like THE WHOLE SERVER is getting affected by him blacklisting certain people. How do you get to that conclusion? Just don't be an obnoxious stream sniper and be surprised that your reputation for those guilds is "somehow" bad und unjustified.
---
&gt; Your argument for the second consists of, they are good at this other game so they will be the best in this other game, would not hold up to a 5 year old.
---
They are playing a washed down version of the retail version mechanics-wise. Will they be better than psever-players in the beginning? Probably not since those pserver players know every single little detail of the game, but the gap won't be big since a lot of top players from pservers are joining sodas guild.
---
Are they going to be better in the long run? I would say yes. People will catch up on knowledge and the most talented players (Venruki, snutz, cdew, pikaboo, multiple rank1, blizzcon winners and so on) are in sodas guild. 
---
&gt; Their piles of fanbois will barely reach 12, because theyre too busy just following them around, people are going to be tag stealing from them all day every day, people are going to be going after them via pvp all day and they'll likly be much higher in lvl due to not being slowed down the whole way by 100s of people 
---
Those Streamers are already talking about not streaming the first levels. As soon they reach Dungeons the general playerblase wont be able to catch up to them. Good luck leveling as fast as someone who can play 24/7h and simultaneusly pvping those people.
---
These big streamers honestly don't get how privileged they are.
---
They will always prefix their complaints with something like "sure I get some benefits, but...", but they don't actually get that they're essentially playing another game than the rest of us.
---
I'd gladly accept getting ganked half of my playtime if I never had to farm gold, could summon competent players to help me raid, grind, or pvp  whenever I wanted, and could form a raid of random people to just fuck around. This already makes it so they're essentially playing on God mode compared the average Joe. To top it off a normal person's in-game time is way more valuable due to having a normal job taking up a lot of their time.
---
"Oh soda is corpse camping me for no reason? Guess I won't have time to go dungeons today then, hopefully he won't do it again when I get enough time next weekend :')"

Lol boomer snowflakes at it again.  Cross faction collusion is not going to be a bannable offense in classic.  Enjoy feeling like an idiot for a few minutes 😃

Hmm?

BRD is like a ghetto-DME. You can pull the first several rooms just fine.

---
&gt; Even if WoW only had one million subs, it'd still be the second most subbed MMO. 
---
Yes, but you are forgetting how much Blizzard is spending with retail WoW...1 million subs might be damn good for FFXIV and Square Enix, but for Blizzard it's actually quite bad.
---
It's not that I don't like tanking I do. It's fun. It's just I really, really, really, really want Ashkandi. Being the MT I can't really justify taking it and, that hurts my soul.
---
Your a real looser/creep to be a stream sniper. Its essentially online stalking. Yeah I said it , your a creep.
---
Live
---
&gt;They're just loud ass guild leaders.
---
This. With a creepy cult following. If anything, most streamers won't want all those crazy fanatics around them for a multitude of reasons. That, and it's not very different other than reaction speed of someone spying on the other faction, then summoning their entire guild to fight them within 20 minutes time. Now it'll just take like 5 minutes to fully assemble/spy instead : P
---
Which is why they won't fix the problem they have, they'll continue to complain because otherwise they have to actually contribute to conversations.
---
...when playing a videogame where 'robbing' is supposed to happen

That guy is a huge goober.  I don't see the appeal.
---
It is in their terms of service, has been for 15 years. Good luck with your ban ;-)
---
I cant wait to make the run from Menithil to Ironforge again. 13 year me with 2 friends i met along the way made it a adventure.
---
Oh, i guess that makes sense though and thanks for answering my question .
---
The dynamic is much different because he's openly inciting harassment without having a shred of proof that it was stream sniping.
---
I'm really interested in the RP community and would love for Blizzard to implement an RPPVP server. I'm currently reading the books that lead up to the WoW Classic Universe so it would be nice to have a mature community that's also knowledgeable of the lore.
---
As for the community rules, is /1 general chat and /2 trade chat used? If I'm LFG is it encouraged to use the general chat or would I have to look for people and talk to them?
---
&gt; Even if WoW only had one million subs, it'd still be the second most subbed MMO.
---
Not really a hard thing to do if you're the only subscription-based MMORPG out there. I've seen the same thing said when WoW was down to 7 mil subs, then to 5 mil etc. Just how low the sub count should drop for you to admit that the game doing really really poor?
---
But he literally only spam sinister strike and eviscerate, and energy regen is slow af
---
Yeah you need 2 subs to play on both, same as BFA.
---
Yeah but thats what i means to me. I think i was pretty clear in my OP just asking if other people want this. 
---
I mean look at the title .. its self explaining i think. 
---
To ask it again. Do people want servers with addons disabled?
---
My plan is to continue to not watch streamers and have no idea who they are or what their names are so they'll just be like any other player.
---
Huh, i expected it tbh, thanks for answering, i couldn't confirm it anywhere :) But i think i still will try, i know you can add 6 others procs on hit above that, so with some DoT it could be fine for dungeons, with higher gear.
---
&gt;He isn't forcing the information on people so your argument holds no weight.   
---
&gt;They  
---
&gt; are making the choice to seek out information to gain and advantage they shouldn't be able to have. That is called cheating. IT doesn't matter if he's streaming LOL
---
By your incredibly flawed logic, anyone reading a book and using that knowledge to their advantage is cheating.
---
You really do love that staff huh?
---
i have a good life, a very good life, how do you think i can pay something like this ;)
---
My ideal set up is the guild leader at the top, below them is the Raid Leader and Recruitment Leader. Below them is the Class Leaders. Raid Leader says "we want this set up" then class leaders choose their people to fill those slots. Recruitment decisions are made by a council between GM, Raid Lead, Recruitment Lead, AMD appropriate class lead.
---
IDK if I remember correclty, but in my mind is something that in the time he was imprisoned he was not able to see because of some magic guarding his cage, could be wrong though
---
Yeah, cat form is your source of damage/dps. You want to ideally get your bleeds up, shift out, get hots on yourself, go bear repeat when bleeds are down 
---
However, in raids and dps being mainly resto is going to help a ton especially with Mana
---
Thank you for posting this &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Oh because you’ve read the TOS for classic.  I will enjoy playing every day for the next year or more actually. 😃
---
That's actually dope!!
---
As long as they don't give it to a noob.
---
I love that sword so much. I ran diremaul for months trying to get the dragon slaying book with no luck. I then used my money for an epic mount to buy the book from someone, so I never got an epic mount in vanilla lol. 
---
I then began asking/begging the elite warriors on my server if they would let me come to forge the sword with Ony’s breath (no loot, just quest) and eventually the best guild on the server took me along while they killed ony with like ~25 people. I was ecstatic; it was one of my first good epics. 
---
Eventually I started raiding and used the sword until my guild got to aq40, but BC released so I never got to see the last part of aq40 and Naxx.
---
I would look at your own comments too guys - I mean you are being as toxic to people who either like/dislike streamers or people that want to troll them. People can do with their time as they please and I think it is ironic that such hate is being directed in such a fashion.
---
Well yeah, I'm not, so evidently not that hard. What's your point lol?
---
lol backing up soda. he’s such a fuckin pussy streamer and holy shit his music is cancer
---
PvP, 29/11/11 and 30/0/21 are actually both really strong builds and I've had great success with them.
---
It make sense thanks for answering xD
---
Do you know how much Blizzard is spending with vanilla WoW? Is this information publically available?
---
"Asmon-bronze"
---
Is that not a true endgame goal though?
---
I'm not the one comparing getting griefed in a game to rape apologists man
---
 **As it stood in Classic, collusion was bannable. The community should proceed with the assumption that this is bannable unless Blizzard states otherwise.**
---
I feel like dinging 60 on discovery of an enemy city would make a good achievement.
---
Thats not what im saying. Their eyperience will be different griefers or not, being sble to make a group for everything in 2min is a different experience than all of us will have. Its inevitsble that they will have a different experience thsn we do if they are streaming the game. But im just saying thst if they value the genuine experience that much that they can do what we all fo and just play the game.
---
Once you realize the truth, you begin to feel sorry for these full-time streamers. Sure, they get tons of publicity and money for the time-being, but that is only temporary. They’re not spending that time like the rest of us obtaining real-world work experience.
---
I place them in the category of strippers. Big money, entertaining, but long-term, they’re going to need to think about gaining real-world skills or risk turning out like Swifty.
---
This was not copied from the TOS for classic but nice try, see my other comment here.
---
Yeah, thats what the "human component is", its just looking through chat logs and trying to assess the context, its just awful and why as you said, why is that even in the fucking game when there is a profanity filter and mute function available, without any restrictions?
---
I don't even understand what you are suppose to report people for. AFKing in BGs? selling gold? Like does there really need to be an auto-report function highlighter in the UI for that?
---
The only reason the system is highlighted the way it is to be able to mass report people for their speech,which in itself is a non-issue, and especally in Vanilla where you are suppose to have social status so if people act like idiots, they get frozen out and the community self-polices.
---
Besides that, I am 100% certain the system will be mass abused out of spite just as in literally every other game which has unrestricted reporting, gankers will down, streamers, scarab lord race... just awful.
---
#youcannevergohome
---
That's believable, you seem trustworthy and we'll just take you at your word then.
---
If you broadcast your location, you don't get to be mad that people know where you are.
---
So streamers who entertain people that willingly support them don't deserve the same gaming experience that non-streamers do? How can you not question the behavior of those who will streamsnipe to make the streamer's experience worse?
---
Why do streamers deserve to be streamsniped? This mentality speaks volumes about those people who only wish harm to others because of what? Grow the fuck up people.
---
holy/prot Paladin =P
---
Reck bombs with a 2h if the paladin is attacked, blessing of sacrifice basically prevents most CC onto the paladin, and the paladin can cleanse the mage of pretty much any other CC or Freedom/ BOP vs melee.  
---
Not nearly as much burst but you gain a lot of control.  Mage should probably go Frost until you get geared, and then either elementalist (blast wave + shatter) or some other more damage heavy spec. 
---
I'm talking a 2v2 situation here too.. In large group PVP the paladin stays back and heals / supports other folks while the mage can just freecast, and they have their bud to heal if they get jumped
---
I'm gunna spam rank 1 Arcane Intellect on people so they thank me without realising they got a shitty buff :\^)
---
Werd. Upped!
---
&gt;EDIT: I said "done nothing wrong", but if it is a week long camping session, that's obviously griefing. I meant an hour or two here or there is nothing to be banned or suspended over. Maybe if that was everyday, but only then.
---
Someone just gave you an instance where he was griefed for months and you just brushed it off. Do you have a social dysfunction? Like genuinely I wonder.
---
NOW KILL HIM!
---
TBC was peak WoW, imo.
---
They cant accept the reality that classic will have 90% of the playerbase. Because 10 million people will play classic
---
Private servers are nothing near the vanilla experience, and what me and 5 other people are saying about the game here is true. Your single experience on a private server does not match what the actual retail classic experience was like. Nothing personal, but cmon man.

Go find it yourself, I’m sure there’s only 12 or 13 hours of footage to rummage through for a few sentences. 😄
---
it would be wise to find a different game if you can't even decide for yourself what class to play
---
I'm going to get a good night's sleep and miss the launch but instead get up early when people have given up and fallen asleep (the game launches at midnight in the EU)
---
It's almost like... Layering is bullshit and that was never the required "solution".
---
That's 100% on us as a community and not the streamers. I'd be surprised if the higher view streamers even come to this sub.
---
Because its a great way to argue points, you get a point, and you can analyze it and discuss it with the community, he literally pauses like every 5-20 seconds to go over what was just said in the video.
---
The vast majority of people are stupid lemmings. Never forget.
---
Did you never play classic?
---
Yeah I'm going to mage,  was just wondering if they were looking good for PvP,  like balance wise
---
10 million people didn't play classic when it released. Why would they do so now?
---
Don't give them shit. They're greedy as hell with everything they have. Source: in beta
---
"THANK YOU SO MUCH [USER] FOR THE TIER 1 SUB. LET'S GET SOME HYPE IN CHAT GUYS COME ON"
---
forgets 5 seconds later
---
so we’re gonna have a streamer server, rp server, pvp server, rp pvp, pve, and your no addons server? seems a bit much
---
Yeah but if DPS is patient why would the tank need a threat meter? Am i missing something ? I mean thats how we do it in DAOC we give the tank time to get so much aggro that we can dps until infinity without getting aggro. I know some bosses are on a timelimit but like all the DPS in daoc learned when its time to take a litte damage break.
---
Honestly, what that guy said was straight up gulag. China's oppressed \[sometimes even to death\] citizens would be totally happy seeing, we're willing to copy their super effective social credit system. I almost vomited there...
---
I eventually caved on *Fractured* when there was a sale, but for me it lost a lot of its charm.     
---
I'm a swords and sorcery sort of game player, not so much a sci-fi or comic book guy. So the super hero theme, combined with the updated combat system (an increase in complexity, a downgrade in enjoyment IMO) made it a bit of a miss for me. I think I've made it through maybe 20% of the game, and I'm not sure I'll ever finish it.
---
There is no human component, i dont care what they say. Streamers have proven time and time again that its not. Every time a streamer tries to test this and asks his audience to all report him he gats banned in an INSTANT. I've seen wow streamers do this and i've seen hots streamers do this.
---
I once rerolled an alt female UD rogue to my main male UD rogue for that reason specifically :P
---
Leaving Northshire with almost a gold when the average vendor loot for a kill is like 3c to 5c? No fucking way. Have you done this exact strategy on the actual beta?
---
You said it. We all think it.
---
Careful. In the soddapoppin thread I got down voted and told that I have deep rooted social issues, and that I was probably bullied for thinking that ganking lowbies is part of the game and I had nothing wrong with it, lol.
---
Esh. I try to avoid em. I watched Esfrand try to BG as a healer in ret gear, and ret spec.. and nopped out. 
---
Hes got a pretty good YouTube channel, but nothing to stalk.  Im in the beta, and happily on the PVE server away from all the twitch spammed trade chat. thank goodness
---
Classic wow goals.
---
For leveling, go feral, its one of the best leveling specs in the game. At 60, deep swiftmend is where most druids start out, but as your druids get more geared many switch over to a balance/resto hybrid called moonglow spec that has better mana efficiency for raid healing. It basically depends on a ton of factors.
---
I meant the Restoration talent tree.
---
Why is there a XP bar still there if it's vanilla?
---
I did. I love it and i can't wait to play it when it comes out. I am just juggling with ideas, this post was not meant to be an insult to the classic community.
---
But i guess i have no say in that.
---
Note that 400 g at 60 is basically impossible at launch, because there's just not enough gold in the market if you hit 60 in anything remotely like a timely manner. 
---
Basically, there are two principles that contradict each other:
---
-People have less gold now so you should acquire more gold now instead of later, so you can take advantage of cheaper prices. 
---
-People have less gold now so you should hold on to valuable items until later to increase the amount of gold you can get from selling them.
---
Working the balance between selling stuff now so you can get gold to buy while things are cheap, and holding on to profitable items for later so you can sell when things are expensive is the balance you'll have to manage.
---
Out of the loop here. What the heck is a pog?
---
When classic was original, most players didn't raid at all.
---
They did some dugeons, they did some pvp, they worked their professions, they leveled alt after alt after alt.
---
Things will likely be a bit different this time around, Most likely as a casual who wants to raid, your going to basically be one phase behind.  As the guild progesses in the new content, you'll join the farm team that is running the older raids, and trying to gear up the rest of the guild.
---
Don't expect to be scarab lord as a casual, don't expect to be server first to get an a legendary artifact, don't expect to be main tank on progressive raid content, but over time,  you'll end up geared out as long as you keep playing.
---
Playing the class you want to play, virtually garuntees that you will play long enough, to get all the gears eventually, no matter what class/spec/race/faction you've choosen.
---
But it's still lazy content. 
---
And his points that he argues are usually regurgitated comments from below the original video.
---
I appreciate he has an audience that likes that. Just not for me :)
---
If someone will approach me with the words: "will you join MY guild?" I will say no.
---
I am not in anymore into becoming part of a guild that is lead by a despot, that will quantify "success" in their terms and their terms only, because it is THEIR guild.
---
It is either "our" guild and some form of democratic decision process, filled with humble people that value other peoples decisions and values or I rather have my own bank guild and a friends list for the occasional dungeon or elite mob.
---
I am also way too old for guild drama, I had my fair share of that. 
---
If there is ONE thing I do not miss from Vanilla, then it is all the bad shit that happened in and with guilds, guild leaders, guild banks etc.
---
I will not put anything into a guild bank ever again except if  I am fine with throwing it away for nothing and having someone steal it and laugh at all the idiots who collected it.
---
Friends work in Wow just fine without guilds.
---
The burdon of proof is on the person making claims.  It's my not job to make your argument for you, clown.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Dude this post had me dying
---
Unpopular opinion and rightly so (because people should get to choose how they want to play)
---
I'd love if any questing addons weren't able to be used, questie, monkey etc... would be great going in and having new classic players actually explore instead of streamlining questing (as much as you can) and having everyone just have the same exact experience.
---
Yeah, Mechagon also looks pretty cool. Return to Karazhan was dope, easily my all-time favorite dungeon, and Mechagon is supposed to be a spiritual successor to it. My only gripe is that from what I hear that tanking isn't "fun" - and tanking was my favorite thing to do in MoP/WoD/Legion.
---
I loved tailoring and herbalism. Herbs we're always needed at every level. Potions are literal crack in vanilla. Grave Moss and Briarthorn were great money makers. Bags later on were pretty good too.
---
\#PERMADEATH
---
The mods need to treat streamer posts the same way they treat all "low effort" posts.
---
No they're not. If people like soda have competent accountants he'll never have to work a day in his life. Given the amount of money some of these people make and how long they've been doing it, if it's invested in even a decent way, they'll be just fine.
---
Are you PVP focused or PVE?
---
PVP focus basically means you take divine favor and reckoning, leaving you 21/25/0 with 5 points leftover.  I tend to like putting at least 4 points into holy, possibly getting Blessing of Sanc as well to help your PVE utility or if you're in AV for the tank =P
---
I PVP a lot as holy/prot paladin with near BIS gear and it is a ridiculously strong group support class.   If you want a more detailed PVP breakdown of talents let me know I can copy paste something I wrote before
---
Exactly. It’s a video game. People who get upset over it need to go outside more.
---
Yeah, everyone who managed to turn their hobby into a source of income deserve to get sniped. Every game which has security breaches also deserves to be hacked. Because cheating is great and people hating on streamers surely aren't just jelly fucks 👌
---
That’s true, unfortunately I’m not going to do that level of work for you, I did enough of a courtesy putting the correct information out there.
---
Ohh well one more cant hurt. Any streamer servers can easily be avoided if you look up the name of the server they are playing on.
---
If there would be a statistic for a server with least amount of addons used i would simply join that one.
---
Dont think I can trust someone who doesn't believe eyes of the beast is not worth buying.
---
^ Pedant
---
Balance? It's the same as Vanilla - they are strong, much like rogues, locks and warriors :)
---
Feral druid is one of the least gear-dependant classes in the game, this is it's biggest strength, and weakness. At lower levels it makes it extremely strong, but this is also what contributes to it's falling off in the very late end-game. 
---
Resto gears up basically the same way as every other healer; its pretty hard to compare it to hunter.
---
Sodapoppin is such a little bitch it's actually ridiculous. Don't stream or play in a PvP server if you don't want to get ganked. Simple as that.
---
Yo if u dm me I *definitely won't* PayPal you for your acc info :)
---
Cool man! Im so glad you didn't miss the screenshot xD
---
20 servers seems extremely low considering the hype for Classic.
---
Ok fun police, make sure you step on others enjoyment to make sure they conform to what you think Classic should be.....fascist.
---
god damn... i wonder what the most obscure way to hit 60 is in the whole game?
---
None. Ongoing addon development was a part of Vanilla. NOCHANGES.
---
Let's start off by saying I'm glad your buying all the spells I feel it makes the game alot more enjoyable while leveling. The way I use MC is on an elite mob that I can't solo. So I just MC it and run it into other mobs in the area until it's low on health and then once MC falls off just finish the remaining health.  Yes I know it's limited because it only works on humanoids but it has made  some quests and clearing dungeons  a good chunk easier.
---
I was thinking about this this morning. What I'm looking forward to most in Classic is all the ways I can grief alliance scum. 
---
Blizzard has made several QoL changes after people QQ'd on the forums like having high level city guards, making Twinks be put in their own bracket, etc. It ruins so much of the fun for the people who are tanking cities and twinking.
---
I fully expect that when I sign up to play on a PvP server I will be ganked relentlessly by the Alliance while leveling up. The fun comes from once I finally get high level I can then bully the alliance like I was bullied. World PvP is going to be alive and well and I'm extremely excited for it.

if phase 1-6 be released after 18-22 months a raid will need additional 4-6 months to equip all raid member with items. 40 member each 6-10 items and only one raid id per week make the math. you will have over 2 years game content.
---
That's the joke
---
I've been watching beta streams just to get hyped and every time someone takes a mining vein that a streamer has their eye on or a chest, it's like a massive crime. I saw Asmongold and Esfan shouting at a dude going "suck my dick" because the dude took a chest near them whilst they were in combat. 
---
It's OG WoW. This shit happened.
---
So how do you rate written criticism, generally the exact same in context and use, but also one of the longest forms of content historical? Lazy is a harsh word for the updated version imo
---
What is this? An actual Bug Reporting? How unheard of! 
---
Just kidding. Very interesting. This really needs to be seen by the Devs Asap.
---
Streamers and their followers refusing to group with me sounds like a bunch of vegans boycotting a BBQ restaurant.
---
Whatever dude, go make your little revenge groups, flex them muscles on stupid neckbeard streamers and spoiled manchilds. Yeah, be a big boy. I know people with your streamer problems from work and god they are the biggest douchebags. If you remain that focused on a concept comparrison it is clear your mind is super limited to the in your face levels of that comparrison and not the conceptual flawed logic used in defending stream sniping and saying that streamers should go pve, the same they say about you, that you should stop it. Who is more entitled to their oppinion them or you? It’s rethorical both groups are stupid as fuck.
---
He should watch Esfand, he's got all the beta keys
---
I'm just going to play at work
---
***by the actual values that were present in vanilla wow.
---
Thanks for the reply! 
---
I'll probably be playing mostly a support role, depending on what my friend's guild will end up doing.
---
If you want a caster for PvP go Mage. Or shadow priest.
---
Shadow Priest has a higher skill ceiling but Mages are easier to perform on PvP wise.
---
Well I guess it's about to be time to wreck face!
---
This relates to classic how?
---
Looks like we’re both idiots, but long story short shadowmeld cannot be used in combat and is useless for druids.
---
The spec was based around the druid staying in caster form and using a 2h mace to melee. Warlock and druid both dot up multiple targets (druid using moonfire and insect swarm) voidwalker tanks what it can, druid melee's for clearcasting procs for free regrowth on lock so their Mana stays topped off.
---
Plus, it wouldn't even so anything. All the information is publically available on the internet, so the only thing banning quest addons would do is make people alt tab to a website more often.
---
Dude, what's wrong with the other thread?
---
Why do you feel the need to create another thread on the same topic? Do you need attention that much?
---
I like this answer
---
Bob and Joe.
---
People still get banned daily for cross faction on PVP realms on retail, it was in the TOS for classic back in vanilla or are you just wanting to peddle the delusion that you will be part of some server mafia?
---
No problem, the one thing i would like to emphasis is that these people you see that have 1000+ subs are quite literally the 1% of twitch, probably even higher. 
---
I forget the exact metric but there was a stat floating around saying if you stream on twitch, and you get over 200 viewers on avg while streaming, you are within the top 1% of twitch streamers, there soooo many other people out there with 0-1 viewers like you wouldn't believe. 
---
So really people like asmond, esfand, toast(hearthstone streamer) are the 1% OF the 1%, so even smaller group of people.
---
Sorry, could you explain in more detail?
---
Rules are being applied equally. If you're having a LAN party with your friends and one of your friends is screen peeking the others to use an advantage to kill them, it's also seen as shitty behavior. 
---
&gt;tbh I hope they just ban streaming on all but a handful of servers, so that actual people can play in peace.
---
This entire discussion is depressing as hell because literally none of your points have argumentative merit, they're all just weak appeals to emotion.
---
This is ironic as hell. Calling me out for ''weak appeals to emotion'' when you have some inherent sad negative bias against streamers and streaming in general. Take a step back and don't let your jealousy cloud your mind that much, buddy.
---
Won’t be as bad due to layering, simply put they will layer enough people at a time to be able to have a reasonable leveling experience. Not expecting it to be a huge success but it will make it doable.
---
Ok I thought you were being dismissive of criticism as a whole, and I agree that it is of no where near the level of those you quoted
---
Umm, leveling your weapon skills on a rat?  Is this a private server thing?  Pretty sure back in the day you couldn't level skill on mobs that were gray.  That's why everyone would go to the Badlands and hit those Servant mobs, one because they never would die and they would always be in ranged of "XP" gains for end game.
---
Except on PvE there is recourse for straight griefing. Blizz wont allow someone to shut down a zone or zones for any long period of time and not let others play the game without a possible pvp solution.
---
Love it. The language of a true vanilla player.
---
Like the guy before you said, they would just alt tab anyway - let those that want to, have to do that.
---
There is no controlling someone's experience... if anything having quest addons in the game does that exact thing- everyone on the same path always from day 1 until the end. (Real different there bud :)
---
* yes
---
* they all take some time, but mining, herbalism, or tailoring are your best bets
---
* yes, since most of what it requires is mining anyways
---
* its' mostly ores, but sometimes you'll need arcane dusts or leathers too. just look at a vanilla (max is 300 or higher if gnome) list of recipes and standard craftables
---
Thanks for the answer. 
---
So you think the Warrior is not going to adapt at all to my playstyle?
---
Honestly I have no rush in leveling. But I would like to avoid arriving to 60 and finding out that I just have to raid in order to have gear (***I know that's a kid's assumption since its WoW and raiding is one of the main thing, I will try to do my best to find a casual guild***)
---
I would. Unfortunately atiesh requires a lot of mats and there are quite a few classes that can use it.
---
*scratching head*
---
You can't get a mount until 40, I'm not sure I understand this argument. You mean you wouldn't want to go any further than 40 without a mount?
---
I'll be the savage here and say that I'm gonna work that day (probably even overtime) and then log in and play when I get off work that night. Will probably even have to wait for it to install like a scrub... Sure, I'm excited... but unfortunately I dont have the luxury of taking off of work for that shit.
---
Indeed so. I'm glad someone has found it or this could've been abused by many.
---
Also the random 1 energy gain might be some artifact from backporting modern Energy regen back to the original energy chunk perhaps?
---
Tidal charm and engineering are things the Rogue could also have, though.
---
In Vanilla PvP, being an Orc Warlock felt like a world of difference compared to any Alliance Warlock. It's crazy how drastically the matchup changes when you trade in an enemy's 5 second fear immunity for a 30% stun resist on yourself.
---
Tank dungeons for instant groups and don't take DPS warrior or paladins. Take all strength mail/plate for yourself. Win.
---
I would suggest u can have fun and enjoy the game as every class,no matter how many hours you will be playing.
---
Warrior is kinda gear dependant and die example shines with raid weapons. But u can craft yourself the arcanite reaper or farm alteractal weapon which are both fine.
---
If you manage to get yourself a healer buddy  ( blessing of freedom op) u will have much fun
---
The hero Azeroth deserves...
---
The classic crew is small and does not involve the kind of positions used for creating new content. There is a huge difference between having a script you're following to a tee with already created content and tables and assets, and creating entirely new stuff.
---
Not getting that i was refering to the flawesd logic used in that rape argument with the flawed logic in the sniping arguments showed me you understand only surface things in a disscussion, and yes that type of associtation in flawed logic is the same.
---
Camp who ever the fuck you want, it's a pvp server. Part of being on a pvp server is having the ability to call out for help if someone is griefing you. Bring it back to classic days, where people knew exactly who not to try and gank because they had the ability to call groups of players at a whim to aid them in battle. Ganking and camping is apart of the game doesnt matter who you are, dont stream if you're afraid of being camped all day
---
Don't mind me, just joking about creating a streamer hunting guild to harass people on and off stream.
---
Guys, it's not a witchhunt!
---
Watching what retail has become, and having in mind how vanilla was, I think any addon that its propose is to skip social interaction should not be allowed. 
---
They already said that addons that “play for you” will not be allowed, which is nice.
---
Personally I would not allow addons like questi and alaike, I think they enter somewhat in the skip social group, but probablybthey are going to allow them

Nah I did it just to annoy you.

You sell a stacks of 5x things for 20c and the wolves drop 2-3 things sometimes. You can fill up a backpack pretty quickly killing level 1 wolves
---
&gt; If we have classic why would we play some weird version of it? 
---
This. It is logical. But some people don't get it.
---
What they also don't get is that the vast majority if current retail players will rage quit if things like LFR, LFD, Titanforging are removed from the game.
---
Blizzard can't "just" redesign Retail WoW more in line with Classic without removing core features that will led to a massive dropout in subs from those that are adamant against.
---
But some people just don't get it.
---
I usually work until 11pm on Monday, going to slide my shift to finish at 10, then taking Tuesday and Wednesday as leave. Off work Thursday, Friday and Saturday anyway, and I can take the laptop in to the office on Sunday. Should be enough time to get myself set.

We're going to need 2 rppvp servers since they won't allow you to have Horde and Alliance on the same server. :/

Thanks.

I've heard of Arcanite Reaper.

Is engineering also a good option that can let me make some money too?

It being legal makes it an acceptable act? Everybody hates paparazzis for a reason, and now if you have a smaller online community where it's possible to call out people who are being obviously shitty to others, people like those paparazzis absolutely should be blacklisted.
---
Right, only 8 million by the time bc launched
---
that's a pretty great way to hit 60!
---
To claim they deserve that or to wrong them for the actions of other trying to grieve them is missing the whole point. The assholes in this situation will always be the snipers, to think otherwise go to shows whats wrong and why we have toxic communities.

---
I think your criteria of “skip social interaction” is a good one.
---
You've made the rape apologists comparison in multiple posts. Your so confused on your actual point I can't even tell what your arguing, but you use big words and horrible spelling.
---
Here's the tldr: don't wanna get sniped, don't stream. Morality of the actions don't matter, it's a god damn video game, and it's not against the rules of said game. 
---
I don't stream snipe, personally, it's not fun. But I don't see anything wrong with it when it's completely within the content creators power to NOT get sniped, especially with the knowledge that it can and probably will happen. 
---
If they don't wanna get pvpd, play pve. I want to pvp, I'll play on a pop server. I'm not gonna stop ganking someone cause they said stop when they chose to roll on a server that's specifically designed to have these confrontations
---
only on mages and druids though
---
Filthy casuals who don't care how terrible their PC specs are will be able to play WoW.
---
Oh fuck off, that's not in any way comparable at all. Don't pretend that streaming was anywhere as huge as it was back in the day, and stream sniping was a common. I don't like the streamers and their entitelment myself, but don't act like it isn't completely different environment for them than it was back then. Pulling 1,000 viewers was considered godly back in the day, now the main guys are pulling 50k+ consistently.
---
In a day and age where any game that comes out is utterly beaten to absolute death and non-existence by a group of hardcore players - Yes, I'm sure some guild will do it. There are groups out there prepping super hardcore. It's wild dude. There is also a TON of information available since there is 3+ years of it out there
---
Hopefully before the 12th so people can coordinate with their guilds/friends.
---
When the name reservation opens up no one wants to waste time coordinating with friends/guilds and then loose their name on the server they finally pick.
---
Wait did you read the satire fake post and think it was legit? Lmao
---
They’re inviting in waves and there will be more invites
---
Thanks, happy cake day!
---
There's some craftable gear for warrior that's pretty good, but that's another huge time sink for mats/gold. 
---
I'd say it's one of the more gear dependant classes in vanilla. You could still have fun doing it tho. There will be plenty of people in blues doing BGs early on, and it won't be impossible to get the early rank gear with minimal time.
---
sorry mr red shirt guy, maybe it was called mortal strike? i haven't touched wow since 2005, excuse me! re-cast timer as in there was no cool down on the ability, they added a cool down so you couldn't just spam it if you had 100rage
---
tbh i hope not, that's such a huge advantage for pvp in an addon if they'll be able to detect pushback and other things too now in classic. The originals was atleast ok since they was only useful for detecting what spell was being cast
---
It definitely feels like a rounding error, yeah.
---
Can't remember the details but one of my old toons a long long time ago dinged maxed level in the middle of a nasty pvp brawl (don't remember if it was in BG or outside).  I was about to die and then got a last second kill somewhere, dinged, went full health/mana or something and then walked over them.
---
Thats what I am used to with my WoW content.
---
i am in no way dismissive - because he does Critique - rather than sit staring at a screen.
---
but this has brought about a younger audience to himself - which also has quite a volitile nature - us classic veterans are older now - more mature - i can see why we have problems with his content - or I do - because back in the day we had the content i mentioned
---
also shout out to Jesse Cox's old channel OMFGCata &lt;3
---
if asmon started putting his theory crafting into classes rather than ADHOC reactions to whats trending - id give him more attention
---
CA is (one of) the most expensive state(s) to live in. Consider TN or small towns in KY, etc. You can live on 700-900 total monthly costs and still live comfortably and save. Rent is very, very cheap, especially if you have a roommate.
---
If you're playing Mage, go frost and find a Warrior or Rogue as a partner.
---
Stream Sniping is not cheating, it's not using external software in any way that modifies the games code to give you an unfair advantage, I don't understand the salt? If someone in your guild tells you that the allaince are planning to raid orgrimmar in 30 minutes, is that cheating too?
---
"Bring the player, not the class". Stupidest design paradigm I've ever heard of. I can't believe people praise Ghostcrawler when he was responsible for that. 
---
Aside from LFR/LFD, I think "bring the player not the class" was the biggest downfall of the direction retail took. Everything ties into it - fun unique utility, class identity, raid balance, encounter design - when you strip away what the class brings, you strip out an essential MMO mechanic.
---
Or crazy fucking idea here - maybe people should have some sense of decency and honor? Why should assholish behavior where people spend 90% of their effort on looking at an out-of-game source to gain intel and then kill someone based on it be accepted? In real life it's obviously tough to ''blacklist'' people who are being assholes but not strictly doing anything illegal, but when we have a chance to oust such people in an online community, it absolutely should be done.
---

---
BiS/near BiS hunter who does dungeons and PvP
---
There is a whole industry around people who give a fuck about that stuff.
---
People played dogshit specs when the game was actually hard because we were all terrible at the game and it was fine. People playing dogshit specs now when the content is 100% trivial due to us being way better players isn't going to matter at all.
---
You're only going to need warm bodies to clear content, the specs aren't going to matter.
---
People that hate them so much they will intentionally roll on their server for the chance to gank them a few times, knowing they will be camped by thousands of mindless followers? I doubt it. 
---
Just look at the beta. Beta was random yet the streamers and their followers are the only ones capable for gathering 400+ people together to control the server. It will be even more imbalanced on live. 
---
People should just roll on a random server and enjoy classic. Knowingly picking the streamer server with sniping in mind = you’re gonna have a bad time.
---
Parrying gives you 1 energy.
---
And defending them and their vain and boring "content" is just plain pathetic.
---
I played on a private server myself so i definitely can see people having all the information and being totally prepared. It just seems to be that some things will require at least a reset in order to down Rag. I guess ill have to wait and see!
---
Lionheart helm was where it was at. If you had those plans you were rich as fuck.
---
A real power move.
---
Ya they are different communities now. They should just treat them as different games.
---
From what I've seen and heard through Nostalrius, as I dont have very many memories of druid knowledge in vanilla, druids are not incredibly gear dependent. I wont be able to elaborate much on that, but I think from a pvp stand point it wont take much to notice big improvements.
---
Druid leveling is very smooth. I would put it at a close third to hunters and locks, from the nostalrius experience I've had. If the mobs were 2 levels below me, I could pull 3-4 at a time, thorns burned down a significant chunk of health from the.mob I wasnt attacking, and I could war stomp out if I needed to heal, shift back and finish the pack. Felt pretty efficient. Hunter is objectively faster, but you arent leveling a warrior as a second character, so I wouldnt be too worried about it.
---
&gt;Its easier for Blizzard to just do no extra QoL stuff and let everyone decide for themselves if they want addons to improve their experience.
---
And when people have addons for castbars, buffs, HP and mana pool etc, is that not a problem?
---
If Blizzard had balls, they would have disables addons from classic entirely.
---
I get they're less dependent on weapon, but do they not benefit from the agility, strength, and stamina?
---
Hunter is less gear dependent because their pet doesn't scale with their stats.
---
I just re-checked the video, the first 1 extra energy has no parry near it. I don't think the second one does either.
---
being "killed" in a video game is now to be considered a heinous crime akin to actual real life sexual assault.
---
this sub has reached a new level of insanity.
---
But those are the means by which they are providing a life for themselves. Why are you so quick at imposing unwritten rules for them if you don’t want unwritten rules imposed on you?
---
Yep, Blizzard is making a mistake by enabling addons.

That "early on" you said is not going to work on me.
---
I honestly think i'm going to play maximum 1 hour per working day and 2 hours per day on weekends. 
---
So, 100% I'm going to have 60 at least 3-4 months after launch
---
Perhaps yeah. Well Good job and good luck finding more bugs. :D Wish i could join but luck wasn't on my side.
---
Look at you! We all are all very aware how little you care now.
---
Yeah. I enjoy his content and hope he has a great experience. I actually like to watch Asmon too, but I’m pretty miffed about Soda and I think knocking some of these streamers down a peg is a good thing. It’s easy in that bubble of sycophants giving you money and hanging on your every word to get too self-important. There needs to be balance and for that you need balances. Enter: PvP yanking guilds reveling in being on a black list.
---
You are the mvp with such a response. Last thing how difficult are rogues to play and gear compared to warrior
---
&gt;1. World Bosses - As they're going to be contested by both factions, does killing a world boss basically boil down to who gets bored of killing the opposing faction first?
---
Is there any strategies that guilds employ to allow them to kill world bosses without the opposing faction contesting them?
---
I know that raiding parties often get interfered with by the opposing faction, but I don't see this being as big of an issue because you're not trying to fight a boss whilst simultaneously dealing with players trying to kill you.
---
Lol get ready :)
---
&gt;2. I imagine the wPvP experience is good on a fresh server, as players are roughly the same level and opposing players will be occupied with levelling, rather than ganking low level players. Will this experience degrade over time as more players hit 60 and meme gank low levels?
---
There will be people ganking lower levels all the way throughout the leveling experience, first character will be the easiest but good luck on alts!
---
Keep in mind honor system doesn't come in until phase 2 (few weeks after launch) world PvP activity will skyrocket when honor system gets implemented since BGs aren't in until phase 3.
---
&gt;3. Will PvE Servers thrive as much as PvP Servers?
---
Good players generally gravitate towards PvP Servers, but will there still be a competitive raiding scene on PvE servers? 
---
PvE servers will be super populated and some will thrive more than pvp servers.
---
Population and faction balance are what matters here. 
---
PvE servers will have plenty of competitive guilds.
---
All this is based off of Vanilla as I never got into Private servers.
---
That that back sir
---
They're fun spells. I think the commenter means to say that if you are min/maxing to the point of passing on fun spells just to save 48s then you're not his/her type of player.

I can imagine a hardcore guild going in with a half dozen tanks so that they can simply rotate through them as they die due to lack of resistances.
---
expectationed subvertified
---
1. Yeah it's gonna suck, frequently. That's how it was back then and how it will be this time too. Then again maybe A/H will strike a cooperative moment and take turns or something. 
---
2. Ganking isn't as bad as you think, at least not back in the day. For a popular Streamer.. it may very well suck for them. The pvp will be totally fine on a fresh server, albeit populated and possibly an even-leveled clusterfuck.
---
3. They all will thrive, IMO
---
By then, Warlocks will be dominating PvP anyway.
---
&gt; I know everyone has a shitty opinion about it but what else do you expect people to talk about right now?
---
Ban one of the few relevant things they can talk about, and then complain that they're talking too much about streamers... maybe if they weren't banned from talking about post-Naxx content, there would be fewer posts about streamers?
---
No trap launcher in vanilla and they fall off harder than other classes earlier in the tiers.
---
Isn't is most beneficial to hunters?
---
Private server players seem to think so even though most things on those servers are wrong. They can't even get leveling right so you'll have zero lvl60s after a week and definitely not 40.
---
I'm pretty sure Xperl unit frames were in vanilla.  I know for sure they were in TBC.
---
I remember doing this. 
---
There was also a time when my friends got into Hyjal. We had a lock with us with. So we would jump into the water that was under Archi's skeleton and swim down to the bottom. With water breathing and summoning we would ask anyone in the major city if they wanted a summon to Hyjal just to end up drowning them when they accepted the summon. 
---
The water was too deep to swim up before drowning at that time. But a lock that gave water breathing to everyone... fun times. You would get the graveyard in either, Winterspring or Azshara.
---
That's if you only bring one non viable spec. The odds are is that it's going to be more than one person that wants to come with a poor spec. Where do you draw the line? And yes, bringing a bad comp into BWL/AQ40/Naxx can easily add 30 minutes at the best, and impossible to finish at the worst
---
Lmao so yes someone else must not enjoy the way they want to play the game because someone else enjoys making their life mission to consistently grief someone. So someone else is allowed to enjoy their game one way and because they stream they can’t enjoy theirs. It makes a lot of sense I’m glad you are using some good logic and explanations.
---
You’re anti streamer it is very clear, not sure what you hate so much about them but you are clearly biased against them no matter what the outcome or behavior is
---
I would imagine mages would take priority over the others simply due to them contributing more to the raid overall.
---
Id let my wife fuck him.
---
by streaming, you are giving the in-game enemy knowledge of your location.
---
are you expecting players on a PvP server to not use any possible advantage?
---
Oh shoot, I love canadians. You all are the coolest! (One of my best online friends is canadian)
---
Beta is a terrible way to judge it, but I can agree to an extent.
---
Warlocks and Mages are simplistic to play, rogues are rogues, only try hards have the ability to gear a warrior, and no one cares about hybrid DPS. 
---
Hunters are both easy to level and have a very high skill cap compared to other vanilla classes. So it attracts casual players who can't play the class very well. It's also just a really funny pun to call them huntard.
---
probably a dumb question. Why wouldnt they have FR gear?
---
Saying you are going to stream snipe gank him is no more witch hunting than doing it, not at all. All of these people are saying it as individuals, out of their own will to do so because Soda said something arrogant and entitled on his stream. Soda is really the only one at fault here, if he had said nothing on the topic he would not get ganked as much as he will at launch now.
---
I just want to wpvp and to let me live blizzard.
---
Frankly a lot of ppl do still care since the topic of streamers is constantly brought up here and the forums.
---
That would be interesting indeed. I'm from Europe! 
---
In case count me in :)
---
You could start with a resto build that specs into Feral charge, with a few points in balance, so that 31 in resto will be fine for raiding and you wont have to respec. Then once you get some gear you could go into the balance spec.
---
Fuck this made me want to play so bad
---
YoU muSt Be FuN aT pArtIes !!!
---
Except that is not how it works. There is already a rivalry between Horde and Alliance streamers on the beta server. They would not do anything to help the opposing sides streamers, who are competing against them.
---
&gt;In the first 40 levels the zones are rarely cross faction 
---
You can't turn on warmode until 20.  I was doing Outlands by the time I decided to turn it off.
---
&gt; because of sharding you should be more likely to see other people, because it groups together the small amount of people in zones across lots of servers into one shard to make them feel more populated, not less.
---
Yes, that's what I expected, instead I got single player simulator 5000.
---
I get where you coming from but same problems in other mmos and they work it out via skill and knowledge just fine.
---
Big True
---
I didn't RP but I spent pretty much 100% of my WoW time on RPPvP servers (Maelstrom).
---
If you plan to go feral/resto hybrid, you MUST skip it in order to get Nature's Swiftness.
---
If you dedicate yourself to feral, it's a great bonus and you shouldn't pass it up.
---
Of course, you can go feral/resto hybrid and pick up LotP, and then at 60 respec to skip it.  You won't have Nature's Swiftness until 60 in that build anyway.
---
its literally already happened and confirmed
---
Yeah, man. A big part of why they fell behind, besides general stat-increases in gear and scaling, is due to not really having items that give them "extra hits" from any kind of talent specialization, items like Hand of Justice, and a few others that potentially grant extra hits. That and they can't take advantage of Windfury either. They're still a great class, and I totally plan on playing one again, albeit might not be my Main again. 
---
I actually wasn't a fan of trap launcher, and very much enjoyed people coming to me to attempt to play in my deadzone and regretting the choice. If they didn't Trinket out of it then destroy me.... that was the ONE thing I hated that I feel fucked up Hunters in pvp... Trinkets. We lost the ability to get the necessary head start in fights because of that fucking thing. Sure we had a trinket too, but movement impairment abilities were spammable by anyone and lasted at least 10 seconds. Sorry to rant....
---
Keys? Like dungeon/raid keys or bis lists/guides
---
I have a master plan to troll the other healing classes. Most guilds will have at least 2 druids. I will conspire with the other druid(s) to take turns playing quarterback for eachother:
---
The Druid playing QB will roll max rank hots specifically for the Druid playing receiver to swiftmend them off. Both/all innervates will go to the receiver if he needs them, and he might, because he will wear max healing gear with no regard for mana regen. 
---
Like this, there will always be some orange at the top of the healing meters and all the sniping nerds will be BTFO. 
---
*****disclaimer, this is obviously only for farm raids not for progression.
---
watching a publicly available stream is "cheating" lmao are you serious
---
Ron Jeremy's son?
---
I can’t wait for real talent points and visiting my trainer and making poisons
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k_6w2hxSgQA
---
I think this is most of them? Good video nonetheless. Defcamp and Melderon are good boys.
---
This guy very clearly dislikes streamers and doesn’t want to admit that consistently ganking them for clout and to grief isn’t healthy for the game. And it isn’t against the rules doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be up for discussion. There’s reasons stream sniping is actually a bannable offense on twitch and in many games.
---
Yeah if those are the hours even months into launch you'll not be able to join raids that much - while 60 play is all about what hear you have, don't try and be competitive- just accept that you'll be undergeared and start enjoying other parts of the game, farming, professions, twinks at lower levels would definitely help your play schedule too :)
---
Sorry, I wouldn't know, I've only leveled one Rogue in vanilla, Loved it in PvE, but turns out I didn't like how they played in BG's, wanted a class that was more focused on wins instead of bragging rights.
---
I don't think I would shift out of bear form to war stomp.
---
Mainly because I'll be NE.
---
A decent pre raid BiS list should show you what you want to get. I'm not even sure how they are gating craftable gear so I can't help with that
---
What if they ended developing modern WOW at the end of BFA and moved all the WOW resources to developing and maintaining legacy servers for all the expansions. Impossible, I know. But what if?
---
Wtf man. Your a god among mans
---
Slow down and proof read before hitting post. No point having any kind of a discussion when I can barely read your posts.
---
I sit at my computer desk corrected.
---
Pvp zones with full loot! 
---
Any soul bound item is turned to enchantment materials.  XD This would make gearing and professions quite needed.
---
Again we have differing opinions, doesn't mean either of us is right. Agree to disagree. See you in Azeroth
---
Typically people interested in the RP aspects want to be around other people who want to RP.  If you tried to RP with people on a non-RP server, they'd just laugh at you and ignore you.
---
My main is Paladin. I have human male which runs like he has a tree trunk lodged firmly in his anus. Dwarf males and females are tiny and I can’t play tiny characters. 
---
Which leaves human female. Weapons still look big on them. Actually have a normal run animation. Casing animation looks good. Gear and helms looks proper on them. 
---
It’s my only choice.
---
I’m willing to bet the community of DAOC has on average 20x the braincells of the wow community. If you RL and call slows it should be fine
---
I have no idea of engineering since i did never have it.
---
No one will be 60 or even close to 60 in a week never mind geared up enough to make it through MC and kill Rag.
---
I love post like these. Everyone wants all these legendaries yet most likely will never see them. They weren’t like the legendaries of recent where everyone gets them. If 2 people had a legendary on your server that was a lot.
---
probably the ubrs key
---
people on my server paid other guys to open that up, and having it makes it easier to find a group on that fact alone.
---
and besides that just attunements to raids. trying to think of anything else. i think there was one in BRD too, the gate on the left side when you first walk in. saves some time to getting to last boss.
---
Trap Launcher not required back in the day as instances weren't steam rolled. There was always mention of cc before pulls.
---
It’s the same concept.
---
I may be misremembering, but doesn't Swiftmend have a cooldown?
---
&gt; Que the flame of hatred by the idiots who "were just having some fun"
---
Social repercussions occurring as a result of anti-social actions in a persistent community... This is something these neckbeards rarely ever experience nowadays. It's beautiful.
---
You don’t get to choose your consequences you do get to choose your actions. By choosing to stream a consequence is stream sniping. There isn’t and shouldn’t be any rule against stream sniping. No one should ever get blacklisted for pvp.
---
Don’t want the consequence don’t do the action.
---
Huh, if only my UI didn't show energy
---
A fraction of a fraction of what they spent with BfA. It is not publicly available, but it's small potatoes compared to BfA spendings.
---
And it doesn't even work, people still stack for mythic progression
---
The question was mainly focused on important dungeon and raid keys but both of them would be helpful
---
You're technically right since it's a different title, mostly, but also it's still been done before and at a harder difficulty. So technically wrong too. It makes it less desirable/impressive in my eyes. Regardless, something to be happy about for whomever does it.
---
No dude, i am mad for thinking there is a normal sollution for this and my spelling mistkes clearly are the reason my argument is shit...
---
hahaah feel she'll regret that
---
I believe you get 1 tranq shot in the first reset so they'll have access to that. I imagine you'll see a lot of strats involving just rotating a new tank in once one dies since they won't be able to avoid. A lot of the fights are so short that they can likely get away with it. You'll also probably see a lot more caster dps in the first kill since they are much less gear dependent. As for rep, you only need about 8 players honored to douse all the flames and that can be accomplished with some AoE farming, not a big deal. For the FR gear, I'm not sure exactly, but I do know the tanks are going to be the one class they would make sure are as geared as they can get them, so they'll have whatever FR gear they can get in a day or so along with chugging any possible consumables, etc.
---
The biggest limited factor will be leveling. To get Rag down in the first lockout means you gotta get your tanks and likely most of your dps to 60 in 5 days real time, 6 days max. I would imagine you'll see the guilds gunning for world first will have between 80-100 players working on their 40 man and cycling through players so they can have as close to 24/7 leveling. 
---
I won't guarantee a first lockout kill, 'cause it'll be a grueling affair, but gun to my head I'd bet on it being pulled off.
---
You can't join a guild on the opposing faction. He is talking about using streamer influence to convince the opposing faction's players from grouping with a specific person. That was 100% not in vanilla. 
---
Yes, there were blacklists that formed organically as a result of players learning about others' actions in the game, forums, etc - not through one player on the other side telling everyone they were being bullied and convincing their friends to abandon them.
---
Well maybe .. but imagine a server where likeminded people like daoc players or similar mmos all meet and play the game :p would be lovely
---
is
---
if any raid group is good enough to fight through an entire army of streamgroupies to assassinate the big shot streamer, that's badass. how is that anything to be mad about? that's fucking impressive.
---
No blessings for you bad boy
---
Hey I wasn’t claiming a sick name
---
Who whined? Yeah saying is the same as actually making what is said right?
---
Maybe you should wait couple more months before saying that?
---
[no thanks](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/75244-red-defias-mask.jpg)
---
People want things like 1.13, improvements to retail, and/or TBC/WOTLK servers. 
---
Well.. these things take money and staff. 
---
Regardless of what anyone thinks, twitch streamers bring in viewers and attract interest. Its free marketing for Blizzard and it would be incredibly stupid for blizzard to not give some preference to streamers (Not like everyone in the beta is a streamer). They provide more value and potential growth that your average Joe Shmo.
---
I'll use Summit and Timthetatman as examples here. A large chunk of their viewers have never even played Wow. Some of them will sub and some of those people will actually stick around because they enjoy the game. Even if these numbers are only in the hundreds, it brought in New players to a 15 year old game. That's pretty damn valuable. 
---
On the otherhand they could give the beta to you (your salt makes it obvious you didn't get in). They likely gain nothing from this since you will clearly play classic anyways. 
---
It's pretty damn obvious what the smart choice is here. 
---
It's not even like they get an advantage from playing the beta since it's old content and everything is wiped.
---
Just face it, you provide very little value compared to a popular streamer. Same with me. That's how capitalism goes my dude.
---
Video games in general weren't as mainstream either, from what I recall.
---
Yeah I'd love to play one but can't see it being my main - I originally played rogue, paladin and finished Vanilla with a lock so I'm trying to play everything else this time around since I was a dumb kid back then :)
---
&gt; Nothing game breaking.
---
Eh questionable.
---
&gt;Prot paladin needs taunt and mana regen.
---
Yes but HOW?  How do you plan on giving them mana regen?  Depending on how you do it, you could make it the best spec for 'healing' paladins in pvp making them never go oom.  So how exactly would they be able to do this?  Saying stuff like 'they just need to fix their mana issues without breaking pvp' is lazy and disingenuous to how 'easy' some are claiming it is.  So no, someone suggesting that this could break the game isn't 'retarded' considering that's literally what happened in the past.
---
&gt;Retri's weakest part in PvE is RNG damage, which never did too good in raids. He was rng based in TBC as well, making him mediocre dpser(Ally side). Crusader strike would solve the problem. Its basically just one extra attack every 6-15sec (whatever cd would fit vanilla), not too much of a trouble and he would perform way better in PvE.
---
Their issue isn't RNG, their issue is having the lack of abilities to use that do damage, like you suggested adding crusader strike.  Once again, how exactly does this not completely change how pvp is played out?  Ret paladins are not that bad in pvp at all and giving them a crusader strike is going to buff them WAY more in pvp than it ever would in pve.
---
&gt;Enha needs dual wielding OR tbc version of stormstrike. - Nothing, that would increase his dps in PvP, but makes his dps in PvE somehow more viable. 
---
See this is EXACTLY what I'm talking about with lazy thinking.  How can you possibly think that adding abilities that fundamentally allow them to do more damage, won't allow them to do way more damage in pvp?  This is the exact problem blizzard ran into while balancing these things back in the day.  Take wrath for example, a spec like destro lock wasn't doing so hot so they just gave them a little boost to their damage and it completely busted them in pvp.  There is no 'giving them extra damage in pve but not pvp' option.  Unless that option is literally allow everyone to have what they have.
---
&gt;Feral needs lacerate, that could help him tank.
---
Ferals have 0 issues with threat.
---
&gt;He, however lacks defense, which can be a problem and blizzard would eventually have to make tier sets different for each spec as it was in tbc+.
---
See look now we are adding in new tier sets now... this IS completely changing classic whether you want to admit it or not.   If they have a tier set then why not every spec?  And if you give every spec a tier set then how are you going to deal with drops?  Allow MORE drops off bosses?  Just let you roll the dice and hope you get YOUR spec a gear to drop?  Go to the TBC tier pieces?  Well now you have to add tier tokens....it just doesn't end with the changes here man how can you not see this?  It isn't just a one change and all is well.  It's a change to fix this, then a change to help fix your change then a change to fix that and then this and then this......  You even have shown this progression of changes through your own suggestions.
---
&gt; Balance druid is a problem. He lacks damage and mana. I think, this is harder to solve and blizzard would have to change his talent tree to address this problem. Now these changes are just one of many options, but it would help them get back on feet and be a valid member of raiding guilds.
---
And the changes continue my dude....  you would have to completely redo their talent trees making it something completely different.  Whether you want to hear it or not, this is not classic.  Classic is here to give us the game we use to have, back.  This is you guys trying to meld the aspect of vanilla into what you think it should be.  
---
And before you say anything about nostalgia or anything like that, vanilla is not my favorite version of the game by ANY means.  TBC is for sure my favorite followed by wrath, and then vanilla.  The issue here is that you can't just 'fix' these things in a game like this without changing 100 other things as well.
---
You can call it retarded all you want, but you even provided an example of what would happen if you tried to change stuff like this.
---
Well to be fair, most people didn't even know how to get them back then.
---
You're ignoring a big chunk of your abilities, of course you're gimping yourself.
---
Where do you draw the line? Do you only let four different, non-viable specs into your guild? What if more than that want to come? Your first assertion is ridiculous. You'll spend a year and a half gearing up 24 Fury warriors. You've gotta remember how slow loot comes in classic, and how you don't want any of it to go to waste. Furthermore that would not be an optimum raid spec for every boss. Sure you could min max for Garr, but a guild won't survive if they kick out the people afterwards because they're not the right class for the next boss. People simply won't stay in that guild. Every single class should be brought to the raids, I am not suggesting that, which it appears you believe I am. There isn't a class in the game that doesn't have a desired endgame spec.
---
Omg. I forgot Keys were even a thing.
---
How much more epic would it have been if you got hit for 1337 instead of 137.....
---
Why do I care about how someone else provides for themself?
---
And I'm not against streamers at all, used to stream other games myself and have current subs to a few twitch streamers, Including wow pvpers. Doesn't change my opinion that if you don't wanna deal with the things streamers deal with, there are ways to avoid it without crying to have the community make your personal experience better.
---
[ENHANCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk)
---
When it comes to raiding most things on the server are wrong in the *more difficult* direction. The only exception seems to be parry chance. 
---
And thinking that people won't get 60 in a week is silly...
---
Nice.
---
Indeed it is going to be an "Accept the reality".
---
I was just thinking that maybe ***(I repeat the maybe***) PvP gear is going to save me when they put it in the game.
---
That would be great for LG or anither company like that because i would buy a second monitor to have a guide next to me.
---
&gt;Why do streamers deserve to be streamsniped?
---
Why *don't* they deserve to be streamsniped?  They're playing on PvP servers and publicly broadcasting their location in realtime.  World PvP is literally why people play on PvP servers.  If streamers don't want to engage in world PvP, they shouldn't play on PvP servers.
---
Correct!
---
Takes time to farm the gear. Between running instances for item drops and farming the mats to craft non-drop items.
---
Tbf the door was opened with the jewelry robbery analogy (which is a poor analogy).
---
Should simply be an action-consequence scenario. We choose our actions, the consequences that follow are not able to be chosen. You don’t want the consequence (stream sniping) don’t do the action (streaming).
---
Watch, all the streamers are going to be annoyed with getting trolled forever and all move to EU servers.
---
want to point out that some settings can be set to the highest in bfa without affecting your framerate while some will really slow you down! for example texture resolution/particle density can be cranked up to the highest and i usually have view distance/ground clutter at 6-8. ultra shadows and water will really gib your framerate. ymmv but as someone with a medium-tier computer that helped for better fps
---
Yes they did.
---
The dream
---
In pvp, even against casters I see druids spend a high amount of time in bear form as opposed to cat form.  I understand bear form has charge/bash, but even against casters you can sit on (priest/lock), I see druids rarely fight in cat form.  I am guessing this is to conserve mana, but then should you pretty much only be in cat form to open and if you know you can secure a kill?
---
I can't seem to find it now but there was a great pvp video with a druid and rogue duo. Had a clip in it of the druid feral tanking in BWL and used Dope's You Spin Me Round as one of the songs.
---
Forget MC clear for a sec, you honestly think that world first 60 will take more than a week...?
---
She was sick of me bugging her when she studies.... I don't think she realized wow classic was on the horizon ROFL!
---
WoW Classic is the alternate 1985. It's already going to be different. I never leveled any characters to max post 1.5 or after my main class talent revamp, all my old specs I leveled with are not in game. It's already a separate branch in the timeline and if they do anything other than leave the game as-is post-Naxx, than I hope it's 1.13 and not TBC.
---
That must of been a pain in the balls to organise
---
Active subs on twitch to players of competitive gaming and used to stream casually myself. Doesn't change my opinion that other players shouldn't have to cater their gaming time in ways to make the streamers content better.
---
The streamer has all the tools necessary to make stream sniping not useful or irrelevant. Pve servers, stream delay, etc. 
---
And for the record, I don't even stream snipe, cause I don't find it fun personally. I just don't see anything wrong with it. 
---
Is it annoying for the streamer? Sure, is it my problem that I need to band together and blacklist some other player over it? Fuck no.
---
Haha good point but yeah I 100% had to corpse run out of there after
---
I cant wait to lynch the streamers, no resilience in the game.
---
Too real.
---
Which talent tree and itemization are they using? I really want to do what I did in vanilla and gear up with things like LBRS stealth runs, soloing specific enemies (smolderweb), etc. There's a big difference between 1.0, 1.8, and 1.12 on all those fronts. Probably enchanting to start for smoking heart of the mountain... skinning maybe as secondary since I recall solo farming devilsaur leather was pretty good money early...
---
nothing wrong with the guy, or streamers in general. live and let live, to each their own, etc.
---
fft; doesn't your own post contribute to the 'issue' you are adressing?
---
It doesn't matter what the layoffs were...the end result was CUTTING EXPENSES. And since they only make profits from GAMES (and not arms dealing or selling daisies) , it is clear that those games (BfA included) are under-performing.
---
And that was in months ago...not the situation is much more dire.
---
Do it. Post it. Be it. Live it.
---
Yes, I will play without addons. I find them to be more of a distraction than a help.
---
I'm not jealous at all, and if anything, I am not your 'buddy', I don't associate with people who use emotional blackmail to make a point..
---
I love watching esfand and asmon fuck around, you've really missed every mark.
---
I don't think the launch of classic is a good time to judge sub numbers.
---
Maybe for succubus driven PvP if you can activate it while cced? Otherwise the stats and the activation is terrible indeed.
---
So the solution is for these people to stop playing the game how they enjoy? Why are we ignoring the fact that people are harassing other players? So if a streamer enjoys world pvp, ganking and guild rivalries they have to give up their enjoyment and content creation just because we are allowing targeted harassment communities?
---
 You say I'm straw manning but your just repeating the same statement and ignoring my posts. One more time, I am not referring to one or two people or even guilds camping, ganking or killing streamers. I am 100% referring to people in this thread talking about forming communities that 100% play the game SPECIFICALLY to camp one streamer 24/7. That is 100% provable harassment and should be bannable. 
---
Your never going to convince me or anybody that is capable of empathy that the solution to a harassment group is giving up ones content creation and source of enjoyment in a game. Maybe there is no solution and maybe this wont even matter because people wont do it and it definitely does not effect you or I when we play classic. I just find it annoying how people are completely ok with this kind of toxic environment in the community just because they dont like streamers.
---
Really hope they at least put one out....Honestly, im not even that big into rp but the atmosphere it fosters is definitely one a bit more suited for my liking. I cant see how adding a single server could do anything but be beneficial to the community
---
Dreaming is all i have since i backed starcitizen 2013 T_T
---
Yes, in parts. 
---
But more of a highlight than an addition.
---
days not hours my friend 
---
for most its around 10 days played
---
for the fastest its 5 or so
---
Thanks for this.  Yeah, so then I've never actually played vanilla.  This might be interesting.
---
It’s mortal strike, but honestly if it was that busted your name fits better.
---
&gt;You want to ideally get your bleeds up, shift out, get hots on yourself, go bear repeat when bleeds are down
---
So are bleeds the big DPS spells of feral druids then? How many combo points do you put up before laying down that finishing move bleed and switching out? 
---
I've been leveling a druid on a private server and when I'm grinding mobs my strat has been to go cat and sneak up to the 1st mob I want to kill and attack him from stealth but after I get the first bleed up I imediatly switch out to bear form and then charge the next nearest mob. Then I just AoE tank 2 and maybe pull in one more as bear. I switch out to heal but never go back into cat because it feels like too much switching and with 3 guys on me I take too much damage in cat to make it worth it it feels like. 
---
This doesn't feel like the fastest way to grind, but I love to AoE grind mobs rather than burn 1 down at a time.
---
Yup, it wasn't a mystery was just time luck
---
Windowed mode + 2nd monitor
---
If you're not rushing, but generally know your route and don't waste too much time on extra stuff you could get it done in 8-10 days played, probably less depending on your definition of "not rushing". So 192-240. 
---
The more extra stuff you throw in (non-quest dungeon runs, crafting profs, pvp, goofing around) is gonna add onto that.
---
Is a 0/30/21 spec good for leveling, and if so does it follow the same standards of feline swiftness through 21? I am torn between 11/31/9 and the 0/30/21 as the first has a higher leveling speed with OoC and a bit more utility, but the second has much more use as a PvP build which I expect to be doing some amount of PvP along the way to 60. Any advise would be useful, and in the long run I will be moving towards a moonglow resto build but that will have to be a respec at 60 with raid ready gear.
---
Rested experience 🧐
---
Your source is trash, there's no way of knowing WoW's revenue because ActiBlizz doesn't share that information.
---
This is correct.  Druids don't rely on a specific weapon or piece of armor or trinket, they're rounded out by their gear as a whole and most pieces of gear will only ever be marginal improvements.  There are exceptions to this as some items impact energy regen and are simply better but you're usually not competing with anyone else for gear.
---
It's kind of a paradox, you lack gear dependence and you're also not required to fight over most pieces of gear.  It works out pretty well.
---
now I have to buy a second monitor?
---
Just wing it
---
streamers are popular but not all are pro gamers.
---
Leveling on beta is currently much easier than pservers.  Theres pretty much no reason to believe rag wont be dead in 2 weeks. People are already hours ahead of Joanas time on beta, 1 wk isnt gunna happen as getting 40 speedrunners prob wont happen but 2 wks and cutting edge guilds will no doubt have it down. I’m curious as to what you think most things were wrong, pservers were like 98% accurate. The biggest thing was the parry rate on raid bosses which isnt a massive deal.
---
This is such a dumb idea. Dude.
---
Thanks :D
---
This is the coolest 60 ding screenshot I've ever seen. Hard to beat this.
---
Thanks for explaining it. Makes sense now. Still seems crazy anyone would be able to get to him with all his peeps around him and the fact he's a decent pvp'r himself. Seems like you'd get groups of people grouping up and heading out to launch a major battle on them all.
---
Agreed. TBC is better than vanilla on almost every measurable metric. Coming from someone whos taking a week off work to no life the release of classic
---
Stream on 10 min delay ez pz
---
I've also accepted that I'm the only one that says Stonetalon as "Stone tuh lone"
---
How the fuck is this toxic dumpster fire of a thread allowed?
---
What I'm saying is normal players should continue to play however they want. If that is stream sniping, that's their bag. Have fun playing the game however you want to play it.
---
If someone else is making the game not fun for you, there are ways to circumvent the situation or you can stop playing. In this case, the streamer is sad that someone else is having fun at their expense. That's the streamers problem.
---
&gt; People like me will never sit down to play idiotic clicker-games on the tiny screen of a phone. 
---
You are in a very slim minority of all people who play games. And when you are in a very slim minority, don't be surprised if most companies stop making games for your group.
---
Vanilla offers more than enough content that is accessible, and enjoable, to people who cannot invest a lot of time.
---
As to your questions:
---
&gt; Is it possible to gear up for PvP without raiding?
---
Yes, and in fact that's what most people do.
---
&gt; what are the best professions that can let me achieve good gear or money, considering my casual playstyle?
---
+ your other profession questions
---
I recommend watching [these videos by Frostadamus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLS8lOhApZY&amp;list=PL9AmYHubEvRptg6EHn6qtFDT3DL24c2uD) on this topic. His guides are directed at new and returning players, and explain the topic beautifully.
---
Lev 60 Karazhan raid (it was originally intended to be), Azshara Crater BG, Dragon Isles, Emerald Dream, vanilla Archaeology or non-gameplay altering distractions.
---
All I want to do is enjoy world pvp, BGs, and farming my trade skills. 0 interest in raiding atm. Is this the class for me?
---
Companies want to maximize profit. They would still lay people off if they were doing great so they could make more money.
---
Yes, I am aware that BfA isn't doing great. But the layoffs were not because of BfA. If anything, you should blame HotS.
---
I'm saying the hardcore guild will clear MC around 8 times by the time a casual guild makes it past rag.   Harcore guilds are going for a first week rag kill.
---
Lol people planned a funeral on the forums and a guild ganked them all. Should that guild be blacklisted? According to your rules, yes.
---
Druids are a strong counter for Mage.  Shapeshifting is a nightmare for Frost attacks and for Polymorph.
---
1. I know you said "outside of cat form", but Cat form is really helpful.  You get a huge movement speed boost, and you can put up bleeds that do damage when you're not in range.  If you can stealth in and open up with Maim, you're golden.
---
2. Feral Charge, Bash.  
---
3. Group with a Priest.  They can dispel most player-cast fears, even if they aren't a dwarf.
---
They are dealing with it by making a blacklist.
---
TBH some of the QoL changes were addons first. If you read the TOU Blizz has the right to any addon you make for the game.
---
10 million is a stretch. I would say 6-7 million, which is roughly 5% of the total accounts created since 2004.
---
It is not unrealistic to expect a 5% of former WoW players to try Classic at launch.
---
I don't know if Classic to BfA ratio will be 9 to 1, but at launch will be at least 5 to 1, and long term 2.5-3 to 1.
---
Enough reasons for Blizzard to really admit that retail is a failure and shut it down down the road.
---
Not OP but I’d like to see that. This will be my first paladin after playing priest through wotlk
---
report "people" like the OP for being toxic, aggressive assholes.
---
I would have rolled a human hunter like Kenny did.
---
Hunters get all the bitches
---
I did some plundering of the ancient tomes of the internet.  From what I could find 58 was a common 'they can come now and start contributing level', but you needed to be level 55 to do the attunement quest.  A couple people are saying you could enter at any level from the main entrance inside brd.
---
How are they doing to get to 60, gear and get enough Aqual Quintessence to do MC in a week?  Aqual Quintessence is kind of a time sink.
---
I am disappointed that new players are going to miss the point of Classic by playing with the "retail mentality" of just following a guide. I have the same hate toward the addon Questi. Those addons are making the players less engage with the world.
---
About Mind Control in PvP. You can reposition the enemy where you want. People getting mind control outside of SM so they are too far to re-enter the dungeon is a classic. MC an enemy in a pack of elites or on a cliff is also super effective. It can be used as a stop cast or to reset a fight. It can also be used to force a kick/stun (dot the melee, MC, put him far away...).
---
late reply, but i think a lot of the stigma of 'this optimal spec is the only way to play the game, no druid other than resto, no shaman other than resto, no shadow priest' has been shown to be false via private servers.
---
that's not to say that the 'optimal specs' wont outperform their counterparts, yes, a rogue is going to out dps a feral druid, but there's no enrage timers on bosses, there's nothing outright -forcing- you to be optimal all the time. i think with modern knowledge and theorycrafting, you can play one of these 'off meta' specs in a raid and not pull the other 39 players down in any meaningful way -- as long as you have enough healers and tanks.
---
i think the major reason why shaman/druid/priest were very rarely allowed to play off-meta specs in classic is that nobody played healers in classic. the class distribution, overall, was absurd. i remember seeing graphics where hunter/rogue/mage was like 60% of the playerbase overall (maybe a bit too far of an estimation here idk).
---
also i think you may be underestimating how much dps leader of the pack / moonkin aura adds, how much healing a well geared shadowpriest puts out, how much extra damage nightfall on an enhance shaman adds for casters, etc. sure you dont want a raid full of off-meta specs, but having a couple in a 40 man group, i think, is not going to make any meaningful difference in progression -- as long as you have enough healers.
---
The trick would be to do all of that at level 58 or something. So only SW is left.
---

Engineering is not recommended as a gold making profession at any stage of the game. Especially not to casual players.
---
Thats not how vanilla was
---
Hunters mvp? Dps mvp? LOL. What short buses do people ride these days?
---
Nah. I considered a dps'er a good dps if he wasn't mouth breathing and if he managed to not impale himself on his weapon by the end of the run.
---
Remember: a group is made of a tank, a healer, and a few easily replaced mouth breathers.
---
Maybe there's a happy medium where we don't worship the online personalities but don't hate them for what they are either? 
---
I just like watching classic streams since I can't play it yet. I think Esfand is a cool dude, I enjoy his chill personality (and cool hair)  and his Paladin play. Streamers make some things possible that wouldn't be otherwise; 
---
 Watching a pvp tourney was neat, watching someone troll said tourney was also funny for a little bit. Watching the Beta is interesting, seeing the 30 meta, and soon it will be the 40 meta, etc. 
---
I'm not anti-streamer, and I'm not chomping at the bit to give them my mined Copper at-launch to get their attention or guild invite. Moderation in all things I guess?
---
Lol. I see you're not well versed in the world of investing. That's fine, there's a lot to learn and it can get pretty boring
---
If you're going to a banker to invest you're money, you fucked up.
---
I used account as a general term to mean the people they pay to manage their money, as they certainly make enough to warrant that. I doubt they're choosing their own investment vehicles
---
I believe this time around the concept of guild will be redefined by Discord. I see people actually raiding while in different smaller, meme guilds.
---
Honestly most of the female models are strait up better than their male counterparts.
---
Female tauren/Female dwarve crew checking in
---
Unless leveling time is drastically shortened in Classic than yes.
---
The world record 1-60 during Vanilla is 4 days 20 hours /played, so in other words 108 hours.
---
During Vanilla the AVERAGE player took around 20-30 calendar days to hit 60.
---
I'm sure e that will be shortened quite a bit with all the resources and guides available now, but you're still looking.
---
You're looking at having to play something like 12-14 hours a day to hit 60 in a week. I just don't see 40 people coming together, hitting 60 under a week and gearing up enough to clear MC. I think a month is more reasonable for a full MC clear.
---
Of course I could very well be wrong as I haven't paid much attention to the beta and how quickly people have leveled to 40. So the numbers may be different than what we are during Vanilla.
---
Fair enough! I won't sub until August 25th. At which point I won't see any sense in playing BFA. But that's just me personally.
---
Tbh I'm not sure about the quickest vanilla grinding as a druid though, don't wanna tell you something that's wrong.
---
Average is 9-13 days /played... with NOT having everyone level at the same time.
---
Let's pretend you do it in 10 days - if you were to play 12 hours a day and only focus on leveling - you'd be 60 in 20 days.
---
Im not an gm or officer, just a member. We are using a guild website, discord and a custom made DKP addon.

This argument is just stupid. They put a lot of work getting this going, and guess what? Labor rates of 2019 are MUCH higher than 2005. Why would the sub not increase? Of course it HAS to increase. Everything has to increase. 10$ in 05 was much more than 15$ now I'm sure. (No I won't go find minimum wages, don't care enough)
---
If 15$ is seriously that big of a deal to u guys, u have the wrong hobby, or at least the wrong system considering PCs cost as much as a used car now. Work an extra hour at work each month, is that such a big deal?
---
Yeah OP your just worried, you gotta chill out man and just play THE GAME.
---
You just sold me on playing on an RP server.
---
The remediation for half of this post is to run 5mans with your guild (or at least with your guild tanks). PUG 5mans are horrible for a whole host of reasons even beyond what you list here.

I wish I could help as a hunter

WoW 2 will be out by the time that games ready
---
I mean yeah. During that horde duel tourney soda had like 90k viewers at one point. It's a combination of having a large number of people very interested in a game and simultaneously not being able to play the game themselves. I'm sure they'll still have plenty of viewers, but this is probably the zenith for a while.
---
Meh not really games such as League of legends, Counter Strike or Path of exile are much cheaper
---
I despise dreamers who want special treatment. You’re the ones deciding to stream and exposing yourself to toxic people. Not my fault you can’t handle things you cause
---
Mind controlling Streamers off the chain in blackrock mountain.
---
If anyone thinks software will run on a literal vegetable then they've got problems
---
Yea this sub needs more flairs so I can filter 90% of the garbage out. Used to be much better 100k subs ago
---
Agreed. I would love a new raid with equal gear/difficulty to Naxx. As well as dungeons that arent just easy gear catch up dungeons but ones that are enjoyable and have that Classic feel. Similar gear/difficulty to Dire Maul. Shit man I would even be okay with Kara coming to Classic. That would be pretty sweet as well. I think if they plan it right and are transparent about any changes they want to make, people would be accepting of it. Even the #nochanges crowd. Mostly because it WONT be retail.
---
What if this image actually does load but it takes 10000 years to do so

Omen was out in late Vanilla. Still Vanilla. Let me guess, you would like to stil have to get back on a taxi in Auberdene to fly from Darn, and then again to Ratchet, And then again to Feralas, to finally get back on a taxi one last time to make it to Gadget?
---
Thanks, will definitely look those videos while nanning :)
---
Dousing the flames is like 2 hours of mage AoE farming. That's the least of their hurdles.
---
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE
---
Even though retail subs are quite low, they’re making more money *per subscriber* than ever before. They’ve made a killing off of microtransactions like pets, mounts, money tokens, and transfers, all of which I’ve never used, except the latter. 
---
I don’t think they would ditch the game so long as it’s making them a significant sum of money. I’m sure they’ve been prepared for their subs to reach this number for some time, and have made financial decisions accordingly.
---
I haven’t played one minute of BFA, so you can’t really call me a BFA shill just because I disagree with your conclusion. I think Classic can very easily overtake retail, but not permanently. I think a game with fresh content is more desirable to *the masses*, even if for a short time. 
---
However, six years from now, when we could have Classic, BC, and Wrath? I think the trilogy subs could easily surpass retail for good, and it wold stay that way.
---
Also, just as a caveat, keep in mind there’s no way to tell what game will have more subs. For one, the subs are tied together, so we would have to compare the *traffic* of each game instead. Secondly, there’s little chance that Blizzard would ever divulge this information and spell “defeat” for their own current game. It will just be a guess really at how well each game is doing, kind of like with retail.
---
Thanks! Love your work btw
---
This is alarmist and under informed.  The poster above you is absolutely correct.  Public companies will cut costs even when times are good, as long as it will drive profits.  And when times are bad, companies will cut costs in underperforming sectors, which include things like a not profitable enough esports division.  Cutting esports costs is unlikely to affect overall gameplay, certainly in the near term.  When the cost cutting machine starts going after devs and designers, I’ll take the alarm more seriously.
---
I think Classic will outperform retail and Blizzard will learn some valuable lessons.  But Classic is not for everyone, and the folks that prefer retail will continue to play it.  Even some of the Classic folks will play both if the  next expansion is more like Legion and less like BfA.  WoW isn’t getting cancelled anytime soon.
---
Tbh it feels like the opposite I'm that excited I just want to know as much as possible. Part of it is that I know a lot of keys have long quest chains so it would be nice to have an idea of what I am getting into
---
They are the Kardashians of the gaming community.
---
100% hunter weapon.
---
Ouch, really got me there. If reporting people who have stronger points than you makes your day better, then by all means go nuts. Hope you get over the jealousy.
---
1. You have to be able to claim the spawn first, this means hoping that they are up during your raid time. It is fun to wipe a raid on kazzak or emrald dream.
---
2. Not really because people camp their mains where they are questing, having a 60 guard you is fun.
---
3. PvE servers never had the population of PvP servers, you want to play on a server that does boss kill points and treats raiding like the dick waving contest between guilds that it is.
---
4. ???????
---
5.Profit
---
People are jealous of streamers. Watch the downvotes I get which just proves the point. The more downvotes the more the point is proven.
---
haha thats so funny! have fun dude! you decided what class you're gonna play?
---
This but Unending Breath, and Detect Invisibility.
---
Man the streamer wanking is real.
---
My friend and I singed to 60 by killing one of the SW guards!
---
Is nobody allowed to share their opinion/viewpoint anymore? I get that having actual posts dedicated to it is annoying, but surely commenting like the guy above did is fine
---
Not 2019 addons.
---
Can't wait to download gearscore again.
---
hold up guys let me get this straight.
---
if I, a random nobody who doesn't stream my gameplay, play on on a PvP server, and get ganked and corpse-camped, it's "just part of the game, lol gitgudnoob or roll PvE"
---
but if the same thing happens to a popular streamer, who is giving away his in-game position voluntarily, it's "STREAM SNIPING, BLACKLIST THIS PERSON HOW DARE THEY"
---
have I got this right?
---
More than decent healing. I want a Paladin in my group over any other healer. Those buffs, mmmmmm.
---
I'll note that this is hardcore and uncommon. It requires not only rogues, but almost the entire raid to be engineering. And for a hardcore raid team they are, not just for sappers but for e.g. arcanite dragonling fire vuln debuff in AQ40 and naxx. But far from every guild plays this way.
---
What mod are the bars on top and bottom that show loc etc

I’m rolling a Druid for this exact reason!
---
I don’t have much time to play now that I have kids and a job and I’m not a college dropout.
---
Looking foreword to world pvp and the occasional dungeon run.
---
What they are saying IS the content. What they say is what's making people hate them.
---
You were like 8 when you played classic?
---
That's not vanilla bud
---
the guys with those names will prolly be fakers tho
---
I was developing a website in wordpress and had a good chunk of work done.  About two months ago I abandoned the project because I'm convinced that Discord can do everything a website would.
---
Pin a couple links to google docs for calendar, rosters, EPGP, and make a read only tab for guild progress screenshots and you're done.
---
True. That's a relief. I'd hate to start a BEEF with someone over it. If they want Tauren Priests, they could just MOOve on over to BFA.
---
True xDS
---
And I was correcting you, any average guild will clear MC 8 times in the same time the hardcore guilds did, because everyone is limited to doing it once a week and it's not difficult.
---
Literally only meme guilds (like only having members of a specific one class) would be unable to do that.
---
&gt;Harcore guilds are going for a first week rag kill.
---
No they aren't. That's not possible at all. It literally takes longer than 7 days for the fastest levelers to get to 60. After that it takes many days of grinding 5 mans for 16 hours a day to get pre raid BiS for the guild.
---
Decursive and healbot because it enables shitty players
---
yeah my guild is discord based
---
\*teleports behind u\*
---
psh, nothin personnel... kid
---
I agree. I don’t have much of a problem with streamers, but some of their sycophants can be insufferable and the disruptions can be a nuisance. I do watch some streamers. However, I get quite hot and bothered at people insisting that “stream sniping” is a cardinal sin. It’s a cost of doing business if you want to live stream without a delay. Nothing untoward about stream sniping. I would normally ignore streamers on the server, but Soda’s attitude towards it is not a turn off, but rather a turn on. It’s awakened the ancient griefer in me as he has identified himself as someone entitled and in need of deflation of his large head. I think it’s done that to enough people that a sub-culture/faction of anti-streamers could form to provide lots of meta entertainment if guilds do in fact form to specifically go to war against particular streamers. I see it as actually having the potential to create lots of fun.
---
There’s some guy in retail who’s repeatedly capped his Pandaren in their starting zone by mining and gathering herbs, making him the first (and only?) level capped character that isn’t either Alliance or Horde. Not Classic obvi, but still pretty impressive.
---
This is why I wanted to roll Tauren druid

Wow 70k? That's like...slightly above average, and almost what top streamers make in a month! And let me guess you're pulling that money at age 25 like them? No? 35? 40?
---
You can make more than that with your first undergrad job. Hell, you can make that much in customer service with no degree after a few years.
---
Funny how you call streamers attention whores and yet you're insecure enough that you have to tell everyone your incredibly average financial situation to compare yourself. Sounds like you're still salty towards streamers.

Even if they always dropped 12 copper in vendor loot, the average time-to-kill is 10 to 15 seconds. You'd need to kill around ~800 wolves to accumulate 10,000 copper (1g). It would take 2 to 3 hours in the best-case scenario, which why I'd asked if you had actually done it.
---
You don't think much much lower tank threat is a big deal?? Well you just discredited yourself.

just role play being on a pvp server by keeping yourself flagged.

It's now remade :) I've made three versions (8k, 4k, HD) and put them here:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/mwJ1OIO](https://imgur.com/gallery/mwJ1OIO)
---
Yep. I followed it for a while and a lot of my eve buddies still believe but I really doubt at this point we’ll ever get a coherent finished game
---
1 millions subs...that is $15 million a month....couple millions more from MTX...that is under $20 million a month. Which is under $250 million a year. Yes, very, very good money. But compared to 2010, when it was close to $2 BILLION a month...
---
I mean, sure, not enough reason to ditch it...but this is now, with Classic not live yet.
---
If Classic pulls in 2-3 times the revenue BfA does...Blizzard will probably think : "Well, it looks like THIS games is bringing more profits...maybe we should invest MORE in Classic development, and less in Retail?".
---
It's not rocket science.
---
Yes, the sad part was a hunter who used a trap to cc was indeed an MVP. It was so rare. Half of them didn't even disable growl on their pet. This time around I think hunters will be different since it was the noobiest class in vanilla appealing to new players and kids.
---
Get mining up to 300 along with engineering, make bombs to make PvP better, farm your pre raid BiS in dungeons and then PvP until you reach exalted with WSG,AB and AV, from doing those reps alone you can get some decent epics, also save up for lionheart helm, edgemasters handguards, and then boom you have nice gear mostly epics without stepping into raids once
---
You’re a weird guy huh, hate circle jerking someone you’ve never met, on a wow sub. Like wtf.

Same! Not enough time. I just want to enjoy some pvp and make some gold. Raiding is not for me. Good luck

Haha that's cool, cg

You're so jaded it's insane. Most streamers are just normal people.

Its not much lower, more people will just fury tank and people will call for slows more often. I’ve been mting for like 10 years now, its not gunna be that bad. We’ve been running the numbers and its not egregious
---
SPARTAAAAAA
---
Let me ask you a question:  
---
How many people in the world do you think, are playing golf?  
---
And how many people are playing soccer (European football)?
---
Don't worry, I looked it up for you: Around [60 million people play golf](https://www.quora.com/How-many-golfers-are-in-the-world-now), compared to about [Half the worlds population](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/soccer-world-cup-2018-global-audience-hit-34-billion-fifa-revenue-reach-6-billion-1120071) watching or playing soccer.
---
Does this stop an entire industry of companies manufacturing and selling golf equipment, building and maintaining golf courses, and offering training, coaching and organised tournaments from existing, and thriving?
---
No, it doesn't.
---
Point is, it doesn't matter if mobile games are the majority. As I said before: If there is a small fortune to make in a market, someone will come to claim it.
---
It's a niche item for druids, since it has cat AP and healing power. For every other class it's just 25 extra sp and an aura. For min maxing dps I'd say the mage aura is the best option.
---
My last run through as a warrior on a super over populated server (lots of ganking by 60s / competition for quests) I did it in 5 days 23 hours /played with no help from other characters (no early whirlwind axe etc) 
---
I know the routes pretty well and I tried to stay optimized. I did however get some rested exp here and there (never more than half a level but that’s still quite a difference)
---
The ones that get me the most are SHAY-man, HURTH-stone, and gurr-OSH.
---
The first one might be a valid English pronunciation of Shaman, but I still hate it. I get not knowing how to pronounce "hearth", it looks like "earth" and you've never had a fireplace in your home. Fine. Whatever. But how do you get Garrosh wrong when NPCs literally say his name in voice acted cutscenes in the game?
---
When I played retail, I played RPPvP exclusively. I have never once RP'ed. For me it boiled down to this: you can't name your character sneekyrouge. Which means people who are inclined to name their character sneekyrouge don't join the server. As these people are typically children or morons, the play experience for everyone else is enormously improved.
---
Yeah, this is definitly the downside to adding different versions of Classic. I want some tweaks, but not necessarily to classes. I will play the undertuned classes in Classic just as the overtuned ones. After all these years I'm okay with a slightly imbalance, because I know how to (mostly) make up for it.
---
Have you been in this sub? I would have guessed so, but your comment says no. Even on sites like barrens chat streamers are discussed constantly.    
---
They just really know how to make the content about themself and not about the game.
---
Is any one actually suprised?
---
I kind of redoing Uldum lore
---
I'm 100% reserving Sodapoppin for my bank alt.  Don't panic, it's just me.

---
I have 0 experience in Vanilla WoW, becouse i've started playing from TBC.
---
I might be wrong... but idk, time will tell.
---
I ran add ons in Vanilla. I will run them again in Classic. 
---
My list so far all in one bag, TRP3, threat meter/damage meter, atlas loot, dominos and carbonite/map tracker of some kind. 
---
Out side of TRP3 I ran all of these in vanilla. 
---
Will not be getting a group finder or any kind of 1 button rotation add on.
---
That was a fun anime
---
I remember back in days of MoP Soda was a literal whore that would do anything on stream for donation money and fame, he also was super annoying and brought chaos wherever he went with his "pyah" catchphrase and legions of stream followers destroying everything in his radius like a locust swarm.
---
Nowadays he's some shitty Pewdiepie lookalike that's been forced to tone himself down because Twitch is now his actual job that pays him good money and he doesn't have any other job prospects
---
2 problematic people out of 24k are much better odds than 2 out of 4k.
---
That must not be Blessing of Devotion on your buff tray? A scroll of some kind?
---
Now back in vanilla, 40 people, sometimes you are running with pugs or 2 guilds. There were addons that were more widely used but then new  features made them obsolete. But hopefully those developers will come back. Such as the new looting system of locked group loot. 
---
We used DKP (dragon kill points) back in the day. 
---
Basically you (gm) set how many points a raider gets for a, being on time, staying the whole raid, and points for killing each boss. And maybe a lil bonus if it is first kill of new content. 
---
Now you can do a round robin system of high bidder. 
---
So you kill a boss, it drops a sword and the crowd goes crazy. In a round robin, you are going through your list to see who has the most DKP. That person gets the next piece of loot that is an upgrade, for a set amount of points. 
---
In a bid system, You link the sword in chat and people can with whisper you there bids (how much DKP they want to spend on the sword) high bidder wins. 
---
You can do a mix of both where it starts with round robin so the player up next gets the option of the low by out. If they pass it goes to open auction. 
---
And as always Main Spec over Off Spec 
---
It was so fair that it hurt and if you missed a raid you were fucked. But honestly, it is best to stick with one system and to give points out for everything. 
---
Maybe small Extra points if you’re raiding old content, or guild events. 
---
There’s many ways to look at loot. For progression, you need to make sure your whole team is upgrading in a similar pacing with Eachother so your team has core strength throughout, and so one person doesn’t get overgeard to quickly and then jumps ship. It happened to often.
---
Half the fun in vanilla was camping people. Forcing a guild on guild PvP situation in random zones was fun.
---
Right, a couple of them are going to be on one server, maybe, they said sometime in the past. But they have been clear they will not tell people which server that is and try to hide it so they don't get swamped on launch. It is a shitshow to land on a server with one of these morons, and without knowing in advance which servers they are infesting you can't avoid it.
---
Titan panel
---
well if a streamer have 40k people watching him he probably isn't boring to those 40k people.
---
how hard it is to leave him and his audience alone?
---
liking something isn't pathetic. what it is pathetic is doing all this "hate agenda" for no reason at all.
---
imagine doing a Leonardo DiCaprio hate group just because you don't like his movies. pretty pathetic huh?
---
Here is what's going to happen, the more he complains, the more people will hate him, and be aware of him.
---
He's only digging his own grave, there will be a large guild created specifically to kill sodapoppin on launch day.
---
He did this to himself...
---
Very cool
---
so vintage ♥
---
No one said "Soda made Classic happen". They said he has been a long time advocate and that it's not unlikely that his support for it helped push towards its realization.
---
Someone mentioned that streamers said that battle shout was sucking for AoE threat. I don’t know if that was on traditional 3 mob packs or the insane 9-12 mob pulls I’ve seen in there SM spam videos. I’m not in the beta to test threat values. 
---
But the 2.01 patch notes said that “Fixed an issue where Warrior "Battle Shout" was causing too much threat.” So if it’s not working well on 3 mob packs, that might mean it’s not generating threat per party member/per pet like it did in vanilla. Which would be a bug.
---
the mindless followers will disperse once their streamers leave for the new popular game.
---
but the legend, of the guys who killed (X bigshot streamer) will live on forever.
---
Dude he makes like 10k doing one stream a week where viewers donate clips for him to watch. He’s gonna be fine, but I know that’ll make you rage :)
---
The guild that is planning this has over 100+ people working to make sure it gets done. 
---
There are people leveling certain professions and crafting certain items they deam essential.
---
There are people that on on responsible for leveling high enough to pre-farm certain components.
---
They have 50 people slated to participate in the raid itself,  So I'm assuming they have 10 people on standby, and plan to swap out certain roles and classes for certain fights.
---
I'd say the odds are pretty good they do kill Rag first week.
---
There is no honor in WPvP, get that through your head, sure you might pass by people and decide not to try and kill them but that isn’t and shouldn’t be the norm. People use out of game sources  for all sorts of things, dungeon paths, boss fights, loot tables and bis loot to name a few, of someone wants to give you a constantly up to date guide on where to kill them, that is their own fault. If Soda/A streamer doesn’t want to deal with it there are pve servers for him to play.
---
It is though? On most competitive games, and competitive services such as PubG or ESEA or FACEIT you'll be banned for stream sniping, because it's cheating. It's gaining an unfair advantage using resources outside of the game, and it's also considered a form of harassment in other games, and will probably be in Classic WoW looking at Blizzard's rules regarding griefing.
---
That would be nice, a whole legion of hunters who are not only competent but are really good at their class? Blizz might have to nerf us.
---
It's something that i feel to play. I have 0 experience in Vanilla WoW, becouse i've started playing from TBC.
---
Listen to their quarterly shareholders updates sometime. They go on and on about microtransactions and add on services.
---
It's definitely their main focus going forward... rather than... you know... the games themselves. They discuss the company as if the games are secondary to microtransactions, and not the other way around.
---
Facts!! The Beta chat was cancer. All of their fan boys just spammed world and general chat.
---
I really want to RP an orc like an ork from r/40korkscience but I’m not sure people will put up with the persistent caps.
---
Also mages are really boring in MC. 
---
* Lucifron: spam decurse
---
* Magmadar: reasonably interesting fight
---
* Gehennas: spam decurse
---
* Garr: stand in one spot and roll your mousewheel to fire frostbolts (adds are kited away by a hunter and you never kill them)
---
* Baron: unless you get the bomb, same as Garr.
---
* Shazzrah: spam decurse
---
* Sulfuron: interesting fight 
---
* Golemagg: see Garr 
---
* Majordomo: interesting fight
---
* Ragnaros: see Garr
---
And there are only a couple of pieces of good loot in there: the belt, ring, neck, mageblade. T1 is trash.
---
If your mage starts raiding with the release of ZG you're really not missing any fun.
---
what, you mean [like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G79k8auGLk)
---
Man you're delusional. This is an official world of Warcraft relaunch of vanilla. Oldschool records were under 5 days on retail. Not only are you going to see a full 40 man raid of 60s before week 2, ragnaros will also die on at least 1 server.
---
People love to talk about all this stupid hours a day math. 12 hours is crazy to you? You could almost unhealthily work a fulltime job while doing that, but why is that even a variable? The most hard core people are taking the week off work. You're literally going to have people playing 18-20+ hours a day, these people are insane.
---
You need a handful of mages and a few others to get grinding for aqua's which is easily achievable when that's their sole purpose for day 5.
---
You just fail to understand how hardcore these people are. While you go out for dinner, walk your dog, go see a movie, watch an episode of Netflix ect, that's another few dungeons their core tanks blasted through.
---
I think we may very well see an army of furry warrior tank hybrids in one of the world first rag kills even with the parry changes.
---
and my updot
---
I really want this at launch as well. I love RP servers for many reasons. Creating a character and meeting other characters while progressing through a story is a lot of fun and it's just one more thing to do in the game. I also love that when I'm just running around leveling I'll see players just chilling in the inns and making the world feel more alive.
---
However I love world PvP and the danger of wandering around the world. So I am most likely going to have to roll on a PvP realm, gear up for raids and level professions and such. Then after a couple of months I'll create a toon on an RP realm and just RP on a level 20 characer or something. 
---
I don't want to miss out on world pvp before BGs are introduced so this is what I'm going to have to do.
---
There is no action to take since addon developers are already constrained in what they can make. IE classic will use current LUA/API restrictions
---
Addons in Vanilla were MORE game breaking than they are now.  However addons now are more polished.
---
An example for reference, in Vanilla addons could choose the spell to cast(including rank) and the target to cast on.  So you would literally set up rules and priorities in decursive and healbot and press one button.
---
The question actually is, "should it be in the game?"
---
Just because it technically exists as a sleeper bug in 1.12 doesn't mean that a gamebreaking exploit should be allowed to stay in the game. That's just insane and meme levels of #nochange extremism.
---
You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet.
---
Wtf dude?
---
Now that you mentioned it on my priest I wasn't a fan of Warlocks as they'd kill themselves for mana, druids because I am deeply scarred by the first Druod that exploited my deadzone and Shamans with their Windfury totem was liable to get the Rogue killed when it proc'd like 3 times in a row causing the tank to lose aggro.
---
Less miles means less gas you old fool
---
Streamers should only play on PvE servers. Honestly they are so annoying. Soda has such a bad attitude lol.
---
That’s not a bad point but do you recognize that the chat system setup actually ENABLES that behavior. 
---
If all chat existed that frustration would be directed elsewhere.
---
&gt; Resto, too, suffers a worse rap than it deserves. People repeat "HoTs dont stack" like parrots but don't understand how to properly run a  resto druid team to maximize their healers.
---
This is something I almost never hear discussed. Has the ancient art of healing assignments been lost?
---
&gt; the very slow drip-feed of gear in vanilla rewards diversification, which is something that is never considered a factor on reddit
---
I actually see this mentioned relatively frequently on this subreddit. However, it is usually followed by a flood of comments telling the person that mentioned it that they are completely wrong and diversifying a raid for better loot distribution makes no sense (not always that politely). I have never really understood their arguments if I am honest though.
---
How is he going to blacklist someone on the opposite faction for killing him? Does he think the opposing faction gives a flying fuck if he's being corpse camped?
---
This. Actually hilarious how vitriolic this sub is towards a group of people they have never, nor will ever meet. And who they can avoid entirely if they chose to never open their stream, or roll on their own server.
---
&gt; Your single experience on a private server
---
Except it wasn't one. Those huge brawls are going to be dead a few months in, and I'll be here to tell " I told you so ".
---
Warrior tank
---
Well believe me it will come out one day. The funding is now carried by guys with unlimited pockets that buy everything. But it will be far from the game the had planned way back. Not even in terms of features and all but.. well they nutured a pay2win community with lots of toxic people.
---
Well anyway iam getting to offtopic here have a nice day man
---
What do you mean? "Goblins could also immediately liquidate a portion of their stockpile to raise capital and then use capital + remaining supply to manipulate prices."
---
There was no playable goblins in Vanilla
---
r/titanfall
---
This sub is making me laugh my ass off. At peak streams these guys have as many people watching them as this sub has subscribers. You do understand that right? The people circle jerking here acting like they're going to form gangs to gank streamers are beyond delusional.
---
Lol yeah the caps might be a bit much. Other than that it'd probably be received very well.
---
Dont forget the "i play wow and forgot that's what it is like to make friends with arrangeurs, band together and memories for life" sentiment.
---
So, now i joined the circlejerk and now i go back to hyping myself for August :)
---
LFG addons for any raid or dungeon rest is ok.
---
you are talking as if "worshipping" and "hating" should be put in the same category.
---
worshipping is not a bad thing itself (unless it's a crazy-like-stalker one). let the ppl worship what they enjoy. there is people worshipping athletes/movie stars/religion since forever. it doesn't hurt anyone. it doesn't hurt if you are not part of this group.
---
actively hating (which is different than not liking it) is just stupid
---
Just like women are asking to be harassed if they wear anything but a potato sack!
---
They need to put out one more expansion for retail, tie the story up, get the classes to a good stable spot, go back and scale all of the old content to the new level cap and work on WoW2. They can keep the retail servers running and have a combined subscription like they have now for classic and retail. Make all the dungeons in the game have a mythic keystone version, all the raids are doable at max level, and have the PvP seasons just on an automatic periodic reset. I'd anticipate them hovering around 1 million subs for years even with a WoW2 out.
---
Hunters easiest since there are not a lot of them in a raid and they have almost exclusive gear.
---
Resto druid has no competition at all, only on weapons, and there are not a lot of them in the raid. 
---
The rest exclusive classes may not have outside competition but because there are a lot of them in a raid have harder time getting geared.
---
Most of the gear is either plus heal or plus damage, so warlocks are competing against mages. 
---
MT is the easiest to gear btw.
---
Yes for sure, that big gated area, just waiting for something.
---
outside of raids, all classes are on equal grounds. its all about RNG on drops and how much runs you do.  
---
in raids, Druids and Hunters have least players to share SETs between.
---
They'd destroy the game in 6 months
---
&gt; the stream is off theres obviously gonna be less streamsniping
---
Hot take
---
Lots of spec's make abilities worthless or ignored, not every ability is useful for every spec for each class. Fire mages with lot of fire gear wind up ignoring most of their frost and arcane spells. Please don't act like this is a stupid question i'm simply looking for input. 
---
The question wasn't "is this gimping me; yes or no" it was to what degree and is it viable and worth it or is it so much so that it's simply not the class to choose.
---
Honestly doubt it will happen in the first week unless you have really coordinated 80 man account sharing to get all the chars to 60 and into the raid.
---
Getting FR gear on the tank is going to be impossible.  Hell, getting an alchemist to make a bunch of Fire res pots will be hard enough, since leveling Alchemist and to 60 sounds impossible in a week.
---
Also just straight up leveling all the slower leveling classes to 60 in a week seems unlikely.
---
As easy as MC is, I'm confident it won't be trivial for 40 people in quest greens either.
---
Warrior tank, priest as healer, shaman as healer, druid as healer.
---
Yes. 15 seconds. But casting it on cd on max rank hots that you didn’t pay for yourself is still a huge hps increase, and it is the ultimate snipe because it’s instant.
---
I can understand that concern completely
---
I'll probably either be at work or playing classic, so have fun on here man.
---
How to play games as an adult: Plan ahead for this day when you're young and intentionally avoid making children so I can play video games as much as I want. 
---
If you already have kids, sucks for you.
---
Very true. 
---
It wasn't very socially acceptable. Gamers hid in the shadows back then.
---
I want Classic and I want it now!
---
ummm.. you know the world record is 4 days 20 hours..
---
The people planning this are hitting 60 in less than 100 hours on private servers, and in beta, and stress tests are blowing past their private server benchmarks doing much better times.
---
&gt;  Mr. Grimmmz
---
a.k.a the "everyone is sniping me".
---
Wouldn't it be sick if Blizzard built on classic and went a different way than TBC?
---
The only way to "disallow" a LFG addon would be to completely lock down all chat channels. Blizz-approved chat channels only, and even then it would just parse general and trade. LFG addons do not port you to dungeons, matchmake you into randoms, or give you bonus loot. it is literally a persistent graphical representation of "LFM \[dungeon\], need \[roles\]."  
---
all they do is make it easier to coordinate with other people who have the same goal. You still have to poke someone and talk and actually get invited.
---
Dont forget. In Classic you couldnt earn gold by playing pvp. You have to buy stuff or even repair your armor. You need also a Mount and consumables. Calc in some farm time.
---
It's a post asking for opinions. Wild, but I replied with an opinion. I think it'd be more fun that way for pvp, while leaving everything else intact. Blizz won't care and they're not going to ban any Addons unless it modifies a game file, regardless. They never cared then, I don't know why they would suddenly care now.
---
Guildwebsite to sign up for raids, Google documents to track loot,attendance etc. and discord for channels and easy access.
---
I believe Swiftmend has a 15 second cooldown, yes.
---
Your like or dislike of a streamer on a personal level has nothing to do with WoW Classic. 
---
If they are talking about somthing WoW Classic related feel free to engage that subject, but if your take on what they are saying has anything to do with them on a personal level then just keep it to yourself. It has nothing to do with the game.
---
I agree. Whether you hate them or not, streamers should be able to get their names.
---
amusing
---
Hahaha.  Fury tank rag in greens.  I wanna see that attempted.
---
Would have sucked if you miscalculated and got it on goldshore or something.
---
Well first thing that comes to my mind would be disabling all addons. Alone it wouldn't make a server a hc but it is a start.
---
I'm not hating, I'm just saying it's romanticised and isn't going to be a thing past the initial wave.
---
They called RP-PvP too 'niche' but it's more desired than RP-PvE
---
Why banish Garr adds when you can just have a hunter kite them away on pull while your raid single-targets Garr?
---
You never need to kill the adds.
---
1. You'd need to be streaming and have your stream sniped in order for your comparison to be relevant
---
2. They aren't asking people to get banned. The "blacklist" thing was an idea of a streamer to get people to not guild with the snipers.
---
In DM east, UD female mage is the best to farm with, you can kill lasher packs and loot two of the spots where the books can spawn in DM east below in the courtyard where anyone else who would try and loot it would agro the elite trents
---
My prediction some classes will improve in performance while others will decrease.
---
In my opinion Hunters and Druids will see the largest improvement while rogues and mages on average will go down since more less skilled ppl will play classes that used to have an insane skill cap.
---
You really can't figure out why people care about what other players are doing in a multiplayer game? This isn't retail.
---
Oh ok.
---
I'm glad we had an expert here to tell us why the game he's never actually played is going to fail.
---
Ideally we'd get a server list before the 13th and the streamers will all make their server choices before we all make our character reservations.
---
Classic will be much better, and more authentic, without streamer hordes.
---
ummm.. you know the world record is only 4 days 20 hours..
---
Call me impressed
---
70-240 hours it seems.
---
If you are lvl 60 the lvl 55 is not grey, is that from some addon ?
---
I always read Garona Halforcen as "Hal-Force-en".
---
Until one day I realized it's "Half-Orc-en" because she's a half orc...
---
Definitely see where you’re coming from but I do feel like a lot people on this sub are being rather childish lately. Streamers &amp; their opinions aren’t the end of the world, furher more...it’s a game, like tone it down a bit. 
---
Then again I only watch streamer content from time to time on the good ol’ youtube, so just like you I can’t really say belong in either ”tent” of this drama. Just my opinion watching from the sidelines.
---
Sodapoppin’s comment for an example was a stupid one but it obviously came from a lot of pent up frustration...but at the end of the day it was just a stupid comment. As always, it’a beyond me how people are able to continuously make a big deal out of silly stuff.
---
Not really towards you, just adding some commentary
---
Mage and rogue. Rogue is easy to hop on and feel good at, not gear dependent, do good damage, big fun cooldowns. But in premades you'll be stuck guarding flag room and/or going for fc. In group pvp, you're not great. 
---
Mage is just as powerful, but a bit of a learning curve. Great in all pvp.  A lot more versatile. 
---
Lock is good too but peraonally didnt fins it as fun.
---
Can't they do like a 5 minute delay or something on their stream?
---
This is a good one
---
Nice! My lock hit 60 by turning in cookies to Santa!
---
I feel like people aren't answering your question properly.
---
If you're super casual and in no rush to raid... What is the rush. You could literally level your character and engineering as you level up slowly. You'll have some rest experience helping you out and you can naturally progress through to 60.
---
You can go into dungeons and depending on how slow you really go, could find yourself in phase 3 and pvping in a more formal capacity.
---
I honestly just don't see any negative to what you're doing.
---
Well, Apex is OFF top 10, right? WoW is also OFF top 10, right? Apex made in March $100 million...and you think that WoW made even CLOSE to that? Ofc NOT, and this is why they didn't lost 4/5 of the subs...because they made SIMILAR revenue in March and April...but bellow Apex anyway.
---
WoW made similar revenue in March as in April...they just got under top 10 because other games made more than that.
---
Apex, with $20 million DID NOT MADE it back in top 10. And you failed to see which game is on the 10th place...It's Counter Strike.
---
I can't find the revenue for Counter Strike...but if even CS made more than WoW...it's probably even worse that you think.
---
Yeah sounds good! Hunter fits that role the best for solo play, but Druids are a close ass second. You’ll always find something new to do as a Druid and I think that’s what makes the class so flavorful.
---
Stop
---
For the HORDE! SMOrc
---
Yeah that is what I mean. A little gambling like incentive as an addition to some other perks is perfectly fine. Wow can also be boiled down to that as well. You pay $15 a month to invest time in order to hopefully win the "jackpot" and get your bis neck. A little rng is perfectly fine as long as it goes along with other things. Wow has rng no different than the little rng used to pick the games soda plays on shit show Saturdays. That's fine because you also get other things alongside that rng such as add free watching, supporting your favorite streamer so he/she can continue to provide entertainment, access to sub only chat, emotes etc...
---
Guild Wars Classic 2020!!
---
This guy militaries
---
Until you reach 36 and get rank 4 fortitude, then realize it's 745 mana, which is usually 25-30% of your mana pool depending on your gear.
---
I'm going to record pvp highlights in 240p and play Drowning Pool over-top of it just like the good old days.
---
Your point seems to be that people don't care what you think about streamers either way, so you don't want to see the top of r/classicwow filled with posts about them.
---
This is inherently flawed for 2 reasons. 
---
1) this is reddit, so the posts are making it to the top of the subreddit because people DO care enough to upvote them
---
2) The only reason your post has any relevance is because people are aware enough of streamers to be outraged about the statement from the dumb streamer that thinks stream snipers should be banned. Basically the only reason your post is getting traction is because people care enough about streamers to be aware of them.
---
Maybe in the future if your going to participate in a discussion, adress the other person's arguments. You just keep ignoring them, restating the same thing and getting upset over my wording. You have literally not made an arguement against anything I have said other than when you've felt attacked.
---
You clearly dont have any actual arguments to make you just dont have sympathy for somebody who has communities targeted at ruining thier enjoyment. Im sure if you were in that position you wouldn't be too happy but nobkdy can make you feel differently. I'll take note and try to not hurt the feeling of people in a discussion I hope you can try and present your arguments clearly in future discussions.

Sounds like a really cool build, I'm also interested (:
---
What kindof roles do you do in 5mans and raids with this build?
---
Somewhere between 96 hours and infinity.
---
Yeah, this comment definitely proves you have better things to do. Fucking loser lmao
---
I'm not part of the #nochanges crowd. I just don't think you can say "NO CHANGES (but actually some changes as long as I agree with them)".
---
karndogg and imacoolguy have some of the best pvp videos out there
---
The only really hard one to get is UBRS. And for that one you can't have a rogue lockpick the door. scholo has a decently long quest chain but not too bad. Just spend some time leveling in the plauglands and you'll get it. The rest you either get the key from running a different wing of the instance or the 'key' is just a boss summon or a skip mechanic. ST and ZF i always out leveled before getting the key so never really bothered.
---
It's not that they deserve to get stream sniped, it's that they don't deserve to *not* get stream sniped. There is no need for external control on the situation, because the streamer can deal with their shitty community themselves. (Delay, play pve, DONT STREAM, I don't care but don't play pvp with zero delay and complain about spergs killing you. You made your choice)
---
I can only imagine the crazy cultists out there are ready to claim some streamer names and impersonate Lol.
---
I've been watching richwcampbell since the cap increased to 40 - he's also been playing as druid.  And pretty humorous if sarcasm is your thing.  From a gameplay perspective probably pretty similar to other streamers since he too has been spamming SM dungeons.  But has respecced a few times already, both tanking and healing, so there's a bit of variety in that regard.
---
The only reason why there is no confirmed rppvp is this: Blizzard doesn’t expect a high long-term population for Classic. They want to make 3-6 servers per region, perhaps 1-2 of PvP, pve, and rp each. And what happens when 1 month goes by and the layers are still too full? What if they can’t remoce layering because the servers would be at 5-8k population once they merge? 
---
Well, two solutions are to expand the queue system, so people have to wait longer to play, but the game is more Vanilla-like. The second is simply allowing a higher concurrent population, which is less Vanilla-like.
---
But also, as a final ditch solution, if they realize there’s a massive surplus of population, this massive demand, they can always open RPPVP servers for people to migrate to. Granted, this would only work for rp and PvP servers, since most people on pve wouldn’t go RPPvP, although some would.
---
Either way, maybe they want to save RPPVP as a sieve to drain excess players. It’s not a perfect idea. In fact it’s pretty horrible. In any rp server, especially RPPvP, the people should grow with the server from level 1. But I think it’s an option Blizzard is thinking about. 
---
They even made a comment in that post saying they aren’t against rppvp, IF the demand is there. I still wish they would just introduce them at launch, but that’s my two cents.
---
Do you have examples of specs that are completely broken and have no niche at all? The only that comes to mind might be a balance druid at 60, not familiar with the rogue specs/hunter specs very much.
---
I mean you only really see the shoulders because your tabard covers the chest and you can never see caster legs/boots anyway. I prefer the bloodvine shoulders to T2 anyway; T2 should effect annoys me.
---
I love how people view the Vanilla days. Completely clueless about everything that happened around us, even though we were playing for 8-15 hours a day.
---
&gt;  is small and does not involve the kind of positions used for creating new content. There is a huge difference between having a script you're following to a tee with already created content and tables and assets, and creating entirely new stuff.
---
Ion hozzikostas is on the Classic team, he does do created content, and his best content has always been raids, despite his failures in BFA, he has helped with the decision making on the classic team and objectively speaking your point is inaccurate by this metric.
---
oh look, its already noon, time for another post naxx content post
---
Exactly this.  Only try hards min-max for four levels from 15-19.  Just save money and go feral from the start for 30% move speed at 21.
---
I plan to play on RPPVP and it isn't because I RP but because I like the name rules they have associated with the servers. I don't want to see retarded character names.
---
TBH all Mage PvE in classic is really boring. All you do is spam one button the entire fight, either fireball or frostbolt. I mained a Mage for most of my WoW career, and I wouldn't roll one if I was just gonna do solely PvE in Classic.
---
In PvP however, they're super fun. Lots of great tools and good in any situation. Their only bad matchups in 1v1 are Warlocks and SPriests, but if you roll undead then those become manageable.
---
If people continuously go out of their way to grief a streamer I see no problem for them internally blacklisting someone, and I get it roll pve yes that’s been said a hundred times and everyone knows a pve v PvP server is an entirely different experience and basically game
---
It was streamers who got Mark Kern, it was streamers who gave classic millions of views on youtube and twitch. Yeah sure, people have wanted them for a long time. But Blizzard never took it seriously until streamers came around.
---
Diamond 1 omegalul. That is the equivalent of heroic raiding at best
---
&gt;So griefing others, particularly players who stream where they're at giving the griefers an advantage they wouldn't normally have is fun?
---
Yes? That, along with having thousands of people see you do it in real time. And seeing the real time reaction of the streamer.
---
Hehe
---
That quest chain and getting “the healer” title are my two best solo skill memories because they proved I could utilize my class tools.  
---
I believe as a hunter you had to jump shoot, wing clip and concussive shot a few of the quest NPCs for that bow. Also had a nice flowery animation!
---
 /sigh
---
I have nunchuck skills and computer hacking skills. :)
---
Thanks for the info though!
---
O yeah sodas content has definitely gone downhill recently. I personally think hes at that point of popularity and hes so well of that he just doesn't care anymore. He can turn on his stream play whatever with no cam and still pull in 15k+ viewers. Like a month ago he did a stream where he turned off his cam and played ear rape still had 12k people watching.
---
Mind blown ;(
---
You're going to be fine. Most people aren't going to be that much faster than you. Don't be intimidated by the people here who are taking a month off work to play wow because they aren't the general population. Any class you pick will work fine.
---
Play on the streamers servers so the pop is nice and high with noobs for the good work.

They envious. This sub has never been so bitter
---
r1 glad in cata was easy cus in s9 most good ppl quit or went inactive, final straw for quits s11.
---
PUBG did that to placate streamers because streamers were making them money. It’s an objectively stupid thing to ban people for if you take a step back. These people broadcast their whereabouts to anyone and everyone who would watch. Banning people for watching is like banning people for using Wowhead to figure out how to do something in the game. Blizz has already commented that they will take no action on stream sniping. It’s not a thing. If you broadcast it, we will watch.
---
6 months to a year after release. If we went by launch numbers, WoD and BfA would be considered massive successes
---
“I’m more a black knight kind of guy”

Lol. Ok dude, very cool! Black knight wow! /r/iamvery adass

I'd let my wife fuck him after I had had a go. No homo.

6. Idle animation makes them look drunk.

Part of me really hopes it is, and part of me really hopes it is not.

Or when you try to click on them to /thanks and they run away, so you just jump a few times as it is the universal communication method for “I acknowledge you”

When I meet a good hunter, I usually try to add him to my friendlist. Good hunters are rare, but more than needed.
---
The best
---
So you would quit and find a “proper job” if you were payed 6+ figures to play wow?
---
You were wrong, and you still are. You didn't play the game in a time where tarren mill/southshore was even open up to world pvp. You re-enacted it years later on a much smaller scale private server with probably tons of broken systems, and a lack of community. 
---
Go do better things.
---
Some of these guys have more viewers than this sub has members, and that's just at a given moment. The tiny guilds of neckbeards that form to "gank" streamers won't even be able to level as they'll all be KOS for most players on the streamers server. Even if you guys outnumbered them, you're still never going to be as geared, and obviously in 100x lifetimes will never be as skilled. This entire sub is a joke right now.
---
I wish.
---
Kind of similar to wolfshead and pummelers for druids no?
---
Then how do you know that they are spending more than Square Enix and that 1 million subs is not enough?
---
Fail
---
Oh
---
&gt;They even made a comment in that post saying they aren’t against rppvp, IF the demand is there. 
---
That's the part that annoys me, frankly. If they're so serious about mapping out appropriate servers for population projections, why haven't they don't any surveys to find out what people are going to do? What are they basing their decisions on, then? Beta data that has no RP servers at all?
---
Telling us "idk lol make it go viral" and leaving it at that is just not very fair. They don't realize how many of us there are.
---
And who's Mark Kern? A washed up game developer whose career is dead in the water and nobody in the industry takes serious anymore. And no, no they did not because all of those videos about Classic didn't start until Classic was announced. Streamers are just watching those Classic videos and react to it, it's some of the lowest effort content you can come up with.
---
Blizzard never took it seriously until Nostalrius was shut down and Omar said he could accomplish it.
---
lol nobody says that

can't unsee

What the "point of classic" is to you is not the same for everyone. What they do can only possibly affect you on the most minuscule level. Again - I don't give a shit what anyone does because why would I? Buy all the spells or use all the addons you want. Who cares.
---
I myself get a certain sense of satisfaction in saying "Hey maybe I don't need to shell out on Flamestrike right now as a Frost Mage with Blixzard and AE. I don't need an addon to tell me that.
---
It's just such a weird thing to get upset about.

Streamers are celebs to be worshipped for these kids

---
Exact same one with Tauren mill, basically if I look to fast and read something wrong I start just doing it the wrong way as a way to amuse myself, then it gets stuck.
---
Hahah, what you can do after lvl40 is invite people to group if they don’t have a mount or you’re in a no mount area, and aspect of the pack them around!
---
If you bothered to pay attention to this thread you would have seen I mentioned the current world record.
---
I also mentioned I'm not entirely sure how well the old record will hold up due to numbers being tweaked in Classic causing people to hit 60 a lot sooner than was previously possible.
---
Just because people are blowing through pserver level times doesn't mean anything in beta. Blizz can always tweak the numbers to be more in line with what we had during vanilla.
---
&gt;but one of the streamers who met with blizzard confirmed Ion Hazziwhatever personally said cross faction collusion would be fine.
---
Main tanks, guild masters, ninjas
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info!
---
Death succumbs thee
---
Minimum 120 hours more likely around 190 hours.
---
Even though I don't have any position on this debate, I don't think your analogy works really well. Because you could say don't do the crime if you don't want to do the time (can't do the time). It implies that if you're fine with going to prison, you should do the crime. While here, the goal is to not do the crime in the first place.
---
I believe it would be better to say since main streamers are able to create a big group fast or receiving free gold from their followers (and many other things), thus gaining an advantage on other players, we should have the right to use their advantage (their platform) against them
---
If youre in greens for more than like 2 days lmao. Guilds will be farming their mts pre raid bis asap. Most of MC can be done at level 58. I wouldnt worry about getting your tanks geared

---
I thought every class got a different version so it was more tailored for them?
---
I mean come on
---
Same here! It was my first class in Vanilla and my main up through Cata. After that I played more casual, so it become one of several characters I'd switch between, but I will forever be a Druid at heart.
---
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
---
IMO it doesn’t matter what class it’s best for.  By the time you get it your guild has already beaten the game... it’s a trophy for the person who deserves it the most.   That being said it’s best used on mages
---
So would you be okay with most players using a LFG addon? 
---
There has to be a boundary somewhere. It shouldn’t just be up to the player.

I love this thread.

---
You went from "me and my friends" which should be corrected to "my friends and i", then wrote"i and my friends"
---
He's right. Being able to tell exactly which spell is being cast and exactly how close it is really changes the game. I remember on my Shaman I would bait counterspell by using my hearthstone since it looks like a healing wave. 
---
Also if fighting a warlock it was a big deal when I finally started being able to identify when fear was being cast.
---
Meeting stones weren't summoning stones until Burning Crusade. Prior to that, they were group finders that were effectively less efficient than just looking for a group in chat. This was especially true during the patches where global LFG was a thing.
---
Oh fuck! I never thought about that. Do people need to be level 40 to have the aura work on them ?
---
Comparing apples and oranges.
---
&gt; Especially when the only evidence you have is "Apex did badly". 
---
Nope. The evidence is that Apex did so badly, it fell off top 10...and WoW also fell of top 10. They were BOTH in top 10 in the previous month.
---
Not illogical to assume that if both dropped off top 10, and the one that was above WoW only made $24 on PC and Console, while clearly WoW did similar revenues in March AND April (yes, they didn't lost 4/5ths of the subs from march to April - so WoW made similar revenue in both months) and it's only on PC.
---
Maybe it's too complicated for you to understand that.
---
There are also a ton of people wanking streamers off.
---
BUt you get to shadow meld while eating. ANdthat is sweet. Classic doesnt put shape shifts on the GCD. so you can still toss a heal up and move into bear form. Druids are considered the 3rd best leveler, and IMO better then hunters simply because you get that extra bag space.
---
&gt; You didn't play the game in a time where tarren mill/southshore was even open up to world pvp.
---
I was playing during Vanilla, though.
---
&gt;You re-enacted it years later on a much smaller scale private server with probably tons of broken systems, and a lack of community. That does not reflect how the game is going to be on release
---
LOL how INSANE, literally INSANE do you have to be to think that the community of 2019 is going to be closer to 2005 than to 2018 ?
---
Get the fuck out of here. Blocked and goodbye.
---
if people want to guild up and spend their time playing the game ambushing popular streamers,  who are you to tell them how to play?
---
as long as they aren't hacking to do this, they are doing nothing wrong.
---
I'm I the only I've who doesn't care about being on a streamer server or not?  I'll still make friends and have fun.
---
Crowded servers at launch is some of the most fun in WoW. But regardless at launch you won’t have gankers and tons of world pvp (like there were in beta with BiS geared leave 30’s). Plus I think there’s more starting areas than there are areas for level 30 questing?
---
I'm skipping launch day too and starting up the Wednesday night. Blizzard is not known for successful launch days, and I imagine stability will be wonky af Tuesday.
---
&gt; Is a 0/30/21 spec good for leveling?
---
I always get confused by this statement. How do you have 51 talent points to use while your leveling?
---
Not you man I’m saying the other guy lol
---
Is there a server list yet? And do we know which streamers will be on what servers? I don’t want to play on a server with streamers
---
Shits fucking horrible and If you're into anything remotely RP related like the Gta rp world you will lose interest fast when all the popular streamers do this dogshit.
---
The clarion call of every player who goes out of his/her way to be a douche canoe by saying edgy, deliberately incendiary things and repeated chat violations. One dude literally cried in vent after he got a temp ban for this shit. The lack of self awareness is fucking hilarious.
---
I don't report people. I can count on one hand how many people I've put on my ignore list from 2005 to 2015. I am not easily offended and have also had my fair share of temp bans for chat violations, among other things. But for shit's sake have the maturity to accept that you do this to yourself. It's not your freeze peach being violated, it's not safe spaces and millenials and social justice warriors, it's not fascist control freaks or the nanny state or big brother. If you don't want to be reported for chat violations, don't violate the chat rules. You aren't going to be reported and banned for ganking some lowbie. You aren't going to right click report one person in a fit of rage after he ganks you and get him banned. It doesn't work that way. You're being melodramatic. It isn't cute, clever, or funny.
---
“Oh fu*k me, I can’t get up on this side, I need to turn around and go up the back.”
---
Yeah, priests do well with that "Wax and Wane" healing style. Druids can do the same to an extent.
---
Pog! Ya he was my brothers best friend we consider him family. Lived right by us. He let me use his account a ton lol
---
My guild first killed a few of the bosses in there with people under 60 in the raid. In fact we first killed Lucifron with only 27/40 people and probably at least 10 were under 60 and most people were in greens and few blues.
---
Remember the guild name &lt;Eternal&gt; we bout to fuck the whole world up
---
The maintank most certainly needs lots of FR, but the raid does not. Greater fire protection potions is plenty for them. I did a 10day clear on a pserver last year and our MT had farmed dungeons for like 16 hours with a solid group, you definitely need that if you are going to be clearing ragnaros, day 7 I think is a bit crazy, we could've done day 9(but reset was day 11 so no hurry), day 8 seems possible, but day 7 sounds crazy.
---
I did get it no worries, my sarcasm was directed to the other guy.
---
A pet bar comes up with limited abilities when you mind control someone.
---
You act like you're the only one crying about streamers. LOL. Chuck your post onto the pile with the rest of em. You're a part of the problem, not the solution.
---
if you're levelling you should hit 5/5 Furor in the resto tree followed by dumping points in feral til you get to Leader of the Pack. Then it's up to you if you want to go into Balance for Omen of Clarity and Natural Weapons, or into resto for Nature's Swiftness (which requires a respec and dropping Leader of the Pack).
---
Once you hit 60, 30/21 is a fantastic soloing spec that I ran with for quite a while back in the day and on some more recent servers. For levelling itself, I always get 5/5 Furor in resto first and then head straight for Feline Swiftness in Feral.
---
The record is shit. Joana was an amazing player and router for his time but it's 15 years ago. If people can learn to clear naxx in under 2 hours on pservers, they can learn to level a bit faster than the "world record".
---
Why are you assuming that this record means something, when everything else that was record setting in vanilla either has been or will be broken too?
---
Some bosses will only have 3k armor and some will have much MUCH more, like Garr for example could have as much as 9k armor.
---
Good luck fury tanking with constant parry haste up LOL. You really have no idea what you're talking about.
---
yah good luck believing that blizzard will tweak balance  versus the #NOChanges mafia.
---
You never sheeped MCs on Hakkar or Prophet? Sheeped healers on Domo? AOEd skeletons on Nef? Handled bats on ZG bat boss?
---
"All mage PVE in classic" is hyperbole. There are fights where mages need to react and use more of their skillset, and almost all of them come after MC.
---
You're claiming other people can't figure it out but you wouldn't be able to explain what is is you're even talking about if it was to save your life.
---
If it's so straightforward it should be easy for you to explain, right? I'll wait.
---
&gt;  Retri barely kills anyone 1v1 besides warrior and by giving them one more auto attack every 10-15sec wont make a huge difference in pvp.
---
Wrong.  So much wrong.  There is nothing more to touch on this TBH.  Rets are really good 1v1 already against all classes.  Saying stuff like 'it wouldn't be that big of an issue' just shows your ignorance to the whole scope of the game.  Which I find it funny you think this but at the same time call other peoples ideas retarded lol.
---
&gt; It would change the game more. But honestly, having tier sets suitable for one spec is very limiting and its a terrible design. Its a big flaw in vanilla and was a huge improvement in tbc. But, I have just came up with solutions out of my head. Im pretty sure, blizzard can make some crazy team brainstorming and come up with even better solutions... Lazy thinking is simply stating "no thats not vanilla period", im being very creative here.
---
This right here is your whole issue.  You are attempting to 'fix' vanilla.  It doesn't need fixed.  I'm not suggesting it's perfect, but what it is, is what people have asked for and wanted to play.  We didn't ask for legacy servers to come back so they can fix them, we asked for legacy servers because we liked that version of the game. 
---
Saying 'no that's not vanilla' isn't lazy thinking at all.  It's drawing a line in the sand because of what has been PROVEN to happen in the past.  If you choose to ignore that, then that's on you.
---
What I always liked about DKP if it's setup well is that if someone gets a piece of gear they by definition earned it.  Loot council is obviously best for raw progression if you have a smart council, but it can lead to sour grapes.  If someone wins an item because they have more dkp than you it's because you missed a raid or spent more dkp then them, it makes sense and is reasonable.  
---
I think best is a combo loot council/dkp system.  Certain items are set aside for council only.  The rest is DKP.  For things like tank gear and thunderfury you don't charge DKP, but for items a lot of people want but you decided to council you can set a price when you assess the item to them.  And of course, MS &gt; OS.
---
nice bait
---
And they are recommending beast lore? lol
---
I put my phone down for a while to do something while writing the post, didn't check new again when I continued.
---
I was unsure whether to NSFW tag it or not, I mean it is just a mountain ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
There are level brackets, sure, but there isn't any kind of MMR system taking your personal ranking/skill into account when you enter queue. They just throw you in a BG with random people from your bracket.
---
Ganking is not bannable whatsoever
---
Not true.  A lot of classes have competition in dungeons for loot.  For example, mages/warlocks will likely face competition from priests who also want their gear, let alone shamans and druids who may also want rings, trinkets, etc.
---
Rogues tend to have a lot of competition from warriors on 1h weapons, and hunters/druids on leather.
---
Warriors and paladins have the least competition because no one else can use plate.
---
Disagree on this point - RNG is RNG. My old warlock got two Staves of Jordan in two weeks. I sold the second one and was fairly set for money the rest of my leveling. My druid never got a BoE epic, and I played him a lot more.
---
Sometimes the RNG gods are favorable, most times they're not. Just because many never saw a single drop doesn't mean a few of the millions of players didn't see multiple (and possibly in short time spans).
---
Where are you getting these armor values from? The warrior discord has discussed this to death and tests are showing far, far lower values. I’m certain rag will be down in 2 wks
---
They will need an entourage
---
Oh I'm sorry I was under the impression that there was more than one boss in MC. Apparently not.
---
This is dope.
---
Games are just the delivery method of micro transactions now.
---
I wonder how many people who oppose an optional graphic update purely because the old graphics are vital to the experience have a fully modded Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy, KOTOR, or other game with HD graphics mods and reshade.
---
I'm not arguing for or against a graphics update, I think that's a discussion for a little later when Classic has settled in. I'm just curious how many people flipping tables over graphics mod other games with HD graphics.
---
Which ever you think is the coolest.
---
Races REALLY don't matter that much.
---
You're delusional. Soda would roll you then smoke your ass. You're the type of guy that won't hit level cap.
---
What makes priests so good over other healers in Naxx?
---
Warrior/Tank? Human. Don't like Human? Pick whatever makes you happy. You can still be super effective regardless of Race.
---
And in this case they are spending 32 silver.  You can loot 5 mobs at level 30+ and make that much.
---
Exactly this.
---
Decent keybinds in 2004 beta??? I call Photoshop!
---
How does questi skip social group?
---
\#nochanges isn't about saying WoW Classic was perfect.  #nochanges is about saying we don't want to mess with what worked.
---
&gt;If you don't want to be reported for chat violations, don't violate the chat rules.
---
I won't, but thats what the system is primarily designed to tackle, there is no arguing against that. And I just find it completly unecessary as it takes me literally one second to put them on ignore if I find it annoying, thats it. Problem solved.
---
&gt;You aren't going to be reported and banned for ganking some lowbie. You aren't going to right click report one person in a fit of rage after he ganks you and get him banned. It doesn't work that way. You're being melodramatic. It isn't cute, clever, or funny.
---
I have played my fair share of multiplayer games that involves automated reporting, and from my experience 95% of all reports are made purely out of spite, which ganking lowbies absolutely 100% will cause, there is absolutely no way around it if some alliance players gets camped in Redridge for an hour, you bet your ass people will throw out reports.
---
I don't really see any upsides to this system, I don't think its needed at all, but I can definitely see it being abused and bet my ass  that it will mostly be abused.
---
&gt;I don't like automated reporting, either, but y'all are blowing this way out of proportion.
---
Probably won't affect me much, but again I don't think should be a part of the game at all, and I definitely see possibilities where the system have horrendous outcomes (such as mass reporting during the scarab lord race, sure won't be a permaban but can delay enough in order for them to lose the race). Or if some baby is crying "NINJA LOOTER" in global chats, and have players mass report for that.
---
The system should just be removed entirely, and the game will be much better off without it.
---
I’m sorry but world chat and general chat literally was unreadable with “INV TO SODAS LAYER” or “INV TO ASMONS LAYER”. I literally couldn’t read the chat from individuals looking to group up for non-streamer groups. It was awful. I rather chat be full of shitty convos than unreadable spam.
---
Considering he has consistently been gladiator rank since BC I don’t imagine that’ll go very well, but more power to you for trying.
---
Indeed, I have friends who have 2 or more monitors, but I suspect they have much better things to do with it than going chameleon-eyes to obsess over stalking someone on the internet whenever they're online.
---
I'm not saying anything of the sort. You asked if you had it right and you all of it wrong, which I pointed out.
---
I don't care what people do or do not do to streamers. If I didn't read this sub I wouldn't even know there *were* streamers.
---
What WA currently tells you where to stand in a fight with a visual indicator?
---
I like most of the model updates but prefer most of the old animations.
---
But the point is, these add-ons will be available. So why not just have it in the UI?
---
I always said gno-mer-ee-gan
---
You could have add-on look at the raid group, find a target with a debuff in them and automatically dispel it with one button. So the player would not need to find, target and dispel them, if they knew anyone was debuffed or was going to be, they could spam the button to clear it out without really doing anything.
---
Now imagine same scenario, but instead of looking for a debuff, you look for a certain treshhold of health and autocast a heal on them.
---
I actually played vanilla. I'm not some cata scrub. And I never had to rely on being carried to obtain anything I had.
---
I can see the argument for pummelers, but wolfshead just works as intended - and just happens to be BiS.
---
a good comparison could be the green whelp armor that put attackers to sleep. It was basically the go-to pvp chest until its nerf. 
---
So maybe Blizzard agrees with you since they fixed that one as well. 
---
But another consideration should be how brokem an item is. Druid dps definitly does not go out of hand by using the helmet so no real need to nerf it.
---
Trap launcher was stupid.  Distracting shot works fine.
---
are you being deliberately stupid or like what  
---
its fine to not want flying in a classic patch bc flying is antithetical to the design of classic.  
---
flying was integrated as part of the core game design for BC and WoTLK.  
---
how is this hard to grasp lmao
---
I tanked stockades with my hunter pet on a p server the other day because the warrior tank was literally click to move and got lost in the stockades.
---
You too
---
Ill still toss out r3 forts on randos.
---
If you want the best go human. 
---
If you don’t care about a 5-8% difference in dps / tanking increase then go with whatever you want. 
---
Personally I will play human.  I like the female combat animations and their epic mounts are cool and I like min/maxing. Now if I hated how humans looked then I wouldn’t do it - I’ll tell ya that. 
---
But it really does not matter if you are not pushing for world firsts.
---
Nope, it does not force everyone to use it.
---
There are keys to various low level dungeons. Some of those have gear that’s useful for a long time (zf mallet for trinket).
---
But outside of onyxia, no keys are truly needed by you.
---
Most of the time someone else will bring the UBRS key.
---
That said DM, strat, scholo, brd all have keys and are all endgame dungeons.
---
Well the post was about ragnaros. 
---
But anyway, threat is not an issue doing progression, people have too shit gear to do that much dps and warriors have pretty decent base threat, meaning that even with shit gear they do decent threat.
---
The whole 14% parry shit only impacts speedrunning.

The strength of the druid class comes from using all the tools available to you. Ignoring some tools is just a bad idea because you are only gimping yourself. Cat form should be used when fighting heavily armored opponents: get a pounce/ravage in, rake, rip, and drop into bear. You can also shift into it to dash, break slows/snares, etc.
---
I understand you may not like the form, and you definitely don't have to spend a ton of time in it, but you should always be aware of what abilities it has and when to use it.
---
Mind control? *OwO intensifies*
---
Plan on streaming I welcome the knives of neck beards. Gonna feel real sweet when they learn the hard way. I'm not the dude for that. Then I'll know their name and Jesus the hell I will rain down on them. Gonna be pouting to Blizzard. This streamer I tried to stream snipe is using an army like foxes to smoke me out then kills me over and over. Wah I can't play Wah mommy wheres my chicken tendies. Pretty much going to be the fate of all would be stream campers in the long run.
---
I am not jealous, it is clear you are being obtuse to get a rise out of me.
---
As I said, i love asmon and esfand. I'm sorry I tried engaging with you. I should have known better. it is clear that you are just a troll.
---
What is this addon?
---
Some Druids are hero’s. Others should just be hunters. You met the first kind. Praise Tyrion, there aren’t many
---
I'm sorry, but are you an everyone here willingly ignoring that he's talking about stream sniping, and not ganking? He's said countless times "he wants to be ganked" what he doesn't want is annoying ass stream snipers that spend all day watching his stream, following him around, and doing stupid shit like mob tagging, harassing him using pseudo-n words using a faction translator, and putting parties together to stream snipe him out of stealth.
---
This sub is either willfully ignorant or delusional. You're all ranting about something you don't even understand.
---
Can't go wrong with human, the weapon skill maters, NE have a 1% dodge bonus that's OK, gnome tanks are just funny. Stone form can be OK sometimes.
---
I'd say human is best, but pick what you like
---
Thunderfury and Hand of Rag weren't that uncommon. I mean, yeah only a few people per server had them but that had more to do with the extremely low drop rates than actual difficulty in obtaining them. Atiesh on the other hand was an exercise in consistency with your guild needing to clear the hardest raid content in the game multiple times. There was some RNG to it with the splinter drop rates, but the shaft and head (giggity) were drops from the end-bosses of AQ40 and Naxx respectively. It truly was a trophy and a status symbol.
---
Hunters level best solo, TBH. So you’ll be slowing him down regardless.
---
Just go human or night elf if you plan on tanking. Human is honestly the best race in the game followed by orc. But that’s only for min/maxing.
---
World first Thunderfury going to a hunter would be legendary.
---
Soda is a entertaining dude, and I enjoy his streams. But he talks too big of a game.
---
You haven't tested anything because the info isn't available. Mark Kern said that armor and resistances weren't normalized and that bosses like KT who was a caster had very low armor (3k people have been able to figure out from old clips) and bosses like Garr who was made of rock would have massive amounts of armor. No one boss have the same armor and resistances like the others the only thing we know for sure is that it's generally much MUCH MUCH more than the 3k that KT had.
---
Tailoring specs were TBC afaik, with Primal Mooncloth / Spellcloth / Shadowcloth being the options
---
You can't stop me from using MoveAnything because the default location of your nameplate is in the worst possible place, and group frames for healing are also terrible unless you want to not look at your character when you play.
---
I have no sense of smell.  For some reason it seems relevant if we're discussing female Forsaken.
---
&gt;even better to Elderspell 4 Planeswalkers and then start spamming Good Game!
---
This is great!
---
This is the thing I’m most looking forward to in Classic; a normalized in-game economy again.
---
Oh man I forgot this once too, I had a GF read it Gnome-Regan once, like the president.
---
Don’t Stop Believing just suddenly stopped playing
---
Hoes mad.
---
If you really think about it - all the Streamers and F&amp;F are just playing on their own private server themselves. Just play on a private server until they launch the game. It filled the void for me.
---
This is stupid.
---
ur a human male so obviously thats what you pick
---
i on the other hand am retarded so im picking a pally
---
Does the LFG add-on work cross server or teleport you to the instance? LFG add-on is just a UI improvement.
---
You do want to consider the upgrade. A pair of bracers may be  +1 spirit BiS vs another healer replacing a blue, for instance. 
---
Things to take into consider so that no one get. But if it’s a seasoned raiders BiS +1 spirit and a noob raiders first run. Or maybe it’s the seasoned players off spec. Debate debate debate. 
---
“Go ahead and take 10 everyone, will pick up at the top of the hour”
---
While I have rolled more fem UD casters than male UD, I admit I love how male UD look like they’re dancing to their own montage music while firing up a fireball. Compared to fem UD looking like a calm, composed wizard.
---
My rules for UD casters are:
---
- Is this a flashy pvp spec? (PoM Pyro) Pick male
---
- Is this a normal pvp spec? Pick fem, it’s nice to have a bit of male UD every now and then, but after a while it becomes normal and the beauty of male UD casting animations is no longer the joy it once was.

Why to streamers immediately accuse people who kill them of stream sniping?
---
Do you think people commit the names of streamers to memory?
---
What happens in 99% of these situations is that some entitled streamer decides that someone who killed them, or is hanging out near them, is a stream sniper.  And then he gets all his little fucktarded minions to abuse the reporting system in order to literally prevent that person from being able to play the game. 
---
There are 0 ways to prove "stream sniping" unless you are actually at the physical address of the person allegedly doing it.
---
So why do people deserve to get accused of stream sniping by people with no evidence?  This mentality speaks volumes about those people who only wish harm and to ban others because of what?  Grow the fuck up yourself if you can't put yourself in the shoes of someone who has been undeservedly accused, attacked and possibly even banned by a mob of assholes waving pitchforks at the behest of some streaming douche because he was inconvenienced.
---
No excuses
---
Until the server catches on
---
And human hunter.
---
Cant remember what private server i was on that allowed crossfaction chat but I absolutely hated it. Would much rather gank and be ganked without all the shit talk.
---
No I 100% believe it's awful. I truly think your right about that. Iv'e seen twitch chat before. I'm just saying that I normally leave chat anyway for the reason that it's 90% toxic bullshit anyway.
---
What’s your website? Raid signup is what I’m struggling with most
---
As all thing should be
---
it isn't gonna happen.  
---
power creep is already dicey at AQ40/Naxx gear levels. If they added a new tier of content with better gear, things would begin to spiral out of control *very* fast. That's part of why the hellfire peninsula quest gear was so strong in the first place, to reset everybody's relative power.  
---
even worse, "original classic content" would be *severely* vetted by the community. As of right now the devs seem really in line with the spirit/vision of the original game completely as it was. But putting in new shit would be essentially "this is what *we* think would fit in vanilla" and that's modern 2019 blizz devs saying that, not 2003 blizz devs. Even if it was the OG actually vanilla team it would be dicey, but those guys are long gone.  
---
They're gonna just do BC because the demand for it is high enough.
---
&gt; If blizzard doesn't think there are enough players to sustain a server, they need to survey players and find out for sure.
---
They certainly have some data on this. They have already made the determination that it isn't feasible. 
---
&gt; In the meantime, so many of us are in limbo
---
Nobody is in limbo. They have already stated outright that it isn't happening. Make your plans now because they have already made the decision. 
---
Not trying to be an asshole, but I don't want you or anyone else to continue this false hope that Blizz is changing their mind on this. Do not expect an rppvp server, it's not going to happen.
---
Goron City resurrection.
---
Give our pets an AoE threat generating ability and we'll just take over the role as main tank.
---
Whenever I get onto a tangent with the boys when talking about WoW and its changes through the years, I go in to this recurring rant about how their vision has turned into "creating a consistent user experience." I've found some parallels in Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 as well. 
---
IMO, it's a lot of overzealousness under the banner of balancing the game, and making it more appealing to a broader/more casual audience.
---
That process has only sucked the soul out of the game.
---
Nah, it won't. The streamers are trying to consolidate on servers so they can fight each other. They do realize they can't ALL go to one server because of population, but the big streamers will be on a handful of servers...tops.
---
strawman
---
What's different?
---
Male autoattack animation is reportedly one of the better ones. Female eviscerate looks cooler with a chance for a flip.
---
@McConnellRet
---
Calm down dude
---
If you want to see that content, better grind hard and join the top guild on your server. You are honna have to go try hard, sonething this sub seems to hate.
---
Hands down, #1 S-tier video from vanilla is Nogg-aholic
---
[https://youtu.be/UDQyEe06Q-M](https://youtu.be/UDQyEe06Q-M)
---
That secret troll village that gets linked here all the time?  Largely popularized by it.  I got my first look at rogue T2 set from it, first look at Caverns of Time, first look at Mount Hyjal, and Dopefish's other videos have cool stuff like the alpha Emerald Dream and the original (unfinished) iteration of Outland.  Those exploration guys were pioneers on the fringes of World of Warcraft and left me with a lot of cool songs, to boot.
---
The problem is, games are getting exponentially more expensive to not only make but to maintain as well. Developers can no longer just release a game and be done with it. They have to have content patches, bug fixes, etc... 
---
Mobile games are EXTREMELY cheap to make. Their profit margins are humongous. They will not stop making mobile games. There are plenty of people who enjoy them, a lot more than you could imagine. 
---
I fear that PC and console gaming will be left behind. Sure, mobile games will keep getting better as its users demand more but I doubt PC and console games will do anything other than decline. Everyone wants a piece of the huge market share that mobile games has.
---
Jealous and delusional people. Jealous that they can’t play WoW all day and get paid. Delusional if they think the community is going to be anything like vanilla. It’s 2019 not 2004.
---
There is no "best" or "worst" class. It all depends on what you want to do and your playstyle.
---
Could this be a possible gold making method? Selling 36%movement speed buff
---
so classic wow is out now?
---
I had Ashkandi on my lock for a few days. We used to do BWL alt runs and to get some people the few items they were missing. After downing bed and having it drop the warrior alt that was supposed to get it was bugged in the master looting window, so ML couldn’t give it to him. Being the guy that disenchanted any spare loot they gave it to me so it could be de’d if the ticket they opened about it couldn’t be resolved, in the end it was all sorted out by GMs but it was great walking up to people in IF and putting it in the trade window with them.
---
I say they're the hardest to gear because their gear matters more than most of the rest of the raid. You could send a bunch of 60s with greens into mc and clear it assuming they know how to play. But if you were to have anyone with gear in that raid, you'd want it to be the tank
---
The assumption at current time within all theorycrafting is that raid bosses were massively overbuffed on p servers to the tune of 25-30% in boss damage, hp and armor values. Using a correct comp there will be no issues reducing armor to 0 on some bosses. If we’re talking KT then fury tanking will have 0 issues as everyone will be geared out the ass. MC is so mindlessly easy I don’t understand why people even argue hardcore guilds will remotely struggle. The raids doable at level 58
---
if they want to set themselves behind on DKP over 1 spirit that's their choice and the other playing in blue will catch up fast as that guy has tanked his dkp.  It all works out in the end and it assumes people won't make bad economical choices.  If its a noob raider's first run it won't take hardly any dkp to get your 1 spirit upgrade.  The noob is there as a trial and honestly they haven't proven that they will show up tomorrow so they can watch as a raider gets rewarded with loot for showing up everyday.  
---
That's another nice thing about DKP.  You set the system, everyone knows the rules.  Be smart or be dumb, place your bid and that's it.  Not much to debate afterwards.  Carry on.
---
I mean, Heigan is a cake walk though without addons.  
---
Put on the [Safety Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs) and just run back and forth lol. 
---
Its even a cakewalk depending on which version of the dance you do too. I think I've done it with casters on platform and melee on platform. 
---
Heigan is a pretty poor example to use imo.
---
Incorrect.  A fire mage will still use a ton of arcane and frost spells.
---
* Polymorph
---
* Arcane explosion (only AoE you can continually cast while moving)
---
* Arcane missiles (if target is about to run out of range or break LOS)
---
* Many frost abilities to keep an enemy at range
---
If you go fire mage and only use fire spells, you are seriously gimping yourself.
---
This is very true and I don’t know why all the most upvoted comments are saying “just don’t use them, simple as that!” Blizzard has even had to ban addons (modify the API) on RETAIL for oversimplifying the game. 
---
I used to think this community understood what makes a good game but they really don’t. They just know they like Vanilla.
---
That happened to me when I dinged level 80 the first time too. I believe this bug was fixed in cataclysm.
---
I actually think it won’t happen and for a big reason. Server issues. It’s going to be a bitch to level up and it’s going to be a bigger bitch trying to log in. I think it’s highly likely severs will crash and they’ll have to relog, placing them in a que. I hope nobody is expecting a smooth launch because by now we should be fully aware that smooth launches just don’t exist. Now as for week two, definitely . I see multiple guilds getting it down and complete without too much fuss.
---
You're missing the point. He's saying that the addons should be disabled. Blizzard determines how addons can interact with WoW by providing functions in the API. Things are added and removed from the API all the time.
---
white mode 🤢
---
Yes.  I am.  
---
I'm going to re-up my sub two hours before launch and make my character.  I don't have a "popular" name.
---
Druid: [This space intentionally left blank]
---
Warlock is a fine class, not sure why anyone would say it's the worst. I'd go orc for race but both are fine choices
---
i hope its like that but i dont know man
---
If only... I would love to roll on this server and snipe away just to rustle some jimmies.
---
&gt; They deliberately make their every move public.
---
So because it's easy to take advantage of it, is not cheating? You're wrong.
---
&gt;  in my book it's stupidity of these cult-of-personality figures.
---
"Streaming is stupid because you give an advantage to your opponents" &lt;-- you right now, what a fucking moron.
---
It just seem like you don't like streamers so you don't give a shit, why not just be sincere then? Just admit that the reason why you don't care about the cheating is because you hate streamer culture.
---
Personally I would understand your dislike for streamer culture, I'm not a fan of it myself, but the argument that you shouldn't stream because "it gives advantage to your opponent" is stupid as shit. Clearly their intention is to entertain viewers, not giving an advantage to other players because they're not giving advantage to people who care about fair play.
---
Stream sniping isn't fair play. If there is no fair play someone is cheating.
---
I have things to do between now and launch, so many things.
---
I will do all the things so that for that last 4 months of this year nobody will miss my disappearance. 
---
I’ve already told my Rabbi I won’t be observing Shabbat, he understands and wants me to joint his guild.

ZULUL DEPLOY SCOUTS ZULUL

Orc is best for PvP, Undead for PvE.
---
Yourself. They're all very good choices. Though Stuns tend to be more common than Fears between the collective of classes. Personally I go by which race is sexiest. Tauren Warrior though &lt;3
---
What a yellow dude.
---
Always mark first because the buff lasts longer. Thorns will still fall off first but at least it will stay active for an extra 1.5sec
---
For all you know WoW is in 11th place and Apex is in 30th place. You can't make any of the claims you are making when your only evidence is that both WoW and Apex are outside the top 10.
---
I don't follow CS at all, but it is consistently the second most played game on Steam. Why is it crazy that the second most played game on the biggest PC storefront is in the top 10 of pc revenue?
---
Technically not a mispronunciation, but its similar and it annoys me more than it probably should: Outlands.
---
There's no 'S'. It's just Outland. Yet, for some reason, everyone seems to insist on referring to it as Outlands.
---
\&gt;!but i really am not even that good.!&lt;
---
I have no desire to play with them (unless they're courteous) or really care what they think of me, so I reckon that's my biggest "bargaining chip." I do however, acknowledge that there's an anti-fanbase which for whatever reason, makes it their primary goal to try infuriating streamers. Probably in a "hey ma, I'm on tv!" sort of way? I don't know.
---
As a player that exclusively played on RPPVP, It really doesn't matter much to me,  happy for you if you get it, don't care if you don't.
---
All the RPPVP servers were flooded with people that just wanted to PVP and RP'ers were easy target so, gankers were slightly more common on RPPVP then normal PVP servers.
---
All the RP, usually died down so that only Erotic RP was the only thing RP visibly left on the server, so in the end you were just left with PvP servers, with better naming rules.
---
Okay. Somehow I think Nostalrius shutting down and the petition being signed weighed more than what streamers think. Some streamers may have supported the petition, but if you're saying Blizzard only listened to it because of those streamers, you put way too much value in a streamer's opinion.
---
&gt; can't wait for classic to launch and people realize how irrelevant a handful of dudes broadcasting themselves playing, and their fan base, is in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of people who will be playing the game and never heard of them or could care less.
---
normally i would agree. But my anecdotal evidence overwrites what i feel should be a correct opinion. Streamers absolutely destroyed ESO for the 1st few months of launch. The streamers that were invited to "test" eso before everyone else, and was used to garner audience brand recognition. They all decided to join the same faction, out of 3 possible factions. They ended up using lag a weapon. They would mass report people, just because the streamer said too. it was impossible to pvp against them. unless you coordinated a mass of people to rival theirs. this led to cyrodiil, basically their pvp endgame being utterly pointless for the 1st 2 years of the games life. beause it was nothing but 60 person zergballs spamming aoes and heals.
---
The answer to this is not that complex. You want to aquire as much raw gold as possible, hence vendoring scraps you and farm other activities like that have a lot more value early. 
---
Later on you want to move over to providing services for people (dungeon runs, enchants, rare crafts, etc..)
---
Good luck.
---
Well paladins are busy using cloth leather and mail healing gear so warriors have no competition on plate.

Fordring or Lannister?

The ones that get me are something like dismounting on ability use. You don't auto dismount when you try to use an ability like you do in modern wow but you can just macro all your abilities to dismount. Dont even need an addon to fix it but is just annoying to do.
---
Then he can play on a PVE server and just avoid ganking entirely... It sounds more like he wants to be on a PVP server so he can gank anyone anytime, but doesn't want to have to be ganked ever. It's almost certain that at some point he's going to get camped by someone who doesn't even know who he is and will inevitably complain they are stream sniping. I barely know who he is but if I saw a character in the world, I'd probably attack and kill them if and whenever possible. So if I happened to kill him 2-3x in a random zone he'd probably whine "stream sniping" even though I watch none of them :\.
---
It should be that all QoL that blizzard will *allow* is included in the base game. Addons shouldn't be able to add any functional QoL.  
---
Addon changes layout of your screen for your *personal* QoL = fine  
---
Addon makes it so you can set artificial focus frames = not fine
---
The official forums were so bad they started deleting threads if it was people bitching about streamers. I agree, people are making way too big of a deal about this.
---
Harassing streamers seems like a modestly satisfying part of endgame content. I don’t even have any issues with streamers. 
---
I plan on playing rogue anyways. If I’m ever bored and there’s a streamer on the opposite faction you can bet I’ll be checking it to see if it’s feasible to snipe them.
---
On fresh Northdale (private server), that's what we did.  As a shaman it was important for me to get the gear that would let me 1-shot (or nearly so) most of the people I would face finishing up quests in STV.
---
Oh look, a brown-noser.
---
Its a pvp talent now that reduces frost fire and nature dmg taken by 15% and with this new system coming in bfa you can end up having it in raids potentially. Pretty stupid prune tbh
---
As Meto1183 said, I would rather have it in an optional addon than spamming my chat
---
Don’t be salty, its unbecoming
---
Who gives a shit?  Just /wave and do your thing. They said there will be layering so the fighting over mobs should be lessened, and it’s lunch day anyway so it’s hard to tell if you’re losing a mob over a streamer or just the other million excited people. 
---
Worrying about streamers is going to ruin your experience more than actual streamers.
---
No and no. I would just suggest checking this sub on launch day, I am sure there will be a few threads with people listing streamer's server since many people are concerned.
---
Excactly. My argument here is since this is something that makes no sense in executing, bringing 3 non optimal class specs to raid wont hurt as much as people seem to think it does. Having 1 ret pala/elemental or enh shaman with 1 shadow priest 1 bomkin would barely affect the overall raid dps. W're talking about a 2-5% dps loss. That is not so impactful as to never allow a single spot for each of those 3 specs.
---
It's wierd to me that people worry about this kind of stuff with classic. Guilds will be more important than ever and gearing is much easier to do if you're a main raider for your group that always performs well.
---
Probably people will end up exploring and grouping with others more if there’s not an arrow pointing to their next objective like a carrot on a stick.
---
I’d absolutely love to see Karazhan patched in as a raid, though maybe make the chess event  an optional “boss” and tie nightbane into progression instead.
---
It’d also give the lonely Greater Arcane protection potion significantly more use.
---
How else can i get offended by people i don't know, who also have no impact on me whatsoever?
---
I mean I'm already doing /who c-priest 20-30 to find people for my dungeon groups. Is it a big deal if an addon is running those /who searches for me and presenting the results in a better UI?
---
The music is perfect. That troll put up a good fight!
---
Discord and google sheets/docs. We have everything from forums, raid signup, attendance, information etc on the discord. Then we use google sheets to log attendance and other stuff.
---
It's not really the internet though, seems to be culturally as a whole. People keep more to themselves and avoid conflict more so than I remember. They avoid nuisances and time sinks like waiting around forever for someone to join a group or taking an hour to go to a store when you can simply buy online. We're more of an instant gratification culture now and people don't feel the need to socialize outside of their close group of friends. The internet has played a large part but it's not specifically limited to interactions online.
---
We need top men to make both list.
---
What problem do you think layering is a solution for?
---
Yes but you still can only work on one at a time?
---
&gt; have I got this right? 
---
Yes I think you have it.
---
But also,
---
Using game mechanics to kill a streamer is harassment.
---
But a streamer ordering his followers to mass report someone is not harassment, especially if there is no proof of sniping beyond what the streamer "believes".
---
you said my comparison is irrelevant, while totally missing the point I was trying to make.
---
which is, if nobody is watching me play, and I get ganked, it's  "just the way she goes", not an issue.
---
but if hundreds or thousands are watching me play, its now an issue that needs to be dealt with.
---
I was trying to point out the hypocrisy.
---
IIRC the pservers were making Ragnaros hit for physical damage, but the attacks should have been fire damage. This made Ragnarok a tank and spank vs a gear check on the main tank. 
---
If that's as big of a deal as it should be, none-fire resistant main tanks will be getting one shotted by a rag crit. 2-3 normal hits. Fire protection pots will not work for the main tank since every hit goes against the protection amount, and there is a cooldown to the potion. Please correct me if I am wrong here! 
---
Rag was a gear check for fire resistance on the main tank... 
---
Provided you have efficient farming, fire protection gear by the main tank could be obtained very quickly though. I would anticipate a week 2-3 rag kill given this detail for hardcore guilds. Maybe less. Not a week 1 kill though. 
---
Nothing was more disheartening than being level 49 in pserver, leveling as fast as I could, and then server wide announcement that rag was killed. 4/5 days in. I REALLY HOPE THEY DO NOT ANNOUNCE THIS SERVER WIDE AS IT IS VERY DEMORALIZING!!
---
If you want to tank human all day every day. The others have some benefits but humans weapon skill win state day!
---
Hmm I doubt it. It’s like a cheap taxi service I suppose. With mage portals and flight paths I don’t see it paying out. You would only get business from warriors and priests. Travel form is better, ghost wolf is better, warlocks/Paladins get free mounts, mages have blink/portals, and rogues have sprint (but they could be potential business). Sounds like an interesting idea though
---
I don't get why folks are so alarmed about this. They've always had rppvp realms, why would you think they wrong now?
---
Speed running will be a thing
---
No, I'm saying you guys are discounting streamers and inflating your own role. Do you think Blizzard would respect the opinion of some random person on the wow forums with three replies over a multi rank 1 gladiator, someone who has been playing the game for years and has an audience of over 30k every time he streams and his videos get millions of views? Blizzard understandably would listen to that level of credibility over a bunch of randoms on the internet who are just complaining and playing an illegal version of their game.
---
Get a bank alt to level 5 and have them be your enchanter. Mail them all your greens and just siphon the mats off them to sell or use. The only loss by doing it that way is you cant DE your garbage quest rewards or dungeon loot that binds on pick up.

Sorry for the late reply, he'll be streaming all today and this weekend.
---
I have a solution. 5 camels and I’ll buy your family.
---
An honest trade and then you can play guilt free.
---
1 tank per any guild doing raids consitently at least
---
If you play a lock and want to pve end game be ready to summon the large part of a 40 man raid
---
It's like people forget that WotF is a one time use with a 2 minute cooldown. "Oh no, he used WotF to break fear, guess ill just... fear him again..."
---
I love Classic Orgrimmar.
---
You’re going to report someone for doing something completely legal in the game? Ganking is part of the game. You can’t report someone for killing you repeatedly when you’re in a contested zone or PvP server.
---
&gt; the BfA drones
---
you're impossible to take seriously as an analyst of any kind when you use language like this. Reeks of bias and childishness.
---
Wouldn't they just got about limited the API or whatever to prevent a certain type add-on rather than just banning specifics as they pop up? The latter would seem like a highly ineffective way to regulate such things.
---
That very optimistic yet short sighted.  As many here have said people will just alt tab to wowhead.
---
I don’t remember it being like that you’d get banned from blitz servers for that
---
Ion said they don't plan to add any unless people "show demand." So that's why you see lots of people trying to push it.
---
you’re literally still making streamer content. fucking lol
---
Forsaken Rogue is better. Cannibalizing someone you ganked is the ultimate BM.
---
You're skipping over why game design has become this way. It's not some conspiracy by developers. Culturally the world seeks quicker gratification and less not-required socialization. It has found its way into gaming development. You act like games made people anti-social when the reality is the less social nature of people is why these games have these systems.
---
Upvoted for Great Truth.
---
Give it some hours. Posts these big from new users need to be approved by Blizzard staff in the official forums.
---
You can'?
---
Whats stopping you?
---
Any chance you can add warlock grimoires and remember which ones the warlock pets learned?
---
Currently the grimoire trainer in classic will only tell you what grimoire your currently summoned pet knows. Dismiss the pet and the trainer acts as if you haven't learned any of them.
---
There was a an addon for this in vanilla, but it'll probably not work with all the api changes:

I guess you can play Dark Souls then, if Classic is too easy for you.
---
TL,DR of TL,DR plsss
---
Apparently you don't know the meaning of the term.
---
Just... no.  Seriously, no.
---
I don't care if you don't like their stream.  Just don't watch it.
---
Trolling them doesn't accomplish anything.  It's just the same as trolling anyone else.  You're setting out to be a jerk to someone else and harm their enjoyment of the game.  If that's the attitude you want to bring, please don't play.  Don't add toxicity to WoW Classic.  You aren't a "hero."  You aren't helping anyone or anything.  You're just being a jerk and fostering a negative attitude.
---
Why not just play the game?  Make some friends, run dungeons, do PVP as you normally would.
---
Here's an easy test:
---
Would you *want* someone to do to you what you propose to do to a streamer?
---
If the answer's no, then you shouldn't be doing it.  If the answer's yes, then you're encouraging people sniping each other's names and griefing each other as much as possible.
---
LMAO the reactions must have been golden. That’s hilarious. I wouldn’t be surprised if a few people would quickly assume you were a ninja looter. That’s a funny scenario
---
Awesome work! This is really cool
---
Yah PPP became the top guild, but I remember Valhalla and AP being up there prior to the forming of PPP.

---
I mean fair enough but those have replayabillity because of it's sheer competitiveness, but when it comes to bang for your buck for casual experience I think wow shines, POE is a good example too
---
I think everyone is just super anxious for the game, most don’t have beta access, and we can only just imagine and think about what will happen when the game is finally released.
---
Not new models, I just meant higher textures
---
This is one I shall never forget.
---
so basically, streamers want to play on PvP, but never have to actually deal with the inconvenience of \*gasp\* having to fight opposing faction players.
---
Haha yeah it was great some people just spammed a tirade of abuse others just closed the window, I was also sure to do it to notorious guildhopping lootwhores who by this time had 0 opportunity to get into a position where they could ever get it, and, I know I’m an assshole for this, the people I knew were after it but would never have it drop for their guild (although those people took it quite well in general), also green/blue geared warriors :D
---
Mage gives 2% crit
---
Warlock gives 33SP
---
Priest gives 62 +heal
---
Druid gives 11mp5
---
The warlock staff is more suitable for warlocks while the mage staff is better for mages. The other two are kinda meh tbh. Mostly they give about half a trinket slot to one group.
---
One funny thing about Atiesh is that the aura doesn't work with the moonkin aura. So if you have a moonkin in the raid, you get a bigger bonus from being in the moonkin group than the Atiesh group.
---
World of Tanks... hell World of Warships has a pretty slim market I bet...
---
Go look at how much they are making with their 'slim minority'
---
Undead Females hold their weapons fucked up in one hand (fixed in WoD models), which makes things like Claw of the Black Drake look fucking stupid in their hands. This irked me so badly on my UD female rogue, my first 60 back in Vanilla. Perpetually having one weapon all derped. If they fixed it for Classic (I can hear the reeee-ing from the #nochanges crowd already) then I'd consider UD female again, but this time around I'm going Orc female.
---
The ones used by top guilds.
---
That's pretty dope.  
---
Had one on my paladin where the Princess in BRD's death dinged me AND I got hand of justice after the kill.
---
Right but I assume we are talking about the asmongold/sodapoppin streamers of the world.
---
The only downside to this is that the current meta is so plentiful with both knowledge and software that has been honed for over a decade to the point that this economy is going to be heavily manipulated, as opposed to heavily speculated. Since there is really very little room for speculation all we are going to see are periods of over-inflated but stable markets with wild fluctuations as new phases are rolled out. It is going to be a wild ride, for sure.
---

Stay here you piece of shit I am trying to bu.... Los... Los... Los... There we go!
---
this question is refering to the auro that everyone in your party will get
---
mage grants 2% crit, by far the strongest of the auras. Druid grants 11 mana per 5.... lol
---
I saw the YT clip of Asmon getting the Chromiac Sword as a gift. I nearly shit my self.
---
Thank you!!
---
But this is the issue, Lets take an example, you are walking in STV, you see someone (soda) and you decide to fight him, 1v1 fair fight, you kill him. He tries to revive himself, heal up and chase to fight you again, this time while you are low hp after a elite mob, you still kill him. Now he is mad, he cant beat you. Therefore he will put you on a blacklist to punish you. Does soda really have that power to choose who he puts on that list and not.
---
Then all of his followers will hunt you and gank you forever, just because you won and made him mad.
---
You stop playing the game, just because some over privileged streamer thinks he is a dictator in the server.
---
wait theres a tldr? i couldnt even find it
---
There is a culture of business conduct in wow. If you aren't above board with your transactions, people find out quick and you don't have transactions any more.
---
Isn't it just a different kind of druid?  They established Tauren druid lore in The Barrens pretty damn well.
---
I also don't remember it being written down that only NE males can be druids.  Just because that's all we saw in WC3 doesn't mean they're the only ones that can be druids.
---
Dead mines west wtf is that shit 😏
---
1. It does matter. Waiting 4 days for an AV queue to pop was fucking awful and made people hate the game.
---
2. That's not how it worked anyway. Faction imbalance made queue times on one side extremely long and the other side had fast queue times.
---
Seriously?
---
Which one would you recommend ?
---
So you’re saying they will be playing to defend the honor of their streamer instead of just watching and eating cheetos?  
---
And you’re saying they won’t want to progress their characters and will take big XP breaks to do that as well?  
---
Or do you think PVE guilds will care who is on a streamer’s blacklist?
---
I always heard that the entire raid will have to wear fire resistance gear, but on every private server I've played only the tanks wield fire resist gear. I wonder if this will change on Classic.
---
About healing prediction, yeah, I guess it helps a lot. We didn't have that in vanilla, we had assigned healing targets (aka tanks) and used a lot of stopcasting and of course downranking to heal as  mana efficient as possible. And of course looking at that healing meter after a fight and comparing your healing done to your overheal was a really good ego boost if you did well.
---
As far as I remember I only got healing prediction when mana started to no longer be a big problem anyways in later addons.
---
I remember those augmented reality addons that came to life (and were pretty fast canceled by blizzard) during wotlk? That depending on boss phase and ability painted marks on the ground were you should be standing etc. I'm glad those went away fast.
---
I also wouldn't be using any questhelper and route planner thingies (except for gathering herbs, I had gathermate or whatever it was called in TBC). They are not game breaking but immersion breaking, which for me is a big nono. And I would hate any automated group finder mods.
---
You're leaving out the part that they also said that if people didn't stop doing it from then on they'd be punished extra for it since now they have a warning.
---
i love titanpanel. ill use it again.
---
Link me one. We all watched Method stream Crucible and Jaina and none of them had a visual indicator where to stand. Didn't have one for G'huun either when it would've been pretty handy. We watched the W1st Pieces Crucible still no visual indicator where to go and that fight has one of the highest positional requirements of any fight in recent memory with the way the debuff works.

Some will do it, most I think will do it when after a while they feel lost. Its no the same to alt tab a couple of quest that having an addon tell you every step you have to do.
---
&gt; as long as they aren't hacking to do this
---
They're using information obtained outside of the game to gain an unfair advantage over another player. You don't need to hack to cheat.
---
Trust me, Its a lot of fun.

Ahh gotcha

Which will be honored only by streamer guilds meanwhile everyone else will still have 40man raids to fill.

---
Everyone that has any sort of desire to PvP will be using that addon, for the same reason everyone doing PvE will have DBM, so it's not like one person will have an advantage over everyone else.
---
I think it'll be fine, especially with the initial Layering. Most of the time if you just ignore the PvPer they'll piss off out of boredom anyways. I can't wait to see the city/barrens raids though. Those were always absolutely silly.
---
The Classic Beta client is an older version of the Retail client, it isn't running 8.1. And yes, this has been tested by myself and several other people on Reddit. Absolutely no DX12 and multi-threading support in Classic Beta.
---
It might be a bit chaotic at times but it wont be impossible to level. A lot of people will want to move past leveling so they can max out and then pvp. I will probably waste some time pvping at low levels but not too much

I’m with you man. I hate add-ons, some are way too much. 
---
Lfg addon is #1 in my fuck no and please blizz break it.
---
The ones that provide PvP advantages are bullshit and shouldn’t be allowed.
---
I understand ui addons and don’t think they’re usually game breaking.
---
Quest helper is bullshit and shouldn’t be allowed, this isn’t retail.
---
Boss mods shouldn’t even really be necessary for vanilla, and it would be more difficult if we didn’t use those. I thought we wanted this game to be challenging?
---
Yet I see so many people using all this stuff, like they don’t actually even want Classic, by the time they’ve modded their shit it’s a different thing than what I’m playing.
---
Ah yeah I can't see why anyone would really give a rats ass about that.
---
For pve dps, Humans are the best class by a wide margin because of the +hit with swords/maces. 
---
Every other race has arguably more pvp utility than humans, but Dwarves or Gnomes would probably win it out with Stoneform or Escape Artist (roots will be one of your biggest annoyances as a warrior in pvp - particularly Frost Mages).
---
Warriors also have the benefit of being able to tank outside of raids while in a dps spec. If you end up main tanking for raids, this won't really apply, but everything short of that you should be able to do while fury specced. 
---
Unfortunately, it can't be overstated how useful the +hit with maces/swords is for humans if you want to dps; if you plan on doing a mixture of pvp/pve/raiding, I would highly recommend human. 
---
If, however, you have no plans to raid and are only looking to tank dungeons and pvp on the side, you could accomplish that as an arms specced warrior of pretty much any race and be fine.
---
Best way to prepare? Try and do stuff outside the game so you don't burn out immediately.
---
Yikes, don't hurt anyone buddy, it's just a game
---
This.  Couldn't have said it better myself.

Horde vs. Alliance is part of the game and that means PvP.  If you don't want to PvP go on a PvE server.

I always used to call mara "maruudon"

How is that any different than what will happen if you have to use trade chat instead?

Can you imagine being the alliance seeing this happen?

You could test a few things I guess.
---
Stealing mobs.   By killing the opposite faction and taking their half dead kill?
---
Test racials in PvP.
---
Test cross faction communication.
---
Test side by side troll female with alliance females to truly take in how hideous troll females are.
---
Test diminishing honor from farming the same toon for honour
---
I never ignored him, I've just never seen him. Usually I watch the content creators videos on YouTube, not live streams.

I don't really look on forums unless you count Reddit.

World PvP on a fresh server is the most fun I've ever had in WoW.  You may have to move to another area or group with others to get things done sometimes, but if you view PvP as part of the game rather than a hindrance to leveling you'll have a lot of fun with it.

I prefer dwarves for mining and blacksmithing professions, but they get a hunter boost with guns.

Loot trading will be active in Classic, but only for raid loot.

Not bad
---
Scroll down any wow related reddit there will be an asmon post early on
---
Can these streamers not just set a delay on their streams? 5-10 mins would help if it is such an issue?
---
I get wanting people to suck it up and use ignore. I replied to another post a while back though about somebody worried about getting reported or kicked out of classic. I linked several customer service posts of people right click reported and silenced "for no reason", you know other than sexually explicit remarks, terrorist threats, profanity, racial slurs (one even in a GM chat lol), things like that. It's okay to say this shit in guild, private chats, PM with other like-minded people who share your dark sense of humor, but not trade.
---
It takes more than a handful of reports to get somebody auto-actioned. A group of 5 reporting you for ganking them isn't going to get you squelched, silenced, or banned. Seriously, this is dramatic.
---
There is one case on live where auto-report and silence was abused. Some guild was giving away free carries so people could have one last chance at an "ahead of the curve" type achievement and a mount reward that was going away soon. A competing guild SELLING carries mass reported them. It was overturned, obviously. 
---
Another alarming issue with the right click report system is as I understand it, Blizzard cannot see who filed the report, and so cannot punish those who misuse and abuse the system. If this has been fixed or will be fixed for classic, that's be swell. It sounds to me like before automation kicks in it's supposed to get a human review, and if so that also works for me.
---
I'm not saying there's zero potential for abuse, per se, just that these claims that "95% of reports are made purely out of spite" and are invalid AND implying that any significant portion of them contain enough reports to breach whatever internal threshold to trigger an action is pretty melodramatic.

I was guild leader in a worlk pserver, it was a guild purely focus on pvp. bgs, open world, arenas, and the amount of drama made me hate it so much.
---
Everybody who chooses to be a guild leader and takes it seriously deserves respect. If my guild, without fighting for loot, disbanded after a month because I couldn't connect to the game, a hardcore raider guild in vanilla seems like a nightmare to make 70% of the guild happy.
---
I've heard some complaints about warlock. Mostly that they are threat capped in raids since they dont have any way to reduce threat and that they require good gear to get their dps really going.
---
On the bright side they bring a whole bunch of fun utility to the game and will be welcomed in most groups and raids. Even if just for summons and health stones.
---
That's why no one lets paladins tank.
---
F
---
I never aim to "play" with friends unless you are both putting in the same playtime.  More often than not, one person doesn't play as much and the other person is either stuck waiting around and not playing, or outleveling the first person which means you can't play together.  
---
If you really want to play together, then the person that wants to play more should make an alt and use that to level with the slower friend.  Then just play your main when he's offline.
---
Plus it gets around my own filters. 200iq play
---
They said they will consider it sometime after launch if there is enough people still asking for it. 
---
For launch it's already been confirmed that it isn't happening. Ion tweeted it. 
---
https://twitter.com/watcherdev/status/1109832561704878081?lang=en
---
Orc has stun resist, that said Warlocks don't struggle to much with Rogues provided gear is roughly equal. Though a good rogue will probably counter you, so stun resist might get more value as a result.
---
Undead has fear break, which is nice vs well every class that can fear. Warriors, Other Locks, Priests. Canabalize is also nice.
---
Its really up to you, I value looks over function. But thats just me.
---
so, ban Discord too?
---
Just like people here would rage if someone did to them the kind of stuff they want to do to streamers.
---
People tend to be hypocritical like that.
---
You have a point there. I wouldn't call that "harder" personally though - it's more of "mandatory". If a mage tries to raid with subpar gear, so long as they can watch their threat you'll be fine overall, you're right that a tank can't really get away with it. 
---
In simple numeric terms of time spent trying to gear though, warriors have a significant advantage (and healers to an extent as well) in that they can tailor their group to specifically be the only one in the group who can use the items they're after. RNG in the item dropping still exists, but if the item drops then they get it. 
---
Druids and paladins can also do this, but they sometimes have a stigma surrounding them because warriors are the "main tanks", despite the fact that either class is more than adequate for tanking 5 mans.
---
Again, if you avoid them all of your problems are solved.
---
World PVP “making the game unplayable” is an oxymoron. Join a PVE server.
---
One of the only people speaking sense in this thread. Cutting edge guilds will be 100+ people working to support the 40 they take in week 1 or early week 2 . MT will be adderralled out and farming dungeons 18 hours a day for FR while the rest get by with major fire pots.

There is no point.

Yeah, the "purists" who think even the most minor QoL changes are bad are a bit ridiculous. No one's ever going to convince me that letting Soul Shards stack to 5 or 10 in your bags, or having the repair cost cap at 25g instead of 50g so people could actually respec more often to have some fun exploring their class, would materially hurt the Vanilla experience. Like you said, it's about the community and adventure of an open, slower-paced world that you need to invest in to get the most out of.
---
That being said, I understand from Blizzards perspective, the problem becomes "Where do we draw the line for QoL improvements?" So I'm okay with them keeping it as close to original as possible, but I do think that in doing so, they are leaving in a lot of tedious, burdensome nonsense that was changed for good reason.
---
I bought an ounce of coke, that will get me to 60 in one sitting or into a grave

Shaman tank? Anyone? 😂😂😂
---
He's playing a warrior and I won't be surprised if he constantly has 1 or 2 pocket healers running with him so, sadly that makes even the most average warrior pretty unstoppable :/

When it was actually beneficial.
---
Tauren rogue for the much needed stun, help with spell interrupts without wasting precious energy.
---
Gnome druid escape artist racial really helpful.
---
As to warlock, troll is the best for the sweet in combat HP Regen so you can mana tap for unlimited mana.
---
That's a long post for something very compact.
---
- it's absolutely necessary for launch
---
- it won't be in phase 2
---
- only potential issue is having 6+ hour queues after layering is removed
---
That's about it :)
---
I will only watch Madseasonshow when I'm not able to play, I never watch streamers playing games when I game so I agree with you.
---
Server reputation mattered a lot more on classic wow. In runescape if you scam you can just world hop and get away and no one will care, if you get scammed that's your own fault. In wow if you scam you'll be blacklisted and no one will come to you for enchanting/jc anymore

Being grand marshal, and see a horde coming in valuing more honor just by entering storm wind....

A good day to be alive.

Okay... OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE PLAY THE THINGS THEY WANT FOR FUN... Come on, use your head here...
---
What's NOT fun? being in a dungeon or raid with a paladin tank that can't hold threat because he's a paladin tank.
---
Taking the week of release off
---
IDK why you are getting butt hurt over this - it's pretty simple to understand that PCs will eventually be an outmoded technology. Do people still ride horses? Sure. Do people still make horse shoes? Sure, but nowadays they don't make as many of them as car tires.
---
And tiring.. I remember having to drink up after.... now I stay at 99% no matter how many buffs.
---
Then you pull an Apex Legends and die. The only thing that keeps the numbers high is constant new content, a.k.a. The Fortnite model.
---
Right there with you
---
If I had to guess, you weren't denied because you didn't have enough raid experience, but other factors...
---
What about using Lay on Hands or Shield Wall? Dunno where people draw the line with dueling
---
its more at the lvl 60 stage that we will be playing together
---
I just really want an option for a classic server that doesnt allow addons. That way both parties get what they want and like minded people get to play together. Id be set forever.
---
I love pvp but i dont want to have to download addons that trivialize certain mechanics such as audio / visual cues and memory skill to be on the level playing field.
---
In the case of the rank 14 weapons, they will have a roll group that runs BG’s all day and they are able to decide who has the most honor for the week, good luck beating their chosen #1 as a solo player.
---
This happened in Vanilla on a lot of servers, safe to assume the streamers will be doing the same, and after they rank, the roll group continues with their fanbois.
---
You are right, but the launch numbers will give a pretty solid idea of how many players will be left 6 months later.
---
I mean, I have seen people saying that like 90% of the players will quit Classic in the first 6 months....and I have no idea what are they basing their numbers on.
---
There will be plenty that will quit...but 90%? 
---
That is unrealistic, because we can absolutely count on 1 million players for Classic long term...which will mean that there will be 9 million tourists, if the dropout rate is 90%.
---
At some point, private servers had totaled 1.3 million players...and we know that millions more simply did not wanted to play on private servers, for obvious reasons.
---
I don't know man, but I expect Classic population will be between 2 and 3 millions, 6 months into the game, and I don't see more than 2 million tourists at launch.
---
Either Classic will have 2 million people at launch, with 90% leaving, and only 200k remaining 6 months later (which is absolutely unrealistic), either Classic will have 4-5 million at launch, with 40-50% of them remaining 6 months later (quite realistic), either there will be 10 millions at launch, with 90% leaving, and 1 million remaining 6 months later (unrealistic scenario).
---
BfA and WoD were absolute dogshit, devs didn't cared about alpha and beta feedback. The dropout was massive, and for the right reasons. We didn't knew how those expansions will fare in time, when they not live yet.
---
With Classic, we KNOW everything. We know what to expect. Classic devs are communicating a lot. They backed off on loot trading, on phase release plan, on sharding. It's a whole different situation.

I don't know how many people will be at Classic launch...but I know that the dropout will be far less than anyone expects, because we know WHAT game we are going to play. It's not like we are being presented a nice cinematic, featuring a massive Horde vs Alliance battle, spend our money to buy the expansion...and being delivered a turd.
---
I think it's fair to assume a maximum of 50-60% dropout after launch...and based on launch numbers, which will be announced, we can estimate the long term player base for Classic.
---
We won't need to wait 6 months, unless we wanna know the EXACT numbers. Based on release numbers, and a dropout rate of 50-60%, we can estimate the numbers 6 months down the road, within small margins.
---
Thought it cost 1g?   I haven't made a guild in many years

You’re the one applying to classic guilds lol.

love it mate, really do, thank you.

I'm running on a TN panel and the banding from the blur is a bit jarring. Would it be possible to make it a smoother glow?

In wow Blizzard bans people who scam items and gold. In runescape the scammers make billions of gold doing it and never fear ban.

raid gear or pre-raid gear?

Everyone had to link updated ct profiles with talents and gear for pugs. It would actually be very vanilla.
---
It's faster if you guys are on the same schedule and have a good knowledge of the quests so there is absolutely no doubling back.

I've been tempted to look for someone to level with but I think solo will be the way to go for me on my first character :)

From the top 10 rankings you know exactly two things about WoW.
---
1. You know WoW made less than 100 million in March (it is ranked below Apex in March)
---
2. You know WoW made less than CSGO in April (WoW isn't in the rankings)
---
Its entirely possible WoW made 90 million in March and then made 90 million in April but fell out of the rankings because CSGO had a good month. Hell mathematically its possible WoW made 90 million in March and 100 million in April but still fell out of the rankings if CSGO's revenue grew even more.
---
You can't say anything about WoWs revenue in relation to Apex's in April. You don't know whether Apex made more or less than WoW in April. A game with a 15 year history is going to have a different revenue graph from a game that went viral for a month and then fell off the face of the Earth.

I like making fun of BFA as much as the next person, but this post is just idiotic.

&gt; The argument for guaranteed raid spots for any class over class individuality was a solid blow to game flavour and in my opinion really watered down the value of the individual in favour of the masses. 
---
Bring the player, not the class.  I think that was Ghostcrawler era.

I'd really like to have one of the three staves that share a pretty similar model (just recolored).  Soulkeeper, Staff of Hale Magefire, and one other that im forgetting the name of now.

The dude that proposed the blacklist was sodapoppin right?
---
If he stops streaming for a week and comes back, he would have a viewercount higher than average. That's how it works when the top of the top at twitch go away for a little while.
---
This shit happens all the time, you must not know a lot about twitch.
---
Trading ninja and KOS lists is hardly comparable to this. I dont care if the enemy faction has me on a ninja list from my faction, I'll never run an instance with any of them. Potentially, the list makes it hard to use the cross-faction AH. KOS list is similarly mediocre in affecting your gameplay, as people dont really have any way to punish you on a PvP server, being unable to switch factions.
---
Soda, with this blacklist, would coordinate with the streamers on the Alliance, to keep this person from doing any content just because he thinks he is streamsniping. Sure, the player in question may be a griefer, but this level of cross-faction collusion, where they coordinate to exile a certain set of players from the server that they themselves deem unworthy or unfit to play with them, is an incredibly toxic way to handle the situation, especially considering that this is basically game-death for the player, which is something I think should be decided by the company running the game, not the "asshole" that "camps a level 15 player" for a couple of hours off stream.
---
Holding aggro in dungeons isnt that much of an issue

Lay off the CAPS and you WONT come off as such an ASS

Wow, that is quite the achievement, i started playing a month after some of my real life friends, they were all over at my house for a party and I was just about to hit 60, farming demons in blasted lands iirc, I get to the mob that will push me over the edge (both to 60 and losing my sanity) I turn my chair around to my friend, tell him I’m done with this shit and let him kill the mob.
---
good
---
Honestly, I think you might have a serious issue that you need to get addressed.  Talking to a therapist may help.  I don't like to diagnose over the internet, but I do hope that you seek out some professional help and improve.  I wish you the best. 
---
You didn't hurt my feelings in the slightest, don't worry.  I was trying to help you improve your arguing skills.  Attacking someone personally makes you seem weak in a debate. 
---
Also:  It's you're, not your.  You're is the contraction of "you are" and your is possessive.  Just for future reference.
---
Shouldn't gnomes be able to do it too then?
---
Is that the icon for the epic 2 hander "destiny" on the right ? I remember my friends had to pitch in and help me buy that off the Auction House on my paladin back in the day.
---
People are already applying?!?! for classic guilds? This just sounds ridiculous. Only thing I would be interested in pre-launch is trying to connect with old guildmates, other than that, get classic, pick a pvp server, play and meet people.
---
Eyes of the beast is also super fun. D:
---
Okay this is more along the lines of what I was thinking, Furor is so nice for that extra bit of rage/energy in powershifting, but I'm thinking it will have to be more of a late game spec once I hit 60.
---
Why wouldnt I? I want to play with people who will be our playing hardcore like myself and clear MC in 2-4 weeks. I limit my options if I choose a server then looo for a guild.
---
&gt; You don't enjoy Classic watching a stream on the side man
---
Eh... I'll probably have something going on the side.  Might not be a stream (probably will be Hulu or Netflix), but there are times when you're out there having to kill 196 hoofless zevras to find the four that do have at least one hoof, and that gets dull.
---
For me, especially, that's problematic, because if I'm not focusing enough of my attention on something (including multiple somethings), my brain gets... weird.  Granted, I'm an outlier, not the norm.
---
I think the bigger issue will be access to a second monitor, because you're not going to play a game in a small window so you can watch something else.  A lot of people don't have two monitors, so won't be able to do the game and something else at the same time.
---
This is far too vague to actually help: 
---
What are the issues? Give us examples of the toxicity and negativity. If you'd rather not, due to Rule 3, please send it in a modmail. 
---
What do you want us to do about it? Do you feel we're not enforcing rules appropriately, do you feel we're too lenient with bans, or too strict with bans? 
---
Genuinely, I've no idea what you're talking about. We're constantly banning people for Rule 2, regarding hate and gatekeeping. Please report comments you feel break those rules, and report them *properly*; a lot of reports do not list an appropriate rule, and thus get chucked out the window. Use the other option if you feel it needs expanding on, or better yet, send us a modmail. 
---
We're very happy to discuss the state of the subreddit, and we won't get upset if you call us out on how we're doing the job, but we do need constructive feedback, and this just isn't it. I don't mean to attack you, but there are issues we're looking to address, but this isn't helping us to either highlight or address any issues.
---
ITT: people who don’t realize everyone loved group finder when it came out. If there’s an addon that connects me easily with anyone on my server who wants to run a specific dungeon, I’m using it. And guess what, it won’t change a damn thing.
---
&gt; I have spent quite a lot of time lately dueling on one instant 60 pserver. In my humble opinion Retris are weak. 
---
And just like that you lost all credibility 
---
This discussion is meaningless with someone as little info as yourself sorry =(
---
Can easily purge their world buffs off though.
---
You don't have the full 51 talent points until 60, but to use a talent framework as a skeleton to base choices off of is very nice. And one you start to get to the 45-50 range it helps to be a bit more min/max'd
---
I have a friend who has only ever hit max level on his main by discovering. He has a folder with screenshots of him hitting 60, 70 etc. Pretty cool in my opinion.
---
Correct, but since I didn't know who he was I was indifferent to the word "Asmon" or anything of the sort.
---
Not everyone is a stream/forum lurker. Why is it hard to grasp that some people don't know who he is.
---
I didn't even know what Discord was until about a week ago as I've used Ventrilo pretty much the past two decades of gaming.

---
Based on your past raiding experience I doubt that.
---
There was a massive overhaul of what add-ons could do towards the end of vanilla that totally broke raiding. Like one button decursive with priority lists, healbot that healed the lowest raid member with the most appropriate spell and rank to minimize over-healing.
---
Add-ons in vanilla were broken, and could do much more than now, I'm glad it won't be the same.
---
&gt; You can only reserve the name on THREE realms. That is it.
---
Wait, what? There will be only three realms available to register on August 13th? So far I've only heard that you can create up to three characters.
---
yes but mage and warlock you juste spam one long Spell,  just AA and sometimes aim shot/ms. warrior is pretty slow too. At least with rogue when you are full energy you can do like 3 quick SS, your auto attacks are faster so you need faster reaction time to boss movement etc... But yeah vanilla is pretty slow paced.
---
I suppose I didn't mean ignore completely, but I didn't specify that so that's on me. You're very  right that fire mages will use low rank frost abilities for the slows and freezes. 
---
But frost mages won't as often use fire spells because they don't have the same utility and their frost spells will be getting all the bonus crit and damage (depending on gear) so ideally they'd only be using fire spells for instant cast quick damage to finish someone off. 
---
What about moonkin spec? Do they jump into cat form a lot? The point was it's not absurd for a spec to make certain abilities not worthwhile in large chunks. 
---
I don't have anything against using cat abilities here and there for utility, what I'm trying to gauge is how important is it to the overall playstyle. If I'm spending 3/5ths of my time in cat I probably don't want to be a druid at all. If it's viable to just shape in for a quick bleed and back out that's not a big deal.
---
How come?

---
&gt; a custom made DKP addon.
---
What part of that did you miss?
---
Seeing the old area notifications take me back. So excited for classic and Westfall (favorite leveling zone for some reason).
---
Nah, that is why. Just pretty silly that hardcore for Classic I guess means you have to be a current Mythic raider, despite the fact ive done the Vanilla raids too..
---
Our guild’s MT is going to be a paladin, as a honourable  position to a guy who farmed almost 50% or our guild’s raid consumables back in vanilla WoW. Thunder fury is his.
---
With a raid that knows what is doing (+being supportive) it’s going to be a nice ride. + paladin tanks do not take critical tanking set items, since those can only be equipped by warriors. 
---
-30% reduce threat, Blessing of Protection to the guy who took agro and an adequate knowledge of how to play a paladin tank(eg.:most paladins do not use lower skill ranks to preserve mana and they don’t use the correct set of class skills/items/consumables) will do wonders for 5men with random players.
---
Last I heard was that they'd release detailed server information (i.e. a list of realm names and types) closer to release. Pretty sure that hasn't happened yet, so we gotta keep waiting (:
---
no he got into trouble in /r/hearthstone at one point for viewbotting a couple years back. people were spamming robots in his chat and he was banning them. pretty sure it was him anyway
---
Are the streamers planning on playing on the same server? I hope they do. Let all the fanboys play on their server and leave a server that’s devoid of the stuff that comes with streamer shenanigans.
---
It just sucks that all the big budget titles with gorgeous new graphics are garbage mtxfests now. Graphics aren't everything ofc, but they are something.
---
Just need to accept that streamers with thousands of followers matter more than people who don't.
---
Basically every single number you said needs a 'citation needed' after it. Yes, there were people who didn't want to play on private servers for whatever reason, but there were also people who don't want to play on official servers for whatever reason. Why can we 'absolutely count on 1 million players for Classic long term'? 
---
Not to mention, at no point did I say that 90% of the launch playerbase would leave. All I said was that people would join for the launch and quit soon after. This is how WoW has always worked.
---
Not everyone has played on private servers. They don't know what game they're going in to. They're going in based on their recollections of 15 years ago or other people's opinions. A lot of people are going to be disappointed that classic cannot match 15 years of nostalgia.
---
Not a goddamn bit. Mind your own business
---
KEEP telling OTHER people HOW to TYPE and YOU wont COME off AS such AN ass!
---
Gtfo of here with that shit lol.
---
Did you ever think that maybe I wanted to sound like a bit of an ass? Stop gate keeping my attitude, thanks.
---
Pretty sure it's just world bosses. Teremus is not a world boss.
---
Yes, because otherwise you're paying for a sever transfee potentially and or faction transfer. And you do professions differently if you are with a guild from the start or if you are solo till 60. Big difference when a guild has a dedicated tailor, bs, etc. May be picking a redunudant profession.

Nice find. Hopefully it gets the attention it needs.

And that's when I know you've thrown in the towel. Your only arguments have been,
---
1: I'm being mean
---
2: Your just not sympathetic 
---
3: the classic you're and your
---
You have not made a single counter argument and now I need therapy apparently. This hasn't even been a debate it's been me presenting arguments and you getting offended and ignoring them. I'm on my phone I'm not going to both with you're and your, you know what I am saying dont be pretentious. 
---
Have a good one man have an original thought once in a while maybe it will help you out with your debate  skills.
---
I just hit lvl 30 in the beta, and from my perspective, it's 100% worth it.  
---
In 2004, server queues were hours long, the game crashed constantly, most players had to look at the ground while raiding, and people had no idea what they were doing.  
---
In 2019, the gameplay is identical, but the game is butter smooth (144 fps), never crashes, and everyone's familiarity with WoW basics means that your groups and parties are more competent and relaxed.
---
These pre-Launch new guilds are not real anyway. People will lose interest and bounce. The first raids will be killed by a mish-mash of whoever is 60 first and ready to zone in.
---
Twitch has rules that prevent harassment of other streamers that are pretty vague. I feel repeatedly killing a streamer would fall under this category. They have already banned one hunter for it and have banned people in the past for way less. Twitch is pretty loose with their ban hammer, unless you're sending Hassan those feet pics.
---
Hi, /u/mikekochlol
---
I wouldn't want any of them nerfed, just pointing out a couple other items that people found legitimate use for at 60 that were possible not exactly as planned.
---
Grammar of the last frame.
---
The spell-clicking-keyboard-turning players that were probably 12 years old and didn't even know about threat?
---
Who cares about risking those subs - they’re dwindling with their current model anyway. If they keep going the way they’re going, they will lose those subs anyway. 
---
The real question is how many subs are they going to lose before they admit their philosophies are wrong and catering to everyone kills your game.
---
It was a hot Summer day in 2006, and I watched Pat's 1st PvP video. It was decided on that day that I wanted to be just like Pat, so I rolled a Tauren Woyer and never looked back. Been a woyer main ever since, and will continue to do so.
---
Animations? Female UD only have one casting animation (male has two - one for healing abilities and one for offensive abilities), which is why I’ll be playing male.
---
&gt; you are talking as if "worshipping" and "hating" should be put in the same category. 
---
They should be, and are.
---
&gt; actively hating (which is different than not liking it) is just stupid 
---
I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by "hate." 99.9999% of people out there that "hate" streamers just decide not to watch them and dislike having to hear about them all the time.
---
In this context, people "hating" streamers (as long as they dont go crazy and stalk them) is the same as worshiping them (as long as they dont go crazy and stalk them). They're different sides of the exact same coin. One side is donating money/subs, giving items, etc, to participate with and be noticed by the streamer and their audience. The other side is at best ignoring them and, at worst, they're disrupting/griefing the streamer to get noticed by the streamer and the streamer's audience. Same exact coin. 
---
&gt; there is people worshiping athletes/movie stars/religion since forever. it doesn't hurt anyone.
---
And people have been shitting on those exact same things for just as long, with equally few hurt. Additionally, there definitely are arguments that celebrity worship has a lot of negative effects on our society/culture/individuals, but that's a bit outside the scope of this post.
---
&gt;  it doesn't hurt if you are not part of this group. 
---
I agree, with exception of occasional extreme cases (e.g. where people spend money they can't really afford, etc.). And, again, people talking shit or be annoyed by these people doesn't hurt you if you are part of the group either.
---
That's all beside my original point though. My original point was that BOTH sides take this shit waaay too seriously, and that it's ridiculous. Enjoy your own life and don't get involved in other people's drama.
---
&gt; Mind your own business

Legolas was my favorite lord of the ring character.  Dwarf hunter.
---
One thing that will probably help is that you will start to see the same people on your server and people will get reputations, either as being fun to play with or a-holes.  
---
It takes a long time to level, and people can’t pop in and out of groups anonymously like LFG/LFR. It sort of forces a bit more of a community.  
---
I do doubt it will ever be as social as it once was, life has just changed. This of 15 years prior to vanilla, people were playing mega man 3, no one had a cell phone and the internet wasn’t really even a thing. 15 years is a long time
---
My brother was playing Shaman and Warrior, I enjoyed watching him heal and such as a shaman so I just rolled one.
---
any chance it was something to do with attitude / the way you filled out the app and not your raiding experience?

Thats really cool man
---
Pft, I'm using addons.  People used addons back then, why shouldn't I use one now?  Likely minor stuff, though.  I've tried a lot of addons over the years and they just make the UI confusing and cluttered.  (Probably because I'm too used to how it is.)

Only got to play vanilla for a bit before TBC came out, and never rolled a Warlock. Why is shadow resist gear good?
---
But this is exactly what he wouldn't do.
---
He doesn't care if he gets killed by someone in a organic world pvp situation. He cares if he is getting chased by people who are solely out to disrupt what he is doing by watching his stream and "trolling" him.
---
You are allowed to kill Sodapoppin, just don't make it excessive by preventing him from doing anything for hours. That's the thing that he is talking about.
---
That's an old tweet. See tipsout's interview with the devs.
---
Warlocks have such low HP early on in release that they'll be lucky to get a single fear off past gouge / kick, WotF is for the one fear that a warlock *should* ever land, the one that follows a death coil.
---
There will be a subset that do care and will do that. To act like there won’t is being just as delusional as acting like all 50k people watching will be following the streamer around.
---
Not a chance for me. PvP server, horde, and not looking back.
---
Helllllll no.
---
Because they have data that shows them there is not enough players to sustain it and server merges are shitty for everyone involved.
---
Unpopular opinion: I would love to have achievements in classic. It doesn't affect gameplay at all and is really cool to say oh yea I did that with Joco back in the day.
---
You succeeded.
---
Why do people hate streamers? I love them. They are cool dudes.

Mages could turn things into sheep.

That is all I needed to see at the time.

---
&gt;Stop gate keeping my attitude, thanks.
---
&gt;What is the POINT of rolling Paladin Tank?
---
It runs at 120 FPS on a Macbook Pro.  
---
For many professional adults, that's the standard we use to measure playability.
---
What makes you think there’s going to be server transfers to any realm you want. And faction transfers just aren’t gonna happen, if I had to guess you were denied because you know nothing about classic
---
Thats like your opinion man
---
Please go on about how a streamer being on your server will ruin your experience... By all means please do explain... Cause honestly this is one of the dumbest topics iv seen people complain and bitch about. As if some streamer or the people around him is gonna ruin your fucking experience.
---
What? Levels are already gated: its call real-world commitments.
---
How about no
---
I thought classic was starting in 1.12?
---
There was no level gate in vanilla release, so no.
---
what if they enjoy being told what to do?
---
Why would it be different? It's literally the same game minus the new graphics engine.

Original wow trailer opening led to my first dwarf hunter. Took me over 1 day /played to get to lvl 30ish until I realised that's the wrong class. Switched to dwarf paladin and leveled him to 60. Sadly I can't remember why paladin
---
Witcher 3 was amazing and had great graphics. Subnautica was amazing and had great graphics. Monster Hunter world looked amazing. Neir Autonma, Civ 6, Dishonered 2, Metal Gear 5... the list goes on. Idk what to tell you.
---
But how will Soda know if some at level 30 kills him, then later in new zone at 40, same guy cross his path kills him, and later at 60, maybe this guy is farming a spot. Soda tries to take it over and he kills him.
---
How can soda know if he is streamsniping or just playing the game and soda is the going to his locations over and over again.
---
 5/5 furor (from resto), 11 pts in feral for feral charge, 1 pt nature’s grasp (balance) is IMO just baseline. If you don’t have those you are a potato. 
---
From there there’s a ton of specs you can go. But a pretty safe bet at 60 is to put the remaining points in resto to be a strong raid healer.
---
Just play on a PvE server and you will never have to deal with them

Ahh, Mortal Strike and Cool Down :)

You’re basing everything you know off of private servers which have been proven so many times to be incorrect by wide margins especially the one you’re referring to.  Which is retro.  Your opinions are about private servers not classic.

Tauren Hunter. Not really sure why. Tauren just looked really neat, and anatomically wonky. Their starting area was just delightful too. Went with Hunter mostly because Gun. It was such a simple time then.
---
One is a statement.
---
One is a question.
---
Two different things. Good try though. I never said "Don't roll a paladin tank." I ASKED "WHAT IS THE POINT of rolling a paladin tank?"
---
Literally two different things.
---
Druid is probably the worst class as an overall. They are the worst healer, even if having a healer is better than having no healer. They are bad DPS or at least well below average (yes even with manual crowd pummelers they will be behind).  They are an OK tank for 5 mans, but most Raids won't let them be that role. They are not good for most battle grounds, with the exception of Warsong, where they are the best flag carrier, if they are healer/tank hybrid specced. 
---
I would agree that all classes are playable, but you can probably make a general ranking of best and worst classes overall based on performance across multiple situations.
---
never heard of that

I played Night Elves in Warcraft 3 so it only felt natural to make a Night Elf. Druids turning into animals always seemed cool and the intro cinematic also made them look pretty neat.
---
Ahahahahah this is exactly it.
---
Or you could just play any realm, not even think about streamers and just play... People think its an issue... its really fucking not. its only a problem if you think its a problem and worry about it... Thats the biggest problem you'll encounter is worrying that theres an issue.
---
I liked swords and elves. NE warrior
---
True lol.
---
Basically just level as feral
---
Hmm
---
probably ret pally since there isn't a lot of gear designed for them
---
I feel disgusting writing a TL;DR for this beast of an essay but here you go
---
Raid. I imagine pre raid is just dungeon farming.
---
Appreciated! That would be awesome haha.
---
It's going to be 1.12
---
I stated my argument clearly many times, counter-pointed to yours.  
---
All of your points are emotionally derivative.  I say that you should refrain from making personal attacks because it weakens your position - and you say that I am just calling you out for being mean.  See how that is reductive?
---
You did get one thing right:  I am not sympathetic to the plight of a streamer who chooses to play on a pvp server and then has to deal with the consequences of it.  
---
See how emotionally wrapped up and tangled you are in this?  I genuinely think you may benefit from seeking out a professional to talk to.  I hope you do.  I want the best for you.
---
I leveled a paladin doing the AoE thing in BC (I think Reckoning had been changed to chance on being hit and not being crit) and I remember making really nice progress on Dustwallow Murlocs (not many other spots I remember, though).
---
Omg i remember titan panel lol
---
Replace that with the countdown to the 13th and
---
it me
---
I wish they kept cast bars and focus frame.
---
Not on Ultra settings it doesn’t.
---
There *are* professional reasons to want a MBP if you’re a developer.
---
Gaming isn’t one of them.
---
NON STOP DEADLY ACTION ZULUL
---
i watched the wow trailer and saw the night elf turn into the kitty and saw the big moose sprinkle dust, and when i learned my moose could turn into a kitty, i was in heaven
---
&gt;CRZ is the biggest thing wrong with live today
---
I agree. It's far worse than sharding for an MMO, and sharding should never be mentioned in the same sentence as an MMO to begin with.
---
I don't think they can put the philosophies of vanilla into retail though. It's too far gone. There's simply too many aspects of retail systems that are in complete conflict with vanilla design.
---
New meta. You can adapt.
---
I thought they said Hoot!
---
People who blast to 60 within the first 2 weeks have the right to do so. The original classic experience was all about that journey to 60,but that’s still their choice if they choose to ignore that. Things will be different this time around because we’ll end up seeing 15 Man MC and shit that was thought to be impossible back in the day. The new meta will simply be less people in an instance/raid at 60. The Cathedral clear at 30 was insane and we’ll see plenty more of that this time around for those 5 headed vanilla brain beasts who want to push difficulty and personal achievement.
---
You find me taking my sweet ass time priesting it up. THICCHEALZ out.
---
Aaaaaaand downvote for disagreeing with how I downvote.
---
Joking of course, but everyone else isn't.
---
It's not the class to choose.
---
For once, you'll be not using stealth, this is a great loss.
---
Yup. Finishing moves give no refunds on misses, combo point builders give 90% IIRC.
---
What an ugly thing to say
---
We did that for years, and it was a nightmare.  keeping two to four sets or armor for RP will eat all of your bank space, which was already fairly limited.  With no storage for toys and mounts, people are going to realize how important storage improvements are.
---
Now, as Blizzard has committed to No (minimal) changes, I don't' see these features coming to classic, but they did serve to open up storage for players and make RP much more fulfilling.
---
True. Although since that mod has been around since vanilla, it remains to be seen as to whether they're all talk or if they'll actually go through with it.
---
game minus the new graphic engine plus people's skill and general knowledge
---
Wow you are so right. I didn’t consider this; the offensive vs the defensive. I do however, hate dying. So maybe the Druid is more right for me. So torn! Hehe. What are you going for and why?
---
I stuck the NSFW tag on it mostly because I spent a long while making that stupid icon and I want to see it put to use.
---
Landscape design courtesy of Hammond Druthers.
---
They said you aren't good enough, get over it.  Dwelling is unhealthy.
---
Heres hoping. Would sure love mutes to go out for toxic chat.
---
Yes, 15 years of getting older and understanding the game more wont make any difference at all.
---
Well I would roll a paladin tank to tank 5 mans solo. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to roll a paladin would assume they would be MT’ing in any later raid tier.
---
Ok snowflake
---
So you're kind of like the WPL welcome bear.
---
Old? That is from May this year. 
---
Omar is an Engineer and has no say on the type of decisions like what realms will launch. Ion has already given you the answer you are looking for.
---
&gt; What about moonkin spec? Do they jump into cat form a lot? The point was it's not absurd for a spec to make certain abilities not worthwhile in large chunks.
---
They do. So they can pounce stun. If you can reset the fight it's really great to go cat form and re-stealth.
---
Since us mortal race banded together..
---
Yeah, elsewhere
---
something like that yep

---
Correct, if that is the case with the ganks then that it's all good fun. I think stuff over the top and repeatedly is the "stream sniping" that should be resolved in some way. PvE seems like a lame solution but it would work 100%.
---
Legion only worked because the systems were new, people were desperate for anything after WoD, and they cashed in 15 years of buildup by giving people Ashbringer, letting terrible players fight KJ in raid finder, bringing back Illidan, bringing back Karazhan, on and on. They pulled out everything they had to pull people back after WoD. And then 
---
That was a one-time use effect. They cashed in all their remaining good will and all the “coolness” left in the franchise. Now we see the effect of the new systems they brought it, and it’s not WoW. Retail has completely jumped the shark.
---
I would advocate for a hard reboot but I don’t think the WoW team could do it, I don’t think they really understand why Classic is great. I think the philosophy that underpins WoW is seen as archaic by the ideology of modern commercial game design. These guys are artists who think they’re doing science, and their “science” leaves them perplexed when people don’t like their over-designed mess of a game - so Ion has to get on a QA and explain to us that we are the ones who are wrong for not liking it, because the data says we should.
---
Na they are excellent healers, they just require skill and knowledge to play. Very different from the one button spammers like paladins and shamans. They also don't stack very well since their HoTs cancel eachother.
---
Makes it hard for them to communicate with the chat. They just want their cake and be able to eat it too
---
Do you have an actual argument somewhere in there, or is your quiver empty already?
---
Shits on paladins, name is Konsecration. Seems legit!
---
It's that thing that those filthy casuals are always going on about. /s
---
This is completely right, you’ve explained my situation so well
---
I hate these posts. Just play whatever the hell you want. Literally any class will go great leveling a hunter &amp; warrior. The simple act of leveling with multiple people makes it so much easier. Play whichever class you truly want to play because that's the class you're going to be putting hundreds of hours into.
---

Only to fuck with you op.

"What? Fuckin' Konsecration is in our group? Let me get out my tankadin."
---
Not vanilla but shattrath was pronounced 100983938 different ways and im still not sure how tf its pronounced
---
I'm fine with being wrong. I have been wrong many times. But so far no one has made a compelling case that I am wrong that PC games will eventually be less popular than mobile games and therefore fewer of them will be produced. So I really don't think I am wrong.
---
I was a Necromancer in Diablo II.
---
Warlock seemed the obvious choice :D
---
Ahh didnt consider that ofcourse.
---
Glorious victory of the Horde!
---
Darkshore is a very unnatural place for Horde to end up if there isn't an STV push, and it is very easy to stealthily navigate the zone thanks to easily climable jagged hills with dense tree textures to obscure your name.  For that reason I like it quite a bit (speaking Horde-side).
---
You asked him to stop gatekeeping and you're gatekeeping Vanilla tanking.
---
Removing the debuff slot cap would make raid content significantly easier. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but it would require to buff all the (endgame) pve content to accommodate for this.
---
Since there are no separate brackets for xp on/off there will be a pretty healthy twink population doing this themselves.
---
I wanted to be Thrall, but I also really like Cairne.
---
So Tauren shaman.
---
~10-11 days /played is the average time spent leveling from 1 to 60. so 240 to 264 hours
---
What is the POINT of TYPING like THIS?
---
Done and done.
---
OP, this is awesome. What I’ve done for my plan on launch day is have an excel spreadsheet open that has a list from 1-60, that has a column of spells that I can use for quick reference, along with another column for necessary items, professions, etc. It’s my quick reference guide for just the necessary items. I did one for Rogue, and Priest, but I’m leveling Priest so ditching the Rogue guide. Also building a warlock one that my gf will most likely play.
---
Addons existed during Vanilla, so why wouldn't we want QOL Addons?
---
We don't want QOL changes to the base game, because then it wont be the base game.
---
But addons were ALWAYS a thing in Vanilla, soooooo.
---
I have no thoughts on it because it's frankly just stupid lol. The only reason it's a thing now is because it's a BETA where they need gated content(levels) in order to test everything gradually. Gating levels would be horrible outside of testing.
---
More that blizzard started banning people for scanning in WoW. They didn’t at first but the game became too popular for them to not.
---
MMO’s were very niche then and every mmo pre wow had scams out the wazoo. No one got banned for them. Lo and behold 1 million paying people have a lot more power to change the direction of a genre than they’d like to think.
---
Early WoW was riddled with scams much like MMO’s before it. Rarely would blizzard do anything. When sub numbers went through the fucking roof I’m sure they were flooded with more petitions about it than any other mmo had ever though they could get. They had to do something. Then the bans started.

Shits on paladin TANKS...
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Rat face in the house!
---
Anon is an idiot who doesn't realize that streamers can get carried through anything.
---
That's an argument whether you can contend with it or not haha
---
seems like you can't
---
i was thinking of pwnyhof not sodapoppin, both have dumbass names thats probs why i thought it
---
anyway i retract my viewbotting trhing about sodapooper
---
Forsaken are 1/4 of the playable horde races.
---
Priests are 1/8 of the Alliance classes, and Dwarves are 1/3 of the classes that can be a priest.
---
in short, theres a shitload more people running around with WotF vs Fear Ward.
---
Hardest class to gear are protection paladins, feral (dps) druids, shadow priests, and melee huntards.
---
Unless they destroy your server's economy for the luls...
---
What he's saying is that you have an attitude. People want to raid with chill people, not whiny kids.
---
Blizzard didn’t ban for scams at launch. It had nothing to do with server rep.

I think you underestimate how terrible the majority of players are.

Eat a snickers.. Why so negative against people?
---
I can guarantee you that they are going to allow the beta testers/streamers to have an earlier day to claim names.
---
My DDO main was an avoidance fighter/monk/rogue tank. So I went warrior.
---
Don't be so hard on yourself pal.
---
Oh boy. Tell me one thing regarding class mechanics, that is different (besides well known bugs). Plus, everything we discussed here has nothing to do with different raid bosses and dungeon values on private servers either. Plus, private servers are still the closest comparison to classic you could ever get last 15 year. Yes pservers are incorrect in many things, but people somehow thinks, everything is wrong with them now. Thats not really true.
---
About 250 hours.
---
Also 99% of people in beta don't fucking beta test shit. They would be playing and not reporting anything. Streamers are actually running tests, optimizing stats for classes, trying out unique strategies and combos most people didn't use in Vanilla etc. Asmon may be a persona comedian/entertainer and do dumb stuff, but he's usually taking two ret paladins into shit with him. When was the last time you saw that in Vanilla?
---
Ignoring the fact that streamers were obviously invited for hype and not testing purposes, they are actually the ones out there doing most of the testing. People also watch them and make big reddit threads about it so it gets even more visibility than the report function they used for it in-game. 
---
It's fine to dislike streamers, I certainly don't want to play on a server with them either for economic and big posse world PvP reasons, but this sub has purely unwarranted hate boners for them just because streamers got into a beta that they couldn't. The funny part is Streamers make up less than 1k of the hundreds of thousands of people that want a beta. Even if NO streamer was given a beta at all, even the natural selection way, these people still wouldn't get in.
---
Fair one
---
Calling peoples comments ignorant is not an emotionally charged statement nor is it a personal attack. If you cant handle words perhaps stay away from arguments. Another statement I made was that people making these comments are being idiotic, that's just a fact. Apologies again if that word is offensive to you. And I think I also said that you cant or were unwilling to understand me. Maybe that was rude as well, but you clearly can't. 
---
Oh the other hand making backhanded remarks about my intelligence and mental health have the same effect as what ive done. Just because you wrap up your insults in a prettier package doesnt mean it doesnt have the same effect. 
---
The difference between the two of us is that I placed priority on my arguments instead of how i word them. You have forgone any semblance of an argument just to sound smart and as if you've taken the high road. I honestly do hope you reread your comments just so you can see what I'm saying. Talking down to somebody during an argument just makes you sound like an ass. But I know you wont you feel validated and seeing as how you've moved on to personal insults to me there isnt much more to gain from this conversation.
---
Will it make your progress slower? Absolutely. You're going to get ganked, and you better be ready to counter gank. If this bothers you then roll on a PVE server.
---
Yeah four months ago. Back when we were still wondering how content phases were going to shake out.
---
The beta has shown that classic is more popular than expected. Those lean realmlists are going to have to expand.
---
"massive lag" 60-120 ping. Did it all the time. Also did it on PS although I wouldn't know if those 2 are comparable. The tolerances are clearly wrong.
---
[Call to Arms](https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-addons/call-to-arms-lfg/) was released by the time ZG came out in vanilla WoW. Why was that allowed back then but a new LFG addon released today isn't okay?
---
Personally speaking, while I wouldn't want any changes forced onto anyone I would like to use an addon that would emulate the Party Finder system in retail where it would list groups recruiting for content without the benefit of warping the entire party to the location.
---
Can't reach the books.
---
But what exactly are you afraid of?
---
This is a joke right
---
And I'm sure if we asked the guild they'd have the same answer...
---
This is truly epic
---
Then go play retail. You obviously like harmonious classes.
---
Not a bad idea tbh. Scrap modern WoW to focus on legacy servers while developing a fresh set of characters for people to fall in love with in Warcraft 4 (and eventually meet/kill in WoW 2). Warcraft Reforged will rebuild hype for a next-gen Warcraft RTS too.
---
Looks great. I was actually really worried a hunter shot timer wouldn't get made. So glad you made this.
---
By the way, I've been using your code to learn how to write addons. Thanks!
---
You mistake someone else's opinion, which differs from your own, as negativity.
---
It shouldn’t hurt. I love being a tank but I’m rolling healer because all my dedicated tank heals were shit last time. 
---
Play for fun. Thats the true Classic experience
---
I play on a TBC private server. Every so often I say to myself, "I should join the world chat again. You're essentially playing a social game entirely solo. Let's get some community going here!"
---
10 minutes of homophobia, misogyny and racism later I am quitting the world chat asking myself, "why did I think it would be any different this time?"
---
Friend of mine calls it a guild tuh-Bard.
---
After a decade and a half, there's no fixing it. Lol
---
As someone who has played on low population realms, I say it's a bad idea to play on a realm whose fate is defined by a single player.
---
Da fuq
---
Tanking Raz
---
My hope is that private servers, being free, are more prone to attract these cookie cutter toxic kids (picture bots spewing racist and red pill shit).  But they are unfortunately everyone on the internet now and aside from being annoying it’s also boring.  Same crappy toxic stuff.  Let’s hope the monthly fee and actual possibility of getting banned for crossing the line cuts this down a lot.
---
Yeah as a Druid you’re extremely hard to kill and in 1v1 with no interruptions you will usually win through sheer endurance because you can go in and out for basically as long as you want. I’m going hunter because I know the class the best and I love hard countering rogues and soft countering mages. Also hunters are extremely skill expressive and tier sets are actually good for them, so they are always looking really cool in full tier set gear.
---
It's the nerd version of Justin Berber. They hate him, but all they can do is talk about how much they hate him when it's as simple as stop listening to his shitty music if you don't like him. Yet, here we are....
---
 I played WoW from release day to cata launch. I am a pvp veteran tempered in the darkest depths of the 9 ganking hells, and so long as I draw breath and have 15 dollars to spend a month, these hallowed grounds shall run red with the blood of fuckboi streamers.
---
 Streamers are the worst thing to ever happen to video games, and I intend to make them pay for it in any petty way I can. 
---
Lok'tar Ogar mother fuckers.

They would but it’s fairly easy to develop code that bypasses any restrictions

---
Who the hell wants this?
---
I don't have the cash to blow on a setup like in lower left of pic, but I'm thinking about digging out my old CRT monitor and using it as a second screen.
---
&gt;They said they will keep classic up as long as WoW is up. So they ditch WoW, bye bye classic.
---
They'd never ditch Classic if it had more players than Retail.
---
Maybe thats why everyone calls it Shat.
---
I like to call it Shit-wrath in my head.
---
Pallys can dungeon tank well
---
I mean, I was willing to. I feel like parses show your quality of play and Herooc Tomb when it was fresh was not the easiest. Parsing orange shows you were elite your class/spec in that raid setting
---
I think at the end of the day I'd prefer to be on a server without streamers, but I will say I find the people complaining about streamers to be way more annoying than the streamers could ever be.
---
For general release, no. Might be an interesting side experiment Blizz could do.
---
What lurks on Channel X?...
---
PAT, PAT DOES! \o/
---
Thank you for that, so many people with an over inflated sense of self.
---
this is so true. my mate has just gone and bought a new pc just to play wow classic
---
Pretty much my experience but, my hope is retail won't let that level of inceldom.
---
Ah yes, the good old “4 people said yes, which means 25% of the playerbase supports my dumb idea”.
---
lol. soda will be horde though
---
March 24 &gt; June 7 = 4 months?
---
The tweet ~2 1/2 months old. Does the director of the game need to clarify this issue monthly or something? 
---
If they come out and announce they have changed their mind, then great, but pretending there is a bunch of people in limbo is just false. The game director stated already it isn't going to happen. There is no reason not to work on that assumption.
---
Times change, so must you...
---
You can't just expect things to never change socially.
---
You're definitely right about the data visualization completely forget to do that, I'll add some in a bit
---
Servers aren't going public until 27 AUG, so there are no examples of what it will be like on a live public server. There is the threat of blacklisting players for daring to kill streamers in world pvp which kicked off this drama as an example of what might happen. And yes, false flags do happen like the drama with PubG and random players being banned because a streamer claimed they "stream sniped". 
---
Maybe I was being a little harsh above. My concern is less the streamers themselves as much as the cult of personality and legions of fans that will log in just to follow their favorite internet celebrity around. 
---
These guys are millionaires, yet people with modest income still throw cash at them regularly just for an icon and dopamine hit. If they're willing to do that, they're willing to intervene in PVP and donate gold/resources/etc. Which fucks up the AQ event and World PVP. 
---
Plus a lot of the fanbase of these streamers are just straight up annoying. 
---
This is really only an issue with the top 10% streamers, for what it's worth. The sub is overreacting a bit too. 
---
I don't have an easy "fix"(avoid streamer servers I guess) but my point is there's plenty of reason to not like big streamers besides just "You're jealous". I'm not jealous (seriously, good for them for making it big), I just don't want my experience getting fucked up by them and their legion of fans.
---
That might be a good idea. We can find what the problem is
---
I saw big blue dress by cranius. I played a mage and wore a big blue dress.
---
Now I play shaman. I wear a dress but it jingles when I walk now.
---
Nope! Its strictly that they arent impressed enough because you have to be Mythic raiding live, when i havent mythic raided since Nighthold
---
Sure it will, But almost no guild is going to prioritze atiesh for speed running purposes. its going to go to an important member of the guild.
---
What makes you think it won't be both?
---
Posted about the 1 extra energy 7 days ago, and someone in my post mentioned it was brought up 2 weeks prior.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buzdk8/what_is_causing_my_rogue_to_slowly_generate_1/
---
Well obviously people are going to talk about retail.  Classic and retail are just different versions of the same game.  I mean, you need a retail sub to even play classic.  Then there's the whole bit where people keep asking for post-classic features to be implemented into classic.  The retail talk isn't going away anytime soon.
---
If you're worried about the chat being annoying because of their fanbase or whatever, the only ones you need to avoid are Asmongold and Sodapoppin.
---
The other ones aren't popular enough to cause that type of effect throughout the server and there's a lot of overlap between their fanbases anyway. Bigger streamers from other games will switch over to Classic when it's released, but they'll most likely quit within a few weeks.
---
If we take the size of the modern video games audience into consideration Wrath probably would have had 35 or 36 million subscribers at WoWs peak.
---
I get it now, thank you kind sir.
---
;]
---
It will be in 2 places instead of just one?
---
Excuse my ignorance but is that confirmed that through every phase they won't be expanding the debuff slots? Just hadn't heard this before.
---
Grenades, shield spike, force reactive disk make air easy for warriors too.
---
Thanks so much for the response, very helpful!
---
&gt;Your form of PvP is outlasting the enemy, not bursting them.
---
This is kind of what I was hoping to get at (and was poorly articulating). This makes me hopeful that I'll enjoy PvP despite not being a cat focused player but I'll def check out that video you linked for context. 
---
A bit different of a question, but is there any scenarios where a druid tank would swap to cat form regularly in group PvE?
---
Oh man that’d be hilarious. These man babies would go fucking insane. Can you imagine the level of whining if this guild game into existence? I can, and it makes me feel all tingly inside.
---
Hi, /u/Jazzur
---
Your opinions are not facts, sorry bud.  Calling other people's opinions ignorant, attacking their intelligence, stating that your viewpoint is fact and everyone else's is incorrect - is the definition of the high road.  I really wish you could read your sentences here objectively and apply them to your own argument from the get-go.  You continue to attack the intelligence of the person you are arguing with instead of being persuasive, and this is toxic and self-absorbed behavior.
---
I am not attacking you personally.  I have not attacked your intelligence.  I just want you to be healthy.  I am rooting for you.
---
Thanks! Very informative, it’s cool that there’s some wiggle room with the leftover talent points
---
Sharding is a deal breaker for me. I'm not playing because of it and it sucks because I've convinced 6 of my friends to play. 
---
Still never bought mw2 for PC either.

I remember on my druid, vaguely, that no, I couldn't do it alone.   Aren't there gates you have to click open?

If you are actually orange parsing throughout you mustve made some absolutely galaxy brain take about something to the recruiter. How much vanilla experience do you have? If this is a cutting edge guild going for week 1 clear they’ll want you having your leveling paths down and such
---
imagine using your PTO from work to nolife a video game
---
imagine asking Reddit how to make your wife cool with you using your PTO to nolife a video game
---
Its notba big deal
---
I want to play on highest pop server possible, and if there is streamers there then that good, as it brings more people to the server and more content player-based might occur.
---
And why is Benediction and all the world bosses there? There is no guarantee that streamers will get the kills, normal raiding guilds have 40 people and should be able to shutdown most streamer slaves.
---
I remembered exactly these words when I wrote my comment)
---
Sniping generally means to kill, so please don't get self righteous about the way this kid decided to expand the meaning of the word for PvE games to include same-faction harassment.
---
Using faction translators to circumvent profanity filters is probably against the TOS.
---
You could make the argument that players who spend an inordinate amount of time purposely blocking another player's progression through the game is harrasment and is a bannable offense.
---
Let me explain to you what you don't understand.
---
Blizzard runs the game.  They set the rules.  They decide what is and is not harassment.
---
Suppose Sodapoppin accuses Chungus, stream sniper, of griefing and reports him to Blizzard.
---
Blizzard does not agree with Sodapoppin's assessment of Chungus's behavior and deems that Chungus has not violated the ToS and will not be banned for his behavior.
---
Sodapoppin rees and chooses to punish Chungus himself, and uses his sizable influence to "blacklist" Chungus, and it works.  Even though Chungus has not been banned by Blizzard and has done "nothing" wrong, he effectively loses his character and has to start over again.
---
Is that a fair punishment?  Is it fair to give Sodapoppin that power?  What if he decides to start blacklisting people for far more trivial reasons, like, "this guy wiped us in UBRS.  Blacklist him."  Or perhaps some of his followers decide to take it upon themselves to blacklist any player in Sodapoppin's group if that player makes a mistake live on stream.
---
In the end, Blizzard can't control a server's decision to effectively blacklist people.  I saw it happen to our server 1st priest when he cross-faction AH'd a Hurricane to a hunter in &lt;Domain of Pain&gt;.  In hindsight, now that I am older and wiser, I think that was a shitty thing to do to the guy and we (our server faction) should not have done it.
---
The last thing we need is guys like Sodapoppin popularizing blacklisting as a punishment tool.  It's a shitty thing to do to someone.  In the grand scheme of things it's a far shittier thing to do to someone than stream snipe.
---
I disagree, I think its important to find a guild prelaunch. You can funnel professions and items. I agree some guilds will fizzle out, but with how I have a month off work, I want to dig in with like minded people who wanna enjoy Classic, grind our eyes out, and hit up MC within 2 to 4 weeks
---
Facts!

Asmongold is a sketchy dirty person. I don't know why people support him and his lazy dirty lifestyle. Shit's disgusting.
---
`I and my friends` is grammatically correct, it just sounds weirded than `my friends and I`.
---
gate level 1 so we can 40man hogger
---
Which can just be  fixed manually, just bump up the GS on good items (HoJ or that lvl 40 ish epic staff etc.), problem solved, and GS is viable once again.
---
There’s a guy in Stormwind who does it for gold since Cata I think.
---
It is that icon but i could only wish for that item...it's just the truesilver champion lol
---
Only losers go after streamers who get a massive advantage in game. Real players camp lvl 15s who can't fight back...apparently.
---
It's not an argument. It's just saying that you think they're different. An argument states why you think something is true or false. What you did was a statement.
---
An argument goes Because Thing A is True, I Think Thing B is True.
---
He can't contend with your argument because you literally haven't made one.
---
Yep, I'll never understand it...
---
We had a guy like this on our server, in vanilla he ran the guild &lt;one hundred heroes&gt;. The guild motto was something along the lines of 100 hero’s to support 1 champion (him) basically a super selfish guy that was toxic to boot. My wife joined his guild at one point, while we were progressing in AQ40 he was still fumbling pulls in MC, i used to make her put their teamspeak on speakers so I could hear how their raids were led. Wiping endlessly on the same bosses in AQ became much more bearable when you compared it to those raids. He continued to play and had some semi successful guilds in later expansions but never top. He was made quite famous on the internet with vids like https://youtu.be/6-VIBfGgV40 
---
TLDR: guilds don’t work well if they have a loudmouth asshat as leader
---
Not if the info required for the mod isn't accessible/encrypted, or at least that what was I meant as I understood it.
---
i still think it's a bit too big impact of an addon, there will still be loads of casual pvpers and others that won't necessarily know about it and be at a huge disadvantage. Just my personal opinion, but i hope it will work like the original addons that couldn't detect pushback/other things like that
---
Orc warlock, as rain of fire in Warcraft one was fantastic, finished the last mission easily by cheesing with it. Bit of a let down when casting my first rof outside org and getting killed  by three harpies :-)
---
Streamers bad, me the average person that's not doing much in my life good. Upvotes down below thank you.
---
I guess my main question is how hard is gearing out a boomy? I have tons of experience on a Druid but I didn’t play them in classic. Just worried about obtaining gear that will allow me to have success in WPvP as boomy.
---
I heard that the holy trinity was Warrior tank, Priest healer, Mage dps. 
---
 I wanted to play DPS, so I went Mage.
---
A literal Dick Mountain! Dodgers fans will get the reference.
---
god what an amazing trinket. so simple and so valuable
---
In my opinion I think it’s not so much about the streamer themselves but the cancerous crowd that chases them around and the annoying “omegalul” kids
---
Hunter. Everything is hunter gear.
---
I think the guy was being an ass because it was a custom made add on, not one that was commercially available to everyone. That’s what the original response sounds like, at least. doesn’t excuse the guy who responded to you being a jackass, however.
---
that happened to someone in my guild!! after i told them about doing it they tried and that EXACT scenario happened.
---
Tell me about it.  I rolled an Undead Monk in MoP expecting to be raking my foes eyes out.  Instead, they use the same stupid pose as everyone else.  Very disappointing.
---
I suppose the better question is why would you if it’s within the rules of the game? Don’t stoop to that crybaby level. I feel like people who falsely report should be punished.
---
Just in case your being serious, the damage and armor and damage taken from actual players?  Did you not pay attention at all with all these posts calling out blizzard for players doing too much damage and taking to little damage or other discrepancies that people were linking private server videos of trying to prove its off. 
---
My dude this conversation is over you don’t know anything about what’s going on clearly.  Maybe you should do more research before calling people retarded.
---
Just tell them you’re a capitalist and to get out of your way, you’re busy. Then charge them gold for the name
---
This is chief, it
---
Omg
---
&gt;Cat form isn't used much in PvP because its low damage
---
Why is this? Is it simply because druids weren't meant to be great at dps or is there something about PvP that makes cat dps much worse than dpsing a dungeon or something?
---
I've always played casters so the math behind melee damage isn't my strong point
---
I hope more beta invites go out so I don't have to read dumb shit like this
---
Don't think hours. Think days. Most no lifers will be 60 by the second week. But that's play 16 hours a day.
---
Classic Classic
---
I bet they'll make addons for that
---
there will still be an asmongold on every single server. heck, i might do that myself, maybe people will trade me some gold.
---
Oh without a doubt, but I'd rather have their advertisements in one location rather than two. Adding another tool just means another spot for them to spam at. Also you could argue that trade chat would be easier for Blizzard to act on, and I'd be 100% for perm bans on Gold Sellers AND Carry run sellers
---
I'm gonna use bagone, a dps meter and the vanilla alternative to bartender, that's it.
---
Any guild that doesn't use Discord for as much as they possibly can is shooting themselves in the foot.
---
I'm glad I'm not a American and we don't have these Scrubs here. :&gt;
---
What world do you live in?
---
So you did HEROIC KJ? I take that as Kil’Jaeden in Sunwell in TBC.... that just doesnt seem right.
---
parses in heroic raids don't matter, when mythic is the highest. Clearing heroic KJ doesn't mean you knew the mechanics or anything, now sure you could show a "LOOK AT MY PARSE HERE" move but that could just mean you tunneled anyway.         
---
People would want people that raid(ed) mythic on live because A) they can B) it shows competency, yes vanilla raiding isn't hard but being a mythic raider with high parses shows a player is at least competent.
---
My suggestion is, open RP PvP server for name reservation.
---
Remove if it's below like 3000 players.
---
I remember a scam going around where you offer to CoD an expensive item to someone for like half the cost. Say that you got it but don't really know what it's worth. Say you just want to sell it quick. Someone offers to buy, you send them a gift wrapped present for the CoD price. It's a gray item...
---
Is 400 gold like REALLY rich or just well off middle class?
---
Retail wow inflation has distorted my view of its value.
---
I see the asmon and soda, but I don’t think anyone watches stay safe.
---
I spent like 3 weeks avoiding storm wind because horde had a sit in on wind runner.. those were days..
---
Wrong
---
You can easily tank as arms or fury all the way till 50ish. Just put on a shield and try not to be bad. Leveling as prot is a punishment that nobody should ever put themselves through.
---
Yep. He is a Shaman because of ghost wolf form I believe.
---
agreed. and be sure to use the old.reddit.com/r/classicwow url. the new reddit is garbo
---
That must be where Agamaggan fell, the mountain is his petrified body.
---
Like you said, that happens anyways and did back in Vanilla, and I would say being a streamer in that regard (unless you actually are really good at pvp which a lot of these people are) its probably a disadvantage, as people can just stream sniper your movements,and listen to potential strategies.
---
I'm looking to corner the market on specific things on my server
---
I think streamers are kinda forced into it. They are going to want to do community events, and you definitely want to have a list of people that you know can't behave for those situations. I think you want the game to be policed by the community rather than GMs. 
---
We'll have to see how things shake out, but I doubt people would accept just putting people on a blacklist willy nilly without some proof of dickbaggery. The more people they blacklist the harder it will be to enforce as well.
---
This doesnt make sense at all, Ive done AOTC Heroic KJ with gold parse as UH DK after 200ish tries with retired slow people and my gf that started playing when Legion came out. In no way this should be important. 
---
No guild should care about retail logs in Classic, you dont dps like a maniac the same way mostly because of threat, you barely worked for your consumables besides the runes and elixir and prepots... 
---
The main prerequesite for any guild should be dont be a dick, dont burnout before lvl 30, be proactive, engage in social activities and be present on given times.
---
I could actually fix that problem. A dps'er would probably end up dying and killing 20 people in the process.
---
If you're specced 0/30/21, you're done leveling, so answer that question...No, it's not good for leveling.
---
My alltime favourite boss in wow,great work dude.
---
just add a 0 to the end of that number
---
Nah I came here to say this too. Such an iconic low level weapon.
---
&gt; So would you be okay with most players using a LFG addon?
---
Sure. They can't group up cross server, nor does it teleport you to the instance.
---
post "our" thoughts here.
---
I'm not watching your monetized video.
---
What is wrong and why is it wrong? You just look like a douche with this kind of response.
---
It is a thing in classic. You probably wouldn't get to a position where you would be the master looter though.
---
Never thought I’d see anything like this:))) hilarious and what an achievement!
---
Up until embarrassingly recently, I thought Tirisfal Glades was Tristfal Glades. Little too much Diablo I think.

Looking forward to the completed version!

Check this video by Sonii. He does some great RP-PVP stuff!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePAxmL9NR5M&amp;lc=z22od1vrwmabzj3m1acdp43ay0tg5zamt0efoki534tw03c010c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePAxmL9NR5M&amp;lc=z22od1vrwmabzj3m1acdp43ay0tg5zamt0efoki534tw03c010c)
---
this is fucking stupid
---
you should blur out your email bruh
---
it isn't a monetised video
---
I think that is their goal but at the same time they are already recruiting for their guilds (LOL) so there is no way the server name won't get out.
---
There is nothing more horde than this
---
They probably declined you because of your personality.
---
How do you figure?
---
https://discord.statuspage.io
---
They have exellcent uptime and incident response time. In all of 2018 there were 54 minutes of downtime and the source of those outages were exterior host services that knocked out a large chunk of the internet as a whole.
---
How do I go about playing on one of those?
---
Or I'll play Burning Crusade servers when they come out and have a blast.
---
I’m claiming Asmonbald on all servers
---
I don't much care about streamers, but I'll be on an RP server, so I'll be safe. Streamers can't scream 'WUT A LEGEND" and "WE DID IT BOIZ" on an RP realm all day....can they?
---
&gt; A bit different of a question, but is there any scenarios where a druid tank would swap to cat form regularly in group PvE? 
---
I guess so, because even if it's low damage, it's more damage than bear.
---
So maybe if you are in an offtank situation in a raid, you'll probably want to switch to cat while the main tank is soaking the boss' damage. Or during a phase where the boss isn't doing damage it would be optimal to go cat for some seconds.
---
I'd sugest the MotW spec for you (1/29/21 or 0/30/21) with focus on the bear/tanking talents. You'll be able to heal/tank 5mans, heal raids, and do proper pvp with it.
---
prove it

inb4 watch the video

"If everybody has less gold, then all reagents will sell for less money."
---
If everybody has more gold, then all reagents will sell for more money.
---
More gold in player pockets means less time spending grinding your epic mounts and stuff like that.
---
Is raw gold from instance farming harming the economy? I see it as relative but I'm not an economist. People will always find an optimal way to farm and it will become the new meta.
---
if you like stealthy stuff, go rogue. if you like frontline combat, go warrior. both have good dps and are welcome in raids/pvp
---
You are right in that bringing a few non optimal specs in easy raids is doable. One issue is that you are now allowing non-viable specs into the guild, who compete for the four non-viable spec raid spots you have left open for them. And honestly thats not such a bad idea if these four spots are for your main healer who wants to roll shadow, or for your holy buff bot to go Ret for the week. How is it fair to them if you have some Pally who refuses to do what his class is good at (heal)? 
---
In any kind of serious raiding environment that is just lame. You are also giving valuable gear to these non-viable specs who are gonna make you wipe when you hit Vael or AQ40/Naxx. That gear could have gone to someone who is pulling their own weight. Casual guilds can surely clear MC/Ony with Ret/Boomkins/Ele Shamans. I don't think anyone is suggesting that. Hell you can 3 man Onyxia, 40 Ret pallys could stomp her.
---
If I ever came across a streamer in Classic PvP I will kill them. 
---
Although, this has literally nothing to do with them being a streamer.  Its literally because I am always looking for a fight.  Even if it's a gank, lil guys have big guildies and I was really freaking good at PvP.  There is nothing better than getting guild mates called in, then you kill them too haha.
---
I'm just an asshole in general, and in vanilla, these can turn into massive zone wide brawls that season the server into being better players overall. 
---
Servers could get something fierce at times in the days of old.  Some of my most fond memories are raiding world bosses, while pvping at the same time and trashing an enemy raid sent to stop us.    Some bosses it was often to much to handle both, some bosses you got the kill and destroyed the attacking force.  But all the bosses were fun because of this dynamic.
---
There is a gate at 60 already, which will most likely stay for quite some time. What other gates do you need?
---
You’ll miss out on rep mostly.
---
Here's my vote! I'm committed to rolling on RP-PvP, whether that's the official designation or the PvP server us nerds swarm and make the unofficial RP-PvP server. Going to the regular RP servers is not an option, non-consensual PvP is required for the full game experience.
---
If I buy a 6 month sub in December.  Do they add those earnings all up front in December?  Do they annuitize it for 15 dollars in each of the 6 months I subscribe.  
---
I think it is much more accurate to track MAU.  The number of people using software whether it is free or paid to get the hands on them.  Because that means the consumers eyes are on your products and not on a competitor for their leisure time.
---
/r/mildlypenis
---
Do they?
---
I used to play on Emerald Dream, an RP-PVP server and it was super populated. Of course, I quit playing there when Blizz introduced sharding, which made mass-scale World PVP impossible.
---
This deserves more upvotes lol
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Aussie servers FTW. Absolutely no streamers at all! Also no players though, so it’s a double edged sword 😬
---
If you want to DPS in PvE and PvP both with the same gearset, go rogue. Warriors will only be taken as tank or fury on raid, so you’ll have to likely wait out to get a viable gearset if prot or weapon if fury. Elemental shaman don’t get any play in raids, but you may be able to do resto and get by with the same gear for ele in PvP. Additionally, Resto shaman is very good for PvP, so consider that. As rogue you can viably PvE and PvP in the same gear.
---
So this is not to actually discredit anything you're saying, but:
---
&gt; Ignoring the fact that streamers were obviously invited for hype and not testing purposes, they are actually the ones out there doing most of the testing
---
You have ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS for saying this. None. Zero.
---
The rest of what you said, I pretty much agree with though.
---
I remember paying someone to make that for me way later. That was another thing people forget is blacksmiths had to choose between weaponsmith or armorsmith. So even as a weaponsmith i couldn't make the lionheart helm for myself
---
But why? Genuinely curious
---
Did you miss the article link explaining in detail why Druids are good tanks?
---
We can ALL agree that if them all darnassus is the forgotten one that may as well not even exist. Sad cause it is unique and cool, but just no point to ever make the trek out there
---
54 minutes of total service downtime perhaps, individual servers chat services, voice services and bot services are notoriously unreliable - even on partnered services.
---
Pinging more than 1000 members can lead to the channel freezing and not loading new messages for an undefined period of time. Voice frequency has terrible latency issues which requires resetting the server location, sometimes multiple times an hour. As for bot services they frequently have problems interfacing with Discord leading to unreliability and periods of extended downtime until the service becomes available again and the bots have been restarted.
---
I don't think it's possible, it might not be able to integrate with modern Bnet client and friends list systems. A lot of code has to be altered one way or the other to combine them, be it from the original engine/client or the new one. 
---
But if they don't leave Classic servers this way forever and plan to release the same servers straight into TBC in a couple years and so forth, being on a new engine is obviously ideal anyway. It would make it easier to inject any changing going forward for the current team, I imagine since a lot of them are probably from retail.
---
i dont care what ass pull they did to justifty tauren druids  
---
for one reason or another night elven society had specific sex military roles  
---
females were brutal ones for the most part: hunters, warriors, sentinel  
---
males were sleepy hipsters that hug trees  
---
somewhat based on lions I guess, where females hunt while males sleep  
---
it had creativity, but due to wow they had to throw it all away
---
Well, call it the "hybrid tax".
---
None of the healers have a really good damaging spec (elemental shaman is the closest thing to it).
---
People discovered that using manual crowd pummeler, wolfshead helm and being a hardcore powershifter will get you good DPS in cat form in raids, but even then you'll be behind a well-played rogue.
---
My argument is that his example sucks and he needs to find a new one. That's what "comparing apples to oranges" means
---
One thing I’ll never forget was giving groups going to UBRS gift of the wild while waiting for BWL.
---
Yes it cost some reagent money, but giving those guys the buff when they didn’t have it themselves and with a longer duration was awesome. Got a lot of “thanks bros” from that.
---
I just hope they didn’t wipe!
---
Un Goro Crater, the land of rock hard... rocks... Yeah rocks...
---
Like you?
---
Basically Trial and Error though I've always been partial to casters...
---
Started playing Druid and then shaman because the Jack of all trades thing always appealed to me(ie always having an option no matter the situation).  After getting bored with shaman I tried a mage and it was game changing and importantly it was fun.  
---
A pure dps class made questing/grinding much smoother, the utility spells gave me a lot of options, I could make my own food/water and I could teleport.  It was a far better experience.
---
I do want to note that when I played my Druid/Shaman I didn't really "know" about drinking to restore mana because I had only played console games and GW1.  It was a foreign concept and it really bogged things down even more on my druid/shaman.
---
Sitting on 400g after buying your epic rider, all your skills, leveling all professions... is comfortable.  You could easily blow it on consumables, materials to craft one item, or rep grind items..
---
I think you’re forgetting who the main audience is

---
this is my NUMBER ONE reason for wanting the RP-PvP server. It attracts a certain mindset and repels a certain mindset.
---
People will literally get raid slots just for sniping them.  Non news lol.

The last paragraph of your past three responses have been the most patronizing statements I've seen in a while. Your clearly just being an ass. Like I said your making these backhand comments in an attempt to insult my intelligence and mental health. But that's ok your just out of arguments.
---
I know my opinions arent facts, thats why in interested in discussions. I would love to have an actual discussion but you have been ignoring my explanations and opinions from the start and I'm not sure I actually did insult your intelligence. I called people in this thread idiotic, it's on you if you took that personally. I'm sure your a smart person but you have not presented any clear argument against 95% of the arguments I made. 
---
And yes people saying "stop playing" are 100% ignorant, how can you even argue that it isn't? Perhaps refreshing the definition of the word might help you. That statement just dismisses the fact this is his job and how he makes a living. Playing one the most hyped up games of the year is not an option in that line of work especially when you have a history with game.
---
You've devolved an argument over classic world of warcraft into a shit throwing contest about our intelligence and I'm not interested in it.
---
Thanks for contributing your thoughts to /r/classicwow/
---
&gt;  I said it is going to be canceled, which at this point had become clearer than ever
---
They hired more developers for world of Warcraft around Feb mar.  Look at the job postings.  There are new ones coming out each month.  You are wrong.
---
I think it was some trinket that chance on hit increased your armor. It was pretty garbage overall but the best i had for tanking.
---
How would you be out in the cold? This is part of what I don’t get about modern servers. Back in the day you’d just be on a server (talking about uo and the like) and you made it what it was. Now if it doesn’t say (rp)PvP people feel like they can’t rp?? Just find an rp guild. Granted you’ll still run into people not rping, but you find that on a rp server too. Just rp if you want to rp. If someone else is not and it bothers you, ignore em and keep rping.
---
Originally Tauren was meant to BE the mount! If I remember correctly, which I may not...it’s been a while
---
then im not sure what your issue is?
---
My only issue is that the spelladin will take gear from casters, t2 wont be out for months and spelladins will have to prove themselves in mc, meaning some mc caster loot will be given to spelladins, so theres going to be loot drama.  The spec is fine to me because its just for tryhards, but we have to take into consideration how others will perceive the spec and how it ultimately changes how players raid.  Best of luck to all the spelladins though.
---
I’m saying the hardcore guild will clear it 8 times before the hardcore guild clears it once. Yes, first week rag kill will happen whether you believe it or not.
---
I was a NElf straight huntard need rolling everything.   Im going to roll play that again
---
Add-ons were part of Vanilla since day 1
---
Not mobs because mobs were a common grind to hit 60 since there weren't enough quests. Could possibly be zone discovery like this given that a Hordie used it to discover SW. Can't be Gathering profs because those were also a common thing too. I don't know much else aside from quests that granted XP back then, except the other guy who posted about dinging from someone else's kill in WPVP which pretty much wins it for me.
---
I dont even rp and i agree there should be atleast 1 or 2 rppvp realms, 
---
I tried it once, kept breaking character, still play on rp realms though, much nicer people
---
I really hope not.  I want to play this GAME with other people playing a GAME.  I don't want to play with someone who is trying to make a career out of something that is meant to be a hobby.
---
1. I like the idea of removing it when a player reaches level 60. But I think that the vast majority of people will still be under level 35. And it will become a slog for them if layering is removed. This heavily punishes anyone who isn't a speed leveler and still largely results in the problem layering is trying to avoid (It's not just to help the 1-5 experience)
---
2. Also you have a weird issue of where servers are removing layers at different times... depending on when that server's particular players near 60.
---
Your statement is sad because it denotes thay were already past a time where lootboxes didn't exist at all and all content was just available to play at release.
---
Hardcore guilds will get it second week for sure, first week I dunno.  
---
All the people in this sub talk like they were hardcore players, but not even 5% of all the people here have enough time to play 10+ hours a day, or 30 hours first, second, third day to get ahead...  
---
Don't worry about it so much..
---
Same. But I'm also not sure exactly why the streamers make it awful? Some chat spam? Is there something I'm missing?

Shadow until 50 or so. You will have almost no downtime while leveling and your heals will be fine for 5-mans until Sunken Temple.
---
Shadow is good for solo.  Don't think I ever actually tried leveling non-Shadow back then so I can't speak for smite/HF leveling...

Healing as shadow spec is fine.  Just bring plenty of water.

they will on august 13th like everyone else.

Not true, you can ban addons that legally use available features in the game without getting rid  of those features. But idk it they would want to keep up with that even though it wouldn't be too hard.

"ok"
---
Too true.
---
But I call BS on the matching outfits. lol
---
Can't fix stupid.
---
Till 40-45 go spirit tap and holy / disc
---
I mean of course you’re right, it’s the wrong thing to say, but the reason I replied I guess was more to do with clarifying this guy doesn’t (as far as we know anyway) walk around saying this stuff without any reason at all. it was a pretty specific situation
---
Used to play vanilla on us servers from aus before there was oceanic servers.
---
Now located in the US, gonna play with old friends on oceanic servers for classic. 
---
I guess I'm getting the full authentic experience then?
---
Lotr... indeed that's probably right for the Hunters. Legolas (and less popular Gimli\^\^) is long gone. However the dark, edgy Undead Rogue always believed to remain. But maybe less people are choosing Rogue due to the reasons already mentioned in other comments, the melee competition with Warrior and everybody thinking they are terrible to gear.
---
Interesting nevertheless... only Warrior (popular) and Druid (low/bottom) seem to be in similar spots than back in the days. As a former Warlock (and Priest alt) player it seems like I'm again ending up with an underdog (Hunter) this time around.
---
Female undead warrior is the only true choice.

There's just something psychological about it.  Whether I'm using QuestHelper or I'm using WoW's built-in quest system, the practical effect may be the same - but psychologically, it *feels* different.  I can't really explain *why* exactly, but it does.  When something's just built into the game, it makes it feel too easy, too stream-lined.  But when I have to go download a mod, get any relevant dependencies, sort through any bugs, etc., it feels more *earned*.  It's like "Yes, this thing is easier now - but it's because of something I did to enable it."
---
That probably sounds ridiculous, but like I said, it's basically just a psychological thing.  It's kind of like if my wife says "Pour me a glass of wine" v. "Hey babe, would you mind pouring me a glass of wine please?  Thanks soooo much."  Practically, those two statements are the same thing.  But the psychological difference is enormous.
---
Is he still an edgy 15 year old?
---
Which MMO? Why the throwaway account?
---
I haven’t had a decent guild leader pretty much ever. I had one back in the day in a game called Tabula Rasa and I miss the camaraderie and respect they brought to the group. Also they were just down to earth people. Here’s to hoping I can find that in classic because for me retail was always a shit show.
---
I used that scam (I was the scammer) without getting banned and getting banned after. Difference being about 12 months in between.
---
You would think but UD female has the smallest actual hit box
---
Thanks EA
---
it was nothing but twitch babies spamming poggers when i was on the stress test.  so obnoxious
---
Probably older than you... Good try though.
---
I love it when people literally don't have an argument so they resort to just insulting others. Can you atleast put in the bare minimum of effort and *try* to form an argument, or is that beyond your capabilities?
---
I'm a US top 100 raider with nearly all orange parses all of BFA and I've been getting declined from the top guilds as well. A lot of what are going to be the competitive guilds are looking for people who are private server die hards or people who have cleared naxx and/or were rank 14s back in the day. A lot of guilds are going to be trying to pick anyone who levels fast as well so that they can knock out MC asap. So if you want a ticket to ride, be among the first to hit 60. Easier than it sounds especially if you are leveling solo. Classic is going to be much much more than about raiding. Knowledge is what is going to get peoples attention. People have been min/maxing on private servers for years and have the entire game down like a Method raider in Prog. I never imagined I would be declined from some guilds based on my WoW resume because I figured like you, Classic raids are easy. But that game is so much more than that. I've jumped on a private server because I didn't get beta and can tell you that someone who hasnt been playing private servers for years can't just stroll in and expect to be amazing.
---
&gt; Only reason I played wow after Wrath was because there were no other mmorpgs worth getting invested into... Classic is endlessly replayable for me :)
---
there is always world of final fantasy
---
I know, it sucks, but it's not all bad. Shroud still holds a top slot no matter what he's playing.
---
If you dont like balance and you are not huge fan of beast either you have probably chosen wrong class to begin with
---
Vanilla
---
* I made a human warrior named bigboots, got a +strength 2h sword off a mob otw into SW, got dragonslayer buff as I walked in, and I thought it was just the weapon upgrade that was making me so OP against lvl 5 wolves... 
---
* Thats why I rolled warrior most of my classic experience &gt;.&gt;
---
* Changed to mage near the end as I had a kid who lived down the street from me go on endlessly how op his mage was and how good his uncles mage was, trashed them with mine eventually and then moved on to lvling a druid for TBC
---
TBC/WotLK
---
* I stayed with Druid until cata dropped and quit after a few months, was able to play every spec with the druid competively except for tank, and had around 6-7 sets of armour for the class RestoPvE-RestoPvP-BoomPvE-BoomPvP-CatPvE-CatPvP-BearPvE (not great tho)
---
Cata/Post Cata
---
* I mostly leveled new toons in cata, because the actual content for endgame was god aweful imo. Made a lock and a pally, really enjoyed the lock. 
---
* I dabbled in most of the xpacks that were released except for BFA, getting 1 or two of the previously mentioned toons to w/e the lvl cap was at the time.
---
Other things (Nost/NH/ND)
---
* When I nost popped up I decided that would be for me and I rolled a Lock, managed to get BiS pretty quickly and start raiding, but then I got a bump from hourly to salary, and my free time dwindled, most of it going towards the GF.
---
* When NH popped up I decided I wouldnt give up again and wanted to start anew, but I loved the lock it was so damn much fun I rolled it again, managed to get BiS pretty quickly and start raiding here too, but by this time I had come out and dumped my asshole GF. I did very well here and enjoyed it greatly, I farmed my Aq40/Naxx consumeables months ahead of time and min/maxed as best as my brain could at the time. After AQ40 most of the guild fell apart and I moved to another guild to start naxx, but I really didint feel like I belonged to this other group and wound up quitting over it.
---
* Now as I wait for the Beta I am trying ND, I know I wont be able to raid much before the release, but I hope to explore the paths I will take in the future atm. I am spending a lot of time on learning which quests are a bit more optimal, and looking at guides that I think I could imoprove based on my playstyle.
---
* As for actual classic, I might not roll a lock first like I have been, i've hated playing melee since I switched to mage but just messing around with a pre-60 warrior I am having loads of fun. 
---
* I atm am in a sort of conundrum I want to raid early via lock as this is where I usually find the most fun, but I am really enjoying actually lvling with the warrior. 
---
* Sooo 50/50 lock/warrior
---
Rep for sure but only thing possible will be dungeons, open world = gg
---
Ive heard it called shatter uh a ton even though its not spelled anything like that- i go with it through because shat rath sounds weird to me at this point
---
And I made my case. when I made the claim. Scroll up
---
Not sure why you'd be worried that people might want to play the game slightly differently than you.
---
Show us on the doll where the video touched you.
---
Female Orc hardiness makes me hard
---
last night on private server i had a horde running behind me. I trapped him 2 times and then placed the third trap on the side outside of the road and he ran right into it. Was glorius.
---
lol first time playing real WoW I see.
---
I don't even mind the streamers themselves too much, it's their dumb fucking following that scares me.
---
And much more childish, congrats
---
So why not meet up with some people that get high level in the first week and are recruiting? Instead of betting on strangers you’ve never met to not fizzle out
---
It’s OK I’ll just corpse walk, don’t worry about it
---
yeah hes making some pretty large assumptions, i asked a very general question cuz i wanna talk to the guy about it
---
custom != private
---
so if the guy responds oh its private, i will understand, otherwise im interested in seeing if i can get a repository
---
The fact that you refer to streamers as "attention whores" and have to show off your financial status proves how salty and insecure you are. It honestly sounds like you're trying to convince yourself how awesome your life is.
---
I bring in about 65k a year and I'm 10 years younger than you, but wait... do you hear that? Nobody cares! Learn to enjoy your life without flaming people who live their lives differently than you (even streamers). Until then you're just going to come off as a whiny turd in the punch bowl.
---
I believe blizzard has had issues getting new players since wrath.
---
So this was one of the attempts. To reduce ability "bloat".
---
They only made it so nobody new wanted to play, and made retaining players worse.
---
Colluding with the oposing faction breaks TOS
---
I heard that one was better anyway ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
you could go into MC at 56 if you were a healer.  Warriors could go in at 57ish.  You just need 30 warm bodies and 10 raiders.
---
All of the servers resources will be funneled to them. They will lead the top guild have the best loot the most gold and legions of fans to farm for them. Good luck competing with them and you're fucked if they decide to blacklist you enjoy being endlessly gankef and mever being allowed to fsrm anything or join any groups.
---
Any class with heals in their kit can heal all content as any spec. You are just less efficient if you aren’t spec’d specifically to heal.
---
I sadly pay too much attention this time, since im studying on my finals and procrastination is a thing, such topic havent cross my eyes however. But if you link any post/video, that proves, that values in PvP are off, I ll be happy to admit that Im wrong. But until then, your words arent supported by any evidence. And even if you manage to prove me wrong, pservers are sadly still the closest thing we can get to compare. No matter, how off pservers are, people who been playing on them are still much more knowledgeable about vanilla, than any retail guy.
---
Can engineering be profitable? I heard it was more of a money sink than something that can make you gold. I've been considering herbalism and alchemy for something lucrative that will also mitigate the cost of consumables for pvp as well as being able to provide valuable pve consumables. Ideally I'd want engineering and alchemy once I level them enough to pay for the mats needed on their own. While leveling them I would also want mining/herbalism. Would it be a bad idea to switch around so much?
---
Lololololoololololol
---
Well he asked if it makes an difference if he doesnt take Human as a Rogue, so if he starts increasing his DPS by taking this race theres no reason to stop there.
---
The great Thing is, Guilds that clear Raids like this have to spend a lot less time (for everyone that says he doesnt have time for an hardcore-guild).
---
I'm one of those people who rolled a night elf because I thought they were pretty. I also thought it was hilarious to run around naked for some reason.
---
You can always have someone on the other faction relay their position to you. My point is you cant prove stream sniping. But I agree for the most part
---
I don't watch anyone's stream, but I do plan on trying to steal a name for bank alts. Hoping people send me free stuff on accident. Maybe people will pay extra for \[Insert Armor Name\] crafted by \[Insert Streamer Name\]. If not, it's just a bank alt.
---
I was new to MMOs. Had never played one before but played tons of Warcraft 2, diablo, and wc3 tft. 
---
I picked a night elf warrior because night elf was the race I mained in wc3 and picked warrior because I thought it would be the simplest character to play. Just hit stuff right?
---
Oh man...
---
Asmongold was going to be my banks name
---
Not to mention, they are slower then a regular tank since they have to drink all the time.
---
Do at least 1 East and 1 West I guess
---
oh, never seen the arrows myself. most the people ive seen used it is just for the '!' on the map. maybe its a toggle setting?
---
I know right, I would totally rock a theatrical release poster of Good Night, and Good Luck in my room if I had one. Now I need to go look into buying one while Im here at work.
---
Huh. I assumed that he meant it was private when he called it a custom add on. Didn’t think it was different than that!
---
I had a friend who used to pronounce Orgrimmar as “Oh-guh-mire,” and Kalimdor as “Kala-min-door.”  I think he also pronounced Dalaran as “Dal-air-ian.”  He’s since passed away.  I miss that old fart.
---
So many good screenshots and stories from my BC/Wrath days are lost for all time with my broken laptop. Definitely will need to remember to backup my classic wow pics!
---
Found satan
---
Well..that will be my macro for it lol
---
picture is inaccurate. soda and tips will be on horde
---
\&gt;because sports and videogames aren't comparable
---
You haven't shown this at all lol. You're literally going "those are dissimilar", without backing it up in any way whatsoever.
---
If you live in America and don't take off that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off... what's wrong with you? Labor day makes that 7 days of goodness.
---
Throw a serpant sting their way if you're out among mobs. It's appreciated.
---
Wow you’re an obnoxious fuck
---
Just play whatever you want.  You aren't going to get to 60 for 240 hours /played.  If you play 5 hours a week that's 48 weeks and 10 hours a week is 24 weeks.  That's half a year to a full year.  
---
Just play whatever you want and have fun.
---
I mean.... alot of the game. I mean this seriously too, not in a trolling manner. There is so much story going on in the quest lines!
---
Agreed and I'm not sure how anyone could feel differently, assuming making a stream delay is as simple as we think
---
I think things get a lot better at lvl 20 with Anger Management. The tooltip doesn't mention it, but it causes some steady rage gen during combat. Overall, still a weak class for a looong time. Things definitely start looking up in the 30's like you said!
---
I mean, fair enough. I thought it was obvious I was being slightly hyperbolic. I am sure there are a few people out there actually testing. Regardless of semantics, I think you can agree a lot of people treat betas like early access (admittedly because companies usually do too these days) and don't care about testing though.
---
Just 'playing the game', reporting bugs or not, is what the vast majority of people are doing. That's not bad, because it is a form of testing, but you also have to admit the people actually trying to lowman bosses, bug mobs on purpose, see if they can clip through walls etc. is generally better testing. It's easier to find bugs when you are looking for them because the developers usually catch most of the ones you get from playing normally.
---
Like the vast majority of people here complaining about not being in the beta, I just want to play the game. I admittedly would be a horrible tester and it's the very reason why I am not mad I didn't get in. I know I wouldn't be helping the game much and I would probably burn myself out as well. Hardly any WANTS to test things. Proper beta testing isn't really fun and it's more like a chore or a job. I think you can agree most of the people here that want in just want to play the game and fall into that category, that is where I get my basis for saying what I am saying. Obviously you are right that I don't KNOW, but I mean... we kinda know.
---
Please PLEASE show us your guild application.  Your attitude is absolutely what lead to them denying you and I’d love to see what asinine bullshit pushed it over the top.
---
World, stories, attunements, social interactions, quest rewards, flightpaths, fun
---
inb4 they miss their attack and I accidentally tag it
---
I generally do not recommend DW in vanilla unless you're very geared.
---
Very viable as well, I was going with the idea of only one character to start. The idea of battling thousands of people on day 1 for early mobs to level to 5 twice isn't something I am keen to do.
---
Do I really need to? It should be pretty obvious the ways in which they aren't comparable. Again, you are just being obtuse.
---
Wait what did they do to it?
---
Why not share so we can try it ourselves?
---
Earlier than August 13th? I doubt it.
---
This is an amazing achievement.
---
And the dazed sound as I'm dismounted by their attacks.
---
This is awful
---
You're right, I'm provoking you a bit.  But you seem to be just willfully blind to your own comments the discussion we were having.  Have you ever heard the phrase "it's like arguing with a brick wall?"  You also do come across as very angry, and that's not healthy.  I hope you can get that under control one day.  
---
Still rooting for you.
---
nope, i can write an addon and not have good means to share it or maybe i wanna keep it under wraps but if people ask for it i can share it
---
They were all for no changes for publicity when classic was announced and now they want to blacklist players and pro QoL changes, you tell me what we need to be afraid with them.
---
Well I know how I’m spending the next 40,000 hours of my life. Who needs WOW 1.13?
---
am I out of touch? no.. it must be the incels that are out of touch
---
Sadly, yeah. It's so unique and gorgeous, and it was the first city I ever saw. Makes me wish it had something useful there that would encourage more visitors. I've seen player-run things there on RP realms, but other than that, ghost town.
---
Guys, there can be only one "asmongold" on each server. Which means that there will be at least one asmomgold in every server lol
---
&gt;imagine using your PTO from work to nolife a video game
---
Don't have to imagine I already did
---
&gt;imagine asking Reddit "how to make your wife cool with" you using your PTO to nolife a video game
---
Don't have to, she's doing it with me
---
&gt;imagine considering yourself a responsible adult after doing this
---
Have fun being a responsible adult, cause I'm enjoying my way.
---
&gt;Yes, but you are forgetting how much Blizzard is spending with retail WoW
---
WoW is dirt cheap to run.  From 2004-2008, Blizzard only spent 200m on upkeep in WoW. https://www.engadget.com/2008/09/16/activision-doing-well-blizzard-has-spent-200m-in-upkeep-on-wow/
---
It's probably way cheaper nowadays. Keep in mind, Vanilla WoW would have been succesful with only 400k subs, according to Mark Kern. And people CONSISTENTLY keep coming back for expansions.
---
We can say about how wow is dead and never coming back over and over, but they still sell 3m copies of an expansion pack, opening week of an expansion every 2 years, an expansion that costs 83% of a brand new AAA game + it has a sub fee.
---
I'll be honest. Moon Guard US, has had several guilds in US First contention. But I am unaware of any RPPVP PVE guilds on that level. 
---
That said, even low population servers have had mythic clears.. Just might not be for several months past the release.
---
Nice try Sodapoppin
---
I just reread the whole "discussion" we've had. I didnt insult you but I still apologized when you felt like I did. And I do know that phrase very well, I've been experiencing it. I wouldn't say im angry but I am rather annoyed and maybe I shouldn't be but oh well I'm human. 
---
Hit me up if you ever want to have a real debate without resorting to backhanded comments.
---
All the best man.
---
Absolutely! The goal of these changes is not to make things easier.
---
Hardest to gear will be ret pally, any drop thats remotely good for you will go to tanks, dps warriors, healing pallies, the hunters, off specs and then you
---
for soloing mobs, you generally open with mind blast and just wand. Maybe throw in a SWP as you run back. Shadowform is really good, the rest of the abilities arent really that big of a deal in terms of soloing mobs, but for WPvP, which youll be doing whether you like it or not on a PvP server, its better just to go Shadow.
---
oh yeah. he calmed down for a while actually but classic has triggered some switch in his brain that reverted him back to this state. he had an absolute screaming meltdown the other day
---
Why do you think BFA is unprofitable? 
---
It's not as profitable, but it probably is profitable. 
---
I don't think you're grasping how cheap WoW costs to run.
---
Karazhan was nostalgia... but it was also really, really good. I don't really agree with your logic that they couldn't do it again. In fact, Preach, who is pretty hard on modern WoW, was praising Mechagon as being pretty awesome, it is simply hamstrung by BFA class design. 
---
&gt;faithful rereleases of the original trilogy.
---
Hey man, I'm down for Burning Crusade classic, so sign me up for that. Just because I want that though doesn't mean I have to think retail must fail.
---
What do you think ganking is?
---
I honestly think it's hilarious how butt hurt people are getting over people getting butt hurt about streamers. Just shows their emotional maturity. None of this is a big deal at all. So they got in the beta. Who cares?  One of them thinks out loud how they don't want to be blacklisted. Okay, again, who cares? Play on a different server or don't be a loser who complains about people camping people getting complained about and you won't have a problem. So many of the people in this sub are pathetic.
---
As I understand it, the first Phase of new content in Classic brings the honor system, pvp ranks, and the pvp gear you can farm as well
---
I can hear this screenshot.
---
I thought the image wasn't loading. Fine, you got me. lol
---
Not really.  Know a rogue?  Are YOU a rogue?  No need for a Scholomance key for example.
---
The only aspect of dealing with streamers that actually exists is the fact that they have large amounts of immediately accessible back up. Try ganking someone on stream in any game, you usually have a small army on your tail about a minute later. So world bosses and shit can be a pain if there’s one dude locking it down. That could be any guild though, no stream required - so really it’s just a little short cut to amassing a team if anything.
---
It has rained for me in beta
---
it is viable to level as resto, but if you level alone its slowest spec. Go enhance and level with a slow 2 hander (can be staves)  + rockbitter. Its the best leveling way outside of elemental.  
---
Learn how to bind your keys. Use Q, E, R, Z, V, (/sit) on X, use shift + buttons (that includes 1,2,3,4,5), ctrl + binds, alt+ binds.  
---
You can bind anything actually. Its good to bind everything in your keyboard, when you learn everything you have bidden you will do things on automatic.  
---
The mana problem can be solved with consumables, you will be buying water from vendors/mages anyway don't worry about that...  
---
Answering in advance, you can raid with any spec, BUT, resto will be optimal because manatide is such a good totem...and you can respec to any spec after raid, elemental, enh, and spec into resto when its raid night lol
---
Aw, is that a yeti that came to congratulate you?
---
I'll take one, please!
---
classic had addons stop trying to make others as bad as yourself.
---
So 58 was probably due to hit rating on mobs I'm assuming, since even though 55 is for attunement it's probably still too low and you would be missing everything on the 60-63 elites
---
Decurse was hilarioussly broken. 1 button and you could literally have a monkey decurse for you.
---
You can easily be fury spec and PvP as a warrior.
---
What you ABSOLUTLEY need is a healer or you're pretty worthless.
---
I started playing WoW in late classic, a few months before TBC was announced and my server that I was initially assigned to was Earthen Ring EU, however my friends played on Dragonmaw, so I abandoned my level 6 orc shaman and created a warrior, because my friends were rogue and priest. 
---
They were in late level 30s when I started and it took me about a month to hit level 30 and by then my friends were already 60 and they decided to move to Warsong EU. I already made some friends while leveling, namely Zomz(mage), Werepig(priest) and Slastena(shaman). I decided to not move with my IRL friends and stayed on Dragonmaw with my online friends. 
---
At that time I was attending school and I payed for WoW using the scratch cards I bought at my local store, so transferring server would require me to ask my dad to lend me his credit card, which he would refuse. *Also*At the time I was sent to a summer school, to learn English abroad and many kids there played WoW. They were all 60 and were raiding AQ and BWL and I felt left out, being around level 40 at the time. 
---
I think that every server had this “guy”. You know what I mean? Full Tier 3, thunderfury... best in slot trinkets. If you whispered him he would never ever respond. If he bought your stack of thorium ore you would screenshot it and send it to your friends, as if you just stood in line next to Ashton Kutcher. So on Dragonmaw, this “guy” was called Rbj, a protection warrior with full T3 and thunderfury. It seemed as if every time I ran back and forth from AH, posting my Green Iron Helms, he would be atop the bank roof on his sexy black wolf, teasing me. 
---
So going back to the summer school - the internet there didnt allow you to play WoW because you couldn’t install it so our eyes were glued to thottbot and wow armory. Looking at each others characters and discussing what item was snatched from their nose by a unlucky roll that they dreamt of getting. So when it came my turn to show my character, I did a horrible thing... I typed the 3 letters... R..b..j. And everybody’s jaw dropped. I was a hero amongst there people, they thought I was a god. However the people were raiding AQ40 and soon realized from our conversations that I didnt know the first thing about the end-game and I became a subject of mockery and bullying for the rest of the trip. 
---
Luckily the people you meet in summer camp usually remain in history, but this taught me to not lie about that stuff again. After classic I never heard from Zomz again. When TBC released me and Werepig were playing in Arena at level 70, as warrior and priest 2v2. We both hated druids and both were fine staying at 1400 rating, having fun in the process. He quit the game after TBC. 
---
Slastena and I played together all the way to launch of Cataclysm after which she had a baby and quit. I play till this day, all my friends left retail wow. And since I lost touch with my friends, I am not sure if they are coming back for classic or not, but if they are, and by some miracle see this post, please contact me:) and if you are Rbj, I am sorry for using your character as a part of my lie, I still feel bad, so many years later, when I am an adult, with a wife and a kid... So this is my story, I am very interested of hearing yours.
---
 These stories will always stay with me forever and I hope classic will bring some more. Btw I dont get how I didnt get classic beta, I guess I haven’t played long enough...
---
This is v true. But im going off the assumption he doesnt have a pocket rogue
---
God I feel you on that. I actually liked a few of the streamers personally but playing with them was miserable. Was in &lt;no mercy&gt; back in the day.
---
the improved buffs are for everyone of the class raidwide.
---
I assume he means Greater Blessings, which are pretty unique in that theyre the only castable raid wide buffs.
---
I agree with you, but it was also part of the vanilla experience you can't deny that. If you want the OG experience, that includes decursive.
---
I remember getting my first epic mount. The Frostwolf Howler. Farming the Alterac with my Troll Hunter was quite the time. Best Rank i got was 7 in all that time.
---
I thought it was removed but apparently bits a pvp talent now to reduce dmg or something
---
WrA and ED are probably some of the more mature and level headed players, guilds and communities in modern wow.
---
Ahahah too true this subreddit loves being a victim
---
It's pretty obvious whether someone is streamsniping or not.
---
I don't think you'd have to worry about this, and if Sodapoppin calls someone out for streamsniping when they aren't, then you will see a lot of backlash from the community.
---
We can sort this out
---
Surely the only reason someone would disagree with me is a large conspiracy theory funded by multi-national conglomerates to silence my enlightened opinions.
---
Yepp, living the dream.
---
So you’re afraid they will got so popular that they will change the opinion of people who will then pressure devs to change the game?
---
Good to be on EU, but I wish there was a way to know which (EU) servers will be the best when starting Classic.. It'll be PvP but which one would be the best, with the most balance, lots of people but not too many, no streamers and a good community?
---
remember the original idea behind duskwood when they wanted it to be so dark you would need a torch to see around you? i wish they followed through on that
---
Runescape back in the days before the grand exchange was definitely something else. That’s for sure.
---
Not even close. You have to go the Skarm route of using every consumable in the game and even then it's pretty slow.
---
Or we could have the true vanilla experience and have no oceanic servers!
---
Resist gear for nax aq I think would be good
---
My ex and I used to play on computers next to each other on the same desk. Not sure if others know this but we would frequently have different weather effects i.e. Raining for me but not for her
---
Because it affects them? its not just them being in game they have noticeable impact once they are there and especially once they leave
---
Class wide isn’t raid wide, that’s all I’m saying.
---
&gt; Mark August 27th, 2019, on your calendars. I think it will be the day that will save the WoW franchise...but there will be a sacrifice down the road : Retail WoW.
---
Well, there's a really easy trade.
---
They would they scrap Modern WoW to work on a dead genre when expansion packs to WoW consistently blow sales out of any RTS on the market?
---
How is ninja looting griefing if corpse camping isn't? You have an ingame solution to prevent it from happening again: do not group with the person who ninjas loot. If someone says mean things to you in chat, you can Ignore them. I don't understand people who believe corpse camping lowbies isn't griefing cuz "you asked for it" but other examples such as you stated are.
---
Oh thank god!
---
&gt;Restokin, go into both balance and resto in order to pick up the best Healing Touch talents in both trees, and get a little bit of caster abilities
---
https://i.imgur.com/HcEsJ1q.png
---
That spec right? I think this makes rank 4 healing touch the single most efficient healing ability in the game. It's very raid pve focused only, but it's good for progression.

---
Those of us who have skill-sets that are in-demand have to share our community and forums with Macy's Sales Associates. Just gotta deal with these oompa loompas.
---
Druid doesn’t really have a hope vs an equally geared pvp lock or priest really. Your best option is running away.
---
You can pvp with fury without respec, arms is just more popular lol
---
RIP in peace my ping
---
Omega lol!
---
Yea my goal is to not be on a low pop realm. Some of the fun is weird stuff happening on your server. But 12 year olds chasing streamers is going to be a bit different if I’m playing. We used to do server events that were fun and recorded. Not 24/7 crap
---
I like people like you
---
Parody is a potent contribution
---
Used to play UD female for the model but then everyone thought I was a girl. Changed as soon as I joined a guild.
---
they can if it's in character..  Role play an obnoxious mole rat with delusions of being important to everyone.
---
This does feel like it's exclusively a US problem. Can't think of any EU streamers off the top of my head. Famous people on our realms should be players who are known purely because of their in game accomplishments. Got nothing against streamers, I like Tipsout but glad they're not going to be on our realms.
---
People are excited about classic. But the gaming world has changed. Gamers have changed. It won’t be the same experience unless you get a little lucky and find a good server with a good number of great guilds.
---
But, to keep up hope, school will begin which limits the time spent by the younger audience. And the viewership of the streamers will drop, you won’t see the same crowds following them and polluting chat. Basically it should get better than it currently is.
---
i mean yeah iguess.
---
If you're trying to not respec all the time, just drop Frostbite and keep Shatter.  You have to make your novas count (knowing that you're not getting another freeze until it comes off CD again), but it'll save you money if that's what you're looking for.
---
Do the level requirements for dusting apply in vanilla? Or was that added later? Like once you reach level 20 or so the items required 75 enchanting and so forth.
---
Thank you. I was just wondering if they were similar to how they used to be. Back then they were pretty intense and could completely alter the atmosphere of a zone. kind of like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcJyercsiVQ)
---
I can play video games whenever.
---
I save my PTO for things that aren't available to do "whenever".
---
you do you tho
---
They're fine as off tanks, we had a couple in my guild.
---
I personally often have fun doing very easy things, a challenge can be frustrating :)
---
I’m so excited for layering. I adamantly agree, the first few zones, 1-30 should do it, NEED layering. It will eventually thin itself out and will be removed.
---
Blizzard absolutely nailed this one.
---
True as it may be some of us still want to be sure to avoid servers with big streamers...
---
It was a cheap sex joke.
---
um, I'm a different guy than started this convo with you...
---
I was just responding to the idea that 'most companies stop making games for your group'
---
which... you're not wrong, most would. I guess I was just saying that some of these niche markets are actually pretty big when given the global reach of the internet.
---
Grow a pair? You're acting like a shit head online to others and I guarantee you wouldn't in person. There's nothing manly about disrespecting others online. Nothing you said offended me, I just pointed out that typing like a fucking moron isn't going to get a good reaction, and you had a valid post besides that.
---
Fury can pvp just fine
---
I don't see enough reason to consider SuperData a serious source when I haven't even heard of any of these games on this list.
---
Unsure of every weather effect. But rain was the same as in p servers which are the zone changing kind
---
Stay away from escort quests.
---
We're working longer hours with more things vying for less free time. Socially everything around us is pushing us to be faster, to give more time here, there, etc. Being outright hateful toward others has also seen a rise in recent years which makes it cheaper for game companies to discourage interactions that could bring that out rather than pay staff to do more moderation.
---
Lol no, everyone abandoned RPPVP servers, the only reason anybody is advocating for them is because they were told they wouldn’t get one. It’s like unintended reverse psychology by Ion Haz.
---
Better than me. At level 10 I put a point into arms. 11, fury. 12, protection. 13, arms. And I repeated this pattern until somewhere in my 40s. I also didn't level professions and bought a fresh new set of vendor armor whenever I got to a new zone, which I paid for with the money I got from vendoring any BOE greens and blues I wasn't using instead of selling them at the AH. I didn't wear plate or have a mount until like level 47 because a guildmate felt bad for me.
---
im expecting no more than four servers with 6 layers each, tbh.
---
I'm an addon junkie. Addons are a part of WoW.
---
Carefully, he's a hero.
---
A lot of bosses have fear mechanics in raids.
---
thanks a lot!
---
If you are not going to raid and are not going to dump a lot of hours into PvP rank grinding I HIGHLY suggest nearly any other class. 
---
Warrior is probably THE most gear dependent class. 
---
You are really going to struggle to be anything more than a hamstring bot with just dungeon blue gear.
---
There are still plenty of problems with DKP. 
---
First off, in a bid system, how do you deal with players making back-channel agreements not to compete for drops? For instance, warlocks and mages compete for the majority of non-class-specific drops. If the warlocks work out an agreement where each of them will roll on a certain set piece before the others, then they can all get their tier 1 at discount prices. Meanwhile, the mages are continuing to run the bidding up and spend more on their tier pieces relative to the warlocks. The end result is that the warlocks spend less as a group than the mages and therefore have an advantage on the loot that they compete with mages for.
---
Another thing to consider is inflation. If you hand out points faster than points are spent, then you are essentially just printing money. This makes the value of DKP diminish over time, so you need to establish a balanced economy. You can do that a number of ways, but there are drawbacks. You can award DKP based on the amount of DKP spent (zero sum), but then players don't get DKP unless someone gets loot. You can spend hours and hours trying to establish item pricing that will balance your DKP distribution, but that's a shot in the dark. 
---
The other thing is DKP hoarding. Eventually, you'll get to the point where people don't need drops as much and DKP starts to accumulate. Newer raiders have no chance of getting loot until many weeks after joining, and that can hurt your recruiting chances and retention. Hoarding also presents a problem earlier on, when people hold all of their DKP for that BiS piece that has a 3% chance of dropping, while passing on meaningful upgrades that could help your guild. 
---
Most of the advocates for DKP that I have talked to about these problems will say, "If that happens, you just fix it. Change the rules or reset DKP values." "If the hunter wants to bid on rogue daggers, just tell him no." "If people hoard DKP, just cap it." It just isn't that simple though. The stated purpose of DKP is to be objective and remove human judgement, so if you're going to make up rules, you might as well have a loot council.
---
Can’t wait
---
I mean, I'm not banning you from using it. I gave my opinion and why I won't be using it. I know the Blizzard LFG tool is packed with gold sell and carry sell spam, so I can't imagine how bad a non blizzard tool would be.
---
Imagine being this triggered by *people enjoying things*
---
thanks for answering my question i wish i could give you gold! Let me reiterate. I love resto. I want to play resto.  There is a chance I migh play beast as well if need be although I'd rather not. And I am asking. Do i need 2 different gear sets lets say one with intelligence and one with agility? Or can I do this with just one gear set lets say a robe with both agility and intelligence for example. I am a noob. I don't really  know. That's why I am asking
---
Denial. Enjoy ventrillo
---
I’m actually excited about how all the victim point hunters try to get wow Classic shut down because they can’t handle the bants. 
---
Vox will be going mental about Classic WoW misogyny, within a week of launch. It will be hilarious because no matter how much the try to dictate to gamers, the never understand what it’s like to be one.
---
Yeah wtf is going on!?
---
Leveling Flaw: You're pretty much just auto attacking.
---
Endgame (possible) Flaw: You're more than likely going to be healing.
---
- 100-120 for super tryhard
---
- 130-150 for normal, but following a leveling route
---
- 160+ for casual.
---
No there is not a minimum level require to get the aura. Great for noobs!
---
lol login time around 497 minutes. 
---
Only 8 hours until you can log in!(roughly)
---
This is how Horde speed run guilds get Blessing of Kings
---
Well to be honest some of them belong in Desolace while were in Ironforge
---
Also waiting in que lol
---
So the solution is to have 40 people not sleep for a week in order to clear the raid? Sounds like a winning concept, especially if you're one of the slower leveling classes.
---
Dude......occulus rift
---
I think it was felcloth, ebonweave is wotlk i believe.
---
WTS runspeed for daze
---
To answer your question, yes but it doesn't matter. Play what want to , which sounds like warrior
---
Destiny 2.
---
And it's not a throwaway, just a new account I'll be using for WoW Classic content. I don't want my DTG stuff linked, especially since I'm considering quitting.
---
Got a link?
---
Dude you literally made a post about how damage was off in pve yourself and you had people show you how you were wrong yourself.  And now you’re asking how damage is off in pvp. Think about it.  Really think about it for one second.  Damage is off in pve, but you think it’s right in pvp.  REALLY think about that for just a second.
---
Definitely worth doing them once with the associated quests. Drops will help you in the overworld levelling too.
---
*Look at what they did to my boy*
---
Really thats horrible. God I hate how they just gutted everything.
---
Oh, so suddenly noone cares about income any more? Then why bring it up as an argument in the first place?
---
You owned yourself hard sunshine. Also, learn the difference between gross income and net income :P
---
I will not be hearing from you again, as this is quite frankly a waste of my time.
---
I’m wondering a few of these things myself, mostly how world PVP will be.
---
I’m a newer player, got one character to max pre BfA, and I recently played classic private severs on a few toons LVs 1-15ish. I’m planning on rolling a Dwarf hunter. 
---
Trying to decide on PVP or PVE server. I’m more interested in PVE, but I feel like the pvp interaction would add an interesting/fun aspect to leveling. How frustrating/often is getting camped? I don’t want to have my experience interrupted too often by pvp.
---
Asmon is actually pretty funny even though he’s a streamer and might bring some negatives to a server. He has a pretty light hearted nature most of the time that I can respect and would be healthy to the wow classic community.
---
Low throughput, low reactivity, very high efficiency (once you have the gear to enable rank 4 HT).
---
just think about it, someone has to make an addon. an addon is just a file. Today we have clients such as curse to add addons into wow. They come from a list of trusted sources. I can write an addon that does something simple, like when my charactres name is mentioned in chat it makes the color change. This would be a custom addon, i could share it, but i might not want too simply because i just wanted something quick and easy so i literally only check for "pastagains" properly down you would do something like this.character.name.
---
&gt; IIRC the pservers were making Ragnaros hit for physical damage
---
What!? LOL surely they can't be that incorrect?? That's just stupid.
---
Just a lot of annoyances. Dudes spamming annoying stuff in chat, entire goon squads running around being annoying just so streamers can see them. Essentially Twitch chat but in WoW.
---
I personally like most of the streamers, they bring some good exposure to the game and some fun content, but I'd rather watch it from afar (through twitch) than having to be in a server where that's constantly going down
---
Look you don't have to read or respond to the posts you hate, but feel free. I'm looking for some feedback from people that want to talk about the game and have a discussion. No need to participate.
---
They are worth it one time for the quests
---
Shadow.
---
Melt all the faces. ALL OF THEM.
---
#Vanilla is raid or die, let's get that out of the way. 
---
If you do not raid, you will be shitty in PvP. Doubly-so because you're choosing to play the most gear-based class in the entire classic experience. 
---
You are going to get destroyed by some ass-clown who gave his guild leader a hand job for a obsidian edged blade and it is only going to get worse as that guy gets better weapons like Untamed Blade and Ashkandi in the BWL phase (and later Dark Edge of Insanity - or even insane Naxx gear if you somehow are still playing a masochist simulator). At best you will be using TUF when BGs come out but you will still fall very much behind raiders. 
---
TL;DR: Raid or die. You will suck if you don't raid.
---
Macy's is about to go out of business though
---
Christ, he was joking around and having some fun with it. This is what is really annoying about Asmon, people think he’s serious with things his says. Misunderstanding then hating. Also, imagine being depressed over how someone else interacts with another person
---
I believe that was in vanilla already. I remember being always so far behind on enchanting that it became useless.
---
who are these people? idk these acronyms lol
---
You're not you when you're hungry. Grab a Snickers
---
Well the problem with making an unofficial one, is that people have to be in the same community to find the unofficial one.  Say what if the alliance in emerald dream pick PVP server 10.  The horde in emerald dream pick PVP server 4.  The alliance in wymrest accord pick PVP server 10.  The horde in WrA pick PVP server 6.  Then you have different communities in different places.  Then it just gets muddy for any player that was not on one of those communities before, or a new RP player coming from GW2, FF14 or Eso to find a RP PVP realm and they picked RP PVE!
---
You're supposed to buy everything then wonder why you can't get a mount at 40.
---
no changes :P
---
Fair enough. But it sounds like we agree on my original point.
---
It's 586 minutes now.  Is this a stress test?
---
This would be very cool.  I've always wanted to see a game like this where you drop your loot when you die, or a chance at dropping certain pieces of your loot.
---
Cat form is your opener. You're better off just spamming moonfire and sitting it out in bear form, bashing and charging when you need to heal. 
---
Cat form, even as feral, isn't going to be where you spend a majority of your time. You'll die against hunters, rogues and warriors in cat form, and it doesn't do a whole lot of damage to mages without a lot of shifting out of snares and that costs Mana. Which you won't have a lot of in feral gear. Your uptime as cat is severely limited, honestly. 
---
You're better off just doing some casting, and if you have the Mana and can get close, do some quick cat damage and get out of there with travel form. 
---
Feral ain't nothing in classic, as far as DPS goes. Especially in PVP. Even "use the whole class" people should be able to agree with that. 
---
There's a reason why so many druid PVP vids from vanilla are resto and joked about as just moonfire spam
---
&gt;My argument is that his example sucks and he needs to find a new one 
---
That's not an argument, that's an opinion.
---
My opinion is, that you are wrong, cannot cope with it, and in your panic struggle to cover up the fact, confuse opinions and arguments.
---
Oh right, its the same for the hunter bow too then I guess.
---
&gt;and on pvp servers there will be so much griefing.
---
I am fine with that, the staff is legendary for a reason. Getting it should be a pain in the ass
---
Well, if anything these last days proved that at least Soda does not want competition.
---
And Asmongold is as big a crybaby as Sodah, so...
---
This is one of those more rare suggestions, but one that still gets repeated at a regular interval.  
---
And each time it makes me wonder where humanity went wrong.
---
Savix invented meme edits? Shit son tell me more.
---
reddit is not a democracy though
---
Yes you need a specific feral tanking set, which is different from you healing set, which is also different from a feral dps set. 
---
You can get away with a 30/21 HOTW spec to tank and heal dungeons , but you won't tank properly with a heavy resto spec only.
---
Yes, you need to. Or you could do the intelligent thing, accept that you have been beaten, and end this useless conversation.
---
Do you even remember what happened during LFR Molten Core? People kept endlessly wiping and thats despite mechanics in most of modern WoW being over 10x more difficult than the basic encounter in vanilla. I 100% guarantee a bunch of idiots will repeatedly fuck up without aggro addons and addons that COVER YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN AND BEG YOU TO DO BASIC MECHANICS LIKE THIS.
---
The same goes for anyone blacklisting other players for griefing or ninja looting. That's one of the selling points that people here keep spouting... If someone is toxic, then the community can act against them.
---
Remember that very large survey someone did about people's plans for classic and RP-PvP server was more popular than regular RP?
---
Seriusly!
---
Good posture is really important if you are sitting in front of your pc for a long time.
---
Yes you'd want different gear sets
---
That weapon eluded me until level 40, ran VC multiple times a day every day for that damn sword. I hope I can finally achieve the dream of seeing it drop when I could have actually used it.
---
Just do it. Unless you have some reason to race everyone else to 60 then take your time and enjoy leveling however you like it.
---
I recall leveling from 1-60 being a chore for many back in vanilla/BC/WotLK when I played, but I believe you’re robbing yourself of much of the game’s value if you don’t take the time to enjoy all the &lt;60 content that you want.
---
We think so, but hell is paved with good intentions.
---
You need entirely separate gear sets for tanking and healing yes.
---
Next time it will just be
---
"Estimated wait time until login: *Go fuck yourself*"
---
Dps meters
---
Threat meters are okay
---
Because they are entitled man babies who are outraged that PvP rules apply to them too.
---
Oh the horror!
---
I might just stick with warrior and pray I wont fall too far behind
---
Warlocks are good if you like playing them. That being said, the only objectively best race for Warlock is Gnome. If you're playing Horde, just pick what you like and play to your strengths. If you're worried about balance in Classic then you've already lost.
---
I found some censuse nonses from a questionable website that one of my characters was made in April of 2006 but sadly no invite. Luckily I work with a guy who got in so I get to talk and reminisce with him.
---
The issue is the shifting, in addition to poor dps. You have to shift out to heal, shift out to get out of roots and snares, and in feral gear your Mana pool is pitiful.
---
stress testing
---
Soul Keeper and Headmaster's Charge were my chase items on my Warlock. So many wasted Scholomance runs trying to get the Charge. I eventually got Soul Keeper and enchanted it with Demonslaying for that multi-colored fire. I used Soul Keeper in all non-raid/PvP content just for the aesthetics.
---
WoW will definitely be no. 1. A bunch of big names will be streaming at launch, TimTheTatMan, Summit1G, Shroud, etc. It will be well over 100k for weeks
---
All I need is titan panel, I need to see my XP/hour and current gold status.
---
Thank you! That’s helpful to know
---
Rogue and Warriors are great dps, Warriors are basically the only viable tank as well. Shaman can't dps raids full stop, but they have a super easy time finding raids as resto.
---
Not vanilla, but until a few weeks ago, I thought the BFA zone Tiragarde Sound was Tirisgarde Sound.
---
And yes, I made the same tristfal glades mistake as you.
---
Since they are going 1.12 the mobs in entrance will be throwing nets and
---
Farming will not be very viable in BRD
---
the second and third most populated RP servers and most populated RP PVP servers.
---
Ah - you incessant pedantry has convinced me. PC games are eternal! People will play them until the day the sun explodes! REEEEEEE
---
Female orc best horde race.
---
Most of those existed in some form back in actual vanilla.
---
Sounds delicious
---
&gt;They are going to want to do community events, and you definitely want to have a list of people that you know can't behave for those situations.
---
Having a list of people that you know are going to camp you is different than actively asking the opposite faction streamers to help keep the person from doing content.
---
Even worse. Salty oompa loompas with too much time on their hands.
---
Then you might aswell just not play.
---
Companies at Blizzard's size have internal teams that are entirely dedicated to crunching these kinds of numbers and determining demand. They certainly aren't just guessing. 
---
They can of course be wrong, but they are going to go with the data they currently have. If demand turns out to be higher than anticipated after launch they said they would add a server.
---
“No u”
---
thanks for the reply friend
---
Farming shards before the raid is the bane to lock existence, be prepared to spend the hour before raid time running around burning steppes/Silithus/epl filling your bags with shards for health and soul stones. Speaking of hearthstones, I got banned once for flaming a gm that wouldn’t restore my apex crystal that was lost due to a hunter trading me just after I dcd an item, that apex crystal would have paid for my week of raiding consumables and repairs.
---
zug zug
---
Well we could talk about theoreticals, ideas, concepts, but that stuff isn't usually liked compared to memes.
---
Being EU and watching all these threads constantly, I keep running out of popcorn.
---
Imagine making an entire reddit post because you're salty you got denied to join a guild, and then replying to several people in that post and denying that maaaybe your attitude played a role in your guild app rejection.
---
Crowder gang represent! But for real, these SJW types don't seem to understand there's a difference in speaking words that might hurt your feelings ( in this case, the guy self identifies as all those things. I thought they were proud of it?) and calling on your fanboys to commit actual crimes against people who did nothing illegal. At worst, you can say he was being a dick to him, which again, is not a crime. People use to have thick skins, or at the very least bite their lip and take it. Now, we live in outrage culture and expect to be treated as the center of the universe every time someone says something mean to us
---
I don't think they ever confirmed there would be RP realms or not.
---
I wouldnt say leveling Paladin was ever a struggle, most people just complain that its boring, since you mostly just hit Seal and then auto-attack.
---
You honestly think that every server isn't gonna have spam??? you're insane.
---
thank you for the replies. In your opinion how hard is it to obtain a decent gear set for bear and another one for resto?
---
Gonna try this on mobile, here goes.
---
A 0/30/21 druid build will allow you to tank, heal, and dps in the same gear. Here is a link of pre-raid gear setup with an emphasis on tanking/dps. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Ro0q0zJ89ckk0mm9m8mhD808mhc808c45808c4C87VovU808mRB808mhM808m4f808cji808wf87c
---
To dungeon heal, just switch with healing staff. To raid heal, you will want a 2nd set with +healing. Potentially, you could get the epic pvp set. This has all stats including +damage/healing, but will be quite the grind.
---
Just finished engineering school and I had never heard of it.  Thanks for the link!
---
Jesus Christ. We are still in beta and people are already predicting the end? 
---
Who cares what a streamer does? Why do you guys keep watching these streamers?
---
like most of the posters on this sub
---
Even some of the bigger streamers get what, several thousand views? That's a lot, don't get me wrong, but I think it's a drop in the bucket compared to any overall player base. 
---
I genuinely don't hate streamers; that's not the right word for it. It's more like I can actually feel my brain cells withering away when exposed to twitch culture. I can't hate, because when I was a kid playing counter-strike (and WoW) there were dumb things I thought were funny and cool, but I just can't have a conversation with someone who's saying "pog" all the damn time at this point in my life. 
---
In my excitement for Classic, I've taken to watching some smaller streamers and I agree there are some who are pretty chill and cool dudes, despite the twitch lingo. Even with them, though, I can't help but feel that I'd be annoyed if I was playing with them because they're constantly distracted by their twitch chat and they'll just randomly go afk even in the middle of group content, or forget to respond to people in game who are trying to ask them something, and then be defaulted the loot despite not contributing as much effort. 
---
I completely understand this doesn't make them bad people or anything, **but I think streamers often create an image of themselves that is completely self-centered, and then justify the negativity surrounding that by saying it's just part of their job.** Maybe it is, but again, going back to my original point about how many viewers they draw, is that regardless of whether or not people hate them, I think most people just don't want to be around people like that at all.
---
I don't know exactly how it worked when, but every variation was tested on the beta an none worked.
---
&gt;Oh, so suddenly noone cares about income any more? Then why bring it up as an argument in the first place?
---
My point in saying that no one cares was to differentiate you from them, because you're pretty clearly salty about how much streamers make from "whoring themselves out." Nice reading comprehension, though.
---
You're in your mid-30s and you're still projecting your own insecurities by trying to brag about how great your life is while shitting on streamers. Feel free to keep flaming streamers on every post and embarrassing yourself, though.
---
What a freak.
---
Agree it was quiet and comfy for the months prior to classic beta. Now it seems like low-effort meme karma farmers and stream shitposters have taken over.
---
It's so funny to see all the babies thinking that because you're on a streamers server its gonna ruin your gaming experience. Maybe you should pay less attention to them and their streams and just play the game, you wouldn't even notice or know unless you went onto their stream and were keeping up with their every move... who honestly gives a fuck, if you think there wont be spam in chat because streamers aren't on it... you're in for a treat.
---
It was a simpler time. mistakes were made
---
Don’t level as prot
---
K?
---
Lets be real clear. LFG would obliterate Classic. And it will never happen. There already are meeting stones which you could queue for to find you a group but nothing beyond user interface. If you’re seriously advocating for LFG you need to leave and never come back. 
---
Secondly, you don’t need gearscore because PuG leaders will inspect you to make sure you’re Pre-BiS or geared for the content and fully enchanted. No point in having a shitty add on. Elitism is there to stay.
---
So many memories just by reading LFG channel.
---
So you don't have any arguments, and now try lame stand up comedy to cover it up.
---
Sad.
---
Please do yourself an favor and stop.
---
I’m 90% this is just a dedicated troll to trigger all the people that posted about 1.13 yesterday.
---
Not a bad idea, list things on the AH at double the price for a follower to buy immediately.
---
I farmed up the shadow res to do just this, even rerolled engineering for the 2 shadow reflectors (not gonna lie was tempted to do it for pvp anyways) never got to try it because the lock class leader wouldn’t let anyone else have a go, in the end warriors did it with shouts anyway so I don’t think that point is completely valid, I asked around and all the guilds at the time used a warrior to tank the magic emp.
---
more likely you're in r/wowservers
---
Do paladins not have at least comparable efficiency, thanks to Illumination?
---
Well, good luck getting your guild to use anything else. Your opinions are definitely minority ones and I wouldn't touch a guild that doesn't use Discord with a ten foot pole.
---
That's very awesome
---
TBC is the safest bet. They dont have to do anything and its guaranteed a hit. TBC is the most popular expansion.
---
He has said that if it was 100% guaranteed that 1.13 bonus content was good, he would be for it. But he is traumatized by BfA and doesnt think it is possible, therefore TBC is the easiest safest choice.
---
Then I'd rather they create a new "bank" for clothing only: Maybe a wardrobe located in the inn. That would solve your issue and it would fit reasonably well into the classic philosophy.
---
Certain quest rewards are well worth the effort at the very least, if gear is at all important for you, as well as having reasonable gear when you hit 60.
---
There’s also the atmosphere and storytelling you get from questing, as well as the break in monotony of doing a single action all the way to 60 (subjective of course).
---
Idk, I plan to aoe grind those awkward in between segments after I’ve finished a zone I like but while I’m too low to start the next one that I want. Or just when I feel like it. 
---
Idk if you’ve aoe grinded you’re entire way to 60 before but it can be tiresome, it’s faster than questing for sure but it really doesn’t trivialize the experience and will still take some time.
---
Boredom?
---
thank you, this has been very thourough!
---
tl;dr nothing to see here
---
The knowledge and info is available to anyone, the skills to be a rank 1 player or compete at blizzard are not.
---
Yeah you definitely want a loot council based DKP system and make sure everyone knows that from the start.  Hunter wants a dagger that a rogue needs?  That's too fucking bad and it's not what your (hunter) DKP is for.  The DKP is to take the judgement out of the loot council's choice not taking the judgement out of where the item would go best.  You can just say 'rogues put in a bid for this dagger' and if no rogues put in a bid then you can open it up to the crowd.  You don't want a mindless DKP system that would be so stupid.  Hey that priest had the most DKP so give him TOEP.  Hey that rogue has the most DKP give him that binding.  Hey main tank, we're not going to give you the tanking set piece because this dps warrior thinks it looks cool.  Nope that's not how it works, if you're in a guild where that's how that works you need to get out.  
---
A zero sum DKP system can also solve a lot of the problems you mention about inflation and backdoor agreements but I personally don't prefer it and it's even worse for hoarding.  I prefer DKP that scales up 100 fold each tier.  So if a boss is worth 1 DKP in MC they are worth 100 in BWL, so you are encouraged to spend your dkp before the raid tier ends and it's a soft reset on the next one.  You could alternatively reduce everyone's DKP to 1% of what it was if you like small numbers.  You obviously need to still make running MC worth it though so you wont keep offering only 1 DKP per boss in there.. as an example.
---
Don't discount DKP because you say "the state purpose is to remove human judgement" so obviously we just have to walk into these pitfalls.  There are plenty of ways to avoid it.  Human judgement is still important in setting up the system parameters.  MS &gt; OS.  Need &gt; Desire.  It really helps with a lot of the sour grapes that you get with loot council and adds a fun little metric you can measure to see when/if you'll be getting gear.  
---
There are of course other systems that work too like suicide kings.. they all have their pros and cons you just have to find what works best for your guild.  If you aren't into constantly fielding whispers about why someone didn't get an item or people feeling underappreciated then DKP can be a guild master's best friend.
---
This is close to my plan, though I'm not sure why you split up have 1/5 strength here and 4/5 in focus. 
---
Anyway, this build with a couple changes here and there can easily serve as a healing spec for raids while being fully capable of tanking 5 mans with some def gear.
---
Well if you know the wotf is coming, just start casting another fear right after. That's how pvpers have been doing with cc against trinkets for like 12 years now.
---
They’re not opinions, they’re statements based on user and admin experience.
---
Good one papa, enjoy reading your Saturday morning newspaper tomorrow!
---
You take Imp Blizz 1 at 20 instead of cold snap.
---
Now I gotta go down a YouTube rabbit hole and find this video
---
I think the petition isn't being shared enough. I'm very in favor of RP-PVP and I'm on this sub multiple times a day but I had no idea it existed. It's been signed now though! Really hoping they'll change their minds before August.
---
Having fun while playing a video game -- worth it?
---
My prediction, people asking for post naxx content wont last playing vanilla.
---
Yeah and that's why I am so excited. My only other experience close to this is wrath but I joined too late in that to complete anything
---
I don't need arguments because you convinced me! I am on your side now. There is no way a PC will ever be replaced by newer technology! It's so obvious to me now!
---
My first char was an orc shammy, but I stopped playing him because totems had such small health pools &gt;.&lt;
---
Classic?  This is the most retail BFA wow shit i'v ever seen. Never have i ever seen a horde be a care bear.
---
A big con is that you'll beat your meat so much while leveling that you're end up with chafing.
---
With the right questing route they don't slow you down much, especially if you are lucky with drops + some of the DQuest rewards.
---
I always ran them back in the day because they really helped smooth out the questing so you aren't stuck grinding or doing orange quests at any point.
---
3 month Andy's
---
why do people keep saying 1.13...isnt classic labeled as 1.13?
---
nice rebuttal. really showed me.
---
who hurt you is the biggest, i have nothing left and im gonna act like its the other persons fault that someone im defending is a fucking loser.
---
wanna see something real nice? learn about what soda and his dickhead roommate did to their old editor.
---
Asmongold
---
Do you watch streams? Its incredibly anticlimatic to have 5 minute delay, the streamer will react to comments 5 minute late and vice versa not really an option. But stream snipers can ALSO deal with the consquences, whats wrong with that?
---
Gotta be
---
If you don't do the dungeon quests then move on, glhf.
---
America has the most bizarre culture of celebrity worship. I suppose this is just the next step in that direction, where streamers effectively are the Kardashians of the young, white male demographic. I don't understand it, personally, even as a youngish, white American male.
---
Fury picked up big time during midway/late vanilla but outside of the more serious raiding community there was a common lingering anti-fury sentiment among the average players that I didn't really see go away until TBC.
---
Boss!
---
The rush is I want to MT desperately so I feel like I HAVE to be competitive or I won't get the chance.
---
after wrath comes cata
---
Itll go in order
---
This chief is it
---
Yeah I won't have a pocket rogue and our guild ATM has a severe lack of people picking rogue
---
Gothik :D
---
Literally everything.
---
Reason: In phase 0, people won't have that much money to spend. What good is it to put something up for 100g, if there is no one who can afford it, or is willing to pay that price?
---
That's weird, I thought parody was usually a clever sarcastic imitation instead of a zero effort shitpost.
---
Google" wow private servers" .. everything else is against reddit rules.
---
Requiem here
---
Reddit is more like a mob. Your 3 choices are: The mob ignores you, the mob overwhelms and beats you into a pulp, or the mob celebrates you like a rockstar.
---
"he disagrees with me, must be an old boomer who reads the newspaper"
---
The Stormwind theme immediately started playing in my head when I saw this.
---
meh... people have hour+ videos explaining why classic is better than retail. No point in rehashing.
---
That’ll prob change tbh but ye scholo key is. Big 1
---
I believe it's a 5 minute retention period to stay flagged.
---
No, #NoChanges. 
---
If we start doing seasons years from now sure it’s a neat idea. 
---
But as far as launch 60 will be cap. No question. The blow back they would get would be catastrophic.
---
is fun worth it?
---
Alright, Thanks.
---
Always loved this boss and the orange is a really awesome color!
---
&gt;do you want 6 years of content, with a shrinking player base month after month
---
Guess what, that's the most likely scenario no matter what they choose to do. The idea that they're gonna release Classic and millions of people will play it for years on end is delusional.
---
believe you me, if people like Maza get their way, insults will be a crime.

Sounds kinda like democracy
---
Yes!!! This a million times!!! If I could upvote more than once I'd still be hitting the button!!!
---
I thought I was crazy for preferring the old style of leveling and skills and talent points. So happy to see I'm not the only one!
---
In Diablo 2 I loved the skill points and trees. Planning a build and then working towards completing it with the skill points was my favorite part, fuck upgrading gear, I wanted skill points ;-)
---
My least favorite part of D3 was the change to skills and talent points etc. And when WoW changed the leveling in their game I lost interest quickly!
---
Okay, talking to you is a waste of time, as you decided to replace conversation with rambling.
---
I will not be hearing from you again. But I enjoyed showing you your place.
---
am I supposed to know this automatically or something? why are you assuming everyone watches these asshats?
---
Warmonger. Blue 2-handed sword.
---
Me and my dad played vanilla on a dead server and pretty much just adventured alone/together.
---
I was a paladin, he was a mage. I'd tank/heal us, he'd kill stuff.
---
We were both about mid-40 in leveling and decided I needed a better sword and we looked up that there was a good one in the Eastern Plaguelands.
---
So we saddled up and headed out there, but we were getting our asses kicked by everything. We couldn't even it make it to the quest giver.
---
So in the end, I gave up, but decided to kill one random abomination just to prove we could.
---
And it dropped a blue two-handed sword. Warmonger. My first good two-handed sword since Darkshire gave me Mor'Ladim's.
---
This is a galactic brain post and should be saved by anyone actually trying to play druid
---
'living' in the virtual world has been the dream since Tron
---
I feel like the navy seal copy pasta is now due lol
---
I'm rolling a prot warrior and I really want to MT raids, so I feel like I have to be somewhat competitive or I won't get that chance. 
---
I agree though, leveling was always my absolute favorite part of WoW, in every expansion. And this time I won't be stupid and skip the quest text either!
---
PvP on a PvP server, I am outraged! 🙄
---
This is why you're a turbo nerd. It's all subjective and your definition of outdated is absolutely retarded
---
I’m just looking forward to being a huge troll like I was in classic lol
---
Stop watching streamers. Stop listening to their stupid opinions. Stop discussing them here
---
Ironforge. Coolest city in the game with the best layout.
---
Regarding the conversion of int and ago, I believe that was added in Cata or MoP. Feral has a talent that gives a bonus to Stam/str/int in certain forms.
---
Hello everyone,
---
So when classic WoW comes out I would really like joining up with someone for the leveling process(it is faster right?). Someone who is definitely dedicated. If it is possible I would group with more players, but I don't know if that is actually faster. Anyways, when classic WoW comes out I will have a very flexible schedule ok, so if that is something you are worried about it should not be much of a problem with me.
---
Umm, not sure exactly how much I want to use a quest helper addon yet. I was thinking about only using help if I was actually stuck and I feel like that type of thinking would be even better and more fun with another player.
---
If you are wondering what class/race I am thinking of rolling, well I will probably go for a Warlock. I was never really going to leave the Horde, but this is a fresh start and Ally would be a new experience....we'll see what happens.
---
This video here talks about the best vanilla WoW leveling duos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAfRFzDIRRk

Talk to me, see if we match, excited to get out there :)
---
p.s: Plenty more to talk about in comments/1on1 and before/after we are matched up, such as scheduling, how/where to meet if we are different races, synergistic professions.....quest helper addon....
---
Seems like you are losing it man, I dont understand why are you bringing up well known issue and totally different topic. Its the damage of NPCs being different in PvE, not the damage of players. Just show me the proof, that PvP values and class mechanics are wrong as well, as you said they are. Im truly curious. So far, it seems to me, that you dont have any proof and you made it up, because NPCs were off, then everything must be off!
---
This post was an elaborate ruse to boost staysafe's profile
---
fun
---
or not
---
I don't think a lot of people realize that a majority of end game vanilla WoW was not accessible to a lot of people unless they try harded. Yes they can progress through the content eventually but when a majority are wiping in MC the hard core guilds will be opening the doors to AQ40. 
---
Vanilla WoW isn't like today's WoW where everything was easily accessible to everyone.
---
E.g. when I played vanilla WoW my guild had every world boss on farm and pretty much if we wanted it we would take it before any other guild on the server even has a chance. They would only get it if we didn't care for it because at that point all our members had everything from them.
---
Yup! You are sooo right! Please forgive me though. With so many examples of technology being outmoded over the years, it is an easy mistake to make. I mean, I actually thought that trend would continue! Can you believe it? How could I have been so wrong?!
---
Thanks for showing me my place, friend.
---
And sounds I can taste... Just to keep it going!!
---
If an enemy parries an attack their attack speed increases?  Interesting.  Do players work the same way?
---
I'm not really losing anything actually.  I should have actually ended this conversation a long time ago as I am literally speaking with a child.  
---
Have a good day.
---
Totally agree
---
I don’t think they even mean demand *for RPPVP* servers. They just mean overall. They can’t really hold a poll and not expect a biased result. Just like how most polls on r/classicwow are probably biased in some fashion.
---
I think they’re just waiting for X amount of subscribers, whether that’s 300k or 1M, idk. But they’re trying to be safe about it. Again, I repeat, it’s the wrong way to do it, but I think that’s theyre point of view.
---
Blows my mind, was just wondering if everyone has same weather..
---
Wow this is awesome TY!
---
I loved my vanilla Druid.
---
And since I don’t have the time to lvl a ton of toons im definitely going to roll myself a Druid.
---
Been messing with one a private server for now. 
---
Thanks !
---
The real trick is to be from EU because there are no popular streamers there
---
Well, you proved my point
---
I always thought Stromgarde Keep was Stormgarde. It wasn't until the warfront in BFA that I realized I've been reversing those letter in my head all these years.
---
Like offering to open lock boxes for noobs when you’re a Mage?
---
Same here. Stacked up on coke and amphetamines. Will plow through all the leveling content FAST.
---
Undead Male is the baddest mofo around.
---
=/
---
choice 4: the mods decide the thread you are posting in might offend some of the more, shall we say, "prominent" members of the Classic "community" and lock it
---
In constant flux. Save valuable recipes and other high value items for later.
---
I remember doing an Arathi Basin BG and passing a Paladin at one of the crossroads. He started attacking me so I decided to go ahead and essentially duel him (I know I know "quit fighting on the crossroads"). I must have went through about 4-5 of his health bars and he must have gone through 4-5 of mine before I just decided to run off. There was no way either of us would have ever defeated the other. 
---
Incidentally, I was playing a hybrid "Heart of the Wild" spec intended to be played as healing. I played this in raids and nearly always topped the charts (nearly limitless mana) and in BGs as a flag carrier (was difficult to kill with 1 or 2 on me.....easier with more).
---
Vanilla was not that bad. There would be some spam but there wasn't living memes being thrown out.
---
Yeah imagine if you dropped the gear you were wearing, so people would only ever wear their best gear when they felt really safe, either in numbers or because they were isolated or around lowbies. You'd see a lot more people wearing "of the whale" and shit like that haha
---
So a through non-answer, leaning towards, maybe not. I'm not going to worry over it then. I'm confident we'll get one eventually, if not at launch.
---
that annoyingly unquantifiable thing
---
So C‘thun is not just the eye 😵
---
Aging gamers trying to relive their youth by resurrecting an outdated version of the game? ^^^^/s
---
Legend
---
Vanilla is the only content that we can't do anymore. TBC and on still exist. There's no salient point to a TBC server beyond class meta.
---
Judging people for how they spend their time/PTO is a boomer thing to do. Live and let live
---
Whorelocks take gear that rightfully belongs to mage. Other than that they're decent second best caster dps.
---
tipsout gonna be in jail before launch
---
thanks for the clarification!
---
You'll probably want to put 1 point into Nature's Grasp at level 22 (after 2/2 in Feline Swiftness). Whether you are on a PvP server or not, it is quite powerful for leveling.
---
I like to do 5/5 Furor after that and fill out the rest in Feral until level 40 where you can go 1/30/0 with 5/5 Heart of the Wild. This build lets you do all the things - dps as cat, tank/heal dungeons, and PvP. The rest of the points can go wherever until 60.
---
Oh I'm aware. Pretty soon we'll be living in 1984 and there will be an approved list of words that can be used and everything else is a crime. 
---
And sure, some people are okay with that now. But what happens when they start banning words you use. Next thing you know it's a crime to use any pronouns besides male and female ones. Oh you identify as something else. 10 years in labor camps. I don't agree with a lot of the trans activists, but you should be allowed to call yourself whatever you want. Should I be forced to abide that? No, that's a restriction on me. I should be able to make that choice. But actively trying to reduce everyone's freedoms is an anti American sentiment and should be repulsive to everyone.
---
Ok cool story bro. Your point?
---
True, you could farm up a bit on trash as-well but it severely gimped your dps souldraining. But on progression nights where you wipe on the same boss for hours on end you will need to come well stocked. I think we usually gave the whole raid 1 hearthstone at the start of the night and the yanks at every pull if they had used it on the previous attempt.
---
Of course TBC is the safest bet are you actually retarded?
---
TBC was a very successful expansion with tons of fans, it had higher subscription numbers than vanilla ever had through the entire lifespan. 
---
As for new content, none knows how it will be, it could be fucking amazing it could be shite.
---
So something that is guarenteed success versus something that is not, hmm what is the SAFEST bet
---
Tipsout is irrelevant bro..
---
I wonder when people realise that they can bold or italicise for emphasis instead of resorting to all caps?
---
no
---
Sounds good! Why wouldn't I be ok with that? Can I change it back?
---
Its a terrible experience for both the streamer and the viewers, for example if something happens to the streamer ingame, something funny, he will have to wait 5 minute to finally see peoples reaction, by that time you might have forgotten what are they reacting too. Similiarly, it takes the streamer 5 minutes to react to the viewers comments from the viewers perspective =/
---
Hunters and druids are likely both going to be the least common classes on either faction I think.
---
5Head true genius
---
Yes paladins have very good efficiency as well, and better sustained throughput. The main difference with druids/paladins is druids do have pretty good spirit regen, so they watch 5sec rule and cancel cast to regen mana when needed, whereas pally just literally spams heals the entire fight with downranking, illumination and high mana/5.
---
Every US server
---
Looks like they don't. We would stream so we'd sit next to each other and level together and it would be raining for me and not for her despite us being stood next to each other
---
u wont know until u personally experience it
---
Fire is much more dps for boss fights, aoe damage is on par due to blast wave, but survivability is lower in general. You won’t have resistance issues in five mans at all besides the odd mob here and there. 
---
Upsides; more damage, can front load pyroblast, more buttons to press, bigger numbers and more crits 
---
Downsides: less control, more threat, less survivability
---
Downsides are easily mitigated by not being bad at video games. Go chad spec.
---
Hell yeah I'm going without addons.
---
Modding an MMO doesn't make sense to me. It's a borderline grey area of cheating if you ask me. I get WHY people like them like a different or a better UI, but rather than addons I'd prefer if people advocated Blizzard for a more customizable UI, kind of like in FF14.
---
&gt; In the case of the rank 14 weapons, they will have a roll group that runs BG’s all day and they are able to decide who has the most honor for the week, good luck beating their chosen #1 as a solo player.
---
&gt; This happened in Vanilla on a lot of servers, safe to assume the streamers will be doing the same, and after they rank, the roll group continues with their fanbois.
---
So it's literally the same exact experience?  I mean, I understand that people don't want to be on streamer servers for some reasons, but on my server back in the day both sides had 'celebrities' that gave the server very similar 'streamer' benefit events.
---
Master race, master class. Stun resist - war stopm, got stuns for days beeeesh. Another rogue, boom nature resist poisons and blind. Can hit further so kiting a warrior while in the dead zone and still smacking him. Ez clap.
---
When I leveled mine I went 5/5 spirit tap and disc the rest of the way until 40 where I respecced shadow and then again put the rest into disc. Make sure you get the spirit tap and wand talents
---
Let me preface with I don’t believe blizzard should interfere in any way and I don’t believe that’s what Soda was talking about. That being said the difference between a game of PUBG and WoW is crazy. In many cases of PUBG you had a single data point of someone killing a streamer and that streamer overreacting. In WoW however you would have to have repeated observation of a personal ganking you in multiple places to begin to make the claim. Social blacklisting did exist in Vanilla for a number of reasons and I think he was just suggesting that proven stream snipers get added to that list between him and the other streamers to help each other out. I honestly don’t see it as some crazy “I need streamer privilege thing but more as something more akin to an effective boycott of players that have a history of stream sniping.
---
Lame jump animations though.
---
I disagree with him.  I think druids have a more defined role in BG's, and are more necessary.  Plus stealth and cat move speed lets druids farm professions really easily.
---
There's tons of keys, but the only ones you NEED for endgame prep are the BRD keys (yes, keys), Strat key. Scholo key, UBRS key. Then MC attunement and the Onyxia key. That's it for phase one. Later you'll need the Dire Maul key and the BWL attunement. AQ40 doesn't require a key to use it after it's been opened, so unless you intend to get Scarab Lord don't worry about that. After that, you won't need another key or attunement until Naxx in the final phase.
---
I always wished palas were able to tank back in vanilla. Not because of gameplay because of the lore. They are the defenders of the innocent and the weak and should be able to do this
---
http://www.vanilla-info.com/druid
---
Bear tanks were no joke back in Vanilla, the good bears were badass and out tanked warriors easily...
---
Our main bear tank back in vanilla there towards the end had like 16k health and a crazy ass amount of armor/dodge/crit and his TPS was insane and allowed our DPS to go harder than when the warrior was main tanking.
---
Of course it depended on the bosses, but I remember being blown away by how badass ole Moonhair was back then and he earned his reputation on the server as a badass bear tank.
---
That's nuts!  Seems like the weather was more harsh earlier, seems like it's easier to see now.
---
I guess being blacklisted by or competing with a streamer just isn't on my list of worries
---
No because you will have to kill Rattlegore for the key to open the Viewing Room and idk of a Rogue can lock pick it. There are mobs around the Alch lab anyways so I don’t think you could find a blind spot that will let you make flasks.
---
Whats mtx
---
Meanwhile the upload of the VoD, "Asmongold reacts to Classic World PvP VS BfA world PvP in a nutshell" gets 250,000 views.
---
&gt; and i am so thrilled by the fact everyone gets a shot at whats once was original WoW.   
---
&gt; I truly hope in classic we will have WoW tokens 
---
/thread
---
Thankyou!
---
There’s 7-8 shamans taken in most Raid groups but they’ll want you to be resto. Druids aren’t very needed but they’ll probably take 1-2 of them to the raid. 
---
Enhancement and Feral aren’t in high demand and are pretty underwhelming
---
Addons are like mods, they're fine in Singleplayer games because they only impact the sole player, but MMOs don't exist in a vacuum. Everything you and other players do impact each other. From simple things like the prices of items to the sense of accomplishment you get gear.
---
I love how everyone knows rogue/warrior is the only viable vanilla melee raid dps and everyone's response to that is *but wut i want to play feral/enhance/ret*. It's like the fact that you know it isn't good makes you want to play it so you're a special snowflake defying everyone's expectations.   
---
Well you go for it dude. I'm sure you'll be the world's best enhancement dps/pvper there ever was.
---
depends on ur ability to make friends
---
Invites are over, I got a few messages of my Blizz Employee, that recruitment for Classic is Closed, due the Release already in August. They may open recruitment again for Family &amp; Friends, but doubt. Sadly.
---
I used to like soda but this stream sniping and black listing stuff is making it hard.
---
Tbc is shiet compared to vanilla. It’s the best expansion tho, but the things they added in tbc was shiet: pvp stats(resilience), flying mounts, the world wasn’t relevant, only a few zones.
---
What kind of bullshit principle is that?
---
They artificially fuck up the latency (spellbatching), let every stupid bug in the game and say "well it matches our reference client" and this is the point at which you are sure they should "fix it"? 
---
It's meme level of #nochanges how people like you think they can personally judge what bug is "authentic" and which bugs are an "exploit".
---
Well that's odd
---
Wants vanilla. 
---
Wants wow tokens. 
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
&gt;Just seems kinda sad:(
---
Yes it does, maybe stop posting.
---
me not that kind of orc!
---
Hahaha omg
---
Yeah, bring the world of WARCRAFT to those whining crybabies! If they can't hack PvP WTH are they rolling on those servers?
---
Wait is that DSP?
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
Let's be real, most gamers aren't good designers.
---
This is a facebook mom level meme with a im14andthisisdeep vibe, are we really lowering our standards this much?
---
Lol I said the major streamer one will.
---
haha. That's not very nice, but also quite clever. More power to you if you succeed.
---
Ikr. It would seem like it's just random for each player. Where as prior to streaming and actually sitting next to someone irl and being next to them in game. I had thought the weather was the same for everybody on that particular map
---
&gt;I truly hope in classic we will have WoW tokens, that would be great at keeping all the "chinese farmers" out of the game... and i could play full time classic and still play for free.
---
Nope sorry! Battle farmers isn't solvable - only blizzard can slow it down with banning and wiping the gold people buy.
---
Classic gold will and should be only earned in game... BFA presents the players with an opportunity to buy wow tokens for sub :]
---
You wouldn't understand, being a moron and all.
---
Yes Blizzard is making all new mistakes. You can laugh and say capitalism now, but in 6 to 8 months when the content is run through who do you think is going to be making the decisions for us? Instead of catering to noobs ala bfa we get to experience what its like to cater to streamer culture and watch the game devolve into whatever abomination a few popular streamers decide is good for the game which will be just as bad just in a new and entirely awful way.
---

Yes a basic modder or software programmer likely couldn’t access it, but a hacker/ cyber security person could. That’s our entire job is breaking into encrypted things and code that seems unbreachable, and then re-writing to make it harder to break into again. It’s a form of penetration testing but rather than doing it for the sake of testing, this would be doing it to write a new addon that works with the harder to breach code.
---
I'm grateful that many Classic players won't have to worry about this "avoiding streamers" nonsense.  Streamers won't play on PvE servers.  Problem solved.
---
Engineering by definition cannot be profitable, no rare recipes to craft and sell. Most of thing you make can only be used by other engineers.
---
Alchemy is ok, but again not big on rare recipes so all alchemist are the same. Daily transmutes is kind of the only way to make money.
---
I did the same thing in BC I stopped effectively levelling and went through the whole world discovering every area to reach 70. It's so much fun after the hard part of the grind to get it in a fun way.
---
It's like solidly middle to upper-middle class. Think of your average middle class person; they aren't living paycheck to paycheck, but they also probably wouldn't be able to walk to the nearest car dealership and buy a new car in cash.
---
Are we even looking at the same tweet?  He obviously said there will not be an rppvp server on lauch, just like 2004.
---
Yea don't be confident either way. They are going to base the decision on data that isn't availible yet.
---
Beta definitely has weather effects.
---
That famous Radeon All In Wonder!
---
It was so cool..
---
Unfortunately, that isn't considered griefing. Even corpse camping forever wasn't considered griefing.
---
MMOs don't exist in a vacuum. It's not the same as modding Skyrim. What you do *will* impact others.
---
I’m not using questie. Does that mean nobody should be allowed to? No.
---
Let’s say I was using questie. Should *everybody* be forced into that same experience just because I use it? Also no.
---
What’s hard to understand about that?
---
&gt;I want to lvl a druid but i dont want to be left out at endgame pve and pvp...
---
Feral and enhancement probably the worst 2 specs to go and "not miss out on PvE"
---
Play better specs OR find a guild before classic launches that let's you play either of those specs. 
---
No they are not. People love quoting the blue post but please re read it again, slowly this time
---
there are a few boxes a man can use to ensure his liberty. 
---
soapbox
---
ballet box
---
cartridge box, in that order.
---
Definitely. Part of leveling in Vanilla was the grinding of mobs due to the lack of quests in certain leveling periods. Dungeons helped break of the grind, offered decent gear upgrades, and prepared the players for group end-game content. Enjoy the content with your friends.
---
I had a feeling that was going to be the case with the  leather. I think I read a post recommending that a long while back. Thanks for the reply!
---
Just to reiterate again, that's incorrect and you are dumb for thinking so
---
Think of it this way: want sulfuras? Want devilsaur leather? Shit, Want to make flasks? Yeah have fun competing with the legion of streamer fans camping literally every resource for their lord and savior asmongold.
---
Possibly, but I've seen enough shit-flinging across the aisle in games that DO have all-chat, like Blizzard's Overwatch. Not to mention when my opponents in Heroes of the Storm decide to delay ending the game for an extra 20 seconds to dance or B-Step next to the Hall of Storms, I can only imagine what they'd be doing with the ability to directly communicate.
---
I don't know, maybe I'm jaded, but the people I find myself randomly playing with in modern competitive games are the sorts of people I don't care much to listen to. Even older games like TF2 have seemed to shift more heavily towards this toxic bullshit.
---
top tier troll
---
Bro they have the best animations
---
No you don’t source tanked strat and scholo with force reactive disk. No spike or grenades. Strat and scholo runs go bad because of ass pulls pats or incompetent dps that won’t focus skull and keep cc up.
---
Or you’d have to deposit your gold in the bank and only keep some on you in the world

Ishnu Alah 1:12 And I heard the voice of the Light saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”

---
If you imply that someone using addon, for example Atlas loot addon will somehow magically affect all other players somehow meaningful way you should think again.
---
I agree, only one OCE server.
---
his chat is so pg and boring lol. and his music taste makes me reeee I hate that softboy 2008 alternative
---
No I was just telling you
---
I disagree with you solely based on the ideal that Classic is very much oriented around dealing with an evolving world relatively organically.  By that I mean by groups banding together or doing whatever necessary to overcome challenges.
---
The way I see it:
---
Streaming benefit = Having cronies do your bidding and have an organization around you for help and protection.
---
Streaming downside = Having to use your benefits to counteract potential foul play by the usurpers who feel inclined to do so.
---
Neutrally, Blizzard I believe does have a policy against hyper griefing someone in game and I think that policy should remain as objective to streamers as it is to the common-man(orc).
---
I totally see where you’re coming from and trying to be empathetic towards your fellow human (which we all are, streamers included).  I just think that this is how most people against streamers feel and I wanted to articulate it in a non confrontational way rather than fuel a flame war.
---
I just hope people have seen what he's like out of character. He's actually a pretty caring and genuine person if you check out his non-wow channel, I genuinely believe "asmongold" is just a persona more than anything, but I could be wrong since I dont directly know him. As was said, I think the fan following is far worse than asmon himself, and he's been trying to make his fanbase a bit less toxic from what I've seen.
---
I’m only 30 and had to google what poggers was
---
This sub has gone to shit.
---
Not worth it =/= the kind of attitude you don't need unless you're REALLY concerned about the speed in which you're leveling.
---
You can. I just saved the old command on my desktop that I can revert if I need too. Look through this link to start if you want: https://superuser.com/questions/949385/map-capslock-to-control-in-windows-10
---
If you look through comments, someone will mention how to use a .reg file extension. If you want to use something other than Ctrl, you'll need too find that key's value.
---
TBC was the pinnacle of WoW and the greatest and last bit of WoW being hardcore!
---
WotLK is were WoW peaked, but also where it started to go downhill towards the end as it started to go in the wrong direction and it just kept going downhill ever since.
---
I would be fine with them having TBC only servers and leaving it at that...
---
People who stream snipe enjoy the suffering of others. It gives them happiness. Like killing someone 2-3 times as they res and then leaving alone after. It's the satisfaction of ganking someone + the visual of their suffering. Isn't that why you gank lowbies and attack people in World PVP? You aren't having a /duel. You aren't going /train and then going to stealth as they notice you so they're prepared. You're going to make them suffer for thinking about leaving the safety of a town with less than 2 people with them.  
---
That said, if you don't like the consequences of world pvp, go PVE and just flag yourself when you're ready for it so you can go have fun with it.   
---
To be fair, harassing the streamer by tagging all the enemies in an area around them so they can't farm/level could be worse. Though their fans will feed them like a raid tank with all healers.
---
As long as your group isn't retarded and doesn't take 50 minutes to get there and then randomly afk's for 20 min stretches for smoke break after 1 pull then yes dungeons are very worth it.
---
Go back to twitch kid
---
Ah okay, thank you, I hadn't considered the downside to the stream delay. 
---
Still, I'd say that inconvenience is a good trade off for avoiding stream snipers, and it's always the streamers choice to employ a smaller delay at risk of being less effective.
---
Ran RFC a few days ago and had a hunter outroll me on Chanting Blade as a rogue. "ACTUALLY... I CAN USE THAT!"
---
It's just RFC so who cares but the whole group oof'd in unison.
---
Ehhh. Not really. Pally has to be one of the worst 1v1 classes. Ret has no way to control a fight or its burst DPS (seal of casino, lol). The only thing you really counter are warriors. You absolutely get bent over by any of the "pure" caster classes. The rest is just a game of attrition, which isn't always immediately useful depending on your scenario.
---
Paladins are great healers. Raid heals are great efficiency, if you have direct Mana/5 gear. Spirit won't help you like it does priests.
---
Ret doesn't do much, which is its biggest problem. If you lose to a paladin slowly running at you and auto-attacking, you just aren't good. 
---
Best use in pvp is as a combat healer. You're tough to kill, have bubble, some good blessings in freedom, BoP, and Sacrifice, and efficient heals. Though you may struggle to keep your target up under large burst damage. 
---
Any paladin is most effective in group. Even with Ret is best used as a hybrid with some off heals and blessings.
---
My first toon was an undead priest because I was a cleric in Everquest and loved supporting roles. After getting to 60 and seeing the horde guilds on my server I re rolled as a human mage and power leveled that to 60 with a RL friend so we could join the top alliance guild. Ended up making a lot of good friends and doing all content up through AQ40 with them.

i hope this idiot realizes that whining about getting ganked will just make the gankers come at him harder.
---
its putting fuel on the fire
---
While enhance makes the most sense in terms of totem usage synergy, AGI and WF totems don't come into play until level 40+ or so. I'd also be sharing armor with the hunter, and weapons with the warrior. I made this talent build, aiming for ele/resto.
---
**Full leveling build:**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPDTM3QBkAMw8cA
---
The idea would be to go Ele up to 5/5 Call of Thunder for the 6% crit, and then move into Resto to get 3% hit, +10yds to friendly totems, and 15% reduced threat in the 3rd tier if it seems necessary.
---
**Level 39 would look something like this, and grabbing threat reduction in Resto if needed:**

---
Dwarves, coolest race ever,no contest.
---
I’m looking to go as a priest in classic mainly because I’m not going to be raiding (no time) and want to enjoy the leveling process again.
---
Didn't vanilla have DE gear level restrictions? I remember it existing but not when
---
May your drops be generous, friend
---
I was grounded when wow came out and couldn't play for a week so I read the manual over and over and over and decided on mage
---
You wanna' know how I got these scars?
---
His whole idea of a Cross faction blacklist would be against the ToS due to it being cross faction collusion. Just spam blizzard with his video stating he would be doing cross faction collusion by setting up a cross faction blacklist. Get him banned and then boom he wont have to worry about getting stream sniped.
---
I like my games when they become interactive books! 
---
My fascination with synchronized button pushing started when I was tasked with killing my own father with quick react thing in GoW2x
---
Epic not legendary but yea
---
Albion Online, it used to be the go to game for me, it's now f2p so you can check et, though I stopped... the EvE syndrome got to it too.
---
The idealic gardens of stormwind, built off the backs of laborers and masons that the nobility refused to pay?
---
And when they demanded payment and rebelled, the city pushed them out into the common folks lands. When the farms of westfall started beind raided the nobility offered no assistance and effective raised a middle finger to its subjects? 
---
And then when the resistance became an issue, the nobility dispatched mercenaries to just make the problem go away?
---
Luckily the king has the power to fix things. 
---
Oh wait, you have a child as a puppet king.
---
That's the faction you choose?
---
Lok'tar Ogar bitches.
---
It's a matter of time and how frequently you run some instances and loot leftovers or not. Commitment is much much bigger if you intend to raid on both role .
---
Summoning the raid off a cliff as a warlock 😎
---
I think this time around ppl will take most of the specs raiding just because it is not hard. Just keep in mind, everyone is carrying you since it is very expensive to actually be competitive as a hybrid.
---
With that in mind you can make ur decision.
---
Wont lie, if I somehow end up on a streamers realm I will just reroll unless i get over lvl 25.
---
Then again we might see a influx of streamers come Classic
---
Really hope you enjoy this latest episode :) It's been a while since the last one, so I hope this makes up for the hiatus! Really enjoyed making this one and was definitely surprised to discover the link with those alliance zones!!
---
Also he can still see, it's just magic fire sight.
---
If you want to parade around going "Lol you clearly can't refute my argument get REKT retard" as you just did, yes you pretty much do need to actually make your "irrefuteable argument."
---
I personally want BC after classic vanilla content.
---
You had next to no chance of being r14 solo regardless.. I knew of 1 person to achieve it after all of our Alliance premades server xferred to Tichondrius or Gorgonnash (if I recall) at the end of Vanilla.. it was a Rogue known for being terrible and always using his Crossbow in the middle of WSG never being stealthed, but was online literally unimaginable amount of hours - we assumed his kids played the account while he wasn't around and just spammed BGs.
---
Not WPVP related, but AV feels like it's gone exactly the same way. Back in the day, I remember it being this massive war with about 70% of the people brawling it out on the frontlines and the rest either trying to sneak a cap or just off dicking around somewhere, not knowing what to do. Usually, you popped into an exiting game, but on those rare occasions that you'd get a new game, you got to experience this epic cinematic clash on the frozen lake before everything went chaotic. 
---
And then around TBC sometime, the meta completely changed to everyone just running past each other and speed-capping the objectives. It was honestly such a bizarre experience coming back after a long hiatus; we're all mounted up, charging the enemy FOR THE HORDE; they appear around the corner of Balinda's fortress; we're about to clash, fucking ride of the Rohirrim style; my heart is pumping, and then *whooosh* everyone just runs past each other.
---
I'm just standing there like "waa happen?" And then a priest yells at me for dismounting one of theirs and creating a small skirmish, delaying the farm for everyone. Crickets.
---
People hated it but I absolutely loved loved loved warlock tier 3.
---
You are part right in what you’re saying. While they may not be “friends” per se, streamers and high level PvPers do have a high level of respect for one another. The idea that he is proposing is that the high tier Alli players punish/blacklist the Alli stream snipers camping the Horde players and the high tier Horde players punish/blacklist the Horde stream snipers camping the Alli players.
---
Aint nothing wrong with that.
---
I did the same back on my first character, didn't knew where to go and what to do, so I ended up grinding mobs till level 60. It took me way over 10 days /played and I think you'll safe time with questing.
---
Nope, a lot of that info is in pserver guild discord’s and other esoteric places. Go look up the firelock spec, and the requirements to get it around 2k dps. That isn’t there, it’s on theorycraft discords and super small time YouTube channels. People like me and many others have google docs with info we may or may not want given to everybody.
---
The skill cap is lower in classic in many cases, it makes the large amount of hidden knowledge that more valuable
---
I love anything with Swanson +1
---
Hunter weapon, most definitely.
---
I'm not sure blizzard would ban him. The way they act about these guys anymore is pretty concerning.
---
Some people in the forum megathread are already planning to take over a pvp server if it’s the last option. I’d say keep a lookout near release time.
---
idek what that is :)
---
&gt; just to ruin everything he is trying to do
---
Thats funny. When I was on a wow PvP server getting ganked all the time I figured the goal was to ruin everything I was trying to do too. Course I'm not a youtube famous entitled man baby with a following so yeah. The streamers can always roll PvE when Classic goes live, I would strongly suggest they do. Sodapoppin and his ilk just put a huuuuge target on their backs with this cryin. They will be hunted down without mercy when the live game drops. A new form of PvP just emerged...ganking famous youtubers for shits and grins LOL
---
OP is Omar al-Bashir.
---
We are playing Classic so the old ToS should apply. [https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8) Cross Faction Collusion like this would be a bannable offense. Just report him and get him banned. No more need to worry about getting stream sniped.
---
Lol, yup the models are still there so the game still exists!! With this logic vanilla still exists because i can just watch joana's 1-60 on repeat right?
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
The BC continent is there but the content isn’t experienced nearly the same way it used to be.
---
"To be clear, we have no philosophical opposition to setting up a Classic RP-PvP server. But our priority is making sure servers have long-term healthy populations, so we'll start with lean realmlists and expand as needed, just as the 2004 launch did."
---
What he says:
---
Not against the idea.
---
Priority is to set up servers with healthy populations and ratios.
---
Will expand as needed, try to keep things lean until they need more room, just like 2004.
---
He doesn't confirm or deny that they will have one at launch or add one later. Just rambles on about their philosophy about how they intend to handle the launch. Obviously leaning towards probably getting one later than sooner, but does not confirm or deny anything.
---
So we'll see. He has acknowledged the demand for it, at the very least. Personally, I'm confident we'll get one and it wouldn't surprise me if we get one at launch.
---
 Cheap shot, hey? Wish I knew we had that ability. Not worthwhile to swap to cat? Moonfire spam?
---
Give this guy the award for talking out of his ass.
---
Surprised there was no Springsteens in JoJos Bizarre Adventure, honestly.
---
That’s why I really like FFXIVs UI. Mostly everything is there, and there are no allowed addons. Using DPS meters is bannable. Usually people do so just to track their own.
---
If your group only runs each dungeon once for all of the quests, I wouldnt expect it to be an overall net loss for getting 60 in first two weeks. If you're group has no quests for the dungeon, then it could be a net loss. Grinding dungeons is up for debate for efficiency. Dungeons aren't always worth it if you're solo, mainly because PUGs can be time consuming. If you're on a pvp server, then the dungeon option becomes a bit better too.
---
As a 5man group, you'll have no wait times for finding groups and no shitty randos causing delays. Also being able to smoothly get that dungeon gear can really help since questing doesnt give great rewards. It's typical that when solely relying off of non dungeon quests you'll run into pretty long gaps where you dont get upgrades, and often those upgrades aren't anything impressive. Getting a solid dungeon gear piece can sit in a slot for 10 levels until you get a quest reward to replace.
---
They also help fill some of the harder quest gaps that a 5 man will run into, such as kill + collect quests during launch week.
---
Tough choice there
---
The only downside to streamer servers i see is possibilty of getting corpse camped for life because some whiny brat told his mindless legions of trash to do it.
---
Absolutely no salt there,i personally dont care about streamers and their bs but forementioned scenario could ruin ones gameplay significantly
---
Play on a PvE server if you want 100% streamer avoidance.
---
Probably just add "New" to the old server names...
---
If it makes you feel better think of them as being employed by blizzard's marketing department
---
I wouldn’t even limit it their. I would say that someone could camp/stream snipe all they want but then they can’t turn around and bitch with their social credentials are gone. I think the game would be better without stream sniping but it’s gonna happen so just like streamers have to deal with downsides so do the snipers.
---
With a large enough outcry and enough reports I would be surprised if he didn't receive some sort of reprimanding.
---
If that is actually the case, and until I see the application I will assume it's not, then that guild isn't gonna go anywhere in Classic anyway.
---
Classic will most likely have the same issue as back then, certain classes need to fullfill certain roles.
---
Shambulance was a common name, wondering why... the most guilds wanted them to be healing specced.
---
A druid...
---
Thats a different story, druids can play all 3 specs... and still be wanted... and if i remeber well, Boomkins where lethal as F#$% :)
---
But count on the fact that most of the time, a certain class needs to be a certain spec... nowdays most is balanced, wasn't the case back then.
---
You see i am gonna play a HUNTER, why... so OP in vanilla, thats why :)
---
im like 99% sure he was trolling about the stream sniping and blacklisting
---
If people are willing to pay extra to help a streamer out then they deserv to get scammed
---
He also said he agrees with Soda and I would guess most other streamer will to once they see what he was actually saying ie a social blacklist not a blizzard ban hammer.
---
It wasn’t originally but added in a patch that is earlier than the classic wow code.
---
Yeah Furor is not good at all for levelling. It's only real use is for pvp so you can charge on shift. For actual questing/grinding you always heal straight after killing a mob and then shift back to cat, so you will be at 100 energy by the time you get to the next mob and you only shift once every 4-5 mobs anyway so furor is a huge waste of 5 points.    
---
It is 'nice' but it's is definitely not the optimal levelling spec. The faster you get the good talents in feral the better leveller you will be.
---
She looks fierce
---
Illidan horde is an example of a server that did not have any PVP celebrities anywhere near the level of streamers or an organized honor group.  So no.
---
I assume using the AH won’t be worth the effort and cost for the first month or so. It will be so flooded with the same gathering items they will barely be more than what a vendor would buy them for. I plan to just vendor everything and save any gathering items needed for later crafting. If I get any rare drops I’ll hold them for a few months
---
You are honestly part of the misinformation continuously spouted on this sub. Viable =/= optimal. Feral DPS is viable in both raids and five man. Are you topping the damage meters? No. But if played well, like most classes, you are benefiting the group. Additionally, OP could role a DPS/Tank hybrid spec and tank most of the content in classic. 
---
Nobody is trying to be a special snowflake, they just want to experience endgame as a class they enjoy (in whatever capacity that may be). This guy obviously isn't going to be part of a top tier raiding guild if he is asking this question, so he can play what he wants.
---
Haven't played wow in a while, what does this mean
---
This is so fucking sad and true. Spark my ass and call me rich
---
&gt;this  
---
&gt;[th is]    
---
&gt;1.    
---
&gt;*(used to indicate a person, thing, idea, state, event, time, remark, etc., as present, near, just mentioned or pointed out, supposed to be understood, or by way of emphasis):    e.g **This is my coat.**
---
The first 10-15 players to rank 14 on illidan horde were solo players.
---
Probably the best thing about the Classic Beta is that it has completely eliminated any curiosity I ever had about watching streams.
---
Dont worry if you just play the game you will be gucci
---
I always say yes.
---
Stat stick or no. They contributed, they were there, they have just as much right to roll on it as anyone else who can use.
---
Blizzard is going to do whatever they are going to do. If we understand that then we can attempt to guesstimate what the best options are. In reality, I do not see Blizzard hiring an entire team to develop new content for a 15 year old game. I think it is much more likely that they apply the same treatment to TBC that they did to Vanilla and call it a day. How they will handle servers and character migration to the new expansion is literally impossible to say so no point in talking about it. 
---
This is of course just my opinion and is in no way supposed to be depicted as fact
---
Maybe the only items worth putting On the AH will be cloth due to bags and first aid being something every class needs
---
The game does not exist to facilitate streamers. It’s fine if Soda wants to band together with streamers to make a black list. It just makes him look entitled and makes me want to band together with others to make sure we’re on that list and to make Soda the end game boss. 
---
Yes, I watch streams. Sometimes, stream sniping is part of it and sometimes lolcow streamers react poorly to it and the drama can be entertaining. Sometimes streamers are not total twats and roll with it and it has the potential to be good fun with PvP. It’s not like the streamers are going to be lacking hangers on sadly following them around everywhere. They are a billboard that says “World PvP here 24/7”. If they don’t want to deal with that, Blizz created an option just for this...it’s called PvE servers. You can flag PvP when you want and avoid tanking when you don’t. The problem is Soda insisting on rolling PvP and also not having to deal with World PvP. Stream sniping is fair game and so is camping. So he either whines like a bitch or he and his followers engage in World PvP or he rolls PvE. The idea of trying to be vindictive to collide with the opposing faction on a PvP server to try to punish people on a *PVP* server for engaging in gasp PvP is childish at best.
---
Yes, that's exactly what hes doubting, and with good reason.
---
And you didn't raid in Vanilla, not seriously anyways. If you did, you would know that mechanical prowess doesn't matter at all, and you wouldn't be carrying around your worthless parses like some kind of dumb trophy.
---
The server is going to be high pop or full, so potential queue. I don't mind high pop but I don't want it inflated by viewers trying to follow their favorite streamer. Zones should be less congested.
---
Holy fuck your literally the abomination of retardation
---
Paladins do have incredible efficiency with Illumination - However, the Heart of the Wild talent gives Druids an extremely high mana pool (highest in the game maybe?) for both healing efficiency *and* dispels since we don't have Poison Cleansing Totem on Alliance.
---
Thanks for the non answer mate.
---
Seriously. I feel the same way with the streamer posts. I’m over it.
---
And we have every right to mock you for judging people about something so insignificant
---
Its the in game increased foilage
---
And then geforcw tweaking settings
---
Ahhh the nostalgia! It’s pretty awesome scrolling through the front page and seeing this. I’m the other person in the party and I took my own screenshot of this epic moment!  
---
Proof: http://i.imgur.com/hTsIho0.jpg
---
I wonder if they changed the helm because it is similar to the pvp set helm for paladins/warriors.
---
Agreed, female UD casting animations are the best in my opinion
---
He literally would have won the Horde pvp tournament had he not gotten feared out of the dueling area right after popping two massive cd’s. Also I’m not even a soda fanboy was watching from tipsout once I heard there was a tourney.
---
If you dont start your own guild you likely wont MT
---
I haven’t hear it. What is it about?
---
Leveling
---
After the stress test, you can only play for the next 24 hours, then it's removed. Unless you're in the beta.
---
👍👍👍👍👍
---
You mind control one of the first mobs in ubrs and use it to give 83 ??? Fire Resist to your whole raid. Its not the values, its game knowledge.
---
Cloth...you mean the stuff that naturally drops in abundance for everyone during the normal process of leveling? :D
---
Any mage. Most of my time played I mained a dk and even with death grip it was annoying closing in on them, idk how it will be in classic but I probably won’t look forward to it
---
How many seats did the school bus you rode growing up have?
---
You mind control one of the first mobs in ubrs and use it to give 83 ??? Fire Resist to your whole raid. Its not the values, its game knowledge
---
Paladin vs Druid sounds like a wet noodle fight LOL
---
Granted, but at least we can still do it. They wiped Vanilla off the face of the map with Cata.
---
The only other broken thing, in my opinion, that needs to be brought back, would be the ability to use the old models that they broke with the new animations.
---
No one lol
---
You aren't playing this game right if you dont act autistic
---
On that last bit, solo farming devilsaur will likely be quite hard. 
---
 There is a lucrative cartel meta that developed on private servers generally called the devilsaur mafia.  
---
This was a form of cross faction collusion, where several members of each faction that patrolled Un'Goro basically 24hrs a day.  The mafia is based on an agreement to not harass each other, to split up the spawns so each side got equal share, and finally to attack any competition of the opposing faction.  So any solo farmer will likely get ganked by a 5man group and corpse camped until they leave the zone.  
---
This is profittable because it allows a small group maybe only 20 to 30 players total to control the rate of sell and sales price of devilsaur leather, which is in super high demand in early raiding.  
---
Some people think the mafia won't exist on classic as that level of cross faction coordination might start to cross into ToS territory, but I suspect it will even if it is less organized.  The demand for devilsaur leather means early on there will be chaos of tons and tons of players trying to fight for taps and eventually only groups will be able to farm spawns.  It would be only natural for efficiency for the largest horde and largest alliance groups to avoid each other and prey on uncontested or only solo player contested spawns.
---
Happy Cake day
---
That usually happens when you are being an asshole first, repeatedly ganking someones alt, lower than you, who shows no interest in fighting. 
---
I corpse camped some retards for hours/until they log out myself on my rogue, but you had to really piss me off for me to actually bother spending like 15 mins travelling to booty bay or something similar from IF.
---
Confirmed, they aren't bending over backwards like private servers do, a lot of stuff is thing to start as 1.12.
---
I’m taking a week off don’t care if I’m judged for it. I live my life my wat lol. Enjoy your trolling.
---
There is a mind controllable mob in ubrs that gives an hour long 83 fire resist buff to your whole raid. The rest of FR can be made from prebis you get pretty easily and BoE greens.
---
Lol right?  It’s like the game they actually wanted to play is 1.14 and it won’t be out for a few more years. Will be interesting once they realize that.
---
Uh, no?
---
BC content still exists. Vanilla content doesn't. You can still experience the story of BC firsthand, but not Vanilla.
---
Granted, it doesn't have the same metagame, but the quests are still there.
---
WANDS. Specifically with plus damage or healing. Those sell for a fortune.
---
It is enough, on paper. But it's more complicated that this. Blizzard profits are directly related to they company value, because they are listed on the stock market.
---
They pulled in $100 million/month at the end of Vanilla.$150 million/month at the end of TBC.$180 million/month at the end of Wrath...now, they are pulling $20 million or less a month.
---
That (among other things) is what led to their shares being hammered in the last 12 months, as a company, they lost half of their market value.
---
Blizzard is a MAMMOTH compared to Square Enix. They have over 9,000 employees. Square Enix is making AMAZING profit with 1 million subs, more than they ever had.
---
Blizzard is making 5 times less with WoW today than in Vanilla, and 9 times less than they did in Wrath.
---
I hope you understand the differences between a small company like Square Enix and Blizzard. Profit is profit...but it is seen differently when investors are involved, the company is listed on the stock market and it's among the biggest ones world wide, in gaming.
---
Get home, make a character, and wait for 6pm EST on Monday the 26th.  Take off work the next day and play from 6pm Monday to 9 or 10pm Tuesday which should put me at around level 20.  Then just try to go to work early for the next few days so I can get out and play at night.  The first weekend I'll play both days the entire day.  After the first week (Monday 26th to Sunday 1st) I'll just play when I get time.  I should be level 30 at least with nearly 3 days /played in the first week.  Then I can just take my time and rejoin society to get to 60 over the next month and a half. 
---
The fun really begins at level 20 and ramps up until level 30.  The week after I'll be running SM a lot to get gear and stay out of STV until around Thursday because I have off work the Friday after launch.  I will do all of STV on Thursday night when most people are sleeping.  I'll also begin farming professions (mainly fishing) to ensure I can get my mount at level 40 which should be between the 15th and the 22nd of September.
---
Getting the mount speeds it up a lot and also I can run some dungeons like RFD, Uldaman, and ZF to break it up.
---
I feel like people have lost the ability to not pay attention to the things they do not like.
---
Yep druid is by far the worst
---
Triggered
---
4/5 spiritual focus is enoguh to get 100% immune to pushback delays, when you take 2/3 improved Conc aura in the prot tree.  So you have that leftover point, and 1/5 divine Str is usually the best option. 
---
Improved SoR looks good, but it only buffs the 'default' version of the spell and not from your +spellpower, so it ends up only buffing the damage of SoR by literally a handful of points (depending on weap speed) so it's pretty underwhelming.  If you're going for a strict PVE Tank build it's more valuable because RF boosts its threat, but otherwise it really isn't enough damage (compared to divine str) to be viable in PVP settings.
---
In Vanilla wow I did raids as 31 ret 20 holy and we cleared up to Cthune in an alliance guild that also had a boomkin and multiple MS warriors.  Our guild was able to do a few bosses in Naxx as well.  I would say we were semi hardcore at the time.
---
My good friend played on Bloodscalp Server and was a 30ret20 holy Scarab Lord with fist of Rag.  He was only an officer in the guild.
---
Square Enix is not a small company, dude.

He’s just being a hypocritical bitch boy is all.
---
Didn’t say it would make a ton, lol, just that everyone will need it. I can’t see people spending money on herbs or ore for crafting this early on, but cloth? Yeah everyone wants bags and bandages
---
I've played beta and pservers and usually share weather effects with people around me
---
Someone else going Undead Female priest? :)
---
Neither the warrior or hunter have any downtime. Elemental shaman has the most downtime among all casters. And have absolutely no regen. Yes you don't compete on gear but you also slow down the party. 
---
As a 3 man you don't really need enhance gear to DPS, and all resto gear is urs anyways. With WF in the mid 30s warrior is likely to go dual wield instead of twohander. 
---
Keep in mind as a 3 DPS mobs will die fast, most of the time will be spent looking for mobs and traveling from place to place. 
---
Priest offers absolutely no DPS increase and does not benefit from warr battle shout.
---
looks nice
---
'My experience was different so that means your experience was the same'.  Lol ok dude.  I'm just saying for some people it's literally the exact same thing.  Which it will be this time around too.  Some servers will have celebs and some won't.
---
One of Blizzard's hidden dicks.  Keep an eye out for these, they're probably everywhere.
---
I will be joining the RPPVP server if it exists!
---
 Vanila doesn't  have titan panel mode ...
---
Funny how some streamers think blacklisting campers/stream snipers will do anything. There are plenty of us and we can just ban together to get our shit done xD
---
Yay strength weapons for hunters as participation awards!  
---
Might as well roll need on daggers as I tank because I can right?
---
&gt;Leveling as prot is a punishment that nobody should ever put themselves through.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Work is wonky, 4 days on 4 days off with schedules changing due to different projects popping up, I'm just hoping it lands in the 4 off and if not, whatever, the game wasn't meant to be crushed in 4 days.
---
I guarantee the big streamers get to reserve their names days before it's available to everyone else to prevent number 3.
---
Yeah fill me in
---
Let’s be honest, you’ll still have to whisper healers addon or no. I remember receiving whispers multiple times and hour in TBC, patches after the LFG tool was integrated.
---
lol what how are they the same thing? its like in cs when your friend team kills you as a joke and you have a laugh about it on the other hand is random guy teamkilling you over and over just to get noticed. How are you not able to differentiate these 2 situations?
---
Gathering professions didn’t used to give exp right?
---
Madman
---
It is.
---
:D
---
I’m not up to speed on classic rotations, but how many dps specs have hard rotations as opposed to priority systems? WA was invaluable for me as a shadow priest in legion. It never really told me “okay press this now”, but just gave me much more detailed information on things. Especially when surrender to madness was a must-take talent, there was just too much going on at once to track via the default UI.
---
Dwarves are master race. You are making great choice!
---
Priests  get more mana back from innervate - they literally have a better formula for how much mana they get from spirit, and their gear tends to have more spirit on it.    
---
In addition they have prayer of healing and flash heal that are for more useful ways of burning mana for healing than a druid casting regrowths/rejuvs.  
---
So yeah, spend your innervate how you want, but don't pretend casting it on a druid is just as good as casting it on a priest - it's not.
---
If I remember right you could fix up a script that would target highlighted item, exit shift, cast spell, enter shift
---
Corpse camping isn't, but stalking is. If a single person follows a streamer around CC'ing them all day, that's definitely harassment.
---
Corpse camping is a case where you always have the option of resurrecting at the Spirit Healer and then going to a different area.
---
its the us realms emerald dream and wyrmrest accord believe
---
also argent dawn eu is the best realm
---
I love this guy!
---
Lol I get so much PTO that I almost never manage to use it all. Might as well burn some on a once in a lifetime thing like this.
---
I can't believe there's people that actually think this game has 1.3 million subscribers in an expansion that isn't even as half as bad as the content drough during WoD, which still maintained a shit load. You guys are fucking insane and want to see the bad numbers so you can justify the BfA hate. Just enjoy classic, why do you keep looking into data to support the 'BFA TRASH' argument? There's millions on there still enjoying it, enjoying the lore and the content. Fuck me man, you guys make me semi-depressed by just opening this sub.
---
I wanted to tank.
---
Started with a Paladin because I always enjoyed that class in AD&amp;D. Wasn’t good for tanking though, at least not for newbie me.
---
Switched to warrior. And will be warrior again as I still want to tank.
---
Iirc the PvP set bonus increased cat/bear/travel form speed. What is the maximum movement speed a Druid can achieve?
---
What in the prot tree would help you kill rag or survive him? You get the good early prot talents in a fury prot spec. Literally none of those talents help you at all.
---
Reputation (bigger discounts on your purchases)
---
Gear (some of which is pre BiS)
---
Easy exp. If you grind to and from quest destinations,  then quests are just bonus xp.
---
If you go back and do the quests after 60, then the xp gets turned into cash instead.
---
However the rep is dimished on grey/gray quests.
---
How would that list look like for backstab build? (Leveling with a group of friends)
---
Nothing much. The initial goal of a lot of people will be to level fast and find a raiding guild.  Questing will be the laid back experience people have while leveling alts.
---
Awkwardly this is 100% true although I'd word it different lol.
---
Yes, that stat stick yo! 
---
:p
---
I think it's as much about peoples' attitude and expectations as it is the game.
---
From what I've seen on this sub, a lot of people are going in with a mindset of playing a very social game. And if that's the case, heck yeah it's gonna be social. Because those people, myself included, will be forthcoming with in-game communication.
---
Quality meme sir
---
Gtfo
---
It’s like the Wall of No 2.0
---
Threat usually isn't an issue for a paladin. It all boils down to not having enough mana to keep up said threat. There are some neat guides out there for peolpe who wants to give it a shot. Just google it.
---
top tier ? this is not bfa, in classic there is only 1 mode of an instance.
---
Yea ppl play this game pretty hardcore, esp on release.
---
lmao what
---
Mind Control a mage and have them buff you with Int before you buff them with Fort.
---
Paladins can breeze through every 5-10 man while tanking as long as the DPS aren't in T2+
---
Asmond has been hitting 20-30k viewers regularly throughout Classic.
---
His fans will easily, EASILY brute-force anything he tries to do to keep himself hidden. Imagine having thousands of stalkers with nothing better to do than to find out where you live.
---
What now?
---
I got a few messages from my blizard employees that the recruitment for classic is closed due ot it releasing prety soon in Augutso.  They may open it agian but for meow its closed sadly doubt it sad!
---
Pro strats, you know.
---
31/13/7 tanky shockadin. Full holy spec for raid healing, and then for PvP and solo grinding I get Imp Judgement, Precision, and the shield prot talents for tankiness. Swap out the raid-healing set for a spell damage set and melt faces with 1200+ Holy Shock crits.
---
The gif labels a warrior and a pally.
---
You think the reaction shown in the gif would be if the hunter asked to roll on an agility based weapon?
---
Kinda obvious what is implied here.
---
"a bunch of idiots" 
---
I've been playing for 15 years, 1/2 of being good at this game is being able to sniff out and avoid the above mentioned people. 
---
I have no illusions as to how bad your average player is, that also has no impact on what I determine to be the minimum skill level worth playing with.
---
Its why I join guilds: so that I never wipe to Geddon bomb.
---
The 1.12 patch only makes leveling easier.
---
If a critical mass of people start using a LFG addon and you cannot find a group without it, than it sorta does force your hand
---
Although I don’t think that will happen with LFG. Way too many people dislike the LFG system for a critical mass of people to start using the addon
---
I am not particularly familiar with Vanilla raid mechanics. Are poison dispels a big deal in raids? I am aware that curses certainly can be.
---
and people wonder why streamers are hated
---
Truth.
---
Mine once got this bear at Goldshire Inn ... it turned out to be a druid, so all good ;)
---
People play 16 hrs a day for months to get rank 14. They will do it in classic.
---
Warlock by far. People that are saying mage aren't accounting for worldbuffs and just how much crit you get in naxx/aq gear. Also, by pure calculation 2% crit averages to 28SP therefore the 33SP takes the lead with or without world buffs.
---
What a douche
---
I can’t believe there is no RP-PvP slated for classic launch. It’s the best server type!
---
*- More Immersive from others RP’ing around you, even if you don’t partake.*
---
*- More open world PvP in unique areas in the world, because people are more focused on being a part of the world, over just the most efficient grind paths to power.*
---
*- Better community.*
---
Really, really hoping they are going to give us one… If the pop is low, I’d rather take a merge later down the line then have to abandon my current guild to go to a new server, as said previously in this thread. Not sure how they are overlooking this aspect.
---
I mean… other than just adding another server with “RP” in front of it, has to take minimal effort, no?
---
It's kinda funny that anyone thinks spergs reeeing on reddit will lead to streamers getting banned.
---
BAS and SAB.  Fun guy.
---
Couldn't agree more. I have no problem with wow streamers at all and I think they are over all great for the game but ensuring that I am not on the same server as any of them is going to be the deciding factor for choosing my new home on August 27th (or September 20th when I can actually find enough cactus apples to get out of the starting zone after the initial rush).
---
total shit show, I'm not gonna attempt to do any serious auctioning for months
---
He has been banned many times on stream back in the day
---
Isn't  Sodapoppin the same asswhole that wasted a GM's time for lulz while people with real issued waited
---
I watch a ton of content videos and guides etc, but I can’t understand why people watch others just play the game? A cool clip occasionally? Sure. But just watch them play and drone on? I don’t get it. Seriously can someone elaborate? I’m not being a dick, is it like listening to a podcast or something? What is the draw is streamers?
---
You obviously give a fuck.
---
They arent doing that. He made that up. This would make rag harder to tank not easier as wearing full FR gear wouldnt mitigate his physical dmg well.
---
You should have continued reading. I didn't mention anything about raid difficulty. Top tier raiding guild. The guilds that min/max everything and go for "world firsts" or speed runs.
---
What an incredibly stupid thread. Activision is a publicly traded company. Go look at their earnings reports. They made $344M in revenue on Blizzard products in Q1 FY19 with 32M monthly active users. https://investor.activision.com/static-files/ec7dd3c9-06e6-4e91-a973-400fa351bd77
---
Shit the line waiting to gank this loser will be a mile long LOL
---
information received
---
Of course it did, are you trolling? Titan panel was the epitome of vanilla wow.
---
Would it be a dick move to roll on a gun/bow over a hunter? I mean, I need it for optimal ranged pulls.
---
..why's that?
---
Rag does only fire dmg on private server. If he did physical then it would be harder since you wouldnt be able to wear pure fire resist gear. Ypu clearly dont have a fucking clue what you are talking about.
---
I've only logged into BFA once since getting into the beta, and it was like drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth.
---
sure, but rank 1 glad doesn't have the same weight in diff seasons.
---
in TBC/WOTLK, you're **NOT** going to get carried to rank 1 glad. period.
---
In the expansions after, it becomes more feasible because more good people stop playing and the game became easier and easier.
---
It would be cool if we can switch the /dance
---
Here's some good studying material to read before Release, ty for the post and work put into it!
---
If you think gankers have numbers over a streamer who will be getting 50k+ viewers every day at launch, I think you're mistaken. It's just going to mean he'll have an army of subs protecting him.
---
If you're really that upset about what he said, then stop playing into it. You're just going to make it worse.
---
It's pretty obvious that he was. This sub is desperate for drama.
---
Freaking Titan bars
---
&gt; You cant prove they were streamsniping, you can only prove they were griefing, which is Blizzard's responsibility to handle. Soda is a well known crybaby. Whether or not he gets targeted, he overreacts and that makes me unable to support a blacklist that utilizes cross-faction collusion to that degree.
---
The only power that he will have is with opposing faction streamer friends who might indulge his ego mania. The sky isn't falling because he want some mythical blacklist that will never be fully realized.
---
In small case in point. A few auction house mods let you view price per units and stack amounts, sorted by lowest.
---
So those mofos who instead of putting up 5 stacks of 20 Silk, decides to put up 100 individual single stacks, are basically flooding and slowing down the buyer experience, due to the ease of automating the process of posting 100 single stacks with the click of a button. If I needed to, the mod could let me more easily buy all those single stacks, without worrying that I am overspending or buy the wrong over priced one.
---
Now the buyer AND seller experience for those with the mod is vastly different for a modless auction house user, who has to search page after page, manually calculate best unit price, and if they decided to post 100 single stacks, doing it by hand at a rate of 5 seconds per stack, while a mod can do it in 2 clicks.
---
It's like theres two layers in that part of the game. The power sellers and buyers, and the normal users and buyers. The problem being that the modless user are at a vast disadvantage, and often underprice items due to lack of information and useability of the default AH experience.
---
The sniping, yes... hes just fucking around being stupid. The Blacklisting, no... he was 100% serious
---
You kinda missed the point, it has nothing to do with it being 'hard' it is simply tedious.
---
If you start in SW, without a portal, with perfect boat timing it takes nearly 20 minutes start to finish to get to Ony.
---
Compare that to horde starting in Org and it's about 6.5~7m.
---
Huge difference.
---
That's basically his shtick. He doesn't pander to the chat and desperately hope everyone likes him. He's not worried about offending people. He doesn't pretend he's always happy and optimistic and everything is awesome. He says what he's thinking.   
---
I mean if you don't like that fair enough, but it's not easy to see why he's popular. There are plenty of streamers that are all happy fake smiles and politeness if that's what you're after.
---
That he's an idiot chud lol did he slam your head on his moldy ass desk too?
---
This is so ruthless and I love it.
---
if BC comes out it will be in 2 years  after release or so...
---
Hey man I’m telling you it gets a lot of hate on here, but I did th exact same thing as you. Two weeks ago resubbed and started playing a 113 warlock. Got to 120 really enjoyed the story so far. I’ve played at least 5 hours every single day. I am having a blast! Just started raiding this week with a guild I joined when I started up again. It’s a blast my man just gotta enjoy it for what it is and not let the haters ruin it for you! Enjoy and hope to see you on the battlefield!
---
I was really proud of doing Heroic LK before the nerfs &gt;.&gt;
---
Tokens would ruin wow's economy and vanilla was when it was at its best.  Earning any epic mount becomes a meaningless achievement when you can just buy the gold.
---
The trouble is this subreddit is filled with people who are die hard lovers of vanilla wow and only want to play vanilla or a vanilla like experience, but also lots of people who love the idea of going back to the "golden era" of WoW (Vanilla-WOTLK). Come time for classic to end there is going to be a sort of civil war because as of now both parties are supporting the same cause, to have a gret Classic WoW experience, but ultimately many people are going to want to move to TBC. I think a lot of the die hard Vanilla people on this reddit just assume everyone here in support of Classic only wants Vanilla forever, reality will turn to be a bit different.
---
Still though Classic hasnt even started its far to early to determine anything at this point.
---
It's all about the journey. Ever wonder what a lvl 40 capped meta looks like?
---
AOE pally tanking for leveling not dungeons is actually pretty fun to me
---
I mean.. haven't we all?
---
I would have killed the priest after he buffed me. That would just be too funny to pass up.
---
What’s your point? If I don’t enjoy something I don’t complain about it. I just move on.
---
Well, you make some valid points...
---

---
I believe he was the bear's owner, informing me that said bear was up to date on shots and to please not get the law involved.
---
That helmet was actually reintroduced into the game back in TBC as a green *mail* helmet - so it never was available to plate wearers as a tmog later on... so close yet so far.
---
change this sub's name to r/wowclassicstreamerfanboys
---
I really want to respect your opinion and all.....
---
but NO!
---
"No one boss have the same armor and resistances like the others the only thing we know for sure is that it's generally much MUCH MUCH more than the 3k that KT had."
---
Show evidence of this thing you think you "know for sure". I call bullshit.
---
You should take a closer look of TBC's patchs.
---
You'll see that downhill began before Wotlk : remove attunement/nerf xp/nerf elite/alterac reinforcements etc...
---
TBC was "perfect" before 2.3.
---
There's nothing to “break into” you dweeb. There's either a public API for something or you can't do it with an addon. The only way to “bypass any restriction” is to break the ToS by modifying game files or reading from and writing to its memory.
---
Thx to prove my point
---
I'm not 30 yet and I had to google it... I think it's less to do with age and more to do with it being a Twitch thing.
---
Yeah, this is what we did.  Shout spams.  And Taunt maybe?  Wow, I can't remember if Taunt was considered physical or magic.
---
What type of itch are your itching to itch? is it a ball sack itch or more of an arsehole itch?
---
No. I resubbed for a chance at beta (stupid I know) and I was almost one shotting every mob with my mage. The quests fell so forced and boring; just a grind-fest. 2/10 would not recommend
---
It's the joy of ganking and getting to see the opponents misery at the same time. Double win.   
---
What do you gank for?
---
Gets you into the mood but just feels like a mobile game. Do your dailies and your weekly mythic. Leveling is probably the best part but even then gear drops don’t mean shit because you buy heirlooms. Rush to 120 to not have anything to. Unless you’re a tank 45 min queue times for low level dungeons. 
---
Making a new toon like the one you want to be in classic is fun lol. Get to have the visual of what you will bounce around as
---
Tbh it’s been making me mad and want to play classic less because I think they will fuck it up.
---
This sounds like an argument in favour of paladins though, no? Paladins have better throughput and do not have to worry about the 5 second rule the way druids do. Unless I am missing something (and I usually am) it sounds like paladins make the druid niche obsolete.
---
I really do not want to seem like I am just bashing druids. I am really not, and really want to play one. They were the class that got me into WoW in the first place. Just every time I try and work out what advantages they have I keep coming up short.
---
not even released yet and they're already wondering what's "next"
---
fucking locusts go ruin some other game
---
Thx bruh
---
Do you want to be applying buffs to 40 people every 5 minutes and having an easy time with healing tanks or would you like to do the most healing with lots of different ranks of spells but have to manage your mana very carefully.
---
In before every single one on the opposite faction tries to gang him.
---
It would be a lot easier to prove harassment if you're a streamer but there is always a fine line.
---
Ultimately, it would have to be an issue where calling in others from your faction can't change your situation after logging out for awhile or playing an alt instead.
---
Because that kind of balance is unattainable. Any unique abilities will always bring the risk of being overpowered in some way. It's better to give each class its own strengths and weaknesses, rather than make everyone the same and hope that the few special abilities a class have don't break an encounter.
---
As a hunter I wouldn't mind you rolling on a gun / bow if it had nice stats but low DPS.
---
Like... seriously dude? I cba to hold your hand through all this shit. He didn't outright restate it again, that tweet was the lastest confirmation of what was already stated to us already. There will be no rppvp servers on launch. 
---
If you wana hear it from the horses mouth go google around a bit. It was already stated outright before this tweet that it wouldn't happen. He confirmed what he already said. 
---
If you want to hold some insane delusion that it's all smoke and mirrors and there will just magically be there on launch then go ahead I guess. You are going to be in for a pretty big let down.
---
No. Do I wanna know? I mean, I guess I should wanna know. But...
---
8.2 will help the wait for classic - but nothing until 8.2... which is still unannounced.
---
Should be out before mid July though, to squeeze out more subs.
---
Nice! I dinged 60 grinding those ghosts in the lake in Winterspring.
---
I try to do a different level cap every time. Exploration was 70 in Shadowmoon Valley. I've done all sorts of stuff, like Archaeology, PvP, bonus objectives, Garrison EXP. I'll probably do something like this in Classic too!
---
Wtf are these two eerily similar comments ... Is there some kind of propaganda campaign now about the beta invites
---
They will have it ppl are just dumb
---
You are right.
---
I respect people like you who actually explain reasoning, have my upvote friend.
---
immediately think less of people who use twitch emotes on things that aren't twitch. i dont even know what half of them mean besides them sounding fucking retarded.
---
If you like to PVP go pally, if not go priest. Alliance needs plenty of priests and their spell diversity is good if you really enjoy the healing aspect. Paladin is basically flash heal, holy light, and buffs.

I mean, yeah I would probably take that bet, tbh. What he suggests will only work if the majority of people agree to it because it takes a large group of people working together for it to be effective. You're assuming that everyone taking part in a huge blacklist would be willing participants without evidence. I don't think that's true.  
---
If that is in-face the case, then the people who blindly follow some random list without proof are probably huge fan boys who will literally do anything they say regardless if there is a list or not. Which means all any of the streamers would have to do is say "Don't play with Will, he killed me and I don't like him".
---
That view you have of these people is pretty sketch, imo. A streamer could easily be found out for abusing a blacklist system like killing people then blacklisting them if they fight back. If something like that got out, there would be a huge backlash at that streamer; and not just by regular players, by other streamers too.
---
You can buy tokens in retail, and pay your sub that way.  Being able to buy a token for like 500g would require blizzard to also sell them for like 450g and that would ruin the game.
---
Find it kind of funny that this sub constantly shits on "you think you do, but you dont" then applies it to retail constantly.
---
Yeah, perhaps this is the best way to go
---
That UI is killer
---
That is retail players point of view who have forgotten the use of Chat channels, guild chats and normal communication between people. The claim that one widely used tool would totally replace every other method is also wrong. All of my friends use WhatsApp and that is their preferred way of communicating, still they answer when i call them (or they call me if i don't answer in WhatsApp). Same applies pretty much anything. Widely used method is not replacing and killing every other methods and therefore forcing
---
You will wear platr in naxx
---
Also just because something is bis doesnt mean you will or must get it
---
Paladin gear is less contended especially if all paladins think they must where cloth. You can take the plate. Be much better in pvp, while getting an upgrade 
---
Skarmtank goes over this, how items can go overlooked simply because they are not bis
---
I don't think being a white-male has anything to do with celebrities and their following. I know plenty of people across many cultural and ethnic backgrounds that follow a celebrity in some shape or form. They're just 'popular'.
---
Hey blizzard - get rid of the flag carriers on the maps - let us hide the flag for 40 minutes like we used to :)
---
To be fair, greater blessings are in 1.12, but otherwise yeah
---
Haha me neither was debating this with some of the old crew, they said battleshout, Demi and thunderclap, but thinking it over again only battleshout works, demo and thunder Aggro the neutral mobs and then you wipe :D
---
And that's a very good argument you make and should be noted. 
---
I am personally am against mods/addons, HOWEVER I would advocate for a better filter to be in the base game to address the problem you have. Same thing with more customization in the UI. 
---
Mods/addons are a pretty grey area if you ask me.
---
then you overestimate it, like op did, and fail the task
---
Pvp set bonus grants +15% movement speed, if i recall it was additive not multiplicative, so travel form used to get to 55% movement increase outdoors.
---
As for maximum movement speed, if you count cat 30% , the 15% pvp bonus and +60% from dash , you could run slightly faster than an epic mount, though since movement speed enchants did not work while shapeshifted ( if i recall correctly), then mounted speed can surpass it via trinket/enchants etc.
---
Test fleet best fleet.
---
locks tapping while I'm drinking between pulls really grinds my gears haha
---
Well you said DW Fury tank.  
---
It's one thing to be tanking in a spec that's like 5/31/15.  It's a completely different ballgame to DW tank rag while you're undergeared.
---
“Shath rah”
---
It’s part of the game. I started at launch on a private server and there was probably a 6 hour period that 5 higher level horse guys took over menethil. Couldn’t get any alliance to help. Had to log and play later. Was fun though
---
They interact with the chat (bigger streams are harder for this), you get a live look at how they play and react to the game as opposed to videos that are edited, usually streamers are personality types that are entertaining or they are exceptionally skilled or a combination of the two.
---
People watch for entertainment, or to learn, or both.
---
Yep, clearly photoshopped the entire thing for them internet points
---
Or your memory is terrible
---
Wow. You’re a jerk.
---
I think it’s possible they’ll change their minds. I also think if we don’t get one at launch, we’ll get one soon after.
---
Get over yourself. I have an opinion about a video game. I didn’t do anything that could possibly offend a reasonable person.
---
Are you going resto at 60 or PvP DPS fun?
---
Also for leveling push 31 points into ench for the stormstrike. You will be fine healing 5 mans with just the correct gear.
---
Ah Kristin Holt. I used to think about her a lot when I woke up, before bed and even sometimes during the show.

Yes, it was almost the only way to get rank 14 in vanilla. I worked my way into one of the groups as Horde on Gorefiend. The rules were intense. 
---
It'll just be more circlejerk / culty now.
---
Hi, what name plate addon is that? I got the lorti UI thing but my nameplates don't look like yours.
---
This is because Reddit, and the internet at large, loves discussing these types of things as if they happen in a sterile environment, under ideal conditions. The DnD community struggles with this too, constantly running builds for "white room encounters" where nothing unexpected happens. 
---
In real raiding, people take what they can get. If you are a healer, someone needs you. If you are a tank, someone needs you. Loot spread is a problem that is faced by raid leaders in reality, and internet arguments generally don't care about reality, only number theory.
---
OK, so still what I said, but Use the last frames of Healing Touch / Rejuv? the really mana heavy one as the heal casted.
---
Ahh yes my thought was that the extra 5% silence resistant would be worth it... But nothing is set in stone yet haha, thanks for the input
---
You think people are going to have time to level to 60 AND farm pre-BIS in the first week?  
---
And yeah, the MC mob is great, but it's also somewhat contingent on your raid never wiping or tank never dying.
---
Well they've scaled way back from that now and it's all about 'class fantasy' as the buzz word for retail.
---
And I’ll give him all my money too
---
Blizzard: we want to make sure servers have healthy populations
---
Also Blizzard: let’s release a new server type months after release that will leech players from existing realms.
---
At least by then there won’t be any “layering.”
---
Put an edit in my comment, but you think healing with 31 into Enhance 0 Resto is going to be no issue at all?
---
When I’m a hunter I say yes they can roll.
---
Summoning people underwater 😇
---
Dude badass! I would buy a shirt with this
---
Are you me? My first character ever was an orc hunter and my friends got me into the game just before Burning Crusade. I managed to sing 60 a week before the portal opened. Used to have a screen shot just like this except I was feigning death in the grass
---
I'm quite certain the biggest streamers, like asmongold, will have primary name reserved by Blizzard or be given an extra day to reserve name before others or something. Guild names and smaller streams are probably up for grabs though
---
Why isn't it ok?
---
And that will not happen, ever. One method replacing every other method and therefore forcing everyone to use that specific method can occur only in a very specific situation. When the method is not enforced by the service provider that is really unlikely to happen.
---
warrior.  
---
i was my starting guilds GM so i knew i'd have to pick one of the 'job' characters. So i picked him because the responsibility and necessity.  
---
i'm off that this time around. going with ezpz dps now
---
This streamer hate is truly a blessings. It's the easiest and most accurate test out there to diagnose if you have autism. So, please, if you have irrational hate towards these people who are doing basically their job without harming anyone, please seek medical attention. There is very high probability you have autism and with proper help the quality of your life will surely improve.
---
Lakeshire!
---
Sorry i have a bad habit of assuming ppl are smart when i explain something
---
I forget most arent and cant pick up what im saying without an exhausted overdrawn out explaination. So here we go.
---
Back in 04 our everday computers couldnt handle something like streaming
---
So the level of griefing a person wasnt as big as it is now. And people didnt cry and complain as much as they do now
---
Ill assume youre stupid this time and explain griefing. Griefing or ganking someone in the wow environment is pretty much killing them in the open world, camping them until they log off.
---
As a streamer that pretty much stops your revenune, oh sorry did it again. It stops the person from making money.
---
Which also slows twitches revenune ( can i assume you know what revenune means now?)
---
Soooo twitch made a forum post (this could be false but i did read it, i believe it was posted in the twitch subreddit) that stated that if you are streaming and you gank or grief another streamer whose also streaming. Twitch can ban your stream for stream sniping.
---
It was provoked, whoops sorry, it was caused by a wow streamer known as Sonii who kept creating wpvp raids and grief asmongold and esfran. They pretty much complained everytime until twitch mods saw it happening.
---
Now depending how bad that affects Blizzards revenune and exposure...dammit sorry. Exposure pretty much means letting the world see or you see the world. 
---
Blizzard can go further and ban regular players for stream sniping their favorite players in wow. Its a very real possibility
---
I dont think blizzard would go that far but then again this isnt the same Blizzard that made 04 wow.
---
Hopefully you learned something here.
---
God your making me crave Mythics /s
---
Even at 60 it's no sweat if you have three competent dpsr's with CC for the content that are willing to set pulls up correctly. In strat or scholo where I could contribute to CC with shackle sometimes I'd even pass on the plate wearer and roll with 4 dps.
---
Well yeah, from a HPS/HPM standpoint there's nothing druids bring that's going to make them standout. They cast motw/innervate/rebirth, they use druid gear, they provide slow but efficient single target healing and you bring 1-3 to a raid. Essentially they're the healing support. If you're not ok with that I wouldn't roll druid.
---
You don't need pre-BiS to down MC. You don't even need close to it.
---
Rivaling Disney for dicks now. Lol
---
They really are two different games. I did the last half of Legion and beginning of BFA since I knew I would play classic. Legion was great, BFA an absolute train wreck. That being said I bet you can get a solid month just figuring out whats all new.
---
I'm pretty sure Blarizard broke the group API for addons. So LFG would require some manual interaction.
---
&gt; It will be hilarious because no matter how much they try to dictate to gamers, they never understand what it’s like to be one.
---
What does this even mean?
---
Do you cheer/notify the enemy when you're going stealth since it gives you an advantage to catch them off-guard? Isn't ganking and killing enemies making the others experience worse anyways? Unless they're fully prepared/spec'd/geared for pvp in the world, do you feel you're ruining their fun?   
---
What would you relate is okay to PVP? Is someone shouting X Alliance at X location in the same vein as sniping or different since it was found in game and relayed in game? 
---
While this is not how I PVP, it is how some enjoy theirs. I won't bug people doing dailies/farms since we know the grind and I don't want to make it worse. But if you get paid X dollars to stream the game and get more views the more exciting you PVP you're welcome to become the BFA target you are making yourself.
---
Did you end up testing this on 4.x??
---
surprise, another horde
---
Hi, /u/Wayyzzz
---
Fellow EVE player here, drop me a message if you're looking for an older guild.
---
😑
---
The privilege to steal somebody else’s name?  Kind of a dick move...no it’s a dick move.
---
I can see Blaze or Tirion, Morpheus, other popular names being up for grabs.  But when someone has built a community, fan base, and an identity on a really specific name...nobody should copy it.  Kind of why trademark and copyright laws exist in the real world, otherwise scam business would flourish.
---
If you're always using concentration aura sure, but that won't always be the case. I'd go 5/5 focus and 0 strength.
---
My man
---
I just can't imagine someone that thinks 'the game' is the models and quest text. That is not the game. That's not why I pay $15 or spend 2 hours a day in the game. I'm not here to read a picture book. TBC hasn't existed from the minute wotlk launched.
---
I know right - half this thread is people who have no idea what they’re talking about.
---
If you think stream sniping is bad.  Wait until you get ganked every time you land in menethil harbor
---
From what I recall most plus healing cloth has spirit on it which is useless to a paladin, no talents to support it and you kind of cast all the time. You will use shamans mail items since they are in the similar boat. 
---
Paladin is one button, flash of light, that is it. Priest actually have options thus higher skill cap.
---
&gt;How are you not able to differentiate these 2 situations?
---
Because this sub will do anything to believe streamers are nazis.
---
There were blacklists for ninjas and assholes back in the day. Not sure what's so hard to understand about one for players who constantly streamsnipe for attention. It's amazing how upset people are over this when it won't effect 99.999% of the player population.
---
there has been no better dingery in the world of historycraft
---
You've nailed it with your first sentence. Who wouldn't want to get paid to play their favorite video games and have legions of adoring fans? It would be a dream come true for many.
---
I think that most jealous people are jealous of the popularity, not the money. Something as simple as being recognized throughout WoW could mean a lot to socially unadjusted people.
---
if you have played vanilla, you know bots are a problem... they will return, i promise you.
---
I used to farm aswell, lots... i was a MT, 150-200g repairs a night raiding.
---
Maybe you have a clue on how much that was, we had great problems back then with these bots ruining the game... it would be foolish to not come up with a sollution, thats why they invente the token along the way.
---
And i am sure they wish they had it in vanilla...
---
How great it is to see a Ninja steal ya item, and sell it on AH... for as far as i know, this in classic will also be possible.
---
I still have concerns, and why... because i have first hand experience on how it was, and i truly wish this is not going to screw up Classic.
---
the farther ahead you are the less fighting you'll encounter  
---
the people rushing are generally too busy leveling and dont want to lose time to fighting and retaliation
---
I think every bug should be fixed, spell batching is terrible, and that the #nochanges crowd are delusional. =)
---
nah dude don't even bother
---
don't give up your 15 bucks a month until 8/27
---
sincerely, former BfA player
---
Pog is the worst
---
Lol this is a joke right?
---
A ret pally instead of any normal dps is a way worse trade than a mage instead of a fury warr. You underestimate how trash some of tgese specs are. 
---
Also, part of it is gearing uo a raid for future content. Its not practical to gear 24 furys. Its also not practical to waste gear on meme specs that you will likely have to trim down on for BWL.
---
Sure you can do the raid with 4 meme specs. But why should a guy who does 1/4 of my dps be given gear when he also doesnt scale nearly as well?
---
dunno lol. Why he did that.
---
In my opinion the storytelling in BFA is really good. The cinematics are great. The problem is beyond that, there is not much to hook you. 
---
Therefore, if you are a fan of the warcraft lore, I'd go for it. Otherwise probably not worth it.
---
I think they're retarded even on twitch, why not have discussions or chats like any other chat room? Why when you get more than a few hundred people in a room does it turn into kappa/pog/face-palm spam? Why is this fun for people?
---
Everytime I watch anything on twitch I just hide the chat
---
But but my life would be meaningless without trashing on  them
---
Soda is going Horde though
---
&gt; I really hope that Blizzard is preparing for the inevitable : ditching  Retail WoW for good, or changing it drastically. But if they change it  drastically, I am afraid that they will lose more subs than they will  get, because those changes will be rejected by the current retail player  base. 
---
This is the most fascinating challenge.  They will likely get 1-2m incremental subs with the next expansion or the incrementals that come from classic will at least buy the next expansion and give it a shot.  The question is can they hold them and not lose the current retail playerbase.  I hope they can...
---
Sure... You know something, don't you?
---
What about AP/Crit weapons?
---
Devilsaur Mafia was able to exist on Nost for two main reasons: 
---
1. Cross Faction collusion was not enforced.
---
2. All of the best PvPers in the game were concentrated in one place.
---
People don't talk about it much, but most of the mafia was former rank 14 pvpers who didn't know what to do with their gear. Having such a high concentration of top tier players with free time on there hands is a major factor in the mafia's design. We will likely see similar attempts in classic, and it will vary from server to server I'm sure, but I doubt we will see the same level of control that the original mafia exerted.
---
Saving this for later
---
RIP you 3capped on multiple warlord/HWL premade? Based on the time elapsed I'm gonna guess you guys won the first cap after a long fight, then the horde just sat for the rest? Nice screen shot - love this stuff.
---
Holy paladins actually pretty bad in PvP, lack of any sort of damage unless you go some weird shenanigans, and all of the heals are casts. Priests could actually pack a punch, cc, and had a few instant healing abilities.
---
HHHHHOOOOOOO!
---
PvP is awesome but when you're only going to a zone because the streamer your watching is alone and has 20k viewers that's not actual PvP just some kid trying to get attention mommy never gave him
---
If I wasn't playing Horde I'dd be on him like a fly on shit.  Dude apparently can't stand fears btw for any Alliance looking to take him down.
---
The unstoppable force...so much fun.
---
It wouldn't be a good video without bodies hitting the floor.
---
I wouldn't say instant gratification, I would say a low tolerance for inefficiency.
---
sitting in town for 2 hours looking for a tank sucks. So for arguments sake, lets say the dungeon take 1 hours 15 min. So 3 hours 15 min for the dungeon. Drop rate is X.
---
Current dungeon finder (not LFD; im talking about the M+ group finder) dungeon takes 1 hours 15 min. Takes maybe 15 min to find a group. So 1 hour 30 min for the dungeon. Drop rate is 0.5\*X. 
---
Im going to spend the same amount of time, roughly, on average to loot up. So the pay off takes the same amount of time, the gratification if you will. Except in the latter example, I spend almost all my time pressing buttons, working the mechanics, using strategy--You know reasons I may need to talk to my group. In the former, I spend a lot of time just spamming /2.
---
Im all for hard content, and if Blizzard was to make one difficulty for pve and that difficulty was tuned to live mythic raids and mythic + dungeons, then I'd be all for it. Let us slave for weeks to get 1 upgrade from an instance that is brutal in mechanics too, not just drop rates. 
---
With a dedicated 5 man group, Classic instances are very easy to gear out from. You can be nearly BIS in 2-3 weeks--at most--as a loner on a populated server playing 15-20 hours a week. 
---
Im kinda getting tangential to my previous post, but yes people dont talk to today as much as they used to. I think it is a more a function of easy content for the masses, less than randomized grouping and quick loot. And the internet is a different demographic, it used to be niche and there was predominant archetype of a person, it isnt anymore.
---
Or girl I’m sorry I didn’t mean to offend
---
People think the viewers watch streamers only because of classic WoW. This isn’t even true a lot of people watch streamers despite what game they are playing. Just because other people will accomplish things that streamers might not be able to does not mean that these streamers will become irrelevant.
---
FeelsOkayMan Classic bajs
---
I had heard strikes don't reset your auto-swing in classic unlike pservers; do we know that this is true?  Also at the time i read that it was unsure if WF procs (from strikes)effected your swing as well; has this info changed?
---
Thanks for the hard work you do, still a very awesome addon!
---
I like retail also, but it didn’t scratch the itch as you said. I leveled to 20 on a private server and found that a much more similar experience.
---
Druid is strong but fills a specific niche, don't expect to burst people from 0-100 at level 60, yours is a battle of attrition, hit and run /control and outlast , that's where the class shines tbh.
---
Are they strong in pvp ? hell yeah, but that style isn't for everyone, most prefer a more straight forward style of play.
---
Yeah everyone thinks the version that was out when they got into WoW is the best version. 
---
They should just add servers for each tbh.
---
Thats what im worried about. If most people follow these streamers to their servers, then world events &amp;  random events will be coordinated and controlled by the streamers. It wont be as genuine an experience as everyone's first go round.
---
I really do hope there are some motivated guilds that avoid the servers populated with streamers.
---
Obsession about streamer obsession is embarassing.  Fuck off
---
if they make just one i feel like it's gonna just instantly become the AsMoN server
---
Because other pserver YouTube streamers have gotten access?.. Baron for example. Entirely possible it's just a coincidence though.
---
(Apparently this subreddit)
---
Then you don't play the game for the story, and that's fine. Which is why I qualified my initial statement with "class meta", because that's the only other reason I ever see anyone put forth as to why they want anything Pre-BFA.
---
You just have enough holy palas to have all blessings you need.  Dont need a useless ret player in raid doing less dps than the tank. 
---
Pretending ret pallys actually provide utility and dont blow all their mana on trting to do damage is a lie. A holy pally actually has mana to do the things you are suggesting and much more. 
---
A ret pally can't even hit Ragnaros lol.
---
Alternatively, we want to play feral/enhance/ret because we like the fantasy of the class, or we just enjoy it more, or any of the five million other reasons someone can do something that isn't 'I want to be a special snowflake'.
---
Twitch chat is not made for conversation
---
Yes, they do! Soulstone yourself then hellfire yourself to death then rez. Totally...legit...
---
Streamers are straight up admitting to 16 - 20 hour days.
---
Definitely good money for the time being, but it's kind of weird watching them all ordering burgers and tacos from Uber Eats.
---
🤔
---
I never watched a single second of his videos.
---
I just find it funny that someone will stream themselves out in the world and then cry that it attracts gankers.  Is anyone surprised this happens?
---
If he gets body guards I bet the gankers will bring in reinforcements.  Then you will have a good old fashion wpvp brawl
---
Fuck that's awesome
---
Wtf did I just read, enough r/classicwow for today I guess
---
And r2 for anyone too low for r3.  That feeling when you buff someone and they stop to look around for who/what happened but you're already gone watching them from around a corner. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Revenue ≠ Earnings
---
None of your numbers make any sense with the way you're mixing these terms.
---
A healing pally will do much more than blessing of light ever will for a struggling raid.
---
its totally legendary, at least deserves to be
---
None of the resto talents actually help you heal efficiently which is the main issue in 5 mans of 55 and below. You only get benefits after like 20 points in the tree.
---
Peak performance
---
Twas a long time ago but iirc they tried for 2 caps then danced for the third. We were proud since our guild mostly pve'd but we made it a point to play a couple after raids later. We got pretty decent and had a couple Gladiator ranked teams later on. Of all my video games I've played, WoW pvp is my favorite.
---
Twinky time will be a blast to!
---
It's possible to hit 60 in one week. 
---
The world record on a live server is still 4 days 20 hours *as a hunter* which still works out to 16.5 hours per day.  
---
Now getting a raid's worth of Warriors (how many do you need for Majordomo?) and priests and other healers within a week is what I don't think is possible without account sharing. 
---
I also don't put very much stock into private server records or claims that leveling is faster on the beta client.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Yea you will. Pallys are v commonly played dude.
---
I watched his stream when beta first launched. He legit bragged about being the best player and called everyone a douche bag / dick the entire time things got stolen from him or didn’t go his way
---
Undead male caster animations are fantastic, but for melee they're nothing special. Female undead is pretty underrated in general, they have really smooth and varied animations.
---
Do noggen fogger and world enlarger shrink your hitbox or is it only visual. Still... a gnome with noggen fogger running through WSG with the flag is hard to spot...
---
I bought a copy of the original dungeon guide off of amazon. I fully intend to run each dungeon at least once, if not twice. The whole point of Classic is to relive an experience, and one of those experiences is doing 5 man content with a bunch of undergeared idiots.
---
A year from now people will be levelling Alt number X with a bunch of BiS enchanted crafted gear handed down from their main. They'll know the route and pulls, etc. It won't be the same.
---
Do the dungeons right from the get go. Do the quests. Finish the storylines. Have a blast.
---
Sadly the only thing I knew is recruitment is closed. I am not sure for what they use this therm but.
---
3 things that are worth it to me:
---
Arathi Basin - feels very similar to what it felt like in vanilla, a frenetic, fun battleground with updated characters.
---
nope nevermind, that was the only one.
---
I've been almost exculsively pvping, its not a bad time sync, but i make sure to take time and spend with my wife (banking up those hours) prior to classic dropping.
---
goodmorning, ready for your daily dose of pwnage?
---
Get that enchanting for wands
---
annoying but still less annoying than Asmon lol
---
And how much lower is tank threat going to be?
---
sup scrub
---
64 million boars is the only true way to go
---
Hahaa
---
Most streamers are just normal people. If you actually hate people simply for the fact that they stream, you've got to be pretty sad and resentful.
---
I had about 400g after get my lvl 40 mount. I honestly dont why people worry about it #warlock4life
---
Emerald Dream had entire guilds on Horde side that would go in 40 man raids and World PvP bigtime through Legion. &lt;Warsong Battalion&gt;, &lt;Ironsworn Regiment&gt; and some other ones. They've since disbanded for the most part in BfA.
---
Alliance had like two guilds, &lt;Clan Battlehammer&gt; (legendary all dwarf guild) and I think the &lt;7th Legion&gt;? It was something with a 7 in it.
---
So at least on my RP-PvP server there were some SERIOUSLY hardcore PvPers. Like made you rage quit serious, it wasn't fun. I think BfA eliminated most of them though lol.
---
yeah it can only end badly i think.  people who want to xfaction chat for various reasons will organise things outside of the game and thats fine
---
The trick is to pick your three least favorite streamers, steal all 3 names, and then they won’t be on your server.
---
He’s clearly talking about pounce. And doesn’t cat cost like 500 mana? It’s super costly. How is he talking out of his ass?
---
Because they, and the people that are obsessed with watching them, are nothing short of straight up pathetic.  They bring nothing to the world other than their narcissism, and their idiot followers praise them for it.
---
if they make a single RPPVP realm the streamers are just gonna claim it as theirs... you realize that right?
---
I did that on purpose in STV one time. Was levelling, got ganked, fought, realized how close I was, killed a bear, dinged, shat on him.
---
Must have felt bad man
---
"I'm part of something!" "I was there when such-and-such happened!" "something got OMGCLIPPED and my name was in chat!"
---
at least that's about what I assume people are thinking.
---
thats awesome
---
And how many weeks in AQ did you spend before clearing it?
---
Not really. I tried to go back. Popped onto a ~68 Palladin I had been working on way back because I thought some of the TBC/Wrath zones would be a fun throwback. The game just feels so empty. I have a bunch of abilities and I don't really understand what they do or how they work together, but there's absolutely no reason to learn because I can just spam one button while sprinting around to the quest markers on my mini map, killing 10 mobs at a time.
---
holy shit the dedication on this nibba
---
Yes it is just a coincidence.  Anyone that is a known private server streamer wouldn’t make the list of priority invites.  They could still be invited randomly though.
---
Nope, sorry. Unless specifically spec’d for regrowth Resto druids don’t cast it. R4 HT is the most mana efficient heal in the game, making innervate a good choice to use on yourself as a Druid. Much better than giving it to a priest who is foolishly burning mana with flash heal and PoH.
---
Hard to imagine a world where hunters are rare, but I think you are right
---
A good feral is fine. Ret pallys are god awful even w full gear and consumes.
---
I’m planning on rolling a dwarf Hunter! Can’t wait to shoot everyone in the shins.
---
As much as I wish u were right, you just aren't. A handful of dudes broadcasting to *thousands* of people willing to do anything to impress them. They have an incredible amount of power, especially when it comes to in-game things.
---
 They could get killed in wpvp farming professions, and within 2 minutes you'll have 100 people ready to fuck u up until you log off. That's not even an exaggeration either, and it's actually a pretty big deal. I don't complain about things, but I can see this going bad.
---
If you roll on the same server as Soda, make sure it's on the other faction so you can take advantage of the fact that he's stupid enough to stream his location.
---
They make it hard for anyone to convince you that $49.99 loot box isnt worth it.
---
IT HAS AGILITY
---
HUNTAR WEPON
---
Esfand and Tipsout are cool though and deserved a spot in the meme. I don't personally watch any of them, but am aware of the ripple effects of a massive crowd of followers, so yea, I am backing up from streamer-heavy servers come release.
---
He never said that. He only meant streamsnipers, he even said that he likes ganking lowbies because hes an asshole. But streamsniping someone is not organic and "real" which is what classic is trying to bring back.
---
That will depend if the streamer on the oposite faction decided to agree or disagree with him.
---
If both alliance and horde streamers decide to apply the blacklist, things may be strange
---
This^
---
I would honestly prefer an optional Quest Helper feature done by Blizzard similar to retail.
---
I guarantee the majority will want to use it.
---
Who said that? Are people this stupid to where they think another suggestion is someone telling them to actually do something?
---
I think MS enchants work when shape-shifted but have no effect when cat speed talent is active. So it works when in bear and indoors catform (or not having Feline Swiftness selected). Not sure about travel tho and kind of doubt it.
---
Can someone explain me the use of this addons, pretty please ? :)
---
Oh damn, I didn't know that about Imp SoR. I'll have to change a spreadsheet formula. &gt;\_&lt;
---
Which one? Been thinking about getting on one while waiting.
---
It had it coming.
---
Great, so with your way nothing every improves because you never mention things that are shit. Fantastic job buddy.
---
How can you scratch the itch with two completely different games?
---
TB is the best place for me in the entire wow (up to WOTLK havent played much cata and nothing at all post it)
---
It's the perfect chill place.
---
More like clicking Pally Powers 8th on-screen buttons every **15** minutes which is not really pain in the ass
---
Read post, I updated post so if u want config just copy and paste to config.wtf
---
Sounds like new content I'm down
---
There are a few high-tier fights that require a lot of poison dispels - Huhuran, Viscidus, and Faerlina.
---
You are correct that Swiftmend or Moonglow builds are better for straight healing. On the topic of Druid's healing niche, their flexibility checks that box and poison dispels for Alliance are right there.
---
Alright thanks for all of the insight! Gave me some food for thought, for sure. You recommend going full enhance, or 31 and then into resto?
---
When I watched my friend walk into the Gates of Ironforge I saw the big dwarf statue with the axe and mace dualwield. 
---
Thats when I knew, I'm going to be that dwarf. So Dwarf Warrior it was.
---
Yea when they were clicker idiots. Now they are better, amd they know what gear they need. Have fun going oom as ele !
---
just edited post
---
Warriors always say thank you though. They have no buff to give but are always the ones to  give thanks.
---
Crippling poison cleanse.
---
Was it this one?

---
Um, the 15 years of experience the players have? Is this a serious question?
---
“Why would a college game be better than little league? It’s literally the same game?”
---
I'm saying your point about raiders is irrelevant to the discussion, because 95% of retail players don't raid. Most retail players will find Classic much more challenging than they're used to.
---
Preach brother, i like my games stale, just like diablo 2, i love playing older games.
---
Soul stone yourself. Instant threat reduction when you die...  Warlocks have improved feign death.
---
There are no useful talents in enchance past 31. So yeah.
---
The constant streamer hate on this sub is actually really "cringey". You guys call them and their fans "kids", yet you lot are being much more childish.
---
I'd try it. Why not.
---
Troll or dumb?  What's your guess?
---
Lol, I think it took me over a year to ding 60, no idea the time played.
---
Do PvP hpals not go into Holy enough for Holy Shock?
---
And I’d assume the utility (Freedom for example) and general tankiness of paladins makes them desirable, no?
---
Personally, I have always wanted this!
---
OG as fuck. Breaking Benjamin! *Holy* smite, 480p, UD speaking common, no tooltips, INNER RAGE?! No talents! No charges on inner fire! Booty Bay is a war zone! Frost nova chains of ice animation! SHADOW AND HOLY PROTECTION! 5 minute spirit release. No PW:S debuff! CAPITAL LETTERS IN NAMES? 
---
That ogre running animation had me absolutely cracking up.
---
Upvoted for legitimate beta video. Love watching these.
---
Also, holy shit their website is still up and they still play games, not WoW though.
---
22 days to 60 hooray! Lol
---
I don’t have any surviving pictures, but dwarves have and always will be my favorite race in all fantasy. 
---
I did retire my retail Dwarf Paladin to a quiet retirement in Ironforge until he gets his rebirth in Classic. I’ll gladly welcome you as a new dwarven brother. 
---
For Khaz Modan!
---
Took him like 22 days of playtime to ding 60.
---
I never understood asmongold's success tbh, he's neither the most skilled nor the most interesting streamer out there, it puzzles me sometimes how he's managed to gather such a large following.
---
I’m talking about streamer culture in general, which is pretty heavily skewed to the teenage to early twenties white male demographic. Obviously culture worship in general isn’t limited to any one demographic.
---
Some fraud with his dad's Construction Company we dont know what exactly tho.
---
Maybe they are different people.
---
It is surprising to find someone on this sub who can't grasp the common courtesy of only rolling need on items that are optimal for your class. Sure you CAN use and INT/SPIRIT staff, but the mage and priest in the group are the classes those stats are designed/optimal for.
---
I totally understand your argument of not telling others how to play the game and I agree.
---
You can't make me tank for selfish or stupid hunters.
---
BRUH WAT
---
This is the "problem" wow had since day 1. The only thing dps brings to the raid is damage. You can think that there is nothing wrong with that, but then you will have a superior class (personally, I don't think this is bad). its inevitable. WoW always lacked a support rol. It has some support abilities, like buffs, but those aren't enough if you want to create variety.
---
There can also be hero hunters. Know how to control pet and traps can really assist the whole team immensly by cc and offtanking. On the contrary if they suck.. Elune have mercy on you.
---
They have different pros and cons but no pallys are not bad at pvp, they are god tier for group pvp. Priests have to play very carefully to not be gibbed by warrior/hunter/rogues in end game pvp. Paladins wear full plate and have a spell that makes them completely immune to everything in the game for 10 seconds on a 5 min CD.
---
If I don't play beta, no one is playing beta!
---
the worst part about this thread is you probably think you are being downvoted for calling the streamer out, when in reality its just your terrible opinions
---
Do a Disc/Holy combo and if you want to switch to Shadow, wait until 40+ to do it.
---
I guarantee that Blizzard has already saved their character names for them.  Asmongold is too important to their bottom line with Classic to let someone snipe his name.
---
It will be difficult to gauge the success of Classic since access is tied to the normal retail subscription. There will also be a lot of players who give it a shot and stop leveling halfway through. However, I am confident it will satisfy the cravings of the people who know what they want from the game.
---
Being realistic, I hope Classic gets developers and publishers to realize that there is still an appetite for mechanically simpler, but more story-rich and social-driven games. I definitely don't expect Classic to come anywhere near the retail playerbase. Retail WoW evolved into what it is today because the market demanded faster games, with more clicking and typing and less downtime in order to keep the mental rush going. Classic is the exact opposite.
---
It's been interesting seeing Blizzard's stance on Classic change from "we're not doing it because nobody will play it" to "we're going to give it to you for (sort of) free".
---
C'thun
---
WotF, PvP Trinket, Living Action Potion, Improved Sprint x2 plus Engineering

Cheap Shot, Mind Numbing (6 sec Fear Cast), Gouge, Improved Kick, Blind x2, Kidney Shot
---
Took me foreeeeeever to hit 60 lol. I was also like 10 with no responsibilities, so idk what the hell I did in the 8-10 hours I'd play haha
---
Wait I remember you -  you are the guy that got "directly asked by a devs to join the beta" Yeah sorry mate but you seem full of shit, hard to believe you....
---
what does this have to do with the person's question?
---
There is no right, there is no wrong, there is the fun you choose to have now and the fun you will have in the future
---
It's granted with a sub, so it doesn't hurt you to try it.
---
Survival Hunter is neato.
---
Then play on a PvE server or don't stream. Put stream on delay. There are solutions
---
Is this r/classicwow or r/livestreamfails ?
---
“All the RP, usually died down so that only Erotic RP was the only thing RP visibly left on the server, so in the end you were just left with PvP servers, with better naming rules.” 
---
This lol, we used to head on over to a rppvp server whenever ours went down, my char was called readynwilling, she was just that, on the IF bridge. Till it got me banned and had to force namechange. One of my friends was smarter about it and opened a brothel and became rich as fuck.
---
You're already lagging, I heard 2x in peace.
---
I'm going off of what I've heard. ATM the only things that reset your swing timer are hits, misses of any kind, attack modifying spells like Heroic Strike, and Slam. Parry haste is also taken into account.
---
Because I have every server to pick from instead of one, unless I reroll or server transfer if that's an option.
---
I can pool from every server, instead of being locked to one.
---
THAT'S IT THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
---
As a paladin all ur heals are casts, and you have no offensive utility like offensive dispel, mana burn, fear, dots, or even nukes. Priest has all of those. 
---
So easy to counterspell a healing paladin and he is useless. Some paladins would preemptively bubble to be able to heal their friend.
---
My uncle is Jay Allen Brack and he said they're inviting fifty ten people
---
I play like this too but so few people do now because doing all of that cuts into their rotation so they can't get good parses or whatever. I hate current wow culture so much.
---
This would be ideal - but sadly blizzards "vips" wouldn't be down for it so gg!
---
Epic.
---
Personally I like for them to expand the level 60 content.  Make hybrid dps slightly more viable, pretty easy imo, Ele shaman and Moonkin just need spell mana cost adjustments.  The melee hybrids would be tough, this is blizzard afterall, they will completely botch any balancing...so I don't know.  People aren't going to be happy no matter what it seems.
---
For gear and content, they are releasing them in phases, but gear will retain it's 1.12 stat allocation.
---
So gear not released in 1.3 will be in phase 2, gear released in 1.10 will be released in phase 5. There are 6 phased total.
---
So much salt about banning addons, chill. OP makes a good point
---
Not much barring any radical unforeseen differences. Rag for example doesnt even have a threat table
---
There’s no improvement to be made.  There’s 100s of others of streamers to choose from at no real inconvenience. If I don’t like McDonalds burgers, I’ll go to Burger King or make one myself.
---
Paladin isn't hard to level at all. You can heal up between mobs so there isn't much down time. Plenty of tools to handle any hairy situations you might encounter while questing. Badass level 20 mace to smash things with.
---
End game... yeah people will just want you to heal.
---
I am fine. Not need to Proof. Also feel free to downvote.
---
You can Hope for the other Guy Comeback. But He wont since he has Access now.
---
The people whinjng about it are just man-children who love to complain and join hiveminds. This post specifically is insane. Issuing a “reality check” to streamers when all they’re doing is creating good world activities. Also, he ignores the point that the streamer servers will be the most populated.
---
I guess this sub forgot guilds exist. If a streamer guild didn't rule over this content, a guild would anyway. The difference would be pretty much indistinguishable.
---
Actually when the stress test happened everyone(who didn't get in) complained about streamers even more lol
---
There are dozens of us!
---
If you ban leveling addons, all that happens is people alt tab to check wowhead or some other site more often. 
---
Also, if you cover up most of your screen with addons, you are doing something wrong, especially in a competitive raiding setting.
---
Of course you can play the game with no addons. You can also play the game by keyboard turning and clicking your spells. Do you want a server in which everyone has to keyboard turn and click their spells?
---
I mean he got his start on youtube where he'd make decent/tame videos about WoW. Then he started shitting on the game 24/7 and got a following. Now a lot of the classic people follow him because he's one of the oldest recognizable WoW players who is super pro Classic. I'm personally not a huge fan of him, but he at least has a personality unlike say Towelie. I think he also got a large following after he came out pro Trump , so a lot of the /r/kotaku type gamers started following him (although he doesn't really tread into that terrirory and sticks mostly to WOW)
---
&gt; hope to see you on the battlefield!
---
Because you sure wont see him in the world!
---
Did you not watch the clip?
---
spam like barrens chat is different then a bunch of people spamming about a streamer
---
Worth the wait!
---
However they don't get roflstomped in a kidney shot like Priests do. Hpal doesn't need as many peels as Priests do.
---
I agree, watching general chat during stress test was such a turn off and killed some of the excitement I had for classic, all they did was flame streamers ~90% of the time it was the topic of conversations, I agree playing on streamer servers will probably suck but all the whining is in my opinion just as bad..
---
You didn’t answer my first question at all. Do PVP Hpals not spec into Holy Shock?
---
Is it that you favor crit over hit in aq?
---
In TBC I'd spam whisper Druids asking for "books of the wild" and they'd all just reply "???"
---
They were not even that effective. I was able with two others fend off attacks and get leather for our whole guild.
---
This isn't even tryhard culture. This is "data driven without context". This is what happens when everything is driven by data with lack of context. This is why "hybrids" don't exist in retail anymore, but if everything is judged by "DPS, HPS" a class that doesn't excel but fill in the missing pieces never shows up high.
---
&gt;Even if WoW only had one million subs, it'd still be the second most subbed MMO.
---
I remember the days of 2010 : "Wow have 12 millions subs, more than the next 10 MMOs COMBINED"....now we are happy with "it's still the SECOND best MMO"...?
---
Do you see how low retail got?
---
Ugghhh all this debate just makes me want to play now
---
You are correct, I jumped the gun. In a big group PvP they are good. It just they were so defenseless if a DPS targeted them. Priest would just mana burn, mage counterspell the heal preventing a bubble, warlock mana drain. Hunter kite for says. Rogue would not even let you cast...... At least that was my experience. Always wanted to be a priest.
---
Question, ive heard for druid tanks you should aim for 1% spell hit chance to make sure you land faerie fire, where should i get this stat from? gear? enchant? or other?
---
Good point, I didn't think about that. Are all non-boss mobs lvl 60 and therefore don't require casters to have full hit gear?
---
Gatekeep more, Soda.
---
The beautiful thing about classic is you can try it out for yourself.
---
Link for Shroud?
---
Compared to Blizzard, they are midgets.
---
We are still comparing the two right?
---
&gt;I don't want to play with someone who is trying to make a career out of something that is meant to be a hobb
---
This is a weird attitude to have lol. I agree that they shouldn't get priority, but i don't blame them for trying to make a career out of something that they love doing.
---
Paladins and hunters are just never going to be in my 5 mans. 
---
It’s that simple lol
---
Way way waaaayy to many experiences with that. You never know just how desperate you can get till it’s 5am and that’s the only option...
---
if by "normal people" you mean, "people who want to become the next Asmongold and do nothing but play video games for a living", then yes.
---
My guess is that this is all drama and even on streamer realms the game will go pretty normal. You all just want something to bitch about. This sub is going to shit since everyone just wants to talk about streamers. If you don't like them don't play on there server. If you want to gank them then do it. Stop bitching about it.
---
imagine being this angry
---
WoWhead is putting up guides on the regular.
---
Eh, it's nothing like that in guild chat. Sure there are some fanboys, but for the most part it's just people playing the game in a zerg style guild.
---
I think Towlie has game chat on his stream if you're curious to what it looks like.
---
The future of World of Warcraft. 
---
BFA &gt; Classic &gt; Expac after BFA &gt; BC &gt; New Expac &gt; WOTLK
---
Question is what after that? And another question is how do they continue to develop and handle the legacy servers?
---
What are you gonna do when their thousands of viewers start camping your corpse?
---
Do you watch sports?
---
You really wanna compare michael jordan with a streamer?
---
I never wore FR gear on rag as tange DPS in vanilla. FR is overrated.
---
2 hander + windfury + auto attack + earth shock on cooldown.
---
Yeah it’s fairly customizable. Fun game to give a shot if your looking for an MMO to kill time before Classic
---
They could be considered grossly overpaid then. Blizzard's actual marketing team should have only given beta to those signing away a percentage of income while streaming the game. But that would be shitty.
---
I want to say the origin of the word itself is POG meaning Play of the Game. Eventually just morphing into people shouting POGGERS
---
Probably because of the principle d the matter. It comes from a place of entitlement expecting special service and the ability to self-police someone who is playing the game in a way you don’t like. Idk I don’t have particularly strong feelings about stream sniping to begin with but his rant was absolutely childish and entitled.
---
And count the headlights on the hiiiigh-waaaaay
---
There's a chance all of them will be on the same server to capitalize on the fact that they can organize events together/ up their own streamer counts.
---
I’ve lost these rolls as a hunter....
---
Ouch...
---
A company that got 2.3 billion in profits last year is not a small company, even compared to one that got 6 billion.
---
People here are acting all doom &amp; gloom having made massive assumptions about streamer's personalities based on uninformed hive mind reactions out of what I have to assume is jealousy.  I'm really not even surprised by the idiocy but still amazed at how vindictive people are getting over this all.  They're even proving soda's point on needing a blacklist with the number of people who have now made it their mission in life to snipe and camp him.  It's hilarious yet depressing to watch this all unfold.
---
I really cannot understand how them getting their names effects your GAME in any way. You're just whining
---
They are both great. Paladins have incredible mana efficiency and are not only the best pvp healers, they might be the best group pvp class in the game.
---
I think it's mostly because of the personality of his stream persona being the stereotype of a neckbeard elitist which is pretty amusing.
---
It's like James Rolfe and the Angry Video Game Nerd, imo.
---
I can honestly say I admire some streamers more than I do Michael Jordan...
---
I don’t like basketball. Never watched basketball. 
---
I did like Space Jam though...
---
It’s ok, i identity as non gender specific murloc kin
---
I'm not a ganker at all, however if I was in the US I'd roll on the same server as soda just to gank him. What a cry baby.
---
Why don't warlocks fit in better than hunters? They too have a pet and can dot multiple people at the same time and watch them die
---
How is it clearly not? You’re so set on tarnishing retail it’s fucking weird. All your provided sources are no good insight into subscriber numbers. Sub numbers are private and will be kept that way, but considering they weren’t this low for no content WoD 6.1 to 6.3 - I doubt they are now. 
---
Gtfo.
---
I would say go on youtube and watch some of ''which class should I pick?'' videos. There are many, every youtuber has made one
---
Choosing a class is 1st decision you will have to make
---
Nice try, child of Sodapoppin.
---
Are you serious? They are absurdly overpowered. They just aren't a damage class.
---
That'll be very interesting to see how dps classes shape up so. A lot of the pserver meta might not apply at all
---
You just walk out of MC after majordomo, get the buff, and  kill Rag. Not very hard.
---
They won't have full prebis, they will have some.
---
First character was a Troll Hunter, I was 8 years old and had recently convinced my grandparents to get me a subscription after watching my best friends dad level as a Troll Warrior. Me and my best friend were super young, and loved Lord of the Rings. We would sit and watch his dad play for hours, questing in the Northern Barrens and Dustwallow Marsh, and we became just as addicted. I always loved Legolas and the concept of Bow/Arrow over Swords so I rolled a hunter. My best friend rolled a shaman. 
---
Next expansion (BC) my friend would continue to play his shaman while also leveling a hunter, and I  switched to an Undead Mage in 2007 as my main which is still what I main today. Always keep a Troll Hunter as an alt though! 
---
We never reached level 25 until WotLK just because of our ages, but once we were a little older we were able to understand the game and level at a somewhat decent pace.
---
This guy ganks
---
I almost always play female characters but I'm probably rolling male UD because those casting animations are just too spicy.
---
PvP paladins where PvE players doing some PvP. And since PvE spec did not go holy shock most would not respecc just for that. 
---
Stun was actually a double edge sword. if you stun early you achieve nothing, if you stun late to heal, a trinket followed by a kick or a pummel would lock out bubble.
---
You the MVP if you buff my pet as well. Best druid.
---
I assume they're mostly very young.
---
As an alliance warrior on fresh server I run: 
---
Deadmines (just fucking have to for a weapon...)
---
Stockades 
---
Uldaman
---
Zul’farak 
---
Mara
---
ST
---
BRD 
---
While leveling.
---
Everything else I skip.
---
TBC = Classic WoW
---
100% agree
---
Undead Warlock.  My love of Necromancy as a fantasy trope+The Scourge in WC3+ the excellent intro in the trailer.
---
Yeah, the 1 extra energy I've seen a few times and other people in-game confirmed it. The double-tick I haven't seen. Thanks though.
---
Cool Tell him I sent him a E-Mail and he not replied yet :-(
---
Yeah lemme just contact them to ask if that random guy from reddit really got asked directly by them to join
---
but then everyone is playing on empty servers
---
The reason your argument is fundamentally wrong is because what I said is based on skill, using addons takes no skill and it makes the game easier, on the otherside keyboard turning takes skill and for sure, if you are more skilled than the other person the game should be easier that's how it works.
---
I wish I could do nothing but play video games for a living. The fact that you look down upon them just makes you look spiteful and/or envious.
---
rolling my main on a RP server. problem solved. (also I actually enjoy RP)
---
“Pog” is the cringiest shit ever
---
If you want to melee dps, enhance is a horrible choice. Feral will get some invites as they do middling dps and are great offtanks. Enhance is horrible dps.
---
I felt naked against DPS, sure I could last but I could not do anything.
---
Only if they’re younger than me
---
I would just use shield slam spec on a first week clear but since rag is all fire damage and you will have maxed fire resist, dual wielding isn't going to be that bad for survivability. But you wont have the hit or AP to make fury really good so yea just do shield slam. At least first week. Full prebis, you can mayb go DW.
---
Honestly, trying to hamstring people by running 5 yards in front of them is still worth playing over retail.
---
The fan bases of Ven, Cdew and most of the other arena players are completely different because they are more relaxed.
---
I hope not, they shouldn’t have any privileges, *at all*.
---
heavy and above will eventually sell  
---
definitely vendor scraps, light, and medium
---
Hellfire Penninsula DAY ONE is the pinnacle of World of Warcraft
---
Played a priest and a paladin, priest buffing is actually more annoying.  Assuming you have spirit talent, you spend shit ton on holy candles and still need to drink to buff more then a one group.
---
This is 100% true. Asmongold and a few other streamers played on my retail RP realm for a while during "Project 60" (a project where they locked themselves to a ruleset while leveling to 60 to beat all of the high end vanilla content, they did it on RP realms because there is supposedly no sharding on RP realms) and it grinded RP on the server to a halt for a while.
---
It wasn't Asmongold's fault, as he mostly just explored around some of the RP hubs and even read a few interesting RP backstories without any intent to troll (this is actually how I found out about Asmongold) but his fans literally just trolled every single RP hub all day for days. Roleplayers wanted his head on a pike, but again, I don't think it's his fault per-say.
---
I just thing it's an unfortunate thing that will have to be dealt with by people who want to play on the highest pop realm (which will probably be the one all of the streamers play on.) Hopefully we are all overestimating how big of an effect it will have, because I know that there will be a lot of people who have no idea who these streamers are, or that they are even on a "streamer server."
---
That was actually an interesting and enjoyable video, good work
---
They are and they are beautiful
---
Except Forsen.
---
Love these stories.  Different points ond view of the se path.   I love it.
---
Lucky for me I'm EU!
---
&gt;"STILL arguing that TBC will be the SAFEST bet"
---
It is the safest. You might not agree with it but it IS the safest bet as a business decision which is what he was talking about. The expansion did very well and has a large interest. It was already a proven product, pretty much like classic. They could have just made a brand new MMO with vanillas "core philosophies" but they didn't. They recreated the game people already loved. Because it is SAFER which is the key point you're missing. You clearly don't like TBC and your own bias is showing.  
---
If it comes down to TBC vs 1.13 it makes business sense and is SAFER to do TBC than 1.13. Potential and safety are very different things. Yeah 1.13 COULD do way better than TBC ever did. It could also do even worse than TBC. TBC is already proven though and 1.13 isn't. As a businessman would you rather your company release something that there is demand for and was already well received or something new? Everything you're saying about 1.13 can be applied to BFA. It COULD have improved the game it COULD have been a lot of things, but look where we are now. It is riskier, I don't see how anyone can deny that?
---
Your bias is leading you to the same line of thinking you're condemning him for. It's just you're in favor of 1.13.
---
Here's the thing, you keep saying 1.13 CAN be great it's entirely based on what ifs. Yeah it could be great. It could also ruin classic. Keeping classic classic and adding a new separate option to continue to TBC is safer and keeps classic intact. 
---
I'm down for 1.13 or TBC honestly. I don't really care. All I want is if the time comes where they feel the need to add something is that it isn't forced. Separate servers, you can copy your character over or whatever but your OG classic server stays classic so you'll always have that.
---
The slippery slope of going to TBC leading eventually to cata and WoD and shit like that is just a bad argument. Not all versions of the game are created equal and you know that.
---
Everyone has an expansion and no matter how badly it is received even the most hated expansions are peoples favorites. People will advocate for them. But it's very clear Vanilla,TBC and WOTLK have the largest demand.
---
Maybe part of the skill in this game is using addons, just like part of the skill in this game is knowing not to keyboard turn.
---
If Blizzard didn't want people to use addons, they would prevent people from using them.
---
He's the Everyman
---
It’s never the worst. It’s just people who take the idea that no one does as much dps as a warrior or mage to mean everyone is the worst. Besides Rogues I guess.
---
I just started this series. More to come.
---
https://youtu.be/4UJwwcAPkNg
---
I haven't played any of the Wow classic servers since 2005, but I was a druid main back then and I can tell you that cat form for damage was basically worthless.
---
You used catform to escape CC and stealth, that was basically it.
---
oh god, using it in chat and text is one thing, but repeatedly saying it? cringe indeed
---
For not having any of the level 60 stuff its pretty impressive.
---
That video is funny dude. Y'all are a bunch of snowflakes.
---
“Winning the World Cup? Who cares, It’s been around since 1930! LOL”
---
I tried to read this man I really did. You gotta make paragraphs.
---
Overpowered? A bit strong, maybe I a big organized world PvP. But otherwise they were OK at best.
---
PSA: It doesn't fucking matter what pet you get as long as it has a dps ability it'll be 95% as good as any other. BIS is actually a boar just to trigger all the cat/owl try hards.
---
Ditto!
---
Ask a GM for a few days to check WoW out the day before.  They'll probably give you the time.
---
I don't think I played a single day of my last 6 month sub since I resubbed right when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I'm going to ask for it to be rolled forward around the end of July.
---
And you won’t even have to stream to experience it!
---
RP are totally happening in NA and EU regions, but RPPvP might not.

---
They are good for solo play as well but they can’t kite like hunters so soloing elites isn’t as possible. World pvp is based on what pet you have summoned at the time. If you have a void walker you can fight warriors/rogues well but mages will have the upper hand and if you have felstalker you can dick mages but rogues will eat you alive. Also if you DO die in world pvp it’s all over because after every rez you need to re-summon your pet and that’s slow as fuck and mana costly, so if you’re getting camped you will never have a fighting chance. They are great for leveling and if you specifically spec for pvp at 60 (soul link warlock spec) you will counter everyone but it’s ass for PvE and you only win through out sustaining and not through big burst. Also dot damage isn’t that good because it can’t crit and I don’t think it scales with spell power (I may be wrong on that one). Locks can definitely do solo play better than the rest, I would say only beaten by Hunter and slightly beaten by Druid. This is all my personal opinion though I’m sure valid arguments can be made.
---
If you are a pvp player and you broadcast your location constantly, well, that's on you.
---
Now I suddenly want to roleplay an April Ludgate human warlock. 
---
&gt;Can I have soulstone?
---
“No.”
---
He's dynamite!
---
And yet you still give him Revenue clicks
---
This happens a lot for stats when raiding. Hunter gets rhok delar, then chromag xbow, then KT xbow. Others are considered stat items for melee
---
If your want to be an optimal WoW champion! Leveling a paladin requires two monitors so you can watch Netflix while you auto attack!
---
Oh sad. That is why he not replied. At least Not all Blacklisted me xD
---
Ok right on, so it seems that anything outside of PvP is bannable then. As in, same faction griefing for example.
---
If you want to tank, go warrior. Paladins can tank tho, so if you like being able to be your heal spec and still get 20 points in prot, or go full prot then 20 in holy, you can tank and heal in the same spec. But if you want to be a great tank, go warrior.
---
This isn't exactly true as alliance needs both priest and paladins in pvp to be good.  Just realize as alliance your role as priest is more hybrid then you might otherwise anticipate as you are the only offensive dispel.  You are also more likely to be the target to die, so alliance needs paladins to help support and keep the priests alive.
---
I'm not against all QoL changes made. Especially not ones made during vanilla. But I do think that the private server community's obsession with efficiency leads to the usage of addons that remove much of the challenge thay they're supposedly seeking.
---
If they really wanted to challenge themselves, why do they go out of their way to remove as much of the skill and judgement as possible?
---
I’m just sitting here hoping this is still a thing...
---
A. Unreadable
---
B. Boar is the best here's why
---
1. can be found easily by any race early on
---
2. can eat anything making taming and gaining       loyalty easier
---
3. Charge and dash make for faster pet based pulls and easier pet management 
---
4. A good balance of dps and tanking capability making it more versatile
---
5. Just a good pig boi
---
They do a lot of community events (like project 60, etc.) on RP servers on retail. Doubt that’ll carry over to classic though.
---
Edited! Sorry I'm doing this from my phone. I added a few breaks. Should be better now
---
I don't pay enough attention to the streamers or the deep details like this in the community, thanks. How was this discovered by the community? I'm sure stuff like this isn't supposed to get out in the first place.
---
Ya he has some good points in there about the owls screech but man it hard to read
---
Correct.  TBC didn't give xp either.  Honestly I dont remember when it was introduced though - I just remember playing vanilla and didnt get *into* it until TBC
---
How is it entitlement to tell people he won't play with you if you streamsnipe and grief him?
---
A blacklist isn't banning from playing the game. It just means people who run in the same circles as Soda aren't going to invite you to their guild if you're streamsniping. It's a pretty reasonable condition that's easy to avoid unless you're trying to leech attention from streamers.
---
If people on this sub think streamers are annoying and not worth their time, surely they're not the ones who would make themselves a target.
---
This stuff all started when they had the dueling tournament and level 1s followed people around standing on duelers trying to distract them, even after changing the tournament location multiple times. People are idiots.
---
Dont need to level your enchanting alt right away, just name it and create it and leave all your greens sitting in its mailbox while you level your main. Also I think they are sharding only the starting areas so leveling two characters to 5 will probably be easier than continuing to level elsewhere with increased competition
---
Why do you think this about Hunters?
---
They level very slow but steady. Only down side is you will need 2 sets of gear while you level so you can heal for dungeons from time to time. Yes you can level just Ret or go Prot at 40 but you will get faster groups as a healer. You can heal most leveling 5 mans while not being holy spec just fine as long as your group doesn’t go crazy. 
---
At end game most will want you to heal. If you are okay with that great. They are one of the best healers in both PVP and PVE. Expect to wear non plate as holy. 
---
Yes Ret isn’t as bad as people make it out to be but you should NEVER out DPS a rogue/mage/warrior in equal gear. If you do they are bad. So know that you are being brought for utility and don’t focus so much on damage meters if you go Ret. You can cleanse, you can heal, you can use other great utility spells and you should. Tunneling on DPS makes you a bad Ret paladin in my opinion.
---
If you plan on going Prot for anything other than 5 mans... don’t. You will never come close to a Warrior or a Druid even when it comes to raids. Even if your guild is cool with it. You are still gimping your whole raid team so you can meme. If we get Classic BC Prot was great after that. Really came into its own in Wrath.
---
Thanks. I couldn't remember if the key holds in your inventory after you get it. I imagine the money around the table would require at least two players. Good input.
---
1) Buying grey items into my 20s, travelled all the way to IF as Night Elf just to buy a staff I didnt think was sold anywhere else.
---
2) Not realizing what talents were until mid 20s, then proceeded to mix up talent choices not going down a specific path,  like 8/3/5, etc.
---
3) Not a noob thing, but once lvl 50 realized that my connection wasn't good enough to raid. (I would avoid IF cause it took me 30 mins whenever I went there to get anything done). So became an altoholic and created 5-6 lvl 29 twinks.
---
I like the idea of the screech for group play. Ya that edit looks a lot better
---
 "time to level 7 seconds"
---
this dude gives the rest of the streamers a bad name
---
Pink paw, stances, auras.  Hell yeah.
---
Benediction. I can still remember the first moment i saw a level 60 wearing that beautiful and mysterious staff. That's the moment i understood the scope of this game, that it had real treasures hidden for the players to discover. That some heroes had gone deeper than i thought imaginable and killed monsters bigger than my own demons.
---
It's BEAUTIFUL. My teenages biggest boner, no women has ever given me more excitement than the first time i witnessed an erected benediction of some no lifer who was way ahead of the curve.
---
I didn't even know what a raid was, or who the fuck Ragnaros was. Never heard the word "End game".
---
On the other hand, if the streamer wanted to, they potentially could have an army of people at their beck and call to hunt down a specific individual. That would probably happen in retaliation anyways.
---
Okay I can see this. I haven’t played much WoW in the age of streamers but I watch other game streams. I suppose I can concede that they might make the server about them. But I still would just ignore them. Back in the day I learned to remove non-guild chats because I didn’t need people ranting about the new world order in LFG.
---
"If you do not want people to be able to hunt you, perhaps consider not constantly telling others your up to date location."
---
This reminds me of a certain other faulty argument... "If she didn't want to get raped, why was she wearing provocative clothing?"
---
The two aren't comparable, obviously, but in either case blaming the victim for being a victim doesn't make sense.
---
I don't think what Soda said makes much sense, but what you're proposing is actively contributing to a toxic community whose only goal is to ruin other people's fun. Hurting/inconveniencing others to make yourself feel better isn't going to work.
---
Seems you not have the Balls. Could even have have you a Blizzard Contact :P alright I am out of Here. Much fun on hope for your invites.
---
Anyone who thinks that Classic won't be massively multi-boxed and botted and flooded with the stuff everyone is already aware are super useful/rare/expensive/etc.
---
Yes, you have rage bar as bear, mana bar as nelf/tauren, and yellow bar for kitty.  Can't remember name.
---
Fixed
---
100% agree, in PvE they had no rivals, and scaled insanely with gear. 
---
In PvP the only skill cap I remember for paladins is interrupt baiting, if you were good at that, yes you were GOD. Otherwise you were OK at best. 
---
Priest had options.....a lot of them.
---
Fixed formatting
---
Is there any gear progression guide for oomkin out there?
---
I know it sucks, but I kinda want to be that terrible moonkin pve pvp'er on my non-tryhard. I had enough with pummeler farming on pservers, but still love my drood.
---
I’ve been playing lowbies on the freebie, it’s been so so. Mostly I’ve been toying with the different classes and different professions I have planned for alts. I can’t say as it scratches the itch, it’s very different.
---
no you dont switch bars when you go into stealth, only when you go into or out of a form
---
Your entire statement is an assumption and you are trying to present it as a fact.
---
Happy in EU we dont have this big streamers.
---
Me too.
---
&gt;The sky isn't falling because he wants some mythical blacklist that will never be fully realized.
---
It may not be fully realized, but it's better if we show disdain for the idea rather than defending it or ignoring it. That list, if the idea comes to fruition among people that have literally nothing to lose by enforcing that system using their thousands of fans, could ruin whatever server they are on.
---
You're not a victim if you get killed in a PVP game. You're just a loser.
---
I jumped around IF and inspected every level 60 just wishing I was that level and as geared as them lmao.
---
bfa is nothing like how wow used to be, just wait it out
---
Is he French?
---
I'll take Asmonbad on all servers then.
---
If you dont want to use add-ons then dont use them.  There, now your server is add-on free, as far as you know.
---
Yes?
---
I will drain my souls essence during the night of August 26, and I will probably never be the same again. 
---
From pure willpower my body will transcend into a self powered MageBot that will begin his grind to 60, depleting my inner sanity before I start my final year of college.
---
Then I will attempt two final semesters alongside a senior thesis while trying to get pre-raid BiS.
---
Pray for me.
---
What are you a magician
---
20% additional crit, totalling 30%.
---
What guild is this
---
And this time it won’t be like pservers.
---
Camping the redisdead r3 undead twink in front of astranarr won’t result in a lv 1 gnome screeching obscenities at me 2 minutes later!
---
This is poorly though out. The reason you are wrong is because you assume everyone wants to be a non-magical melee. Which simply isn't the case. The reason why people gravitate to this stuff isn't that they just want to be special snow flakes. It's that they aren't min maxer and actually want to play the game the way it was intended. As an RPG.
---
There's a difference to being just ganked, and being streamsniped. I'm referring to the latter.
---
I once watched a Asmondgold vid on my YouTube on my Xbox....just deleted the app off my Xbox then reinstalled. Once you watch one that's all you ever see on recommended and I was tired of seeing his /r/punchablefaces
---
Did the other Guy ganked him?
---
Hey look, it's like the 10th time today this has been posted.  It is almost like there is a "thought of the day" and people just post it over and over until the next days thought.
---
I'd like to know as well. I played vanilla, but never played melee.
---
If how other people choose to play the game affects your fun, you are in for a bad time.
---
may your report clicking be fast and furious.
---
spiteful? maybe. envious? no.
---
I like being able to do what I want in a game without having to consider if what I'm doing is entertaining a bunch of other people.
---
Unfortunately not, zero excuses. Lol
---
He's an Ohio boy.
---
I mean, for a Hunter, it takes 56 AGI to get 1% of crit.
---
The Barbarous Blade is a prime example of a weapon that everyone will fight over.
---
60 AP and 1% crit is probably the best pre-raid 2hander for a hunter and huntard alike.
---
No, they're just much better overall.
---
Yeah Tips is a great guy.  Committing fraud is awesome.
---
&gt; I don't that 25% of the horde is/was/will be undead.
---
You're right, that's assuming there's an even distribution of races. And we all know no one will play tauren and trolls.
---
Sometimes you just don't want to deal with it. I play a game to have fun, not to be bombarded with people talking about exterminating the jews, how n*****s are subhuman, etc.
---
"Beating them" isn't even an option since they're on the same faction as you.
---
Negative.  They have not done any kind of legwork I guarantee it.  If they really had they would see that RP-PVP servers are over 50% more popular than standard RP servers but yet they still plan on implementing those at launch.
---
Then don't play on their server.
---
Is pally tanks stacking SP a thing in vanilla or was that a tbc only thing?
---
Very true, good example too.
---
That's my hope for sure.
---
Why do people keep fucking up thinking raid buffs are on 5m cooldowns? Greater Blessings are already available in Phase 1.
---
Boar is best because it ducking eats everything so you don’t have to worry about running out of a certain type of food.
---
Bots might be a problem on a pve server. On a pvp server they just food.
---
Whenever a streamer says "we did it boiz" I want to puke
---
So is playing video games.  Some people just wanna have fun man.
---
Streamers Just get Carried xD
---
Paladin isn't great 1v1, but they are legit the best group healer in vanilla.  The above statment couldn't be further from the truth.  
---
In fact holy paladins didn't even have to be terrible at 1v1, with enough spell power [shockadin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay7RU0N-44Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) is ok while not great dueling spec.
---
Looks like it falls to you. You and me and every individual player to decide to go out into the world. To decide to make events. To decide to contribute to the community and not sit in town and play queue simulator.
---
You can see which servers they play on. Pick one that they aren't on.
---
Way too many people called it Sholomance ignoring the c and the fact that it was a school.
---
If you use his stream to find him and follow him about or gank him, him and his friends won't invite you to their groups.
---
Wondering this as well, would love to raid as boomkin but will probably just pvp as 31/11/11. Still need good gear tho!
---
“Out ranked warriors easily” 
---
“Depended on the boss” 
---
Understatement of the year right there.
---
Thats a cool addon. Gonna Grab it.
---
I like groups that lay out rules beforehand for this reason. 
---
Really, though, the biggest arguments won't be "hunter rolls on strength axe" but rather "you are an enhancement shaman, don't take healing cloth pieces"
---
I watched and can vouch it's not monetized. Just some EU dudes rambling about how they feel about the content plan.
---
Be lucky you weren't me. I didn't realize you could fear other players until very late in the game on a pvp server. My time in STV was a nightmare. 
---
(At the time I didn't think the computer would take over and make the player walk around feared like they do, so I only thought it was possible to fear mobs) I don't game much.
---
That's not a fair point at all, he compressed 15 years of gameplay changes and multiple massive overall game design changes into a single step. TBC proved that you can fix classes, keep class identity, keep class interdependence without homogenizing everything.
---
That being said, I usually no longer participate in threads like this since it's pretty clear such changes are off the table. I still believe that Vanilla content + TBC class mechanics would have been something truly special, but oh well no use arguing about it anymore now that Blizz has weighed in on the direction for Classic.
---
At 8m:
---
&gt; I’m hoping asmongold rolls alliance on our server... he thinks people are gonna gank him too much— yeah that’s the point. I’m literally gonna be stream sniping off stream. I don’t care what anyone says. If he goes on our server I will 100% log in and snipe him. I’m gonna stream snipe, I don’t care.  It’s gonna be fun.
---
Reeeee, it was the only way to end #streamerprivalage Reeeeeeee!
---
The player bar helps with hamstring/earthbind kiting and helps rogues not clip their main hand autos. 
---
The target bar helps with trading in PvP, study crit reactive procs, and when to pop cooldowns that block swings like Shield Block.
---
The hunter bar helps hunters not clip their autoshot by moving/casting and gives them a cast bar because Aimed Shot and Multi-Shot dont have cast bars in Classic.
---
You seem to know a lot about this, and I'm completely confused.
---
Can you give an example of what stream sniping in WoW is and how it hurts the streamer?
---
Keep gargling those corporate balls. I'm sure youll be rich some day.
---
Will the old stay forever or they abadon it?
---
I have to agree with us. As much as it didn’t make sense as many times as I lost shit that I could use to someone who is just going to auction it off, fair is fair. Now if their guild member and they know that’s helpful for me, and they make it very obvious they’re just going to sell it, trust me that I made a little mental note LOL
---
This is essentially how the LFG channel used to be used, isn't it? Let you post the thing once and do away with spamming the chat channel. I see no reason why that would be so bad.
---
I'd say hybrids don't exist because Blizzard made us stop building hybrid specs.
---
ok so something they could have just typed out here, but instead they have to make a video and promote their YouTube channel here and get those dank viewers. gotcha.
---
Streamers = population = content = fun. I don't even watch streams of wow that much anymore (not since cata) but it seems like streamers will have the people to do some fun shit.
---
My knowledge comes from like 14 years ago but cat form was worthless for combat in vanilla. Basically you could get outdamaged in catform by hunters pets.  You don't open with cat form, you would do more damage by nuking them after rooting them in place.
---
Bear form gave you survivability where you could attack casters who were also squishy.  When I would play pvp, it is basically to conserve mana, and use my HoTS to restore health while I whittle away my opponent down.
---
As a druid, you won by outlasting your opponents. Using your HoTS before going bear form and using your Moonfire Dots to just slowly bring them down.
---
What were those streamers streaming prior to WoW classic? BFA, right?
---
It really won't.
---
If you're basing this on private servers that are vastly overpopulated with a global playerbase, you're in for a shock. Most of those people won't be paying for Classic, and even if they do, they'll likely be split up enough that their idiocy is significantly diluted. Plus, you can't get away with a lot of private server crap on blizzard servers.
---
Corpse camping has a pvp solution, ninja looting doesn't. When you join a pvp server you consent that you will be put into unfair pvp situations.
---
I bet those Linux laptops will run classic pretty well too 👍
---
Probably look at it this way...
---
HARD to gear...
---
- Classes lacking multiple armor proficiencies (Rogues, and cloth wearers)
---
- Items that multiple classes will be needing (Truestrike Shoulders come to mind)
---
- Class/Spec that are not seen as optimal (Competing vs others, won't get invites)
---
- BIS items that need to be crafted (crafting guarantees you the item, but in vanilla is very expensive)
---
- Lack of 'friends' or guild. Anything is going to be harder to accomplish if you don't know anyone.
---
owl is super noob trap. Cat all the way.
---
And that difference is what, exactly?
---
I would definitely look at the market for cooking mats. 
---
Crafting professions are designed so that you typically get the mats to make something 5 levels after you could have started using it, but there's also a real cost in bag space and recipe costs to cooking a bunch of odds and ends. As a result, it makes sense to buy the mats you need early, and then sell the mats later when you farm them yourself.
---
For example, cooks at level 15 want tangy clam meat. It vendors for 22c, so it's EASY to justify diverting it from the vendor. 
---
Consider a 2s price point. (I can only use private server prices as I do not have the beta). 
---
At 2s each, a stack sells for 40s. WELL worth mailing to your bank alt at level 20.
---
At 2s each, it's well worth buying, too. That means you have a full stack of on level buff food. 5 hours of heavy combat worth of 6stam/6spirit for only 1 bag slot for is a big deal, and I would say well worth paying that price. that's why you HAVE skinning. so you can buy stuff like this.
---
And then when you get your own clams, you know that you can either sell them for 2s each, or the actual natural price point is lower at server launch.
---
I don't know what tangy clam meat will go for at launch. But I definitely think it's worth buying AND selling. And that's what you need for a market. Even on a mature server, with inflated prices, I think it's worth immediately buying enough mats to cook a full stack of buff food at levels 15, 25, and 35. Why not at launch, when things are cheaper?
---
I haven't done shit in retail since I've gotten the beta.
---
I think about it like this:
---
I know that all my progress will be completely wasted once 8.2 goes live. All the boss grinding, all the m+ farming, and all the dailies mean nothing.
---
Yeah, nothing will matter once Classic is live, but at least I'm having fun. What's next for retail? Another expansion of gear treadmilling?
---
Asmonbronze
---
I dont think many of them will care, soda has like 5 different names he uses randomly
---
&gt;Dont need a useless ret player in raid doing less dps than the tank.
---
Crazy exaggeration 
---
&gt;Pretending ret pallys actually provide utility and don´t blow all their mana on trying to do damage is a lie.
---
What´s that even supposed to mean? Literally all paladin players are unable to manage mana and use Blessing of Protection, or Blessing of Sacrifice, or Lay on Hands?
---
&gt;A ret pally can't even hit Ragnaros lol.
---
What?..
---
tell that to the streamers demanding a blacklist for "stream snipers" AKA anyone who manages to kill them in PvP ;)
---
As long as you don't have Soda's stream up on another screen, this won't even affect you.
---
Why are alcoholics like necrophiliacs?
---
They both want to crack open a cold one.
---
Hey thanks a lot! Glad you liked it :)
---
Lol, this has nothing to do with my views. Just an observation of how the world works currently.
---
I personally love the challenge of "how can I get away from this chump and ruin his griefing fun by surviving?"
---
I even have a catchphrase in my friend group on pservers: Y'all can get camped all you want. I don't get camped. I get away.
---
Ill take that as your defeat.
---
It's summer if you're an adult.
---
Simple as that haha
---
It depends. They spend less time doing the raid itself, but much more time in preparation. Beyond just farming for consumes and such, guilds that play this way typically mandate practicing upcoming raids on PTR as well.
---
That is awesome!
---
Yeah no fucken shit I’m not gonna. But thousands of unaware others will.
---
Did you read the text in the post? I was pretty clear that I wouldn't be the one streaming. If it were me getting camped though, just log onto an alt? Go watch some Netflix?
---
I find this pretty shitty if it happens, these favours...
---
There's very little good leather spell damage gear in the game before AQ40, so your gear progression will essentially be the same as mage/warlock - just look up those lists.
---
Ching and Quinnyboi
---
I mean it's not really that weird of an attitude.  You wanna go down to the YMCA to hoop it up with your boys only to find Boogie Cousins is down there in the paint grabbing every single rebound making every single layup and hitting you with some elbows in the process?  Nope.  You wanna sit down with your buds to play some cards and have Justin Bonomo saddle up next to you and take everyone's money every single hand?  Hard pass.   If I log in and some streamer is there and everyone is quickly logging on to jump and dance around them so much that it causes lag and stuff then I'd probably be mad also.  
---
But then again, truthfully that probably won't ever happen so on the flip side I'm not gonna waste the energy being theoretically mad at something now that most likely won't happen in the future lol
---
&gt; They made $344M in revenue on Blizzard products in Q1 FY19 with 32M monthly active users 
---
If you would took the time and compile the data from the last 2 years, quarter to quarter, you would see that in the last 2 quarters of 2018, HotS and Overwatch have 83% of the MAUs and almost 85% of the revenue.
---
And this trend was most likely in Q1 2019.
---
Out of $344 million, 83-85% of the revenue is coming from Hearthstone and Overwatch, which is around $290 million. The rest of $55 million comes from WoW, Diablo 3, Starcraft, HoTs, and the MTX are probably more than half of that income.
---
The income from WoW was probably half of those $55 million.Maybe $30 million, with a good chunk from MTX. So, when WoW was in top 10, in March, it was with around $30 million in revenue.
---
Is that a long shot to say that their revenue in April was around $20-25 million, INCLUDING microtransactions? When BfA is bleeding subs like crazy? No, it is not a long shot, is a logical, educated guess.
---
When you remove the MTX, which are probably 20-30% of the WoW revenue, you got left with $15-17 million from subs.
---
And that is just above 1 million subs.
---
As for MAUs, WoW maybe have 1/10th of the total. Which is around 3.2 million MAUs.
---
It's REALLY BAD.
---
&gt;Gorilla: Listen I feel you on this one, everyone wants a big fuzzy Mike Tyson by their side and I can't argue.
---
Haha what xpac was it with monkeys. I don't remember them being that good but Holy shit were they annoying. The noise... I can still hear it in my nightmares ever so faintly.
---
I don't have to do that since they will not be a part of my community experience
---
If they implement dualspec or togglable graphical upgrades you aren't forced to use it either, yet everyone starts pissing themselves when you mention it.
---
Wont happen.
---
I'd find this to be quite the dick move tbh !
---
I’m struggling to see why you would post this here. What’s the win for you? That everyone agrees that it’s ridiculous, or perhaps praises what you did? 
---
In my experience if you’re this keen for it you’ll find a guild anyway.
---
BoE’s are a different beast. And anyone rolling need on a BoP item to vendor is a different kind of asshat.
---
I loved the random encounters that broke the grind and monotony and turned into great battles or long tight running. Triggering hardcore raid guilds by purging world buffs in front of the instance, killing a few key or just simply fighting for a resource. It brings challenge and fun.
---
And there are the pve servers which I have no data on, even after all these years..
---
EU reporting :')
---
Certainly not Goldshire. Not enough naked Night Elves.
---
Glad you agree! LoL isn't hard. finding a stable team to grind with is the hard part... or lucking out and hoping your team work together instead of throwing cause they lost first blood.
---
it's 1 league below master ( who would be mythic), something like 10% or less of the playerbase.
---
Now, why are you comparing PvP game with a PvE activity again? and why did you pretend MOBA where hard?
---
Look at all those people who disagree :o no hivemind for you pal
---
Hmmm, well in the p server I'm on I'm doing skinning/leather working and I do enjoy it. Making some coin while I level too. Maybe I'll just stick with that post 60.lol I know as a hunter I can make devilsaur and what not later on anyways. Thank you for all the insight!
---
It doesn't matter who does it, streamers guild are gonna be full immediately on launch, help will come faster than you can find them.
---
I was once camped,  thought fair enough ill just watch a movie and come back,  the motherfucker was still there waiting for me 3 hours later, hovering in a tree on his flying mount.  I couldn't fucking believe it.
---
Has nothing to do with white males and everything to do with people being dumb, lifeless, losers that want to be part of something bigger than their pathetic lives.
---
Get off your high horse.
---
I commend how well written and detailed it is, but a lot of the core information is completely wrong.
---
What’s wrong with going full try hard if you want to?
---
There were no BGs at the start of the honor system in the original release and that is what people are talking about.. 100% of the day every day it was a massive TM vs. Southshore battle on my server and it was always epic.. 1.12 will be different with BGs already in the game.
---
If you've found someone once, you can corpse camp them over and over. You don't need to watch his stream for that. 
---
As it is, people like Soda get ganked in a low pop zone *once* and they immediately blurt out "STREAM SNIPER!" because that's just so much easier than accepting an irrelevant defeat
---
oh, sorry. wasn't aware I needed to be on twitch executive comittee to state obvious fact such as people rather play game than watch game when they have access to it.
---
Did you try to make a point here?
---
sup dude, lok tar, how many times have u got rekt since last we spoke?
---
You don't understand it because you're not a moron.
---
Celebrity worship is reserved exclusively for imbeciles.
---
Keep in mind that phase 2 adds the honor system but battlegrounds aren't added until phase 3. At the very least, there'll be massive amounts of world pvp in phase 2.
---
can we blacklist big streamers and force them all on to the same realm so the rest of us can avoid their cess pool?
---
For me it'll be talking with friends on discord, but that's not everybody's go to, and not always, sometimes you want chill music, I get you 100% don't worry, I'm just thinking a stream on the side won't be the norm, so less viewers overal
---
That is pretty cool.
---
I watched his videos a few years back when Nostalrius went down and he was just alright.  I remember him shit talking the vanilla community.
---
I assume now that it's actually getting created he's changed his tune completely to get in the vanilla communities good graces, he seams like the type of Kripparian-scumbag who would do that.
---
Now apparently he's blown up and my feed is full of those worthless react videos where he just steals another persons content by replaying it and probably saying something dumb from time to time.
---
Oh it's a mountain alright...
---
Feign Death+
---
You crazy son of a bitch you did it
---
Glad I won't see you.
---
Cuz not a single guild will have a full roster of pvp geared players on BWL launch
---
Blacklisting happened in vanilla and will happen again in classic. You don't even have to be a streamer. My guild had a blacklist of assholes on the server.
---
I don't think screech would be usable in raid due to debuff limit.
---
yet, once BG come out you can bet world PvP will shrink to nothingness... as it did back then.
---
His opinion very much reflect reality.
---
It's just a meme template with the situation, come on, so many people taking this seriously... I don't have time for that shit, I'll be rediscovering Classic on EU with friends man
---
Correct OP then and teach the youngins
---
Me, a dedicated Prot Warrior:  "Okay, but I get to roll on the stat stick ranged weapons."
---
That's pure BS. Mage, rogue and WL insignia do not break stun effects
---
I've been playing on US-Kel'Thuzad server regularly since November 2004. I didn't even know Asmongold was on my server until 2018. I never even heard of him until something like 2016 or 2017. I still don't know much about him. I can assure you that playing on the same realm as a streamer is no big deal.
---
Was Asmongold playing on Kel'Thuzad since launch 2004? I still don't know anything about him (other than he obviously is/was a streamer on US-Kel'Thuzad)
---

---
I
---
so how do you tell these two apart?
---
I'd say a good chunk of end game is available to non-tryhards. You can do MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20 without really tryharding. BWL is a happy medium. Where you really need to be hardcore is when you keep world bosses on farm and go for AQ40/Naxx.
---
Welcome to reddit where people that have better thing to do actual have nothing better to do.
---
haha, man that would be some big bad karma, hope you're not a medium
---
&gt; Yeah you definitely want a **loot council based DKP system** and make sure everyone knows that from the start. Hunter wants a dagger that a rogue needs? That's too fucking bad and it's not what your (hunter) DKP is for. The DKP is to take the judgement out of the loot council's choice not taking the judgement out of where the item would go best. You can just say 'rogues put in a bid for this dagger' and if no rogues put in a bid then you can open it up to the crowd. You don't want a mindless DKP system that would be so stupid. Hey that priest had the most DKP so give him TOEP. Hey that rogue has the most DKP give him that binding. Hey main tank, we're not going to give you the tanking set piece because this dps warrior thinks it looks cool. Nope that's not how it works, if you're in a guild where that's how that works you need to get out. 
---
This is exactly what I'm saying that you don't want. The logic behind deciding to use DKP is to remove human judgement from the process. If you can create rules arbitrarily to say who has a right to get each piece of gear, then you are going to face the same kind of questioning about your policies as you would running a loot council. If your goal is to take out the drama and avoid having your decisions questioned, DKP isn't going to do that without removing restrictions on gear. 
---
I'm not saying that DKP isn't a decent system, but it's not 100% fair or immune to exploitation. I can say that my GM was constantly fielding whispers about loot distribution in vanilla, even when we used DKP.
---
People are pissing off because those weren't part of the game back then. I don't think you understand the topic very well.
---
Mana users can not be in melee range of ragmaros or he will cast on the melee. Rets can literally not participate in the fight besides being crappy healers.
---
As a tank I constantly out dmg a geared ret paladin swinging hand of rag and maxing out on consumes on private server. Ret paladin dmg is very bad. 
---
The idea that they provide this mystical utility is just not a strong argument as they bring nothing a holy doesnt and them actually saving the raid with a LoH or a BoP is very very rare. Will happen in like 1 in 20 raids maybe. And a holy could just do it.
---
A single server is not representative of the whole. There were high pop PvP servers that barely did any WPvP and high pop PvP servers where it was an every day occurrence.
---
Also, did you ever ask yourself "what was the point?" When you finished a video game?
---
We play for fun. The reward is fun.
---
Why do I gear my characters in raids? So I can melt things because it's fun.
---
I bet you're a hit at parties, OP.
---
What's so bad about that lol?
---
Idk what it stacks too.  I also dont know 100% the 16 debuffs thst take priority
---
Same! Its not hard at all.
---
Decent dungeon blues can get you spellpower and damage but your HP will be small so ultra glass cannon. Around Rank 10 u can get good blues from pvp (depending on patch) and rank 10 is totally obtainable unlike rank 14.
---
The gear progression sucks unfortunately. The amount of spell crit and mp5 you will need (on top of spell damage instead of raw healing) is few and far between prior to AQ.
---
Play as you are now.. 
---
Ask ingame, make a few friends while you play. Many people rush to 60 and grind gear since that is their style. Play as you like, if you are really stuck and noone is helping you (which I doubt) just Google.
---
Didnt want to roll alliance for the 72747839th time
---
Thanks for getting in! Simply joking about the situation, it's sad people waste time on that, but it's also sad to think you can stream your gameplay with no consequence on it whatsoever, so I'm quite neutral on this
---
Because they're better...
---
Lol likewise buddy
---
I think it’s also because he’s a loser who makes alot of good points, I’ve seen a couple of his videos where he describes his thought process and I tend to agree with him. He’s utterly insufferable as a personality tho.
---
yeah you're right but alliance races aren't that much better tbh
---
The real question ITT is why do people make low effort posts?
---
Primarily because of math and the fact that Druids cannot use weapons in cat form.
---
Normally the way every instant attack ability scales for a rogue is this:
---
* Ambush: 4.5 * Weapon Damage + 300 or something.
---
* Weapon Damage == Raw Weapon Damage + Attack Power * Some Constant (This depends on weapon type, and other things)
---
Now lets look at "Ravage" on Cat Form
---
* Ravage : 3.5 * Weapon Damage + 300 or so
---
* Weapon Damage: Cat Claws Damage + Attack Power * Some Constant (This depends on weapon type, and other things)
---
The difference between these two is that essentially as a Rogue, Warrior, or Hunter you have 2 things you can do to improve your ability damage. You can increase attack power through Str, Agi, + Attack Power, and you can also get a better weapon with raw damage improvement. As a druid your only option is to get Attack Power.
---
Basically the damage doesn't scale well, and part of the reason for that is because if you could do as much damage as a rogue, while still being able to instant-heal yourself, it wouldn't be super fun for anyone involved, except maybe you.
---
That being said, I can still ravage for 1800 on clothies and rogues with blue gear so... its not so bad.
---
It's not about BfA. It's just about WoW as a channel. That's why Classic and Bfa are considered on the same launcher and why the release is for August. They can legally claim high numbers for WoW.
---
This is actually a pretty important point.  
---
In 2005, it was extremely hard to coordinate 40 people, let alone hundreds. We literally texted each other if we needed to down a world boss.  
---
In 2019, it's easy to coordinate thousands of people in real time, and that will change the dynamics of servers substantially. It's also easier to organize multiple raids within one mega-guild, all organized in Discord.  
---
Once everyone hits 60, it will be easy to summon 100 players into one zone and dominate anyone else who isn't zerging at the same level. Also, the leaders of these mega-guilds know each other, and can coordinate efforts to monopolize the world pvp experience.
---
We see this effect in the Beta already, with Tip's guild rocking 1000 players on the PvP server.
---
So it's not actually the stream sniping you have a problem with, but the general idea of players rolling opposite faction on the streamers server specifically so he can be a PVP target for them, and then actually PVPing him on a PVP server? 
---
So even if they did that without stream sniping, that would be bad in your book?
---
Ganking is ganking, stalk an area, find prey, have at em. *Regardless of who they are*
---
Streamsniping is locating a streamer through their stream, going to them, and killing them *because they're a streamer*
---
Well I'm a smelly cow IRL, So....
---
Throw shit at your enemy for CC. Ridiculous pet
---
He left something with his IRL name on his desk before streaming, people found his personal information, looked him up and found that he committed fraud for a million, something along those lines.
---
Jokes on you that’s what I was going to name my Hunters eagle pet.
---
Official forum post gets lots of chatter - someone copies it to Reddit 10x - makes it's way back to the official forum the next day by someone else.
---
Repeat.
---
To echo this, you can 1v1 anyone in the game if you are on equal footing in terms of skill/gear. Some classes are a lot more difficult than others (rogue/warrior), and can come down to a bit of luck sometimes.
---
I mean, 1MM subscribers and 20MM in revenue is still staggeringly good. Blizzard probably didn't even spend $20MM developing BFA, so to continue to see those kind of monthly revenue numbers from a game that is as poorly received as WoW is right now is very serious IMO.
---
Play Subnautica... It's slow pased and awesome.
---
This game was large before the streaming cancer that this POS is part of. Someone should make a guild for called stream snipers and all they do is hunt bitches like this down. It sounds like there's more than enough players to make his blacklist useless.
---
Is that a reference to this?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSEer6mC\_oE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSEer6mC_oE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
you make valid points. but consider the following:
---
if people didn't play Horde, Alliance wouldn't have anyone to fight against. and then we wouldnt have a game, now would we? ;)
---
Hamstring kiting. allows you to know when you can attack so you can only be attacked when you are attacking.
---
Right here. 
---
I generally tour every xpac but my highest level right now is 113 before I stopped. It's fairly dreadful.
---
&gt; just pick what's going to help you first and foremost
---
Yup. Think of selling things as what to do with the excess.
---
&gt; you won't be getting a lot of gold when there literally isn't much in circulation
---
Another fine point. If you're savvy at the AH you might end up with relatively more gold than other players but the costs we tend to care about (mounts and training) are essentially fixed. They go down a bit with reputation but not that much.
---
So you're largely going to be at the mercy of farming gold into existence. Through quests, loot, harvesting, etc. So being efficient with that gold is important. This is where make things you can use first and foremost is important. It allows you to spend less on what you have. Additionally, if you have useful items to smooth over difficulty spikes (good armor, consumables, whatever) then you're going to level faster. Being a high level gives you more ways to generate gold and better ways.
---
I guess I would say, in a sense the best way to make money in WoW is to reach level 60 and start farming for it. You could for example, level a mage to 60 first. I want to play a warrior for the sweet tanking. So I expect to have money issues all the way to 60. At some point I'll be leveling an alt, either a druid or mage, to help with the money issues but I don't know how early on I'll start doing that.
---
Mercenary groups have not had a meaningful position in the Eve universe for a long time.
---
This is an answer in the sense of I'm joking about THAT situation buddy, I'm not taking sides here, I'm on EU. And tbh, there shouldn't be a consequence from using a streamer's weakness, don't you think? They gotta admit that making thousands of fuckin dollars, getting ganked from time to time just cause they don't wanna put even 1 minute of delay is a pretty okay price to pay.
---
&gt; Idk the context of anything other than the video highlighting his rant about blacklisting but his idea as I recall was to literally block people from in game content for ganking him.
---
It has nothing to do with ganking. It has to do with being an annoying, attention-seeking presence in his stream whether you're horde or alliance.
---
As I mentioned in my previous comment, his annoyance with streamsnipers manifested after **players of the same faction** tried to sabotage the dueling tournament. People keep telling him to play on a PvE server when it wouldn't even solve the issue.
---
&gt;Giving someone power simply because of their social status is a bad idea
---
I agree, but this is what Classic WoW is. Just look at nearly every guild back then. Your power within the guild was based on your rank within it, and if you acted like an asshole, you'd be gkicked and your GM would post on the server forums to make sure everyone knew. You can't have a strong gaming community and anonymity at the same time.
---
I don’t want to get blacklisted by chance sodapoppin Morris so I’m playing horde.
---
I did not mentioned earnings.
---
I can't mix something that I was never mentioned in the first place.
---
My first toon was a night elf hunter back in vanilla. It’s a very survivable class, and is easy to learn. When classic comes out that’s what I’m gonna roll again.
---
TL;DR
---
Owl stronk, Screech OP
---
The topic is QoL Changes.
---
And you already stated you are fine with QoL which are optional to use.
---
haha pretty much !
---
Aww man moonkin!!! I love it dude
---
for PvP, sure
---
Curious who of Them designed him :D
---
Only thing more worthless would be your post.....
---
The only downside IMO is that most shoulder gear for them is too small and hurts the intimidation factor
---
Cue. Que is Spanish for 'that'
---
listen here, i hate you. keep your filthy upvote
---
its not ascetics for me. its story based. the underdog lost and forgotten races join together to battle the dominate more prestigious races for control of the world.
---
Biased here, I was Rank 1 on paladin in season 1 and 2 TBC.  Glad, but not rank 1 on an alt priest in season 2.  
---
The skill cap is arguably higher on paladin as you lack instant heals or a 2nd spell tree to cast from so literally ever heal is a risk, and since you lack PWS or something like NS you must anticipate healing need before the person actually takes damage.  At the same time, only bad paladins ignore offense.  A well timed hoj or even offensive holyshock+judge is not minor burst when added to other players damage.  Remember 1.12 paladins get hammer of wrath as well, so you have ranged execute.  
---
In group pvp paladins are typically the backbone healer, and priests are the flex.  Avoiding CC with los and bosac, and avoiding kicks is paramount to success.  Priests are expected to have lost globals to frequently being the focus target.
---
Venruki, Perplexity, Esfand, smoothmcgroove, madseason, great people for SURE! It's just the annoying ones make a lot of noise :(
---
So how exactly do you prove that someone is stream sniping rather than just, you know, playing the game until Arial 40 red "KILL ME PLEASE" appears somewhere on their screen and they do just that?
---
WoW is not exactly that big, and the world design is made that Horde and Alliance constantly run into each other after the low levels. Even in low pop zones I've frequently had random PVP encounters.
---
Truth. Thats why i roll with tauren of dwarv fems they thiccc af
---
Nostalgia? LOL

I would highly recommend you not to read / watch any guides, but rather to explore the game with an open mind. 
---
Of course you should do what you want to do - but I think I'm not the only one that would pay a lot to experience World of Warcraft for the very first time. 
---
Don't worry about being a noob, you'll have plenty of time to optimise your gameplay once you hit lvl 60, and hopefully most people will be friendly despite you not knowing everything, and just give you some good advice on the way :) 
---
I have a few friends that'll be experiencing wow for the first time for real in classic, and I've agreed with all of my "veteran" friends that we let those guys enjoy the game, and won't just rush them through, or blame them for being slow. We can always help them, and bring them to some raids :)
---
You are absolutely correct rogues could not break stuns. I guess maybe it was a dispel visuals I remember since you could dispel HOJ. 
---
Mages had ice block and blink.
---
yeah midnight is ridiculous :')
---
A lot of popular streamers in the beta played on private servers for years. Some are also world class players both in PvE and PvP. They also have a way to play all day every day. You going to beat them to anything?
---
Why would I want to be a human, i already am and it sucks.

Tauren ftw.

Oh look another fascist dictating how people are allowed to have fun.
---
Oh uh well I live in... Wait a minute...
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted, it feels like people here are way overrating cat form. 
---
Back in original Wow, I was one of the first 10 druids to 60, I was in the best raiding guild at the time and I was very proficient at PVP.  I had a reputation as being a very skilled pvper on my server.
---
The way you want to play a druid is basically how I played it. The people who are saying cat form is necessary for pvp frankly do not know what they are talking about.  
---
You use catform in pvp for mainly two reasons. 1) sneak function 2) break CC and dash away.  If you try to use catform for damage, you will just get your face melted off. Your damage is pitiful and you can't burst anyone down. The tradeoff from the feral dots isn't worth the loss to your health.
---
We played 2 very different versions of vanilla. Sure the ones going for Grand Marshall were in cities 24 hours a day having 8 people play 1 account. But I loved the battles out of pure anger and vengeance. Meant more. I never saw PVP as a way to get gear I just enjoyed battling people
---
Because the alliance is garbage 🤷

---
\&gt; for simply existing  
---
Well... they exist, and play the game as a full time job
---
So the entire difference is the motivation behind the attack? How do you even know that the motivation behind a gank on Soda was because Soda is a streamer? It seems impossible to tell.
---
It doesn't stack and it's not that big of a debuff compared to the more important ones.
---
Single Target mage rotation lol.
---
nice meta-QQ
---
Oh, i was sure we were talking about addons that give QoL options, not changes to the core game. Yea it seems that you don't understand the topic.
---
Enjoy trying to farm Elementals or herb/mine without finding world PVP.
---
This guy gets it
---
So, as someone who doesn't watch streamers at all...
---
What the fuck was that? People enjoy this shit?
---
Just name your guild one of the forbidden Chinese words or spam global with it and you won't see any farmers.
---
I guarantee you there is going to be raids dedicated to hunting this scum and their followers down within the first week.
---
You know... there is literally a hundreds of thousends of people who use addons like DBM or BW in WoW and they are still shit. Do you know why? Because using the addon and paying attention to addons, reacting to addons and doing raotation etc. at the same time is a skill. You may think "Oh but addon tells you everything, how that can be hard?", well addon tells you everything only if you pay attention and look at what addon wants to tell you. There is as much skill required with and without addons. With the exception that without addons you are playing with - kind of - blindfold. Then again WoW Vanilla didnt have a addon-free server and people were using addons. Why do you want to destroy #NoChanges?
---
Who would want to play alliance? I eat gnomes in STV.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Druid shifting macros are crayzie.
---
Rag wont die until the end of the 2nd week at the absolute earliest.
---
In my opinion making a guild or community to specifically target one person and only play in order to camp that person is toxic harassment. Obviously camping a streamer you happen across is fine, that's part of PvP. My issue is with people in this thread talking about making whole communities and guilds just to 10-20 man camp one streamer non-stop.
---
Doesnt really effect me in the long run as I dont watch streams and obviously dont stream myself but it's just a toxic community thag classic doesnt need.
---
The data you're pulling is "Top Grossing Titles by Category, Worldwide ranked by April 2019 earnings". So the $24 million number from Apex you're using is earnings, not revenue.
---
It’s been said for so many years that only blizzard could make something that kills WoW. No one imagined it would be this!
---
I was off tanking a third string raid where some of the people couldn't get the dance down, and no addon would have helped.
---
A warrior tank would make vastly better use of that dagger than a huntard would make of a 2h str weapon.
---
quin will play on aussie servers.
---
100% lack of insta heals and having only one magic school made it really hard to be a good paladin healer. I know I was not one of them, got rolled by every DPS sooner or later.
---
Undead (and perhaps trolls) are just about the only ones I could play on horde. Too much "For the horde"mouthfoam and too little personal stories, at least thats how it feels to me. Alliance races are just so much more interesting. I suppose I dont experience horde as being individualistic enoug for my liking.
---
Thats when you roll Horde on that same server
---
Call James Cameron if you need the bar raised

You are what they call “ a good boi”

Humans want all other races extinguished, including their allies and have no problem with atrocious labor camps. They're the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for every event that almost destroyed the world. They're the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig up shit they shouldn't. They're the Middle Eastern regimes.
---
Gnomes are... just idiot refugees that can't protect themselves and wiped out 80% of their own population with poisonous radiation. They're the Middle Eastern peasants.
---
Orcs just don't want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They're the African Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They're the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want peace and for everyone to love the planet. They're the Canadians.
---
Forsaken just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They're the White Americans.
---
The best part is the about 30 seconds after Soda kind of goes back on what he says and then states that he would give up streaming for 3 months if the burden of streaming got in the way of classic. The man just wants to play classic.

Yeah I wonder why people go horde..

Dwarves are seriously the best and usually end up being the friendliest people.  Even most horde respect dwarves
---
I want Thunderfury  so bad but agree I will probably be a third string tank for a semi hardcore guild. :( but I can dream.
---
Stupid idea.
---
I wasn't aware of that, whatever it is/was.
---
Excellent post, lot of good data.  I think the danger to the economy is overstated, but I have always been an economic has-not in WoW.  Even if it is skewed to the fastest levelers, it only changes who is gouging me, not that I will be gouged at the AH.
---
Also, Sorry about your 1000 year ban.  That's 1/10 of an Illidan, which seems extreme.
---
We're obviously getting off track here. I'm not talking about Soda getting ganked by some rando. I'm talking about a guild being formed that *actively hunts streamers*. That's what I see as being toxic.
---
That is precisely what happened. The same will likely be the case come classic. I understand why Blizzard added battlegrounds. I don't understand why they prevented players from ranking up through world pvp. They could have capped battleground honor at rank or something, and then forced players to world pvp for the higher hono ranks.
---
As someone who's on the fence about playing a druid this really helped. I'm going to do it. Thank you.
---
:(. I actually liked the dance cause it was fun to try and maximize DPS as a caster doing the dance.
---
Has this actually ever happened? I mean, streamers like those in question here haven't been unpopular just since last Tuesday. 
---
Is there a video somewhere of a streamer who was corpse camped so hard and by so many players that he could not actually play anymore?
---
Allaince dogs steaming &lt; Horde that can kill them
---
The beta is a great opportunity for newer modders on the scene to show up and get noticed by the community-- I'm hoping you've felt that you're benefiting from that!
---
Great all-in-one addon, I also love the todo items.
---
Hunter weapon timers are especially useful for leveling or pvping as a hunter and basically shooting-&gt;running during recharge-&gt; shooting. A level 1 hunter can get one guaranteed, maybe even 2 additional shots on an enemy. Especially so with concussive shot at like level 8. Realllly makes the 1-10 no-pet levels not a slog.
---
Hunters (at least on the private servers I was on) were also able to basically get a free additional shot in when they timed aimed shot to start casting the moment autoshot finished its "cast".
---
it's almost as if classic was successful once already, and it's success led to Blizzard progressively ruining the game to cater to all those people..
---
I have literally never played wow. Do people get immunity after being hit with CC? Or do you mean spawn immunity
---
Lol, why would you possibly think this? If he makes it past the first lockout, he'll die on day 8. There's zero chance he makes it 14 days.
---
1/10 post for making me respond
---
I would suggest Druid, you can tank or heal any five man or any pluggable raid with the heart of the wild nature swiftness spec. You can't really do competitive DPS, but you can easily farm with your feral gear.
---
I played ED, thanks for the nostalgia remembering NMM haha.
---
I know. This is one of the best aspects of Classic.
---
Don't see your point. They aren't forcing anything.
---
Also mindcontrol in some cases
---
If Boogie was at the gym I would be stoked lol. 
---
I'm also not going to roll on streamer server(s) but this analogy does not hold up.
---
Maybe change it to a local tournament with a cash prize.
---
Yeah it kind of comes down to that 5% boost to silence, one of the lower tier holy talents like unyielding faith, divine STR or healing light, or blessing of sanc.  You can get some of those, but not all.  The baseline is 21/25 for divine str/reckoning and there is a little wiggle room in the lower Holy tree but I think some talents are definitely better than others.
---
Most people play for rewards. Vanilla was no different.
---
I haven't figured out raid signups yet (although this thread has given me some great ideas - thanks), but we're planning to use Discord only for voice channels. If we can find something better for free, or near it, then we will.
---
My solution to guild announcements is having a community manager to set up social media accounts and post updates. We're going to be running a loot council, so I've got officers for tracking raid attendance, guild bank contributions, and loot history. They will all be using a Google Sheet that feeds summarized information for each guild member into a dashboard for quick review to keep loot distribution moving along quickly. A shared spreadsheet that can be actively edited by multiple people is an amazing tool that I wish I had had back in vanilla.
---
I would also argue that using the in-game lfg vs using a 3rd party lfg is an entirely different experience. Picking up 4 players from the WoW Discord or subreddit is going to result in a much different group than simply queueing for lfg; people are more likely to be on comms, more likely to be taking the game seriously, and are more likely to already have a couple of players in their group when they use Discord or Call to Arms.
---
So yeah, arguing "well players can already do this through an addon so Blizzard should implement it as standard" doesn't make sense. Are they giving us swing timers too? Yaht? Joanna's guide? Bongos? Bagnon?
---
The simple solution is to just keep the core game the same and give players a huge number of options in the settings. 
---
Addons are basically just third party settings anyways, so it’d be smarter to just include them built-in. 
---
You don’t want quest help? Turn off the trackers. You don’t want all your bags to show as one giant one? Turn that option off too. Want a damage meter? Click here and it’s yours. 
---
I always used addons because they made the game more enjoyable and unless Blizzard decides to incorporate the most popular addons into the game itself, I guess I’ll have to do it on my own.
---
Zin'rokh, Death's Sting, Servo Arm
---
But then they'll skip out on Eye of Kilrogg and Enslave Demon
---
I've always found my guilds organically in game, meaning I made friends with people who were in a guild and they invited me. This time around I am going to be making a guild with a bunch of friends I've made in other games and a few people from my old classic wow guild.

My buddy works at a high school and hears kids of all races and genders saying twitch shit. If anything it's just skewed to young people in general as they're the ones who took advantage of it and find all that appealing or funny. I'm 30 years old and this is the first time opening twitch since I wanna live vicariously through people on the beta and I have no idea what the chat is saying 95% of the time.

---
The followers, yes.  But that doesn't stop them at throwing money at some narcissistic dipshit so he can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year playing a game, and often by their actions, dictating the way in which a game plays out.  Granted the same could be said for pop music artists, but I honestly don't have a lot of respect for them either.  Video game streamers are still worse though, because have turned something that is fundamentally supposed to be intended for fun and enjoyment in a business.  And then as a result of their actions, they will infect everything that they touch as now any server that they inhabit will have a sizable population dedicated to catering to their needs instead of just playing the damn game.
---
So as long as it isn't a negative opinion, it's okay. What kind of thought policing logic is that?
---
Yeah I get that part.  I can be annoyed by their presence but I'm not going to stop anyone from getting to the paper.  Probably the only way I'd criticize a streamer from making money off a hobby is out of jealousy lol
---
Yeah, we all know how that turned out.
---
Oh man me too. Im sorry I ever willed that thought into existence.
---
Soda is the biggest fucking crybaby there is.
---
Talks about blacklisting people who gank him.
---
the level requirements for DE was added in patch 2.x.x. In classic, you'll be able to DE any item regardless of level.
---
blizzards login servers have been replaced with a single pentium 4 PC with 2gb's of RAM running Windows Vista
---
Yeah.  My personal playstyle is to stay Conc almost all the time, sometimes switching to a resistance aura if we're in a smaller fight (3v3 or smaller) vs a warlock or mage AND I don't have a hunter pet or rogue on me that would cause me significant pushback.  Often I find the silence resistance and 100% pushback immune to be the best overall way to stay in the fight.   Basically every class has a silence or pushback element in a 1v1 fight (other than like.. druids?) and being silenced is a big sad face
---
As a horde druid, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE MY GOD DAMN MOUTH IN A DECADE FFS!

---
I’m waiting until a server list actually comes out. Getting 40+ people to agree on the same server is gonna be aids. Especially when people want to avoid/choose streamer servers.
---
As much as you people hate these streamers, you sure do watch them a lot.
---
I agree . Im saying i can see its use in rp
---
lol yeah bro do you even vidya?
---
I think there will be hardcore groups that clear it super fast. 85% of the guilds will be at a steady pace and clear it in a month or 6 weeks. It won't be easy having 35 to 40 dedicated 60s right away
---
Played rogue to level 30 then I watched a Zalgradis video and rerolled straight to paladin
---
Not that I'm aware of, but like I said I dont watch streamers. But when I original was commenting last night the thread was full of people talking about making guilds and communities just to do that. 95% of the comments were just that. This subreddit has been a lot of anti streamer bias recently so I wouldn't be surprised if it happens on launch but we'll see I suppose.
---
I've done a few 40 man progress raids as the only druid and I'd rather swap guilds or reroll priest then do that again.
---
Yeah your right cooking can definitely be profitable on a fresh server, the buffs from good food definitely help with leveling. Good call. I wonder if it would be more profitable to sell mats for cooking vs finished products
---
People complaining about people who like or dislike streamers is already getting old
---
Honestly, I am having fun playing through Legion as a Warlock, so many demons to enslave. I didn't pay the $50 for BFA, just re-subbed for 1 month at $15 so to me its worth it just to get my finger dexterity back since I haven't played pc games in years.
---
The biggest thing id like to point out is that I was still saving everything I could for epic mount. So while I did have a decent amount it was all for the mount I was gonna dump on and then be below the poverty line lol
---
Did you reply to the wrong person?
---
I disagree, world PvP was a regular occurrence. Arathi Hilands, South Shore v Tauren Mill, STV. Maybe not always huge groups but it was definitely there. I played on Ner'zhul. 
---
If you wanted to initiate some world PvP you just had to attack and take over a low level camp like Hammerfall in Arathi (I play Alliance).  I did NOT camp the lowbies although they would have to give there life to the cause on occasion. 
---
World PvP is about as productive/pointless as playing a video game. Those extra letters and pixles you get from BG's does not make or break the fun for everyone.

Now woukd allow you to not waste a bunch of time

Likely they have discord and you can begin socializing now
---
Skill isn't the only quality when it comes to a streamers popularity, it of course can help a lot, most of it can come from their personality. Shroud got huge for being a god at CSGO then moved into streaming but even when he plays something like a house flipping simulator he can have over 10k viewers because of his personality.
---
If you want to go full big dick and no life search for one now. If you want to chill and hang with boys then finding one later is fine.
---
Yes exactly, first CC hits for 9 seconds, if you do it again within a certain window it does 4 seconds, then 1-2 sec (if I'm correct) and then it doesn't work for a while, each time for a certain time
---
I don't know about that in ED's case  lol
---
Emerald Dream is probably the most toxic cancerous server I've experienced in WoW (I played on it for years). Go back years on their forums, look at the hundreds of ED players on twitter, the server spent years being universally known for doxxing of players over wpvp drama, RBG's, and even the RP'ers would dox each other over RP drama.  
---
There's a reason it's been nicknamed Emerald Drama for over a decade.
---
Maybe you want to read the title of the OP again and then go let your primary school teacher explain it to you, so that you understand it's about QoL addon vs QoL changes.
---
Go enchanting for heart of the mountain trinket. BIS for ferals.
---
This post is shit.
---
pretty much anything will be cheap early on / not sell for much since people dont have much gold
---
decent greens will yield a slight profit as people try to upgrade their leveling gear
---
just vendor your leather (light/medium/heavy) and sell thick/rugged to crafters (who are able to craft and vendor for a small profit), auction fees for leather are stupid high and not worth it
---
save later herbs, as soon as raiding begins people will use herbs for consumables. also save blues/other valuable items for as long as possible. the longer the server goes, the more expensive things will usually get
---
You jinxed it, I can feel it already.
---
I'm not a fan of the horde of people jumping on the hype bandwagon of Classic to get more viewers for their YouTube channel.
---
if you have something important to say, type it out and let your words stand on their own.
---
Yep, I also played on ED in the guild Nyx and had some of my greatest wow experiences that I don't believe I could have experienced on any other type of server.
---
There was one guild on my server Zuluhed, called Brimstone, they were the only guild to clear naxx IIRC and their main hunter had all T3. I remember just drooling over it lol.
---
Great post, but there are a lot of errors when it comes to your formulas and numbers.
---
Uhh... That's in terrokar forest, in TBC expansion. Not vanilla.
---
At least that's what I heard based on private server values.  Who knows how it works in Classic.  Even if they scale with +spellpower thrown in, it still won't be a ton.  The coefficient is low for SoR, so even with 200 spellpower (which is about what I have in near BIS gear, no consumes) you're still not adding a ton of damage.  But definitely more.  
---
I very rarely am just autoattacking, most melee attacks are reck bombs or as a last resort thing if I'm under attack and have no other way to spend my gcd.  Often I find it better to reposition or try to get a heal off (to buy allies time to help me) and so I'm not often just wailing on someone.  Sure there are times I do that, but usually that means I already have the upper hand quite a bit and don't really need that small boost to SoR damage
---
Criticizing Classic WoW doesn't make a post worthless. I understand the NoChanges perspective, but Classic WoW had many shortcomings, especially after BWL. The appeal of Classic WoW for many is the open world nature of the game. Unfortunately, some of that was lost towards the end of Classic. Then Blizzard doubled down with TBC.
---
"rotation"
---
Fair enough, that makes sense.   Me and my boys are trying to make a little beer money off a YMCA tourney and here comes Boogie scooping up all the winnings and leaving us to buy Milwaukee's Best while he was already poppin' bottles to begin with lol
---
Yes both agility and daggers are excellent for tanking.
---
You aren’t going to find tanking+spell power plate combos, but when you can survive fights then spell power does lots of work. Usually paladin tanks have a spell power trinket/ring/necklace and some spell power plates depending on the fights.
---
Spell power enchant on weapon is your main option for protection paladin. Also if you dont have thunder fury, then spell power main hands with high dps are preferable.
---
but you you can be a ripped chad with epic facial hair
---
Haha, good one man, like how good the names look !
---
on a fresh server, a good balance would be to level skinning+herbalism. Sell the skins to vendor to build up wealth, and save the herbs to either 
---
(1) sell on AH later when there is more gold in the economy, and everyone wants to powerlevel alchemy (which WILL happen)
---
or
---
(2) save for your own character/alt to powerlevel alchemy at a later time
---
Personally I'd only search a guild beforehand if I was in a really competitive class like warrior or mages. Anything else I'd rather go with the flow and meet people as I go.
---
I typically go Furor first because pre-20 I am in bear a lot. Open with roots, wrath x2, moonfire, then drop into bear, that extra rage is valuable. Once I hit 20 I respect and go str8 feral rushing to feral swiftness 2/2 by 22. After that I see value in grasp, but unless I am tanking dungeons, I would leave furor till later and stay in the feral tree. I guess the point I am trying to make is it isn't a useless talent, but I agree with your theory of just being in cat form, because that is my style after 20 as well.  Just my humble opinion.
---
Thanks. Happy cake day
---
I would look for one before launch. It'll help you decide which server to play on. Best of all, if you find like-minded people (ie hardcore crowd for you), you will have a group of people you can group with right from the start. The guild will grow when the game comes out anyway.
---
Personally, I am waiting for the servers to be announced. That way I can get an idea of which server I want to join, and see if there are interesting guilds planning on choosing those.
---
Part of the classic WoW experience was making fun of people that felt the need for as much hand-holding as Carbonite gave them.
---
Google is how I started.
---
I don't know the system that well at all, but it sounds like it wouldn't be too difficult for a group of people to trade world pvp kills all day to rank up.
---
You say that, but if BGs don't give you any reward, and you're not currently raiding, and you like PvP'ing... well, ganking in BRM can be a lot of fun.
---
Moonfire is your source of damage in duels. Cat form makes you too vulnerable to use much.
---
you're not going to get streamsniped because you will be streaming to an audience of 1 person.
---
Holy fuck, what is it with you incels and your condescending smiley use?
---
I agree. That is one of the best parts of Classic WoW. There was tons of resources and materials to farm across the zones. It was just a shame that you would kill another player and receive little to no honor or reward from it.
---
How would blacklisting a level one made to disrupt a dueling tournament prevent them from raiding on their main if nobody knew who that was? The context of the video I saw very much alluded solely to ganking with zero mention of same-faction annoyances, which given the example you provided doesn’t really make sense or solve the problem either.
---
Nobody doubts that acting like a tool will inhibit your social abilities in the game, that’s what most of us love about vanilla, and that’s absolutely not what the problem is. 
---
The problem people have with this topic is that the dude threw a tantrum and casually demanded that streamers be given power to blacklist people personally based on behavior they deemed unsavory. It’s a childish and absurd proposal which demonstrates a sense of entitlement for wanting all the clout and acclaim of a streamer, wanting all of the positive attention and none of the negative.
---
He has he option to enjoy a non streamer experience by playing offline or by playing on a PvE server like anyone else that doesn’t like to be ganked. Asking for special treatment in this context is asking for the ridicule hems receiving. It should be noted at this point that the community outcry and other streamers disagreeing with him isn’t because his claim is totally legitimate and the rest of us just “don’t get it” or are “being fucking stupid”, it’s because he’s behaving in a socially abhorrent manner, which as far as I can tell based on any time his name pops up is largely why he’s relevant at all.
---
except when his army of fanboys lock down a zone to ensure he gets to do what he wants done with no competition.
---
Yah I brought my char there
---
I want to make the ultimate party for dwarf dungeon delving.
---
Gunner - The dwarf hunter.
---
Engineer - dwarf paladin.
---
Scout: dwarf rogue.
---
Driller: Dwarf warrior.
---
Bosco: Dwarf priest .
---
Naturally, all with mining and engineering.
---
Que is short for queue
---
Quick, he’s weakened, poke him in the eye!
---
I was there on Nerzhul as well. The point I am making is that when Blizzard released battlegrounds, it trivialized world pvp because you could no longer rank up doing it. Players flocked to battlegrounds, because that is where all the rewards were.
---
LMFAO like there isn't gonna be some other big dick boys on the server with best loot best guilds best pvpers... its gonna happen regardless. People already do all of this shit streamers do.
---
I would get that tattooed
---
Reminds me of when I was tanking sunken temple on my paladin and dragons call dropped the the freaking Hunter took it over me and the warrior in our group. I was so pissed!
---
The no is also meant for the ret paladin standing next to him.
---
Choice is always nice. Similar to PvP and PvE servers. Nobody is forcing. This could be "hardcore" mode similar to some FPS games without the HUD.
---
But he isn't showing in a zone, did he never log on him, or do patches wipe that info from the selection screen?
---
Yeah Ive reported both as well. The kidney happened all the time when I was doing sm chest runs.
---
I played a paladin up to 40 during the EU open beta, while battling at Tarren mill i saw a 58 NE hunter , he was one shotting people at 40 yard and had a pet doing more damage than me. I thought to myself wtf it's too op and i rolled a NE hunter at launch.
---
Nothing better than pulling an extra mob and resetting to 100% hp after a ding. I always made sure to ding 60 on the yeti quest
---
Some of us are also gym rats. Also horde has epic facial hair too.
---
I'm pretty sure the forsaken and all orcs except the frostwolf clan want world domination too
---
Evasion tanked some shit in BWL and onward but I still think stealthing through Maraudon and soloing Mesh Lok at 49 for my sweet chest not 10 seconds before the servers shut down will always hold a special place.    That or getting rank 9 at level 49.
---
It depends on how far you go with it. In later vanilla raid content, a holy paladin has a hard time with mana efficiency In instances and smaller raids, they fare much better. Plus in vanilla, all of your buffs last 5 minutes and you will spend entire raids spamming the same buffs on 39 other people every 5 minutes for several hours.
---
Priests are fantastic healers (that's what they do) and with good spirit gear they shine in efficiency and capability. Plus, you can buff entire groups for 30 minutes at a shot so there's that.
---
Outside of dungeons and raids, a paladin will generally have a better time of it when soloing due to being a plate class with more combat oriented abilities at their disposal. They are also incredibly durable in duels and pvp if that is your thing.
---
Each class has a DPS oriented spec (Retribution or Shadow) but in vanilla, respecialization gets progressively more expensive and punishes you for doing it so unlike current retail wow, you can't swap to your dps spec and go solo questing.
---
What is with you ret paladins and your terrible arguments/ not knowing mechanics of iconic bosses like ragnaros?
---
Nope.
---
I recently installed Diablo II + LoD, and it's more fun than BfA. Considering that I am talking about a game that can only be played at 800x600 max resolution, that doesn't code well for retail :P
---
Sure it was fun, but the novelty wore off. World PvP should have been a viable way of honor progression.
---
I see. CC works weirdly in WoW. I can't even imagine being stunned for 9 seconds.
---
There will likely be no-addon guilds too, which is great and this guy should join up. Then he and his guild get the experiences they're looking for.
---
It's largely the same type of game with the same humor, which is great. Some people dislike Fractured because they switched to a grid-based Heroes of Might-type system for combat, and it runs off a Super Hero theme instead of high fantasy. If you like Heroes combat and Super Heroes as a theme, then you will love it just as much as the first game. Objectively, it was just as good, but subjectively I can easily see why some people think it's worse because it's got different combat and themes that they just don't personally like.
---
too bad its not vanilla, you still have rested XP after 60, so....
---
that's right. keep your head in the sand. ignore the warnings that have been expressed on big streamer's affect on the game.
---
Rogues are one of the hardest class for a lock to go up against.
---
You're right, it's a huge red flag.  Druid isn't a spec, it's a class.  You're always playing all of the roles, all of the time, and looking for ways to make yourself more useful.
---
OP should definitely put more thought into his class decision.
---
In Vanilla, they added it to only Kazzak. Dunno about azuregos.
---
It works the same with players and enemies: the one who parried gets their swing timer reduced by 40% for the next attack.
---
Hey, what UI mod makes the frames/action bars darker? :) Looks great!
---
Oh, i think its not me who needs teachers help. There is no implication of any changes to core mechanics or functions that weren't available back then. Didn't know dual spec or graphical switch was part of vanilla.
---
Mats, I bet. The thing is, people have to search to find your auction, and there are just a lot more participants in the materials market than the finished product market. 
---
Also, a lot of people actually want the skillups because they didn't take fishing, and most classes that are sophisticated enough to use the auction house to buy buff food are probably also sophisticated enough to level cooking as they level (once the initial speedrunners are gone). 
---
I will probably search for both when I start playing, but I strongly suspect it will be like private servers. There just aren't any listings for goblin deviled clams, which means people are unlikely to search them, which is a death spiral for a market. But people on private servers can have an expectation that when they go to the auction house, tangy clam meat is widely available.
---
Only the epic mount.  Basic mount is essentially free.
---
its because its not vanilla, hes lvl 60 with 200k to next level with rest XP 2 bars in lol
---
Just hitting 60 is an enormous grind. Then you need 40 attuned to core via the brd questline. Then you need the water drop attunements and the fire gear assuming difficulty is similar. Like I said end of 2nd week. Its possible someone like Asmon with a builtin cult might speed it up but I doubt it.
---
No, they are definitely the ones dictating the server they are on unless there is a bigger following fighting against them or trying to make their lives harder.
---
Oh my God. Get the fuck down from your ivory tower. You are putting way too much thought into streamers.
---
Because the Alliance aren't actually the good guys all the time. Also, see the original RTS games
---
Used to duel another resto druid while in pvp queues.
---
30 minute battle, only ended when bg queue popped.
---
Clever but scummy.
---
Solo play implies you don’t raid. 
---
Hunters scale poorly with gear relative to warlocks. A warlock gets stupid powerful if raiding and getting geared. It isn’t as though a hunter gets weaker, but a non raiding hunter will get relatively more out of his character vs a raiding hunter when compared to a non raiding warlock to a raiding warlock.
---
The mounts without armor will exist right away
---
I definitely see the idea, I wouldn't personally play that way as I've gotten used to my UI over the years, but I definitely see the idea. It's kinda like a "hardcore"-mode. 
---
But I agree with your thought that it would level the playing field, and do it only for the people that choose to play that way - again like e.g. hardcore diablo. 
---
While I enjoy my UI looking different, I dislike many of the types of add-ons that many people play with - healbot, decursive, etc.  I prefer making my own decisions, and feeling myself improve. 
---
To my understanding though, such add-ons Will not be available in classic due to the API? Might just be me misunderstanding though.
---
It was a common bug in vanilla to still show the xp bar when you hit max level. Pretty sure it didn't get fixed until cataclysm
---
Since this apparently has never happened before, let's wonder what caused Sodas rant in the first place. 
---
And this is where the ice gets thin. It's apparently in response to him just randomly being ganked. With little reason to tell evil "stream sniper megaguild" apart from regular random alliance player who got the jump on him, it's obvious where this is heading: Blacklisting players for PVPing on a PVP server.
---
Thats not true, most people played for fun. Rewards are PART of what makes something fun.
---
i can't be the only one that tunes out w/e people have to say once they complain about the flying mounts, right?  
---
none of them have good arguements for the issues they caused, makes me think its just a meme or them repeating shit other people said, and becuase other people said it, it must be true  
---
"well, they can just jump you from outa nowhere"  
---
- its no difference from someone with an epic mount approaching from behind  
---
"well, um, yeah... but it makes it so you cant camp people for hours on end"  
---
- and thats a good thing for about 99% of the player base  
---
"and then, uh, well, uh....."  
---
- oh, thats all you had? good complaint
---
gratz!

Despite popular belief pvp wise shaman is great even in bwl gear. But regarding pve you prob wont ever get a raid spot. Unless its a very chill group. I actually also have these in the top 3 rn. And iv'e decided on shaman. Mainly because I just love the class but also I feel like ill have so much more satisfaction putting in the extra work. The wins are going to be so much sweeter. But im also content healing in pve.
---
In your case, since you dont want to pve heal, I would vote rogue. Rogues are great in almost every 1v1 matchup. So itll make the solo pvping a lot more enjoyable.  Thats not saying youll never win a 1v1 as warrior. It'll just be a lot more challenging. You just have so many less tools to work with.
---
On the other hand war will have a much much easier time gearing. Both for dungeons and in raids.
---
Holy shit bro calm down. You might be taking things a bit too serious. Go outside, sip some lemonade. Get off the computer for awhile.
---
Got a link to the non-reddit version?
---
If going the 0/30/20+1 route, what is the general order for specing the points?  all in feral before you start down resto? some of each?  I mostly expect to 5 man/casually pvp so might consider playing a druid and this spec for the ultimate flexibility.
---
Yeah it is funny, but its funny because soda is so super autistic while esfand is just trolling the fuck out of him .
---
Honestly sounds like a great time waster
---
look at his claws! too bad in game they are just fat casters instead of bad ass bear mutants that they are.
---
My same thoughts. I would love to take a week off of work at launch, but for what? The struggle to do Any quest is going to be huge based just on the population alone. Unless you get a very far lead ahead of everyone else, you'll have to compete with a hundred other people for mob tagging and questing. Hunters and druids are going to be spamming every spawn in sight and you'll be lucky to finish a quest that normally would take 10 minutes within 30 minutes. And this doesn't even include server stability issues.
---
nah i never logged him in, just saved the name in case i wanted it, not sure why i picked that name... i had some idea... mush is like short for "mustache".

Focused very much on that facial hair when creating my toons.

---
I had to re-read, I thought you typed the same word twice lol.
---
Nope, as long as you're talking about the playable race and not NPCs, the sole purpose of the Forsaken is free will. The sole purpose of their leader is revenge. The sole purpose of both the orcs and their leader is reconciling their past and building a new life. This is all made very clear in WC3 and the lore books.
---
Bezzer than what they sell for 45$
---
It’s also cause the people in r/wow can play the game they want and in r/classicwow we can’t
---
What addon is it that makes his action bars, unitframes etc look darker like that?
---
Oh I agree for sure. The idea he proposes is stupid and would be abused 100%. The only way to confirm stream sniping would be if they admit it or if its a specific guild following him constantly.
---
My reply was never to defend sodas idea, it was about the people in this thread talking about making these guilds and communities.
---
The stupidest argument I've seen from Blizzard is that we didn't have rppvp servers at launch.  
---
Okay, that's true but..  
---
It's 1.12 .. and not launch.  
---
.. So.. could you hand over those servers now..?
---
Google up the classic WoW talent calculator and make you some builds. I’ve made an interesting raid VIABLE (not optimal) build and an arcane frost build.
---
Wrong! Blizzard confirmed there are no unarmored mounts in the game, ever.

People will slap that dopamine and endorphin button forever.
---
I got sick of waiting and rolled up on a private server.
---
If I get in the Beta i'll swap over.  If not, then i can stay here for a while.
---
&gt;the novelty wore off
---
I played Vanilla from day one. The novelty of succubus-seducing someone and annihilating him with a trinketed Soulfire didn't wear of for the next 2 years.
---
I agree 
---
I’m tired of streamers 
---
I just wanna play the game and enjoy it with other gamers 
---
It’s like we also play this game , you’re not special you just have an ego and want recognition
---
I disagree. Just because you cherry picked an example you like doesn't mean there isn't a solid case to be skeptical about the effect that qol add-ons may have on the game
---
Prove it.
---
you mean the original RTS games where the Horde were alien invaders who slaughtered the native inhabitants of Azeroth until they were finally stopped and then it was all ok because Thrall said some stuff about "honor"? ;)
---
You can't fight other players while they are on flying mounts. Once they are on their flying mount, they are basically safe and unkillable.
---
They literally already confirmed that unarmored mounts won't be in the game.
---
Github here: https://github.com/fusionpit/ClassTrainerPlus
---
This is it for me. I started watching him (and bellular for lore) even though I haven't played wow in a decade.
---
It was a good parody on all the other threads, made me smile.
---
I remember it being once of the glitchiest frustrating fights in the game, for sure.

You missed the entire point of my comment. None public = break into. But glad to know you’re so passionate about this that you feel inclined to call someone something as silly as a “dweeb”. Lol. Peace. ✌🏻
---
I think you are 100% wrong. The world PvP is the best thing about classic.
---
&gt; I wonder if they changed the helm because it is similar to the pvp set helm for paladins/warriors. 
---
I believe they just put a placeholder texture on lightforge helm early on because they had not had time to do all the custom textures yet. I believe you can find the old lightforge helm texture worn by soldiers in the Scarlet Monastery. They most likely just yoinked that texture temporarily right before launch and hoped to get the new textures sorted before people managed to get the gear.
---
Since this is the thread that got the RemindMeBot message: you can follow development, and download closer to classic's release, here: https://github.com/fusionpit/ClassTrainerPlus
---
The reward is you get the camp to farm for yourself with no competition and can make huge gold per hour. Do you want a titanforged epic item or something?
---
I may have overshot.  I'm replaying Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee again....
---
If someone is standing still, and then turns around to face a player, runs directly towards a streamer who is stealthed, kills them, jumps on their body spamming macros (example that I saw the other day), they're a sniper
---
If not, that's unfortunate, but tough luck. I'm sure they'll be able to play the game perfectly fine with the blacklist crew and the masses who will not give a shit about the blacklist.
---
There's always a game for those people.
---
so the same as ground-mounting and leaving? cool, cool
---
Going disc priest for the extra buff
---
Found the games “journalist”
---
definitely created my character and his name based on Gimli's "Not the beard!" line from LOTR
---
He talks about people asking alternatives for addons. If you don't understand the concept of alternatives and why it means we are talking about content that already exists i think even primary school might be too hard for you.
---
I don't know why people play Alliance.
---
Ugly races.
---
Boring and bland.
---
And that's completely fair. Sure I've met /some/ immature people from rppvp servers and the time I spent there was mostly pleasant due to the soft rule enforcement and general demographic.   
---
One of my biggest pet peeves about this is, if I have to play a PvP server, I'm going to meet people with retarded names like "XxAshley" or "HuckForde".  If I wanted retarded names to play with and against, I'd launch up Dota 2 for an hour, thanks.
---
Being ganked is random on who it happens to, being streamsnipped is deliberate towards the streamer.
---
Just as good
---
Had a hunter ninja Thermaplugg's Left Arm a few days ago. He's on ignore now.
---
You can dismount and PvP other players while they are on ground mounts.
---
And i see that some of the threads on wow reddit are about classic.
---
And female
---
Blizzard confirmed there are no unarmored mounts in Classic, not at launch and not ever.
---
Just don't play with addons my dude, I have raided without addons recently, as long as you're good you're gonna be indistinguishable from addon users.
---
Is not impossible to be great without them.
---
I don't think they have released the timing of each Phase just yet.
---
Sorry but this is wrong. Feral swiftness is always the better choice to get first THEN furor. The movement speed is too good. If you got fruit first you'd be 26 by the time you get swiftness, which would be useless at 30 with travel form
---
not really. have fun having your healer in perma stun until he has to use his ownly defensive cooldown

No, it's a misspelling of queue. Either way, cue is a different word and it's the one you meant to use. A queue is a line, a cue is a signal to start something.
---
you'll see
---
You quit at level 2 and think classic will be better? Uhhhhh
---
I guess nothing.
---
For me the line is crossed when tryhards start talking down to other people for not also being tryhards. Like when they start derogatorily talking down to "casuals".
---
Makes sense, any approximation? Thanks!
---
No one gives a fuck
---
I'm torn about it, personally. I find that most of the wpvp encounters I have are terribly unbalanced. Getting backstabbed by a rogue that is 6 levels higher than you. Having a ganker sneak up on you while you're solo leveling and at 1/3rd health. Having a level ?? come and kill you for the lolz. Then we have corpse campers.
---
That stuff is not much fun.
---
On the other hand, I have memorable experiences like being in a group of 2 people and getting attacked by another group of 2. After a big fight one person is left standing. Everyone reses at their corpse and goes back to leveling. Another fond memory, getting the level 30 warrior armor quest and sneaking down to wetlands as horde. Trying to cross the zone. Having all these tense moments with alliance. Trying to be non threatening because it's 1am and you just want to get some shinbones before 3am. But getting attacked anyway and having to defend yourself. Getting some lucky kills. Doing a revenge here and there.
---
I guess my feeling is that I like the tension and excitement that can come with wpvp. It helps to break up the routine of questing to level. But at the same time I get really sick of trying to level in hillsbrad while alliance keep trucking through and slaughtering you driving up your repair bills and wasting your time.
---
I think I have a slight preference to PvE servers but I think I could play on either and enjoy it. I would just enjoy each server type for different reasons.
---
That looks awesome :-) good job. I hope to post some classic inspired art myself, but I'm too shy and bashful about getting slammed on a public forum.
---
YOU WILL ALLLLLL SEEEEEEE!
---
Doesn't Imp SoR apply to the judgement too though, which is like 50% spell damage?
---
Only need 1 person with the Aqual Quintessence, so you can have a few ppl dedicated to that, a few people farming for consumables and most farming t0.
---
&gt; WoW always lacked a support rol[e].  
---
Paladins would like a word to some degree here with things like freedom, sac, bop, resist auras etc.
---
Unpopular, but correct statement.  
---
That said, it's a bit like the Oxford comma - It's not a mandatory rule, but what monster wouldn't use it?
---
Brings a tear to my eye.... : )
---
Considering the number of classic related posts in r/wow, I doubt they are playing "the game they want" ^^
---
Almost certainly it will be after a couple months. People have to have time to level up to 60 and do some raid content before moving into phase 2 let alone 3, but I could be wrong.
---
...there isn't even AGI on it. Dumbass hunter
---
Still unsure how you're supposed to tell the two apart with 100% certainty.
---
I'll agree there. Crazy addons, crazy expectations. On LFG Monday there was guilds recruiting requiring a signed commitment to have 2 pre-bis 60s before phase 2 and any toon you wanted to raid on needed engineering. Meaning, any BOP raid plans would require people to be an ENG/BS for instance.
---
Yeah definitely don’t want to be on any server with a streamer like that. Especially Sodapopin. He’s the worst.
---
15 years later and we still don't have a dance studio in BfA. xD
---
Each phase is approx 2-3 months so looking at 4-6 for gulch
---
I don’t think that many people will be watching classic when they are busy playing.
---
Ah, the innocence of a young child.  Can't even try to bash that. We were all silly kids once.
---
Without a doubt, Forsen's server will be so fucking chaotic that he might even quit playing if he has a huge crowd of players following him 24/7.
---
It's a derivation of the emote "PogChamp", which originated from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9TNY75jhcs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m9s). It was given its name because of a Mad Catz FightStick promo done back in 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkBDZ8Davvg
---
I thought you guys were going to set up a guild where you harassed them for saying that they didn't like being fucked with 24/7, did I miss something?
---
...about such comments.
---
&gt; People quit a game after 14 years. It happens. 
---
It does happen. It's inevitable. Still...from 12.4 million subs to 1 million? That is no longer a game that slowly grows old...it's a game that is dying.
---
Without Classic on the horizon, Retail could probably be alive for 2-3 more expansions. But with Classic coming, and everyone with 2 neurons is realizing that is will blow BfA out of the water, not only during launch, but permanently...Blizzard will have to make a HARD decision.
---
And they are preparing for this possibility. It would be stupid not to.
---
Yes, there was memorable World PvP in Classic WoW. The criticism in the op is that the rewards for doing world pvp were insignificant. You could not viably rank up doing world pvp. Blizzard didn't even give players an option between ranking up through world pvp or battlegrounds. Once battlegrounds are released, they become the sole way to rank up, and world pvp becomes trivialized to an extent. That is what my issue with classic wow is. You kill another level 60 in EPL and receive a negligble reward. The player you killed just respawns and walks away like nothing happened.
---
Thank you very much!
---
It just depends what's considered try hard.
---
I would argue that the guy he played with was a "try hard" because he was trying hard to see the group succeed.
---
The negative connotation of "try hard" is a person that is only interested in their own performance.
---
If I could use a cringe analogy:
---
If anyone's ever played D&amp;D, the rule-whore min/maxer that makes sure to take every possible broken skill and abuse them... is often not fun to play with.
---
Whereas the person that puts more time and effort into group cohesion is probably not playing the best or most powerful class / race combination, but is way more fun.
---
Lol you think phase 3 is coming out after a month? Try 6-8 months.
---
Blizzard said they were looking at a "quick" release of phase 2, so probably 2 months. That would put phase 3 at 3-4 months and we all know Blizzard doesn't like to release content around Christmas and New Years, so it's unlikely we'll see WSG and BWL until 2020.
---
I'm planning on doing the same.
---
My upgrade has been a LONG time coming, but I haven't been able to justify it, because this old girl is still chugging along.
---
I'm excited to finally experience the loads speeds of my first SSD.
---
&gt; When Goldman Sachs is saying "Buy ATVI stock now", they know WHY.
---
Ah yes, just like when they were buying house mortgages?
---
I'm not implying that they are necessarily wrong in this case, but this "big companies can't be wrong"-mentality is dangerous.
---
Damn, thanks though
---
&gt;It's really not hard to raid without addons 
---
In original MC vanilla there were no raid frames
---
Took a while for someone to create that first addon
---
Try raiding without raid frames, let me know how your healers do
---
&gt; If not, that's unfortunate, but tough luck.
---
oh, solid justification. Sorry we're randomly slandering you across message boards for PVPing, tough luck there buddy. 
---
At least you're honest enough to admit you don't give a shit about justice, as long as you can side with your fav streamer.
---
It has a 2hr CD
---
Usually I would agree, but for some reason it really bothers me that they seem left handed... Is there a mod that simply mirrors my character? (only for me, of course)
---
When did I ever say a certain form of streamsniping is good, or ok?  Quote me saying it. Just in case, me not mentioning my stance on it specifically doesn't mean I'm for *or* against.
---
A guild being formed that hunts streamsnipers, as I understand it, would *streamsnipe*. It wouldn't make sense for them not to, if their goal was to mess with streamers.
---
Since you seem unclear as to my opinions, I'll try to clarify:
---
- Forming a guild whose main function is to target streamers, using streamsniping, is bad.
---
- I think that people streamsniping in order negatively impact a streamer is bad.
---
He's right tho, and expressed deliberate ignorance towards the topic doesn't make you look smarter.
---
I have no idea, thereby my question
---
you will tho
---
Lol you made him delete his account.... kek
---
World pvp hks should give more honor
---
Probably because he one shot the first mob and hit two and thought “wow this game is ass” I would do the same thing
---
I'm going to have to run Deadmines and Mara for Verigan's Fist and Thrash Blade respectively either way.
---
My favourite is the human jump swing.
---
***"Arcanite Reaper HOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"***
---
The guilds dedicated to going for world first will likely have 80-100 players working around the clock to level up. Getting attunement is a non-issue as they'll be running the instance anyway to get their tank some gear. The water is the smallest issue as it only requires 8 people to be honored which can be accomplished in a matter of a couple of hours with AoE mages. The only person in the raid that needs any FR gear is the main tank. And with the knowledge of what buffs you can get he would likely only need a couple of pieces.
---
The one shot burst mechanics of classic wow pvp is one of the best parts.
---
So you're saying it's cool to shit on soda?
---
Don't sound so triggered. Daddy Soda doesn't give a fuck about you, only cares about your money.
---
sexy goth waifu vs you irl after playing wow for 15 years
---
Whatever makes you happy dude
---
would be better to have a paladin and give them Kings so they can feel uber special since horde can't usually get that.
---
Yea totally game changing when you log onto classic and two shot the mob. That one extra hit really draws you into the game.
---
As a former warrior that will now play a hunter i will let you have it.
---
Getting a nice polearm or axe upgrade felt so good with warrior.
---
Unless you don’t know anything about wow, you should probably know that they won’t release BWL when not even 10% of the population is level 60.
---
Meh. I did it in middle school during vanilla, blind.
---
Nobodies trying to hit R14 from WPVP, it’s just fun. It’s not about maximizing tangible rewards, the reward is the fun of competition. 
---
Plus, once BG release most WPVP ends up being people leveling in contested zones: Killing the opposite faction for stealing your quest mobs, testing your skills outside of BG, because you’re low level for w/e bracket but you run into an enemy player around the same level, protecting your factions lowbies from enemy gankers... etc 
---
Consider this, capital city raids still happened once the honor system came out with DHKs. IIRC, capital city raids had no rewards whatsoever, and even resulted in many DHKs. Capital city raids only had a negative effect on honor, and yet people still formed these raids all the time. The reward was in the fun of the experience and being able to /flex on the enemy faction.
---
What aspect exactly becomes eesier using addons on Classic?
---
This is because they need devs for 1.13. Not Retail.
---
New blood, unaffected by retail design stupidity, for developing 1.13. Or WoW 2.
---
The new hirings are not for retail...what the hell they need to design? Different colors on the billion epics? Other icons on the map for World Quests? An additional button for vote kick on LFR?
---
Blizzard is hiring for 1.13, or for WoW 2.
---
Not retail.
---
Don’t female undead have a one handed casting animation for most spells?
---
I agree with you there. It is just unfortunate that the honor gain for killing another player was so low relative to battlegrounds.
---
Hunters are great man. I was my guild's highest DPS before 1.9 (due to FD / Drink).
---
I also pulled most bosses with Eyes of the Beast. Would handle 2x mobs in the Razorgore Fight. My bear pet tanked our first Hakkar kill. I tanked a healer mob in the Majordomo fight.
---
People are not going to min/max like they do in BFA. You'll need 40 people with 20 or so slots very specifically needed.
---
Also, Hunters were brutal in PvP. Especially in AV. 
---
Have fun!
---
It's not really above board, but there is a thing called a wow private server. You can find ones that support each release from vanilla to current retail. There's a subreddit around here that has server lists and instructions for how to get started. I got started by just googling it. Ended up on a pserver that tries to be faithful to vanilla, but they make ones that vary wildly from vanilla in terms of leveling rate and drop rate.
---
So yeah, if questionable legal areas are your thing you could play on a pserver until classic launches.
---
I will be going from Orc Warrior to a dwarf priest. Oh boy...I’m not sure if I’m ready. Please take me in brothers.
---
Thanks! People usually say it's bad, I've been wondering whether this was mostly due to travel time and waiting to find a party.
---
Sheesh.
---
I hope to find a raid guild in Classic, but I'm staying far away from that kind of mentality. WoW is supposed to be fun, not a job.
---
Yes you're correct.  Similarly, even with the spellpower judgment isn't a huge part of my playstyle because I'm not always near a target that I want to try and attack.  But it definitely helps boost the judgment a lot more than the actual seal damage so yes, it could be helpful there. 
---
I said it elsewhere I think the talent is better for tank paladins, because they are judging SOR on cooldown and autoattacking with it all the time.  Also perhaps for a build that has holy shock, to maximize your burst potential.  
---
Additionally, I believe (at least it is this way on Pservers) that the talent only boosts BASE damage, not the overall damage.  So the talent might only do half as much as it would if it took +spellpower into effect, so who knows this might be a different story once Classic launches and theorycrafters can get all their stuff updated
---
It's been some time tbh, but thanks for the answers!
---

Wireless peripherals in 2004 that's a big yikes from me dawg.
---
I kill red cause they are on the other faction. 
---
If the red players are going to broadcast where they are, making them easier targets, bet your ass imma go kill them?
---
I mean the fuck, I’m not sadistic, I’m lazy.
---
I got to rank 9 back in the day but we were on a RP server and there was a HUGE Alliance/Horde imbalance... like 70/30 and we were the only ones running premades on the Horde side. 
---
Even I remember rank 10 not being totally doable for casuals
---
This screenshot is very symmetrical and lined up perfectly.
---
Another post saying Chinese gold sellers are a problem to justify their laziness of farming gold. You're also clearly not keeping up to date because their bot detection systems have increased quite a bit since 2004. They send out ban waves every 2-3 months and most botters get banned.
---
It was called Plainsrunning.
---
Rogues are one of the hardest for most classes. They have a lot of fight control, but a properly speced warlock is also one of the hardest classes for a rogue to beat. Stack enough spell damage on a warlock and they are probably the king of 1v1 in AQ/Naxx content.
---
They hate them because they ain't them.  
---
Ok, maybe that's a bit reductive and probably only true for maybe half.
---
I played on Ravenholdt back in BC and it was dead and still is.  Sad part was people rarely RP'd on the server so it was just like a normal PvP server with a third of the population.
---
Exactly. I get why Blizzard added battlegrounds.  I personally do not care for them, especially almost 15 years of WSG, AB.
---
That's a very good point that I hadn't thought about, they will be more challenging during launch than they will once I'm leveling my alts. Thanks for the input!
---
That has nothing to do with blacklisting, though. That's just what happens when you play on the server that big streamers play on.
---
posting your video here with no comment at all is a sure way to make me not want to watch your video
---
Okay, but I literally said I enjoy world pvp. I never took put a pitchfork, I asked a question lol.
---
You mean just like all the complaints in r/classicwow?
---
I'm subbed to both. I'd imagine those who are more active on reddit are in both, those who subbed to r/wow a while back and stopped using reddit and left their accounts subbed to something, because why would you not. 
---
That being said, how does the online count work? Just having an account on reddit with the site open, subbed to something? Does count me as online for classic when I'm browsing r/wow? Or just for r/wow?
---
okay, let me disect this for you my slow friend:
---
&gt;I find it ironic how some people demand no Quality of Life changes to Classic but then load up on QoL addons anyway
---
In short: QoL Changes vs QoL Addons.
---
Now, how do define a change? I've also got your back here:
---
&gt; make or become different.
---
Okay, now how do you suggest you change something in classic without adding or removing something from it? It's not freaking possible. You'll have to add stuff which wasn't in classic or remove stuff so it is no longer in classic. You change the classic experience. That is one side of the argument. The other side is that Addons do the exact same thing as the QoL Changes, but they just happen to be part of the game.
---
And it doesn't even matter where you stand on this topic, since our argument is whether "There is no implication of any changes to core mechanics or functions that weren't available back then" and I just schooled you on said subject, so maybe you should send over a check with your tuiton.
---
I never said that Blizzard will cancel Retail one day after Classic launch. I said it will be "down the road".
---
But it will come. The most I can see is one more expansion for Retail, one that will last for 3 years, and that will be it. Retail will be put on "conservation" during this last expansion, and closed 1 or 2 years afterwards.

Yes, the entire internet is just one hivemind of one person, and everything ever written by anyone is written by the same entity, the internet hivemind. So if you read something that contradicts something written somewhere else, that was the same entity in both scenarios, contradicting itself. 
---
Except you of course. You're the only other person the internet. Just us, and you.

I’ve been having fun going for loremaster of kalimdor since I’ve never really quested there. While the zones aren’t super challenging I enjoy the challenge of seeing how many mobs I can survive. 
---
I’ve also enjoyed the class hall campaigns from Legion. Those stories were well done as were a lot of the Legion zones. Legion is a top 3 expac for sure. 
---
I’ve also had a lot of fun pvp in random BGs and doing dungeons with friends. The current game has its flaws, but it’s still wow and you get out what you put in.
---
I disagree, at least as someone with 2 monitors I often play games while watching a stream of the same game. Especially nice for PvP, it keeps my mind focused on the micro play.
---
A warlock is one of the hardest class for most people. A geared warlock does well against almost every class, an sl warlock dumpsters every class. Only class that has a chance vs an sl lock is a rogue.
---
What class do you think is a harder match up than rogue if you’re playing a lock?
---
2 monitors friend
---
I agree in general, but I really want to MT in raids and the way people talk on this sub, you absolutely have to be competitive to even have a shot at MTing. Thanks for the input!
---
Mfw I just come back from an area that was sieged by ISIS for 6 months and people maken30 cents an hour doing back breaking labor in 100 degree weather to hearing Westerners complain people stream their video games
---
Permadeath and no addons would be pretty awesome.
---
Paladins need something to do while leveling lol
---
I know full well of the situation. You all on this sub have lost your fucking minds and shoved it up your ass. You are just as bad as people that read gossip magazines. Just fucking play the game.
---
Man, I don't know why I am in the minority here, but this guy streams as a career. He has to go to work everyday and the game is a painful slog when no lifers make it their mission to stream snipe. Imagine if you played a rogue and people constantly knew your location.. The game just isn't fucking fun. In the video OP shows, Sodapoppin mentions that he would ditch the benefits entirely so that he didn't have to encounter the drawbacks. 
---
I think if the community on the classic servers the streamers choose to play decides to rally around the blacklist idea, then that's their prerogative. It's not like it's against TOS for guilds to not invite you because you're a no life asshole. The video also omits the part Soda mentions where "If it was ganking once while we cross paths naturally in the game that's fine, but when I rez and go stealth and the two characters ganking me pause for a second and turn around to my exact location, that's a problem." and I agree 100%
---
These two and Xaryu are by far my favorite.
---
Or maybe it's not on par on how you think it works.
---
Thanks for putting in the time! Is it possible to upload a version that has less compression artifacts? A PNG would be nice.
---
A geared Ele shaman
---
wtf i thought you were an orc until i saw racial. the framing is legendarily bad, i love it!
---
And now I think I'll attempt to name my druid for classic Moonfare
---
even SM?
---
When I grow up, I want to be a science doctor.
---
Doubt

Made a bunch of friends during TBC when I was 9 and stopped. When I got back into it during Legion I wasn’t able to make nearly as many friends.
---
I just figured it was an age thing. Maybe it wasn’t
---
That's not an achievement
---
There's just a link section and a title section though :p I'm sorry

Please don't stress your simple mind with these difficult concepts. It seems it makes you really confused.

A setting that burnt out many people in the past.

Advice to avoid burn out for anyone, trust me I was there like so many others.
---
Delegate delegate delegate.   Your main jobs as a Guild Leader should only be to select officers and manage active rosters while making executive decisions.  Those executive decisions will often be a time sink, so assign others with responsibility.
---
1. Raid Leader(s) 
---
2. PvP Leader(s) (yes if you weren't there we had these for world raids and AVs)
---
3. Class Officers
---
4. Loot Officers (To track loot via spreadsheet as occasionally things slip through cracks)
---
Guilds should be set up as a well oiled social machine.  Make your structure known and stick people to it.  Keep the drama away by having structure, if someone stirs the pot, let them know the grass may not be greener but they are going to find out if they keep it up.  Never play favorites, and be fair, remember the Golden rule.
---
Enjoy the game!
---
What does that web archive mean? I promise this is legitimate. I think i may still even be Facebook friends with the guy in my party Karova who I'm pretty sure has screenshots from his POV
---
Why not just answer homie’s question without expecting him to know when that’s why he’s asking in the first place.
---
Great post!
---
Landing faerie fire is not important at all since you can just cast it again. The only time spell hit is relevant is for the 4 horsemen and you can get it from a trinket in ZG - Nat Pagle's Broken Reel.
---
That fun and activity diminished once battlegrounds released like you said. Players were offered incomparable honor gains and rewards once WSG/AV were introduced. This lowered the pvp activity in the open world. Dishonorable kills hurt world pvp a ton. Sure, there still was the occasional city raid, but the introduction of dhk had a negative impact on world pvp.
---
that'd be the scummiest slap in the face to fans of WoW imaginable
---
An observer can't unless they're watching the stream. The ganker obviously knows if they're using twitch as a means to track someone. The ganked would start getting an idea that they're being tracked if they fuck off to random places and the ganker shows up.
---
&gt;The video omits the part Soda mentions where "If it was ganking once while we cross paths naturally in the game that's fine, but when I rez and go stealth and the two characters ganking me pause for a second and turn around to my exact location, that's a problem." and I agree 100%
---
It would be a lot of work for blizzard to calculate the damage of /e paws your thigh you moan
---
&gt;oh, solid justification
---
Sorry but people will not be forced to group with people who fuck them over in Classic. You may think it's lame, but people should be allowed to group with who they want to group with.
---
&gt;Sorry we're randomly slandering you across message boards for PVPing
---
Where did someone say they will slander people across message boards for "pvping"? Keep in mind that this is about stream sniping, not just PvP.
---
&gt;At least you're honest enough to admit you don't give a shit about justice,
---
This isn't a court of law. This is an individual deciding them and their friends won't group with you. Oh no, the discrimination is unreal! Rise up!
---
Nelf named 'Viserion' must have been a GOT book reader

"The only game that will kill WoW, is WoW itself."
---
... starting to believe it 😀
---
I got 2 downvotes in mere seconds after posting.
---
I call the drones, because they are...
---
most, if not all dungeons are relatively close to zones of the same level range. when leveling in 1k needles, dont join a SM group, stick to RFK and travel times are not an issue. you can always do SM when leveling in hillsbrad/alterac/arathi
---
You should make the second screenshot widescreen at least.
---
I really really dig the colors - great effing job
---
Onyxia next?👏🏽
---
Stating an obvious fact, are you? Ping me in 3 months and show me the dead streams. I'll be around.
---
no you're not
---
Achievement, Noun. a thing done successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill.
---
It took effort to coordinate the experience points I needed to level with the experience points gained from discovering a hostile enemy faction city. So yeah its an achievement by definition. But even subjectively achievements can be intrinsic so from both facets its an achievement. K thx bye.
---
What do you love about it?
---
What did Kripp do?
---
&gt;barbarous blade
---
I had that sword as well.. I went with a guild group so I could get it, I just wanted the other stats on it. The STR was just a necessary evil for the other stats. ( I wasnt really raiding at the time and I wanted to try the sword out, I had other stat sticks to use but I liked the Haste and crit it had )
---
I gave my opinion on what i think blizzards stance would be
---
horde are total pricks on rp-pvp servers and my dumb ass roll alliance on one. big fucking mistake. to this day if i ever found some of those horde i would beat think irl with a lead pipe. i'll never do world pvp EVER again cause of that server!
---
Which quest chain is that?
---
Why do you need them to compete, why do you need Classic to beat retail? Its best for both games if both do well.
---
Not to mention, the same phenomenon happened leading up to BfA launch; people couldn't play but wanted to, so they sat on reddit. This is a stretch, man.
---
lmao i didn't play on rp servers back in the day, and people like that are usually running around on the alliance doing that. most freaks and pervs who like hentai roll alliance to stare at night elves or suck humans off in goldshire.  thats another reason why horde wins.
---
Phlea gotta go. Mains go on top!
---
I had not heard that the layering was only in starting areas, thought it was everywhere for the initial launch. 
---
Good point on naming the character and then swapping immediately so you have somewhere to mail stuff. Didn't think of that.
---
Yup
---
Recently I got the "in our 10 years together I've never seen you do such day in day out effort"
---
Because we have the ability to, do you think that those men wouldn't complain about their lot if they possessed the ability to do so on this scale? 
---
I mean just because another issue is worse doesn't suddenly invalidate another issue. This is a bad comparison and you should feel bad for making it.
---
Your post has a huge hole in it. You don’t know what the percent drop in revenue was in Apex. It could be 20%, 35%, 80%. All are valid guesses. 
---
You also don’t know what the percent increase in CS GO (I think this is the one that replaced wow) had to replace wow. If wow was taking in 80 million USD and CSGO was taking in 79.9 million USD, the amount that is required to make the change in relatively small. 
---
Until AB reports their quarterlies we have no idea where wow might stand.
---
I'm going to do exactly this. The only reason is to have some variation during leveling.
---
Both will be fine.
---
Fair. I guess Undead can really give a bone
---
Huh. I played Ravenholdt before I went to Emerald Dream. I think it was Cata I played it during and it seemed pretty populated. What faction?
---
It was said that "RP-PvP is a bit too small niche" for development. It was also said, we will see how things unfold once classic is out there. If there were to be a large demand for that type of server, it was mentioned they would be utilized.
---
Source video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDsbKpH_wNk
---
I would say RP-PvP should have a bigger appeal than it did during vanilla WoWs original release. Why? Because there are tons of communities of people, friends, guilds, and even individuals who wish to play competitively, immersed, and even joke around. Those people also want to avoid the culture of streamers, and the types of fan bases they bring to servers. Every single one of those people, even if they do not plan to RP should gravitate towards calling for RP-PVP servers on release ASAP.
---
http://chng.it/5xXqXRcztH - Petition for RP-PVP realms
---
ALL REASONABLE CONTENT DEVELOPERS should support this too. .
---
It’s the other side of the coin that streamers have to deal with. That same player will already be put on KOS lists for a lot of their viewers anyways, not to mention the other consequences they might face. Streamers will gank randoms just like anybody else and those players will inevitably get harassed to no end by their stream viewers for doing nothing.
---
Damn now you’ve just reminded me how I made gold ahahhahah
---
I mean all my comments about the subject are in the video though.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Haha that's so true. Especially since if someone looked badass, they probably were since Tmogs didn't exist. That and being 60 alone was an accomplishment on it's own, with being a *geared* 60 being even more impressive
---
What lvl?
---
Witch hunting implies that you're punishing someone without proof of wrongdoing.
---
Soda is wrong and a crybaby. So people "stream sniping" him should be 100% allowed and encouraged in his case.
---
You could use druid offtanks since they are faster levelers and its easier to get a decent set of pre-raid gear.
---
Good point. Just got a sweet name for later use.
---
&gt;I mean, 1MM subscribers and 20MM in revenue is still staggeringly good
---
Not if you compare with 12.4 million subscribers and $180 million in revenue. If you look at the numbers without comparing them in time, you can't understand the bad shape retail WoW is today.
---
Hardcore guilds are already playing together on pservers and if you're not already in one, you aren't get in this late in the cycle. Any guild that you do find to join at this moment in time almost certainly doesn't meet the definition of hardcore. Consequently your "find one now" option isn't even possible.
---
What about spells and abilities? Like I know druids got their 360% armor in dire bear form in 1.12. Will they start with that still or have to wait to get the "buff"
---
Not today, servers have been down.
---
I'm gonna have a couple/few.  Damage Meter, for sure.  Movable Action Buttons/Bars, for sure.  Totem Manager, if'n my buttons/bars addon doesn't.
---
Else, can't think of much.  Mayhaps some sort of loot thing, or crafting thing, Gatherer used to be pretty helpful.  But I also knew all the ore spawn locations, so we'll see if those come back without Gatherer.
---
Remember when hunters could get insane running speed.
---
these guys know how to classic
---
Paladins have significantly better AoE threat than warriors and druids. If you’re doing undead content then triple this.
---
The SSD upgrade is a game changer.
---
&gt;muh toxic
---
You're crying about pvp on a pvp server
---
You need to stretch your banal opinions out to ten minutes if you want to monetize them properly.
---
Well I apologize then, if you've seen the shit the other people have posted in here you'd see why I came off as a bit defensive. People are literally saying I have deep rooted social issues irl, because I like gank in world of Warcraft... Lol.
---
Oh god please don't remind me...I'm gonna play on the german realms...
---
The german word for bear is "bär" Common names for hunterpets especially those of dwarfes:
---
* Hubschraubär. (Hubschrauber == Helicopter)
---
* Bärbel. (an old german female first name)
---
* Himbär. "Himbbere" == "Raspberry"
---
Really? they cater to them so much already I would think it's just par for the course. I mean i get it they bring in income but streamers are cancer, just like "influencers" for non-nerdy shit.           
---
           
---
I just hope to god they stay the fuck away from RP servers, I dont mind they exist as long as they dont ruin the game and I think that why I hate them so much. Imagine for a second you love something or someone, you love that thing or person to the point where you base your entire life around it/them and then someone gives you money to ruin/kill them, surprise surprise. You do.
---
I still have my tabard.
---
I want to roll Alliance this time around, but holy shit do Alliance have garbage casting animations. Female Undead is just perfect animation wise.
---
This was my secondary warrior that i started to main early 2006, My previous and after TBC main warrior was/is still rocking all the fancy stuff but i did get the full t0.5 quest done - getting the helmet and some other neat stuff that was sadly way easier to replace than the t3 gear hehe.
---
That idle animation where they swing the whole body just to look over their shoulder.
---
I do have monetize on, theres no point lol
---
Pet me daddy
---
&gt; Where did someone say they will slander people across message boards for "pvping"?
---
You. You literally said so in your example. The example sounded like stream sniping, but any rogue or night elf who crept in the shadows knows that sometimes their target just walks straight up to them by pure chance. And you said yourself, if they get blacklisted for that, *unfortunate, but tough luck*. 
---
&gt;This is an individual deciding them and their friends won't group with you.
---
Oh please, as if we couldn't go back right now to the YT mirror and see exactly what soda called for: global Blacklists for anyone to subscribe to. "anything that the actual good guilds of the alliance are doing". "You'll never get good raids, you'll never get good gear"
---
That goes beyond a few friends. That is full on slander and shaming of a player, for no reason other than a gank. And any time Soda hides in stealth form and someone just finds and kills him anyways, his name goes on the blacklist (your words).
---
and you’re too dense to understand that stream sniping gives an unfair advantage and is not just “pvp”.
---
Neat.
---
Unpopular opinion: Undercity is the best city in the game and undead are the only horde race. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
---
Yee 8-)
---
Why, because some SJW could throw a hissyfit? Let them.
---
It’s only a job im the sense that he pays taxes.
---
Being a streamer is as much having a job as being an athlete. Are there elements that are demanding, sure. It’s life, everyone has shit work in their life. 
---
But I can’t imagine for a second a pro athlete or successful streamer trading in their gig to be a traveling sandpaper salesman, claim adjuster, carpenter, accountant, software engineer, mechanic....
---
Yet if given the opportunity between literally being paid to play a game or do any of the above 40-60 hours a week, bet your ass they’d take it. 
---
The thing too many people forget is being a singer, athlete, streamer, influencer, actor...isn’t a skill you can just be world class at if you work hard enough. Anyone with a basic intelligence can learn accounting, coding, cars, insurance policies....
---
It doesn’t matter how many times I swing a bat...I will never be Frank Thomas, I’ll never play csgo like Stewie2k, nor will I ever have the face and depth of expression Steve Buscemi can display on screen.
---
So ya life isn’t fair, most of us don’t have some freakish skill or feature, most of us can’t game like shroud, ball like LeBron, sing like Beyoncé or act like DiCaprio—life sucks a bit more for the rest of us.
---
So everyone watching Classic right now likes to watch streams while they play? I have two monitors, I only keep music and chats on the second one while playing, or turn it off.
---
Druid dps that innervate the priest, help deal with aggro by taunting mobs off healers and do some healing themselves....
---
So basically Runescape is like a third world country.
---
Druids can’t do a lot of things while shapeshifted, can they? They can’t skin beasts or talk to NPCs or use potions, right?
---
&gt;You. You literally said so in your example. The example sounded like stream sniping, but any rogue or night elf who crept in the shadows knows that sometimes their target just walks straight up to them by pure chance. And you said yourself, if they get blacklisted for that, unfortunate, but tough luck.
---
Blacklist isn't slandered across forums. Blacklist is not being grouped with. Jesus christ you don't even know what you're upset about. Try again.
---
It took an insane amount of grinding to get to 70 for the greater wand. Enchanting is hard to level in comparison to tailoring.
---
Well it's exactly the same as how they are indirectly ruining this sub. 
---
The fact that every time something negative is said about then causes a brigade of there fanboys just shows how immature their audience is and how it will ruin any server that they're on.
---
Right tho? Barrens chat is older than twitch chat. 
---
And frankly any negatives of a streamer server will be cancelled out by the population size and community events that get formed. 
---
This is gaming in 2019, just cause we are getting a remake of a 2004 game we remember fondly won't change that. The salt threads have been entertaining at least
---
&gt; The "one druid" raiding thing is true but a little overblown.
---
It's full of SHIT. Back in Vanilla we had literally 5 raiding druids, recently on a private server, we had 3. (Only because we couldn't FIND ANY OTHERS)
---
Druids are awesome. People lose sight of how far we have come in player skill over content.
---
Nah spells, abilities, and talents will all be 1.12.
---
Actually you could drag and drop party frames out of the raid tab. I healed MC through Naxx that way in vanilla and did quite well.
---
A cutting edge guild will have multiple tanks farming blue t0 asap in dungeons.
---
you know they would get banned from twitch right? It’s against ToS because those private servers are against blizzard ToS because the private servers are profiting illegally from their IP.
---
horde are total pricks on rp-pvp servers and my dumb ass roll alliance on one. big fucking mistake. to this day if i ever found some of those horde i would beat them irl with a lead pipe. i'll never do world pvp EVER again cause of that server!
---
Of those, they can skin.
---
Any race hunter. Any good hunter that is &gt;= 5 levels lower than you should wreck you - regardless of gear. 
---
If you’re open world and did not see it coming a hunter should and probably will win every time.
---
I haven't been to a sandy zone yet, and didn't notice it snowing in dun morogh. But it definitely rains its ass off. [https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousObliquePotatoCclamChamp](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousObliquePotatoCclamChamp)
---
Let me put it this way:
---
If you bring your owl to a raid, and its useless, fuckin screetch knocks off my Curse of Elements/Shadows/Doom, then so the gods below stand as my witness, I will bribe every single warlock on the server, making you run to every raid until hell freezes over!
---
Huh, that's cool.  Makes sense when you think about the definition of Parry.  Basically you get to follow up a Parry with a Riposte.
---
This isn't anywhere near ungoro.
---
So do i need to buy the game again or can i use my cd key from 2004-05
---
Yep! Beating each other to death with foam swords basically. People usually watched too as it was interesting seeing druids constantly be shifting forms and using all of them to their advantage.
---
I would rather be water boarded, but thank you for the offer
---
Why did you make this post, you could roflstomp on everything if that item keeps the fast attack speed.
---
Kat Durid is 4 fite!
---
This is all available considering the rogue doesn’t kill the lock in that time, as well.
---
&gt;unfair advantage
---
If you're purposefully broadcasting your location in real time then you have only yourself to blame.
---
Yeah, I did vanilla as a no lifer. I have too much goin on in RL now with the kids and such. So Im playing alliance PVE in the Beta. FOund a great group to run with, who will even allow things like Bear tanks ect
---
I'm well aware.  But you appear to not be aware of what I am saying hehe.  In Ungoro there are rock stacks that are... Well yeah...
---
Paladins aren’t going to be doing much.
---
This might be the worst post on classic I've ever seen. Tokens? Of all the changes, tokens? That would ruin everything
---
No potions while in form, npc's yes, skin yes, mining no, herb yes.
---
And who pissed in your cereal bowl this morning?
---
You can skin beasts, but yeah you need to be in a humanoid form to talk to NPCS and pop pots.
---
Best way to do it really, when I wanted Barbarous Blade on my Hunter I formed the groups and checked the party members didn't want it which I think is fair.
---
The thing is that this whole "1 million subs left" thing is something that you've just completely made up. You have no actual hard evidence to prove any of it. You're literally creating fake news just to try and divide the community even further.
---
teebus blazing longsword!
---
This guy knows to thin his paints.
---
He has good production values. He's streaming constantly with a good setup. You'd think it would be obvious, but there's still streamers with garbage setups wondering why nobody is watching them
---
Meat.
---
I've sent you a pm
---
Hunters are kings of wpvp.
---
&gt;I also mentioned I'm not entirely sure how well the old record will hold up
---
People have already beaten the current vanilla lvling record by *a lot*, granted this is up to lvl 40 at the moment, but there's a good reason to assume that the lvl 60 record will be broken easily.
---
The internet is relentless
---
When you are leveling you should spec full feral 14/32/5 and then change to heart of the wild (0/30/21) at level 60 or at the earliest around level 56 if you want to start healing 5 mans.
---
I started playing RPPvP in Warlords and it's nice. I don't roleplay much myself but it's a much more immersive experience. The world feels more alive when you're walking through Dalaran and you see an Orc reciting poetry to a group of Goblins or a traditional Gnomish wedding ceremony.
---
It's also a super-fun endgame to come up with characters and then transmog-hunt for their costume.
---
Please send this to Mountain dew!
---
I can see it now... your chores are do dishes, dust living room, farm 200 peacebloom lol
---
I don’t play a single mobile game. It’s just awful most of the time
---
I’m F/16/LA given me gold pls
---
Free internet polls are horribly biased towards the kind of people who opt in to them. But they could insert a poll onto login on retail WoW that asks "1. Are you interested in playing WoW Classic? 2. If so, what kind of realm would you prefer to play on?" Current retail players aren't fully representative of the people who will play Classic, but on the huge reddit survey an absolute majority of people had played BfA, meaning that recent WoW players are *generally* representative of the potential Classic playerbase. If there's more demand for RPPvP than RPPvE among current retail players, that would be a good indication that RPPvP is a good idea for WoW Classic's launch.
---
how do you sing this, give us a baseline song atleast.
---
Warlocks and SPriests also do work.
---
Touched a nerve lol I’ll bet you work for Vox
---
Are you telling me i played horde for 6 years and never noticed this?
---
I'm honestly just considering not inviting any hunters to my groups.
---
Druids are insanely mechanical especially with the use of power shifting. Really cool class
---
wotlk DK and Ret palas were insane
---
&gt; Each phase is approx 2-3 months
---
Shit posts are parody
---
You get Lupos while everyone else is lvl farming to be honest and he does you good with the shadow damage all the way to 60
---
Ackthually
---
These where so good! Please make it happen once again!
---
This is like a bad political meme posted a 90 year old on facebook
---
I’ll SS you if you’re a healer, but anyone else or asking for a healthstone as well? Get fucked twat
---
Who cares? Just find a good guild on your server. You could always make one.
---
I just imagined a whole chess board with figures like this lol. But what class would be the pawn.
---
Yeah I know of the player pogchamp but isn't POG, even in his name, not an acronym for Play of the Game?
---
&gt; yet, once BG come out you can bet world PvP will shrink to nothingness... as it did back then.
---
This did not happen on my server.
---
Another lolret post? This is the peak of comedy.
---
Yes, when I was used "you guys" I was referring to absolutely 100% of the people who browse this subreddit, and not making a generalization based on top upvoted posts and comments demonstrating anti-streamer sentiments. To assume that I didn't mean 100% of everyone everywhere is just ridiculous. I obviously meant 100% of all people everywhere. This is how "you guys" is meant to be colloquially understood in the English language.
---
When one makes a comment on the fact that a large amount of comments of a previous thread were fantasizing about going out of their way to camp a streamer they of course mean to argue that every single person did that, yes.
---
&gt; in your logic, getting ganked means more subs. more subs equals $$ 
---
If it is entertaining, of course.
---
&gt; problem? 
---
What?
---
I have bunch of murlocs, would they work? :D
---
Ooh god I am so happy when I get buffs. Itreally can be a difference between life or death in some cases. Even mages int buff for skilling up my new weap i just found that has .05 more dps. But ive never used one before.
---
So it's distributed by telepathy? Come on..
---
I'm compiling a similar list for [my hunter](https://puu.sh/DD0SP/f486838796.png) and for my friends. I saw  some people list Warrior and Druid already but what should Priests skip out on to save some extra cash for level 40?

@ The irrationally angry people in the comments: it's a given that we're going to buy all of our skills *after* getting to level 40 or 60 after we have purchased our mounts and riding skills. I just feel like it's a bit silly to yell at people who are prioritizing their mounts, bags and other essentials before their ability to maximize their Mongoose Bite rank.
---
I'll continue to add my support to each of these threads I see for as long as it take Blizz to reverse course on this awful decision.
---
Undead
---
Dwarf or Human.
---
"lol ur mad"
---
Could you be any more of a cliche?
---
Man, this sub wants like 15 different types of servers.
---
Agreed. My pserver guild is rolling to classic together. It’s the only reason I have a guild already. Otherwise, I’d just wait till classic to find one.
---
From what I've seen, hardcore is clearing MC within 2-4 weeks, which I am inline to do.
---
Classic raids aren't that hard, especially MC and Onyxia. But even retail raids are a million times harder then Classic ones will be.. You will see people pugging Molten Core within the first month too
---
Damn dude
---
Where’d you pick up the mini from?
---
Skin yes, npcs yes.
---
If mobile gaming would literally the erased overnight, do you really think the people playing Candy Crush would switch into PC gaming?
---
Yea theyre worth it, the /played times per level from those on the beta are getting very consistent and good xp in scarlet monestary. However, dungeon grinding is only good in dungeons such as those and only worthwhile if you spam run them relentlessly. If you travel all the way to a dungeon entrance only to do it one or twice (assuming youve already done the quests) then its a lot of wasted time traveleing. If you and youre group are dedicated to running the same instances over and over until you outlevel it then yes its completely worthwhile. Not all instances are worth doing tho, scarlet monestary is great because all the dungeons are next to each other but broken up into their own sections. So, in comparison, if you look at uldaman the beginning mobs are lvl 37 and at the end theyre like lvl 45. This is super inconvenient for xp and drags leveling drastically. Because youd want to be around 42-43 for uldaman for a clean no wipe run. The issue with going in at that level is that you have to fight through the level 37 mobs to progress through the instance. Those low level mobs will have massive xp reductions. Now imagine if uldaman was broken up into 4 sections like scarlet monestary, and each had their own level range of mobs that only differed by 2-3 levels from beginning to end. That would make uldaman very worth doing. This same logic can be applied to other dungeons as well. ZF has a good compact level rage of mobs, roughly 43-46. Stockades as well if youre ally. Sunken temple might be worth it but i cant say for sure, it is hard on private servers especially the armor reduction mobs and the packs that can sleep the healer. If its not tuned as hard as private servers then itll be worth it to grind from about lvl 50+ or the first half of brd. However, if youre not up to spamming the dungeons over and over until you outlevel it then Id say its not as efficient if youre ahead of the pack. If youve fallen behind the pack and questing is overly crowded then even doing 2-3 times might be on pace or slightly better, as weve seen from the beta update from 30-40. In the end its really subjective to the circumstances youre in and if you dont get too bored rerunning the same instances. But so long as you go into the dungeon with quests and then repeat the instance for a couple times it probably is equal to questing at that rate tbh
---
No bear mounts, but you do you, boo.
---
The point is to find that guild on your server while you are leveling. It will be obvious which guild that is because they will be ahead of the pack leveling.
---
Why would I play without Add-ons? I used them in Vanilla. All the QoL changes I want are game changes, anyway. Can't make an add-on that eliminates a Hunter's need for ammo, pets not insta-lvling to your level, Achievements to work towards and get rewards from, or mounts being cheap and riding skill being expensive.

You are welcome here bearded brother!

I got Manual Crowd Pummelers. I'm good, bro.
---
&gt;the warnings that have been expressed on big streamer's affect on the game.
---
Without streamers, there would be no game lol
---
This. You're probably 6 months late to find a hardcore guild prior to launch. I'm sure there are guilds forming around now with the intention of being hardcore but unless they are over-recruiting massively the chance of actually reaching 60 with a solid raid group is slim.
---
Night elf

Sitting invisible near cliffs and killing people with mind control will bring you more joy than fear wars ever will
---
The last PC I built was in 2010, the mobo failed last year so I haven't had a PC since. I am going all out and am going to be living the high life for launch. I know what I build will be overkill, but who knows what else I'll want to play down the road.
---
I can't wait.
---
I guess you've been locked in a closet since 2004 along with Classic? Even so, AOL instant messenger was available back then, so I have faith in you figuring out how information can be passed privately between different friends without using a public shaming forum.
---
I believe in you! That is your homework for the weekend. Once you figure out that instant messengers exist, you'll have a blast figuring out gsuite.
---
Who cares? I didn’t think he was an ass. He can’t read it for you. It’s up to the reader to determine. Caps for emphasis does not make someone an ass just because you think so.

soil make great music imo :)
---
I just logged in and gave away about 670k gold, a bank full of epix BoEs and mats coz I will never return to Bfa again. Been lookin forward to play vanilla once again since wotlk ended....and now its only 80 days left.
---
We’re onto streamers bad now
---
Troll for Shadowguard.
---
Which is not what you said in your post. You said world pvp is worthless, nothing more than your opinion. Your opinion is worthless, the fact I have to explain this just reinforces the point.
---
I continue to play retail and can find fun in it. If you have a sub, just try it. If you like it, cool. If you don't, cool.
---
World of Warcraft Board Game, 125 sculpts, Gnome mage's, Troll rogues, Tauren warriors and lots of lots enemies. Currently painting them to get classic feeling :D
---
Best priest race is dwarf, but if you really want to go horde then undead.
---
Rogues are good every 5 minutes.
---
Prot warrior. Just no.
---
just a single rppvp server is all i need! i love rp servers and the community they foster so much more than anything i've ever found on pvp/pve realms and it has made my experinces in wow so memorable and exciting... but classic is classic, it just isn't the same without open-world pvp
---
Eh, I think for most people, MMOs aren't interesting to watch. WoW is kind of the outlier because of how popular it is.
---
Our GM was a Ret and he got it.
---
Don’t listen to these people. Undead is the master race. They get Devouring Plauge as an extra spell, which is benefited from shadow form. Extra DoT
---
Prior to the advent of instanced PvP...pvp was in many cases raiding the opposite faction capital and killing the leader.
---
Many of thecraiding guilds on Vanilla put their kill dates for Rag, Ony, Hakka, Nef...and Thrall, Carin, Sylvanas (vice versa). 
---
That was all back before rewards dominated decision making. People used to even organize roaming PvP tournaments that were completely shit for honor/hr. But were ya know...fun.
---
Had a gm in bc call Tanaris: Tanaree. Like it was a French pronunciation.
---
Wow your investigational journalism really got me, one day you could work for HuffPo with those deduction skills. 
---
Let me guess, I am also Russian.
---
I was a Holy Paladin's and I had a druid jump me in un goro one time...  I think we fought for something like 50 min... chasing me all the way to gadetzen is what finally ended it....
---
The classic crowd wants the success of classic to be a big "FUCK YOU" to blizzard and similar game devs that try to make their games into some kind of online utopia that caters to every kind of player. In reality, all that does is ruin meaningful gameplay. BFA deserves to fail. Change my mind.
---
Memes aside, the answer is to be at least somewhat knowledgable of bis for other classes and roll when appropriate.
---
Is enchanting/tailoring a good combo in vanilla too?
---
How high are you right now?
---
8 months of prep for a Classic WoW guild seems pretty insane. That's unfortunate if that's true.
---
All I want is a guild thats gonna clear MC in 2-4 weeks because I'm no life-ing the game too. I've practiced routes, know all the raid fights, etc. So there's no hope for me to find a guild like that despite the fact i'm putting in time, which is the most valuable skill in Classic WoW?
---
It was introduced in WotLK with the achievement system
---
warlocks are a strong wPvP class but their "recovery" after death is absolute garbage. you revive with 50% health and a bit of mana, no pet and no armor. only thing you can do is mount up and run
---
And the hex, 'mon. Applies a 20% MS and costs almost no mana. Mouseover and spam in BGs.
---
He's only 500g short of his epic mount. Still got a waaaaays to go
---
Achievements don't exist until Wrath, but raiding cities was still a thing in classic. People just did it for fun and not for the mount. You'll have better luck on a PvP server though.
---
Have you seen this sub?  It’s the exact opposite. 
---
Question for you though, when you see “casuals” talking shit about try hards do you go and defend them too?  
---
The hypocrisy in this sub is unreal. Maybe not you specifically but the majority.
---
I think his humor style attracts a lot of people as well. He's very quick and witty with most things
---
Don’t comment on a thread asking for the best with this trash
---
Do one for hunters
---
I thought that this subreddit was nice and kind.. Obviously you proved me that i was wrong...
---
&gt; and that they are instead paying for something that was free before they did it, and continues to be free afterwards
---
you think soda would stream every day if he didnt get all those donations? free is an interesting term to use for a situation like this.
---
Who does that? I’ve never heard that before.
---
Yeah definitely. Enchanting just usually costs a lot of time and money to max out but you can get value out of disenchanting boe's for people. If you do enchanting you almost definitely do tailoring or a gathering profession to offset the cost
---
Troll is best for horde. Shadowguard scales extremely well and is far better DPS whenever you can use it compared to mind flay.
---
Undead is wrong for pvp and pve, people need to learn
---
it's, it's hideous wtf?
---
Dude it was only 800k smh
---
Like contacting Blizzard requires any balls. Its obvious your claims are based on nothing, rather not waste both mine and the devs time just because you are delusional. I bet you don't even have a beta access and if I ask you to prove it with a proper screenshot or a video you would refuse.
---
My response to Sodapoppin: who are you?
---
We called him "Steve" because no one could agree on a pronunciation.
---
Yeah that's why I've watched some of his react videos.  His thoughts and points are actually quite good or interesting (even when I disagree) but I can't watch him play the game... The first time he died in an Arathi Basin 1v1 he was crying like a biatch.
---
Also, you should use this with inner focus. Same 3min CD, and you get a free large heal and DOT.
---
Only really other good race is troll, and that is for healing priests
---
Kripp would do anything for a buck.  First thing that comes to mind is shit talking Amazon so he could pedal G2A's stolen keys, and then as soon as Amazon Prime and Twitch were integrated he became the biggest Amazon fan for those subs.
---
Hyjal was a Place you could get to in vanilla, just ask the people I summoned down the well of eternity to fall for well, eternity (or till a GM ported them out). I assure you it wasn’t as black as you make it seem to be.
---
He didn't delete his account, u/Forbes-23 just [deleted his comment](https://i.imgur.com/x4F3kd1.png) in shame after being cocky.
---
Now I wanna hear you say adrian.
---
shadowguard is underrated af
---
Undead or troll. Undead has the stronger ability with devouring plague, but it has a 3 min CD, which will be cleansed. Troll has no CD and theirs is a self buff, meaning the only counter is a priest purging you.
---
Dwarf. Ironskin, gigantic instant cast self heal.
---
Somehow already written out my basic/cheap starting gear list for when I hit 60, my BiS list for Phase 1, and my BiS list for phase 2. Don't know what else to do now.
---
gottem
---
He doesn't have Shadow damage in Classic.
---
That’s the concern.  I don’t feel this so acutely, but it’s a small concern of mine.
---
vast majority is 60-62.  The 6% spell hit from the elemental precision talent caps you for mobs +2 levels above, so all of the hit on bloodvine is wasted on those pulls.
---
What's it like to be filled with so much bitterness?
---
Sounds like a lot of people will avoid grouping with random hunters.
---
I usually try to level efficiently (I’ve done all the dungeons tons of times so I may not be the best person to take advice from but for the sake of your post on what is “worth” doing from just a number crunching perspective and not a “experience” or some intangible value one) There is nothing efficient about SM - especially for alliance.
---
Well done.
---
Retail servers aren't really the same thing though. With all the cross realm stuff going on behind the scenes you rarely see your own realms player base consistently. He wasn't even streaming before cross-realm servers and intense sharding happened.
---
Thats the moment he gets kicked out of the group and blacklisted. Id understand stat weapons. But this is a huge weapon, and they have no use at all for it.
---
Yeah they would just add a cash shop... and make it not classic yay!!!!
---
&gt;nowdays most is balanced
---
Homogenized*. FTFY.
---
This could be resolved by companies not bending to the will of young adults who play too many video games and think they have literally any authority.
---
You simply aren't aware of how prepared guilds will be for this. The top two competitors have a roster of AT LEAST 40 players who are capable of hitting 60 on the 5th and 6th day, with another 60 or so players stacked on top in case the main raid can't meet leveling times.
---
Also account selling was big back then, especially because it took such a long time to level characters.
---
I think in Germany you were able to buy a fresh 60 for 80€ or so on eBay. By far not a good hourly wage, but for what you are actually doing it isn't even that bad.
---
Cash shop and all.
---
No need to demonize the hard working developers just trying to do their best and make video games. There are millions of players enjoying BfA right now, the anti-BfA hype was blown way out of proportion. Just because its not for you or this community doesn't mean you have to say "FUCK YOU" to the other one, just like retail players don't have to hate people that want Classic. We can have both. Change my mind.
---
Probably, but why make it worse :(

I don't have a link, but one of the streamers (I think Esfand or Tipsout) released an interview with Ion and he was talking about layering lasting only for phase 1 and estimated it to be 3 weeks to 3 months. That's the most detail I've heard.
---
Mooncloth/Ebonweave/Spellsomething was a choice for tailors in BC. Vanilla was just straight up tailoring. I was always happy with tailoring/enchanting on my priest.
---
This whole subs obsession with AND against streamers is pathetic.
---
They're just people. Who cares, honestly?
---
I was in an AV once on my druid... stopped on the initial zerg charge to take one of the towers ... there was a paladin inside. I fought him continuously for the entire game. 2 more druids and 2 more paladins showed up and they fought for the rest of the game too. Once in a while some guy would die but he would make it back before the others could capitalize on the 3v2.
---
(this was during the 1 hour AVs, not the 48 hour AVs.)
---
I'll roll on it anyway
---
Just to be clear: you think that the only reason someone might not want to casually compare black people to gorillas is because it might annoy SJWs?
---
We’re gonna have a long time with just mc and ony... depending on your raid schedule and luck you might be able to get one.
---
Ok good, had me worried for a minute lol. Thanks by the way :D
---
Randomly chiming in here to mention how pleasantly surprised I am to see someone touch on what’s the cutting edge of medical practice right now. 
---
Currently there’s a major push in medicine to pursue “practice based evidence” as opposed to the classic evidence based practice. Essentially, people are only just realizing how much of our previous research and theory was influenced by context from which it originated. It’s very similar to what you’re saying here. Because hybrids became known as bad, fewer and fewer people pursued them at the highest level, couple that with more and more people focusing on HPS and DPS and less variety in utility provided, and it’s resulted in the extinction of hybrids that we currently see.
---
ret prio
---
Hey man, I'm Alliance, but that's pretty dope, you almost put a tear in my eye. I was at the store when I read this, the woman behind the desk thought I was retarded or something because of the face I made.
---
Apparently it doesnt take very long at all, a few hours of aoe grinding on a mage, and you only need honored for it.
---
yeah, I had a couple 1v1's that went on long enough that I asked my wife to fly out to the plaguelands and kill the guy for me.
---
oh stuns don't, I should have been more precise!
---
Fears last for 9 seconds on first time, but they break on damage.
---
Stuns last 5 seconds on first time, don't break on damage but can be dispelled with what is called a trinket, or with a racial ability from the humans. Both get reduced when applied multiple times in a row!
---
I wasn’t cocky, I asked for proof, I deleted my comment for being wrong
---
Theres more to a raid than dps.
---
As a PvE combat rogue with sword specialization, you want to know your weapon swing timers so you can cast your instant attacks (i.e. sinister strike) just after you auto attack (when there is a long time until your next auto attack). 
---
The reason is that your instant attacks can proc sword specialization (basically a free auto attack) and then reset your swing timer. So if you wait until right before your swing is about to reset, then you get less of a benefit from the sword specialization proc off your instant attack because you were about to get a swing anyways. Figuring out this rhythm can help increase your DPS and get the most out of your talents.
---
Micro transactions.
---
I play hunter, rogue, Druid and warrior. 
---
Just don’t feel entitled to drops because they are “optimal” for my class.
---
Doesnt it just reduce by half the first 3 time then 4th they are immune?
---
I would but not NA.
---
Fuck democracy
---
But paladins can't go invisible :(
---
But it would be fun as hell to do this somewhere in Durotar where people are usually dueling. MC a hordie, give him kings, and have them go back to the gates to duel people.
---
First person they duel: "Hey, take off that Blessing... Of... Kings...? WHAT?"
---
Either human or Nelf.
---
Human Spirit or Shadowmeld.
---
You did mean Smite Priest, right?
---
All of our dads put sperm in our moms so that we could be here today and play classic WoW
---
Hi, /u/GlisteningCelery
---
Yeah the hunter definitely knew they were in the wrong because they instantly left the group once they got it.
---
Yes yes yes this is all very fine, but why are you not in Scarlet Monastary???
---
Yep, in honor of the greatest metal band from finland!
---
Your litterally retarded,  making fun of people having a legit complaint? Lmfao, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat a joke
---
There are people out there who, when they first get a game immediately search out a guide to explain how to play that game. Someone who follows guides, and who never got to experience the fun spells wont even realize what they are missing out on. They will grind up to max level, do thier quests, get bored and then say "I dont get what the big deal is, this is just retail but boring." They will have missed the magic that was right in front of them.
---
I just dont think we should encourage people to skip the fun. Why even bother with classic at that point.
---
Nothing of value.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwb02y/thank_you_tipsout_for_building_such_an_awesome/epxadnw/

I did it by picking flowers (herbalism). 
---
I think there was a guy a while back that did a “pacifist” character that only got xp from non-fighting options. He wasn’t able to do this until WotLK I think though, because there were limits on xp from professions.
---
You can have both. That's fine. I didn't demonize anyone. I said nothing about them. I criticized their design direction. Huge difference. Millions of people enjoy candy crush. Doesn't mean it's a good game. I can say "FUCK YOU" to any shitty game if I want. It's my opinion. Retail deserves to die. Retail WoW is a disgrace and insult to what WoW was about during vanilla.
---
Hahah "ask"
---
Oh, huh. I never noticed them.
---
Found the guy who likes to look at man-ass all day and thinks he's in the majority. lul
---
But its not the same as games like EQ or FFXI where literally the only job of some classes is to buff/debuff.
---
I loved Bard in FFXI. It used to be one of the busiest jobs in the game.

They're entitled little pricks.

Every good druid I've played against , even in vanilla, started duels in cat form and got bleeds up initially but yeah I agree you can't stay in cat in duels very often, also in general for druids like with killing most mobs you'll need the cat DoTs to kill them quickly
---
&gt; "Bring the player, not the class".
---
I love the contradiction!                   
---
"Bring the player, not the class"                 
---
                 
---
Proceeds to strip spells away from the classes least invited anyways.
---
Test in windowed mode.  
---
Some vanilla clients from private servers does not support some resolutions and Hz.
---
This is truly a miracle, I'll thank my dad later
---
No use at all?  **At all?**
---
The fact that you think it's complaining about streamer privilege is legitimate... REEEEEE THEY GOT INTO THE BETA AND I DIDN'T REEEEEE!!!!
---
Addons don’t tell you anything the game and a third arm with a stopwatch wouldn’t. Or just the ability to count out multiple timers simultaneously in your head would do. 
---
Addons just present the information in a useful manner...typically one of the end users configuration. 
---
It takes just as much skill to set up your addon and react to it appropriately (and to min max all the extra time you have) as it does to not use addons and constantly parse your chat log and commit the high skill play of stopping dps earlier to make sure you account for errors in your mental counting.
---
Addons that play the game for you get banned pretty quickly by blizzard, addons that organize information are fine, and using them appropriately is the sign of a skilled player. Refusing is some sort of high minded ignorance, akin to being an antivaxxer.
---
And be sure to have the monitor with the highest resolution as primary.
---
No worries.
---
Back when southshore was PVP heaven, I had that happen on various toons I played there. Was always fun to have someone go mutually assured destruction or come at me for an easy kill after a fight, and I would ding and be full health.
---
&gt; You can have both
---
&gt; It deserves to die
---
It is, beta testing use to be what's its called.  I know your prepubescent and don't understand that though.  Go to bed Billy.
---
Is 11/31/9 a thing? I haven't kept up on it, but I'd think that if you're not going enough into resto to be decent at healing, you should get swiftshifting out of balance? (i.e. 14/32/5 or something like that)
---
There were tons of addons already back in Classic. I don’t really see the problem.
---
Proud to be a racist, I guess.
---
Traitor!
---
If anything this video just encourages more people to roll on his server to gank him. He already seems so mad and classic isn't even out yet lol.
---
That’s just visual
---
Or you’ll meet APES, never kill a world boss, never skin a devilsaur, and have to compete with 2 mil honor every week
---
If only you could use other people's abilities under MC.
---
I guess it depends on your definition of hardcore. There's a huge difference between clearing MC week 2 and week 4. Almost all guilds that fall under my definition of hardcore have been playing together on pservers, retail or other games so they are already established.
---
That's not to say there's no hope of finding a guild like this, but you'll probably just have to get lucky and be on a server where one exists and needs your class once level 60 rolls around. A lot of people are underestimating how many people won't even make it to max level so there are definitely gonna be raidspots available.
---
Now I am kinda.
---
Wrong, you have to play the long game. Meet them in a dungeon with a girl char, don’t let on you’re a girl straight away wait for them to ask, then tell them yes you are a girl. Let them give you some gold they’ll ask you to come on ventrilo day I don’t have a mic yet and sting em on for a few more weeks. I know my gold making ;)
---
Well it's a trash warrior weapon. It should be priod to hunters who pvp and then paladins who want it for an offset.
---
You only need an active subscription.
---
What mechanics? Its a dps race.
---
Retail is fun for 6-8 hours a week if you can raid log in a mythic guild. 
---
Outside of that, just figure out how to get on an...alternative server, or just go outside and enjoy the last summer you’ll have for 3 years.
---
Just play a private server and sick around , try different classes to level 20... it’s way more fun than BFA
---
And off zeppelins.
---

Why would a hunter take a low damage casting staff?  You do realize hunters have to actually use their melee weapon from time to time right?

What? Would you like to discuss this over voice? You seem confused.
---
Thanks for your detailed response! I think I’m going to go Warlock.
---
Troll is phenomenally better than undead for shadow priests. Shadowguard is much better dps and rank 1 can be used for blackout procs in PvP. Devouring plague is cleansable by paladin and priest and shaman if youre dueling, and is 900 mana with a 3 minute CD. Berserking and hex of weakness are great as well. I prefer undead only if I'm concerned about PVE Healing, as wotf+skull+ pvp trinket makes u very hard to cc.
---
Alright I've got a plan. First of all, you join a guild. Doesn't matter if you're an officer or average raider, just as long as you get in there. Then, just log on every day. Do the dungeons. Do the raids. Gain their trust until you get them in the palm of your hand.
---
How do you get the loot?
---
That's the beauty of it. They deposit the loot straight into your inventory. Week after week. Month after month. Then, twenty, thirty months later, you /gquit out the front door like nothing even happened.
---
so how do you avoid streamer servers? I dont want to be on a server with frogposting swarms of entitled babies and people who idolize youtube personalities.
---
Everything you said is true. I get where you're coming from as far as WPVP dwindling once BGs release, and I wish that weren't the case. It would be awesome if WPVP stayed more impactful after BGs. Sure, we wont have the crazy clusterfuck of TM vs SS raids all day after BGs are out, but I can just about guarantee you that Hillsbrad will still be a WPVP shitshow through the lifetime of a server. The reason I mentioned capital city raids is they only have negative impact on honor and yet people still find them fun and still do them, regardless of rewards. It's kinda like people dueling outside capital cities, most of the time there's no reward outside having fun and being able to "I won", but they're will always be someone waiting out there to duel.
---
Does WPVP suffer from implementing BGs? Absolutely. Does that mean there's no fun to be had in WPVP and it's totally pointless? Absolutely not.
---
Maybe at some point Blizz will implement a way to make WPVP more relevant again.
---
&gt;With the amount of addons you need to be able to be competitive in raids, you cover up most of your screen.
---
Plenty of raiders use UIs even more minimalist than the default.  Most of the crap you see in those meme-y screenshots is completely unnecessary.  You don't actually need damage and threat meters covering half your screen, people just suck at building good UIs.  You don't even need action bars.
---
&gt;Some addons tell you where to move and when, that's pretty much not you playing but the addon. Raiding then is pretty much degraded to a game of reflexes and knowing your surroundings plays no role at all.
---
You still have to move your character when you get Living Bomb.  Addons aren't gonna do that for you.  If someone wants to use an addon to make receiving that debuff more obvious, why shouldn't they be able to?
---
&gt;A game without addons would be more about skill. That's pretty much a fact because that's how the official competitive games for pvp in wow are played.
---
Is a raid leader who uses a damage meter to identify poor healing/DPS more or less skillful than a raid leader whose raid keeps wiping to gear checks because that leader doesn't have the tools to identify the problem?  Why is farming consumables skillful, but configuring a UI to better understand my surroundings isn't?
---
&gt;Everyone is playing on equal grounds
---
Addons don't change this.  You're free to use any addon you want, as is everyone else.  If you truly want everyone on equal footing, why aren't you also arguing for screen resolution, latency, and framerate restrictions?
---
To be honest, after reading your post I'm still unclear as to why you're against using addons.
---
I’m drunk soz for spellcheck
---
BGs yes (especially WSG but also AB to a lesser extent. AV it depends on your skill, gear, and what you’re doing) farming absolutely (travel form and Car form are SUPER useful for this). World PvP has pros and cons. The biggest pro is you almost always get to pick your fights. You have a ton of way to escape stuff (switching form does most of the work, dash in Cat form helps get you away, too), can sneak up on people in Cat form, etc. However, winning straight up 1v1s can be difficult against some classes, so you should choose your fights wisely.
---
I dunno man, I’m not into butt stuff, and I like to think I’m a chip off the old block. Here’s to hoping genetics accounts for sexual preferences.
---
Scaled like they did with naxx?  No thanks...
---
It's the Internet Archive. World's biggest repository of archived web pages. So if a site or a page goes down, it'll still be available.
---
This sounds amazing, but impossible in classic? As you would require 3 sets of gear since the stats don't shift with your shape, and without proper stats the healing and dmg would be useless. Please correct me if I'm wrong, as I would love to be a shapeshifting monster.
---
As someone that tried going for enhance - I wouldn't recommend it. When if you get t raiding, which is unlikely if you aren't starting your own guild, you'll basically just be auto attacking and popping totems (you don't have mana for stormstrikes or shocks). Enhance is fun (not good) in PvP, but really boring in PvE. 
---
Feral is more likely to be used in raids. Especially if you're tanking. The DPS rotation is fairly complex, and the damage is respectable, and as a tank you're useful on trash, as an OT on bosses, or even MT on certain encounters.
---
Shadow
---
On one hand they talk abput their utility and hybrid power. Then they refuse to heal bc they want to show up on meters. Are you a hybrid or a hybrid pretending to be a pure dps?
---
Which part are you having the most trouble with? Need me to spell it out?
---
YEP! Which is what drew me to them in the first place. The skill ceiling is very high.
---
Sure, he's totally an asshole. Not for suggesting that people be held accountable for their actions, but for things like camping lowbies for hours, or the times when he has blown up and shown himself to be a big entitled manbaby.
---
I wouldn’t say AQ and Naxx were forgettable. They just butted right up against TBCs release, so they were over shadowed and made irrelevant quickly.
---
Troll is *probably* the best race for Horde and this is coming from someone who played Undead SPriest since 04. The reason I think Troll is better is for a few different reasons. The first being Berserking, you can do a lot with 10 seconds of increased casting speed but mostly you will be using it to spam Mana Burn. Getting extra Mana Burns off in a PvP fight is insanely good and cannot be under estimated, Mana Burn wins fights. The other reason is they get Shadowguard which gives them 3x charge self buff that can stun an attacker if you have Blackout(all SPriest should have Blackout) The Undead's equiv is Touch of Weakness and it only has 1x charge so you have to reapply it more often and it gives less chances to stun. You also have increased damage to Beasts which will help you while leveling....
---
NOW onto why I feel Undead are tied for 1st place with Troll. The obvious one is Will of the Forsaken, having an extra fear break is nice. You also have access to Devouring Plague which is kinda "meh" due to its insane mana cost BUT you can use Inner Focus to 100% reduce the mana cost (I make a macro that casts Inner Focus THEN casts Devouring Plague). Something people don't consider is Undead have a smaller character model. I always joke as a Priest you are always Main Tank in PvP, having a smaller character makes you hide in a crowd of friendlies easier.
---
Boomkin piece of shit!
---
i would be playing the beta instead of reading about streamers on this sub but they're the ones who got in
---
Hey, can you not be casually and disgustingly racist?
---
&gt; Gorilla: Listen I feel you on this one, everyone wants a big fuzzy Mike Tyson by their side and I can't argue. 
---
Also, owls suck.
---
I think it was 2. And I really like this system. The people that are nearest to the dungeon will go there and summon, so you don't have to wait for the one guy who can't seem to find the way forever... Or you roll for it... The faction fights in front of the stone... Some systems in TBC were really good, before everything turned to gump.
---
Explains why there are so many lame art posts and memes in this subreddit now.
---
I can understand Asmongold way more than Sodapoppin. Asmon has an interesting persona and he communicates a lot with his chat. Soda is just too annoying and grumpy for my personal taste.
---
It's almost like even way back then players begin to experience what it was like to reach burnout at a certain point in content. It's almost like that maybe they could then realize that the massive amounts of time they chose to play in the first half of the expansion directly contributed to their burnout in the second half of the expansion, and if they chose to play a more moderate schedule in the first half they would still be enjoying themselves in the second half.
---
Or maybe not. But you know how you played last time. You get to choose if you play that way this time.
---
People are saying that this exploit worked in vanilla but to me it seems like an old bug idk
---
Hopefully if people find new exploits for raid bosses they will be fixed
---
Whats the bug? Lol
---
*laughs in eu*
---
I'm pretty sure I dinged in Goldshire is some sort of double entendre.
---
I remember a guy saying this to me during Vanilla and I wrote him off. He just said, "yeah they got claw and can just keep casting it over and over again" was his reasoning. All these years I thought he was full of shit... but he was actually right, even if it was for the wrong reason.
---
It tingles 
---
It’s so good it tingles
---
how can we avoid that shit and find a server where our faction is actually populated with mostly level headed, mature adults with functioning intelligence?? its a must.
---
So it's possible, there is just an achievement for it?
---
I actually thought about doing this. But on the other hand, I would just turn into them, wouldn't I?
---
It went under after Ragnaros opened his own chain.
---
"Taste the flavors of Sulfuron!"
---
Not even a little. I have heard more then enough from the constant refrain of stream whiners.
---
Why aren't you buffing the brains? The pet needs more intellect to keep the hunter in check.
---
Awesome, this is sorta what I expected. I'm glad it's still possible!
---
Literally this. Welcome to humanity, graffiti has existed on any popular medium to the tune of "brianbgrp was here" for as long as there have been popular mediums
---
Why would they? They have to have RP names on RP servers and their streamer names don't fit more often than not.
---
&gt; I mean, I have seen people saying that like 90% of the players will quit Classic in the first 6 months....and I have no idea what are they basing their numbers on.
---
&gt; There will be plenty that will quit...but 90%?
---
The weird thing about those people saying that is the assumption that nobody else is going to join after release. I wouldn't be surprised at all if, between six to twelve months, the game has regained most of the numbers from its first month.
---
&gt;That's an argument whether you can contend with it or not haha  
---
&gt;seems like you can't
---
I'll admit to dramatizing the wording a bit, but you did say this, yes?
---
Without looking it up I feel like it was Cata or MoP
---
i am scared about the shroud fanbase. those people are weird
---
Do you prefer Infernals? I'm currently letting one dry with the base color before I start applying the green effects =)
---
You just reminded me of another one, where POM would get stuck at 0s, and mages could instant-cast all spells.  I remember seeing that in at least one PVP video.
---
No achievements in Vanilla (Classic), either..
---
Get fucking bent then, Child.
---
&gt; They make money doing something that most people here assume they themselves could do
---
it's not like it's an actually hard job like being a surgeon. success in streaming is 90% luck my friend
---
Enhancement is completely trash in raids so the only way you'll be playing it is in a mediocre guild. Feral at least is half-decent DPS if played correctly and has some utility.
---
I'm not saying its wrong, I'm saying both corpse camping and stream sniping are legit.
---
This isn't a privilege, anyone can make a blacklist. The issue is that for most people no one would care about their blacklist. If you don't want to be blacklisted by soda then don't stream snipe or go play on a pve server.
---
You can ofc get people and go kill Enemy faction leaders.
---
Some of them even did that during raid downtime
---
Of all the QOL addons.... just gimmie mail mod, auctioneer and I'm good. Mass posting of auctions suck, and mass retrieval of mail sucks.
---
And then there's decursive.... good luck cleansing on Chromaggus as a druid without it.
---
There is a thread available for guild Recruitment on Mondays "LFG Mondays"
---
Check the side bar :)
---
&gt;Which, in this case, would be Blizzard. Which stated that it is not cheating. Congrats, you played yourself.
---
You do you think Blizzaard doesn' consider it cheating because it's unethical to do so or because they don't have the actual means to legitimately police it? Pull your head out of your ass dude.
---
No one at Blizzard would agree that stream sniping doesn't fit the definition of cheating. The don't officially police it because they have no way to actually prove it lol
---
The strength of a pally tank is in speed running 5/10mans by overgearing a dungeon. You are the guy that is going to be helping the newbies get their prebis, you aren't going to be tanking raids though I have tanked both ZG and AQ20 as a prot pally on private servers with no problems. (probably not going to work in vanilla due to /sitting not being a thing but w/e.) There is a role for them in a guild it's just not going to be for the raid. I don't really have threat problems or Mana problems even when speed running strat live with AQ geared dps.
---
sure, run in there with some people, and punch people in the face.
---
Hahaha they could. Or do you make one side horde and the other alliance? This has to be thing already
---
Our guild had like 4 Paladins with Ashkandi during Vanilla.
---
This looks really cool.
---
Gotchya thanks did this from mobile
---
ZA timed bear runs were a thing at the end.
---
Who wants to play on the server with LTtrash? I know I do
---
Dude I love this idea, please do it, it would be amazing!
---
There are some bosses that it just isn't possible. Resist gear isn't available for non-warriors.
---
Also defensive cooldowns for some bosses are basically mandatory.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with the people who, in your theory, would get special privileges, and everything to do with the ENTIRE POPULATION OF WoW. The 0.00001% of players (Big name streamers) don't pay the millions of dollars in sub money. Maybe they help expose it, but the people who watch WoW streams already play the game. You have an experience here that is unlike anything before, and ruining it for your entire playerbase would be the ultimate fuck you.
---
I maybe could do horde and alliance side, but I do not have like grunts and footmen to fill as pawns.
---
Imagine thinking that having a streamer on your server is going to affect you in anywhere but the starting zones. Watch his streams, aside from times where he purposely gathers people, he’s alone or with like two other people. 
---
It’s not the apocalypse that sensitive people think it’s going to be.
---
Thats a bad thing you need to manage your threat
---
Decursive is too strong.  Bigwigs also makes fights too easy
---
!remind me 80 days
---
Yes, it would be very much against the spirit of Classic.
---
*being a crap team player
---
My favourite wep is Excaliboar. IDK why i just find that wep hilarously funny both as a reference and it's ingame model
---
Can't wait for Blizzard to reply to his request. "Fuck that"
---
The chess event! That's what I'm thinking about. Murlocks would work good as pawns lol.
---
This is fake. Twitch doesn’t separate the 2.
---
From what I can tell, rain looks a lot more intense than vanilla. Probably because it uses modern weather effects.  
---
You decide: [https://youtu.be/kDTeTdljf18?t=1597](https://youtu.be/kDTeTdljf18?t=1597)
---
Yeah couse thats the reason you're playing your tauren female for sure ;) quit the trash talk boy
---
Forgot: PLAY A DRUID.
---
My NZ/AUS guild is putting in quite a bit of effort on that front. The main oceanic guilds are all ready in communication to try and ensure we have a healthy split. Join the Classic WoW Oceania  discord server to be part of it!
---
I once got a bj while raiding ICC.  I held the raid up for at least 22 seconds
---
Lol the only thing i upgraded is the monitor. 3rd world problems
---
That episode is what got me to try out WoW
---
fuck you! but in a good way. test away my friend
---
Yea boohoo blizzard is making use of free promotion to get more attention to the game. Not only streamers got in
---
There MUST be a RP-pvp realm or no sub for me and my mates!
---
 You here me blizz?
---
That makes me feel less dumb so thank you lol
---
thats because of the better education system, EU WoW streamers are usually reasonable intelligent people.. not manchildren who think maga,pepe,pog,and twitch chat r cool memes. the real solution would be for me to immigrate and join a server there lmfao.
---
I remember in Legion to get the jellyfish secret mount I had to use a shrink effect (I'm pretty sure it was noggen fogger) on my tauren to squeeze into a small crevice under a boat...
---
Why is that? He likes rp?
---
That is a lot smaller then I thought. Which makes the painting more impressive. I wish they made larger ones.
---
Your right while children are forced to fight as child soldiers you should be upset that streamers play wow
---
Your life is hard
---
Lmao
---
I hit a nerve huh? :D
---
Nice. I hope you have a nice time with Classic.
---
Loloomkin* fixed that for you
---
I am not the original author. If you read the first paragraph you would know this.
---
move to the EU
---
thx for stating the obvious!
---
Boring for you I guess? But millions of people flocked to this game per year every year for 6 years. 
---
Myself and many others are here specifically for another shot at the second year of classic. But the crazy thing is,and a lot of people don’t know this, but you have to play the first year to get to the second.
---
Hi friend!
---
All these critical missing a simple joke. sigh
---
Pulling bosses through doors to avoid mechanics
---
He has adds that spawn inside the boss room only
---
As long as they roll Ally and hopefully PvP server that is going to make my pvp grind a lot easier.
---
All these critical missing a simple joke. 
---
"ACKSHUALLY....."
---
TIL Paladins used Photobucket.
---
NOT BITTER
---
Then what are you whining about
---
6. asscheeks clap into separate planes of existence when you run
---
1. make exclusive beta   
---
2. Give all streamers access   
---
3. Dont give the plebs access   
---
What could happen
---
All these critics missing a simple joke. 
---
"ACKSHUALLY.....THREAT MANAGEMENT... TEAM PLAYER..REEEE"
---
His armor equation: (X + (X \* 1.8) \* 1.10) + N, which comes out to 2.98X + N
---
should be:   (X + (X \* 1.8) )\* 1.10 + N, which can be simplified to 3.08X + N
---
With Dire Bear form it becomes 5.06X + N
---
Corrections for section 3, talking about stats at 60:
---
* 14 AP = 1 DPS
---
* 1 Agility (cat): 1 attack power, .05% crit and dodge, 2 armor
---
* 1 Agility (bear): .05% crit and dodge, 2 armor
---
The listed stat priorities don't make any sense since armor, dodge/hit/crit, and primary attributes are offered in different ratios.  It's more easily understood as weighted stat values, relative to each other.  The following are generalized and taken from taladril's extensive work on druids.
---
for DPS:
---
AP = 1
---
Agility = 2.1
---
Strength = 2.4
---
Hit = 15
---
Crit = 22
---
for Tanks:
---
Armor = 1
---
Agility = 2.9
---
Defense = 5.9
---
Stamina = 7.8
---
Dodge = 49.5
---
It doesn't affect me so I'm not that worried by it.
---
The only thing that concerns me is when they start complaining and people start getting banned because they can't accept that someone killed them.
---
can't you just click on 'not interested' a few times, that should shut up the recommendations
---
lol streamer crowds are going to bring people who spam racist shit. they have memes to avoid actuallly being banned but they're still a swarm of NEETs who never experience culture outside of 4chan,twitch,and online celebrity worship.
---
Rogues and Hunters
---
Mage Spriest Lock
---
Everything else*
---
*excluding druids, they can’t kill, nor can they be killed
---
Horde. Thank god horde has no "cutiepie" race in vanilla so all the edgylord idiots will be alliance with blonde humans and NE whores.
---
Wow I've just subscribed. Excellent content love it keep it up!
---
Back in early BC I was working on a program and addon that would communicate to a server to allow people to publicly broadcast where they were in the world to a web page, to encourage world pvp. It only saw any traction in my home server but it was pretty fun. 
---
If you tell people where you are, be prepared to be killed. You have literally no way to tell whether or not someone stream sniped you or is merely ganking and camping you. Trying to have them blacklisted among the entire server community is probably the most conceited thing someone could do, especially on a pvp server.
---
This sort of bullshit is why I'm staying the hell away from streamer servers. I don't have to worry about hurting their fragile ego and getting harassed by their fanbase.
---
It should. It does it for runescape
---
S*** I hope the numbers for classic viewers are just as low as battle for Azeroth. I want those people playing the damn game and pushing forward into the future expansions.
---
They are dealing with it by creating a blacklist, not by running to blizzard. If the blacklist will be effective remains to be seen though. People can avoid the server if they don't want to be blacklisted.
---
ESO as an example is not very accurate. Classic wow will take many new comers upwards of 16 days played to hit 60. 
---
I think people are greatly over estimating how many "followers" will be with these streamers let alone even get to end game just to follow some dude around like a puppy.
---
 At 1-30 sure 30-40 maybe but 40-60 there will be a steep steady decline of people being able to keep up in level with these guys or leveling period. Not to mention how bad they will be and plenty will quit before hitting 40.
---
A nerve? I could give two shits about you, you felt the need to reply to my first post, so something I said triggered you regardless. You’re just a sad little shit looking to get fed.
---
streamers chat is basically modern day mix of old Barrens chat, and COD box 360 lobby.
---
Isn't layering a QoL change anyway?
---
it was a joke. try not to think about it too hard
---
I get what you are saying. I do think burn out was a factor. I remember the outcry on the forums in 2006 during AQ days about the lack of content and empty patches. Back then millions of players joining WoW a year in, so they never reached AQ or Naxx. I am concerned players will burn out faster now, especially duw to the lack of content after BWL.
---
Ty for this! Im not much of a chad ganker, more of a zeta survivor when it comes to pvp. I never attack first and basically just like the thrill of pvp in general. Ty again for all the replies. I will definitely be playing Druid! Sounds exactly what I want for my expierence
---
didn't know shamans have blessings
---
I personally hate it, but I was watching Esfand's stream when it happened. I had to switch to someone else, I can't stand Soda. 
---
Someone made a joke that he was coked out and as a bartender, lol.
---
Which is like constantly when it takes 5+ minutes to run to your corpse, in addition to the res cooldown, plus eating a buffing. A rogue should have his cds up pretty much every time the person he is camping finally resses.
---
fund my immigration to IR or UK or something then. can I just like take my animals, my computer, and head over and get a flat within 2 months? I might actually do it.
---
He acts like that as a joke. Why do people find this so difficult to understand?
---
they and their fans are a cancer on the community, they are entitled, they get favouritism from blizz, etc, etc, etc. fuck 'em.
---
In classic you almost all your spells as baseline. The feral tank and feral dps builds are very similar. And with HotW, even as feral, you have a decently large intellect pool. 
---
There’s nothing impossible about this, especially in a 5-man. Your heals aren’t great but they can easily keep a tank alive for a minute or two. Your tanking may not be super great in dps gear but you can tank 1-2 mobs with very little or no healing easily. And your dps won’t be amazing but you can do more than enough for any 5-man content and probably still out dps people who don’t know what they’re doing.
---
And those specific players will have nightmares about J Allen Brack singing a song about you think you do but you don't.
---
It's up to each of us if we know what we are looking for from this game and what we want to accomplish in it. Pushing raiding content is perhaps 1% of 1% of what I am looking forward to in this game.
---
&gt;  is in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of people who will be playing the game  
---
You meant millions, right?
---
the great thing is that each individual can choose what QoL they want, no arguments are needed, everyone can choose how they want to play
---
Aaaaand just like that, druid's back on the map.
---
i put on my robe and wizards hat!
---
I feel like it removes a solution to griefing as well. If they want to host a duel competition like they did on the beta they can have guards from both factions in a contested zone on a PVP server. On a PVE server anyone can come and be the next trollgodx, even on a low level alt so your main doesn't get hate.
---
DaggerSpine?
---
Camping doesn’t give much honor.
---
&gt;This reminds me of a certain other faulty argument... "If she didn't want to get raped, why was she wearing provocative clothing
---
This might be the dumbest shit I've read all day.
---
I don't stream and I have beta.
---
I know that chance on hits won't proc as a cat, but would something like the equip bonus for the halberd of smiting work? And if it does work, is that better or worse than the Draconic Maul?
---
This!! Few players saw inside Naxx. With the steep learning/gear curve and the impending uselessness of drops it was just not utilized. That is why it made a return in Wrath. I am positive clearing Naxx in Classic will be a huge achievement that will keep people vested far longer than it originally did.
---
This was how I did it as well. I'd go to Duskwood on my lowbie Orc hunter and was about level with the Alliance there, then start taking them out. Skull level players would come and I'd escape. Repeat for endless delight.
---
Some people like it and some don’t. 
---
Who cares about whatever the streamers are doing, I’m more excited to play my childhood game again!
---
Their fans are a far worse effect on the community than they are themselves. That's on us, not the streamers. Stop being sycophants.
---
I think a big thing with cat form is that it does many small attacks, instead of few big attacks. So you need to be sitting there consistently on the person for a long time, in order to do your mediocre damage. You can't burst anybody. And if you're getting kited or something, your damage suffers immediately. Whereas e.g. with a warrior, he's being kited for 30 seconds, then he closes in with intercept and gets one big 2H swing and one mortal strike, then he's kited again ... but those two hits might be 2500 damage or something if one of them crits. With a druid it would be like 250 damage.
---
You sound like one o’ them LGBBQTBH+
---
Good video tho.
---
These kind of bugs will be fixed most likely.
---
There’s a difference between useless and suboptimal, and suboptimal is better than nothing. Plus, things like soaking damage in bear form or casting innervate on the healer really don’t require optimized gear. And if casting spells weakly saves you from the damage you’d take as a melee DPS, then ultimately you’re helping the group by saving the healer’s mana. 
---
But lastly, if these players are still in questing gear then it’s perfectly plausible that this Druid was wearing a combination of spell-focused and melee-focused gear.
---
Tried to play my share of modern mmos, think i have at least tried all of the bigger ones. Best was eso tjat kept my attention for a bit over a year or so.. so in early spring in 2018 i ran across some news that classic wow is actually happening. Wondered about it for a couple weeks and found a private server, thought why the hell not try it in the mean time. Just to see the ud starting zone again. 
---
Here i am, 1,5 years later, entered naxx for the first time last week.. first two weeks i played a bit now and then. Then i made some friends ingame, then i logged in more often to be with them.. and still here, waiting for classic and making friends while waiting.

What will happen?  Pretty much this: https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1475/34/1475349370739.png

To me, the "rewards" you're referencing are merely a stepping stone to increasing my strength so I can melt more faces. Cannibalizing the corpse of a player I just killed is my reward.
---
You go stare at a character window idling in a major city if that makes you happy while I'll rack up a body count as I go down fighting.
---
You do you, I'll do me.
---
I’ve seen Cdew play a couple of times over the past few days and man that guy just seems like such a douche. 
---
What’s with all of the toxicity coming out of these streamers? Raging at the slightest mishap, calling people retarded, etc. Just some real weak shit
---
Shame I wont see them since I'll be rolling Horde. Fortunately, I'll be on a PVP server.
---
Good for you :)   
---
99% of us do not
---
Post another one, we dont get it
---
They're gnomes, not bugs.
---
I had fun in PvP during Cata, but the game didn't feel as good. I played first 2 months of MoP and WoD and resubbed last 3 months of MoP ( Enjoyable asf) and last  month of WoD ( not enjoyable at all ).
---
I remember there being a successful pacifist level capped character or two. That method has to be up there in sheer rarity.
---
Wait, are incels "in touch"?
---
That is a really good idea, is that a thing you can do on twitch?
---
then you should re-roll alliance because soda is going horde with his shitty guild
---
For sure. But you want to just go explore with some new friends and experience the game? Go do some quests out in the world? These big streamers are going to have a hell of a time getting that stuff done without hundred of people following around
---
I believe the question is which CCs share DR. Eg: what abilities' DR does Succubus' Seduce trigger other than it's own
---
I am close to 40 and I have never watched any twitch channel for more than 10 seconds. I did watch some youtube clips from streamers, I can enjoy those if they put some effort in post production  so it's actually of a higher quality.  but since that actually takes effort, its more rare than raw twitch footage, which I consider unwatchable. 
---
I have the same problem with magic the gathering.  People used to make quality videos , but more and more they try to become a twitch hero
---
Damn you’re right. Sorry I’m Jewish so it’s in my nature to go right for the wallet. 
---
Do you want to buy some Stranglekelp? I’ll sell it to you cheap for 1g a stack. It’s so cheap bcoz Im gril and don’t know how to play da market.
---
That was an amazing story, it made me feel nostalgic even though I didn’t go through the same thing, I’m so glad we can go back to classic wow to bring back memories just like this
---
lol are you even trying now?
---
Yes they have to overtune the armor because they used faulty information to base their armor values, they based it on a single low armor boss in naxx. A lot of bosses are likely to have much MUCH more armor than on private servers.
---
This post is actually more interesting than a simple "gonna run classic and its old textures on my next gen potato" joke.
---
The real irony comes from the fact that "software" is named as such because it is "soft" and easy to change in contrast to "hardware" which is "hard" and supposedly built to last a while, yet it seems that here we kept the software but changed the hardware.
---
Well done OP.
---
Maybe it will when it’s out for real.
---
You underestimate how many people watch games during the initial launch hype. The first day will be massive, especially since a lot of people will be going for 24+ hour streams. BfA launch had 500k+ viewers.
---
its a meme within my circle of friends
---
it goes from maraudon to marurareraröradon and so on. fuck that name it took me 8 years to get it in my head and now its too much fun to butcher it
---
POST IT AGAIN
---
I mean don’t get me wrong. The idea of streamers complaining about stream snipers is silly imo. With there stream they get the increased visibility to put together and organize these large in game events that normal plays just don’t get to experience. So they should get the best and the worst of the visibility they receive.
---
you would need a job otherwise you wouldn't get  more than a tourist visum, that's only viable for like 3 months or so.  (assuming you are from outside the EU)
---
Wow should be a world pvp based game anyways not pve. It's built perfectly for it.
---
How fucking dumb must you be considering he's SUGGESTING HAVING A SEPARATE SERVER WITHOUT ADD-ONS FOR THOSE WHO WANT THAT. If that's being a fascist dictator you poor imbecile shouldn't have been brought up in this world.
---
Only once?  
---
I played Vanilla -&gt; WotLK with my girlfriend, so that was just how the weekends were spent lol
---
Some good ideas there.
---
&gt;I haven't figured out raid signups yet (although this thread has given me some great ideas - thanks), but we're planning to use Discord only for voice channels. If we can find something better for free, or near it, then we will.
---
For voice - Mumble is free and open source, you just need somewhere to host it.
---
For chat - IRC servers, or Slack.
---
I've seen snow
---
...
---
Just because a lot of streamers are doing 24+ hour streams doesn’t mean a lot of people are going to be watching. If anything that would lower the viewers since everyone is trying to stream a new game launch.
---
Yes but not until naxx has been out for a while.
---
"Please let me buy gold instead of have to farm it."
---
Female dwarf begs to differ. The twirling pigtails!
---
Mindlessly killing all enemies is pretty fun for a while, but its fun to stop and try and be freindly sometimes. It feels like you're communicating with an animal and it feels so wholesome when you guys leave each other alone, lots of people do this on a PvP server too. In fact I'd say more as the RP PvP servers are more into the war
---
Please do tell which streamer it was so I can be disappointed xD
---
I'm not saying they would, but merely replying to you that they could.
---
All Deez criticz
---
I have only seen rain so far, but I haven't spent much time in zones that can potentially snow.
---
Yes all players see the same weather.
---
If anything, the ret should have priority over the warrior, since a ret can't dw.
---
But nice try.
---
Ok will do
---
Damn i have a pretty decent job in the us... wonder if i can find work before release
---
PUBG took away voice chat for the minute prior to plane while people load in. The best times came from that single minute.
---
come on, you need some exceptions. For allaince the exceptions are tauren if they are nice and for horde it's dwarves
---
Guess you could make a case for it lol
---
Hi, /u/blahs44
---
My first instinct was to disregard this, but then I remembered no flight, lost exp at death, tons of ganking, and math.
---
Great job Op!
---
Eh, Mark Kern, the team lead for the freaking game. He said that bosses had thematic armor and resistance values, there was no two bosses alike. He specifically used KT and Garr as examples and it makes total sense for a caster boss having low armor and physical bosses to have loads and loads of armor.
---
Calling someone an imbecile and then finishing your post with a completely incoherent sentence tends to undermine your argument, imbecile. Additionally nobody said dictator you added that probably because you like dick is my guess. To sum it up go fuck yourself loser.
---
If it's only one camper, you rally the other lowbies of the zone and take them down. I remember doing this for Alliance who would come pick fights in the Barrens. They were like a mini-world boss!
---
The biggest thing for casters, especially during leveling, is mana.  You don't even really get Spell Power or +Healing until much later in the game.  So a druid in melee gear instead of caster gear will do similar healing, but they'll get 6 heals off instead of 20 before going OOM, and will take longer to recharge.
---
The nice thing about druids is that (compared with Shamans and Paladins) their melee abilities cost no mana.
---
Tank and melee gear is largely similar for druids.  STR, AGI, and STAM are all good for both cats and bears.  Agi is especially good for both, as it gives AP and Crit to cats, and Dodge to bears.
---
Casting Spells instantly cancels the Mind Control, I think. But if you use an instant spell the cancellation of the Mind control and the instant spell go off in the same batch, so the mind controlled person gets the renew/fort/whatever
---
Ok... at least you will leave me with Assmongold
---
sarcasm? or
---
i'm almost positive that site has information for a later patch. In 1.12 your pet gains nothing from your character, no stats or anything. That's why BM falls off at 60 because there is no scaling with gear.
---
Could be wrong though, its been years
---
Lied about playing vanilla. He started in Cata. Law enforcement takes these things very seriously.
---
It's not impossible in Classic because this story is from a blizz-like Classic P Server.
---
&gt; Is there any gear progression guide for oomkin out there?
---
Yes and no. 
---
Not much leather gear for you, and your tier set bonuses start to swing towards healing at tier 2 and then straight healing tier 3.
---
You'll mainly be fishing for a mixture of cloth and leather. You'll be competing against mages and warlocks for that cloth dps gear. The "best" gear will only be found in raids, and you're going to be hard pressed to convince a raid leader to let you roll, or have access to that gear. 
---
Mainly because your dps is going to be less than mages and warlock dps. You're a hybrid class so by default you will be doing not as much damage. 
---
As far as raiding goes, giving you that gear over the mages and warlocks will actually hurt dps for the raid as a whole. 
---
It's something I always found to be quite odd as far as class design goes in Vanilla. The argument is, "You're a hybrid and you can do anything, so you can't be good at everything." which is a load of bologna. 
---
It's much harder to switch between speccs in Classic than it is in any iteration of the game after MoP. Not only do you have to go to a trainer at a major city (typically), it's also not cheap to change specs. Each time you reset your talent points, the cost goes up. 
---
If you really want to be oomkin, that's perfectly fine. Just know that Vanilla was not really designed around that particular focus in mind. You're going to have to spend a lot of time and effort to obtain that gear and even then you may not have great results compared to other classes.
---
Hybrids were not much more than healing classes until TBC, where they got some love. They didn't start to really be good until Wrath and later.
---
"Pushing raiding content is perhaps 1% of 1% of what I am looking forward to in this game."
---
I think most agree with you. Then why did Blizzard make the game so raid focused the 2nd year with AQ/Naxx?
---
Where do you imagine they are getting such data? The number of healthy rppvp servers during vanilla, DESPITE them being boneheaded enough to hold off on them back then? The rppvp servers in current wow...oh thats right, they no longer exist. The poll of 18k+ people that you are apparently oblivious of that shows that vastly more want rppvp rather than rp? How about the existing megathread on the classic forum?
---
We are not here to convince you. I and it seems others couldn't give a rats ass if you personally have your mind changed or not.
---
Yes \s
---
yeah because cliccing through a clusterfuck of a raid to decurse needs so much skill
---
Remember that nobody will have gold to spare for quite a while. Maybe save things like cloth in a bank and sell later OR trade it for the materials you need.
---
Because he started out as a hugely successful YouTuber before he started streaming and whether you like it or not he is an entertaining streamer to a lot of people.
---
You still should edit that out.
---
Get an owl, make your tank hate you!
---
Is there a build where at 60 you can tank dungeons fine, and then go kitty for raids, or heal for raids, without a full respec?  (With different gear sets of course) I know druid isn't great at anything, but they can do everything which I why it appeals to me.
---
Thats funny, i've been watching cdew for the same period of time and hes my favorite classic streamer. To each their own I guess. To be fair he curses a lot and faux rages at his party members but he honestly seems like a pretty chill dude.
---
Lol yeah idk what that dude is talking about. Soda literally started his streaming career through R1 feral livestreaming
---
MMORPGs are by definition not seasonal. Keep that crap out of them, we don't want more inspiration from ARPGs
---
Don't try reasoning via good sense on this sub, people will think you want to be a special snowflake.
---
Upvoted for dingus. Such a great word
---
 I can’t be the only one that is going to wait a few days from launch and see what realm the streamers  choose to avoid them at all costs
---
&gt; ret pally.  
---
&gt; priority.  
---
Pick one.
---
You're right. Suboptimal is the correct term here. Useless is unnecessary harsh.
---
BT or bust
---
Because it's what they chose. Each of us know what we found fun the first time around and we know it may not necessarily be the same this time around. But just because a game says to me here, this is what we came up with for you to have fun, does not mean I am not free to go, well that's cool and all and maybe I will do it at some point but really I just like doing this other thing I made up with a bunch of my friends out here in this huge open world you gave us. Imagination or some s***.
---
Deleting your watch history helps too. But yeah, Not Interested is better.
---
i'm guessing so people pay for server transfers. like allied races are to sell race changes on retail.
---
He’s gonna play classic?
---
You only ever summon people who have a reason not already being there, everyone else is expected to show up on time.
---
You should tell that to the dudes on p servers that have spent 20+ hours a week for the past year slaughtering lowbies in redridge
---
Complaining your getting killed is one thing. Complaining about people cheating is another.
---
Yeah, I guess his faux rage is what put me off. I see that shit once and nope out. Haven’t found anyone else who seems mad chill yet - guess that’s just the persona streamers adopt in order to maintain relevancy
---
Wow this is my old guild hahah. Gotta love raiding with Chant the legend. I always enjoyed laughing at his nerd rages
---
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
---
I actually doubt it will, knowing what we know now. Only the ones actually going for r14 are gonna wanna farm the same bgs we've been doing for 15 years. I think people are gonna want to do the wpvp thing instead because it was wayyyyy more fun. And I think it will be again.
---
Going super saiyajin right as you enter the enemy's home base.
---
It depends on what you want to do. 
---
You'll be a decent healer. 
---
Feral is rather mediocre as far as damage output. 
---
The game does not really have much gear for Boomkin, and you'll be competing against warlocks and mages for their cloth gear.
---
Imagine playing a bottom of the barrel spec on purpose.
---
Proud to be a human being capable of understanding the difference between harmless humor and deliberate degrading of other humans, more like.
---
Contrary to that, stands your existence, as basically a thought-police-fanatic, who revels in telling others what is okay for them to think and say, thus imposing the same inhumane conditions that racists heaped upon minorities on ALL people, but not because they have a different skin color, but a different opinion than yours.
---
Honestly, I don't know which of the two groups (racists and pseudo-outraged SJWs) I despise more.
---
Do it!!!!!
---
People got to r11 before bgs. The trouble is rank decay at 12 and above. The bonus honor from bgs converts into enough rp to counter the decay and allow you to build rank points. 
---
It certainly is a flaw in the system, and was somewhat fixed in the honor system nerf in late Vanilla. I don’t think anyone argues R14 was a good system. RBGs, even in the state they are (or have been on live) would be better. 
---
That said, wpvp existed for as long as players still needed to go out in the world. Say I’m all geared up in t2 and have all my consumes, my epic mount and I’ve got 200-300g in the bank. Why do I need to leave my city, why do I need to log in but on raid nights? If not for bgs, these people weren’t logged in, yet because of bgs they were logged in 12 hours a day. 
---
Everyone, given time, gets to that endgame state of needing to only log in to raid or prepare for it. 
---
Wpvp thrived when everyone still had to go out in the world to do other things. Wpvp was a side effect of that. Very few people ever went out to just kill and tank and wpvp. 
---
Bgs were essential to wows success. Even before bgs “red is dead” was as common as “if I ignore him, maybe he will leave me alone”
---
WoW added expansions instead every 2 years which negated prior content. That is how Blizzard chose to keep WoW fresh. Do you really think players will stay on a stagnant Classic WoW server beyond Naxx or will they burnout when AQ releases.
---
it's all fun and games until your wedding/picnic/outing is interrupted by rouges.
---
Closest is 30/21 Heart of the Wild build.
---
Man i climbed this thing a few weeks ago on a freeshard and didnt notice ... its for the warrior quest or something
---
Yes!  Please!  This will self-select the bad PVPers out of the regular realms!
---
13th I though
---
Oh so because there are people starving to death somewhere in the world right now i shouldn't complain my neighbors don't have enough to eat? 
---
Galaxy level intellect you have there
---
The owl goes *reeeeee*
---
No one camps for the honor points.
---
A lot of people are going to be watching though. That's what happens during every single expansion launch. It won't be any different for Classic. Sodapoppin and Asmongold alone will combine for 100k+.
---
Sure. Just to keep the no add-on crowd away from me.
---
That’s already normal...
---
Of course asmongold is a shit, many of his viewers don't even like him, he constantly has to put his chat on subs only. His reputation has been going down the drain pretty quickly lately.
---
I fail to see how that justifies hate for literally hundreds of people.
---
&gt; he describes his thought process and I tend to agree with him
---
This. The whole point of streaming is letting the audience know what you are thinking. He does this very well, albeit as you said being a complete tool sometimes about it
---
Is it? Talk to me about Diablo 4.
---
&gt;  RPPVP attracts a healthy mix of all different types of players and is generally shielded from the toxic garbage that permeates other servers.
---
what server/faction where you on? mines was hell on azeroth.
---
But how much DPS does it do? If it dun increase muh parse, it dun belong on muh barse.
---
It's more akin to admiring an entertainer. Liking a streamer is no different from liking a standup comic or something like that. They entertain you so you consume their content.
---
No, we had addons as early as beta back in 2004 so no changes, no "fun servers".
---
I actually played almost exclusively as a Resto druid for flag running.
---
Pure flag running is best as a Resto druid because you are much harder to kill. 
---
I am playing druid again. This time around and will be playing feral only and running a 0/30/21 for PvP flag running but Resto will have more survivability and easier to gear.
---
Thank you for your contribution! Very informative, strong compelling argument to adequately explains why the server population will not decrease as streamers leave &lt;3
---
Careful asmongold may start banning you if you ask about it!
---
"Stop breaking the law asshole!"
---
That is what made Classic WoW special. However, what about the lack of content post BWL for many players? How do you keep players interested beyond AQ/Naxx raids?
---
Which zone? Dun Morough?
---
The paladins have prio on healing gear just like dps classes have prio on dps gear.
---
Seduce is a charm so other charms?
---
It would be pretty cool to play with someone like esfand.  Pretty chill dude and knows his stuff even though he plays a meme spec (plays it well).  Grouping with asmon off stream would probably be fine, but if its during the stream yea thats a hard pass lol.  You beat asmon on a roll or something during the stream and his 50k followers would probably berate you on end.  Again thats only during the stream (i'd assume).
---
Honestly my biggest gripe with playing with streamers would be that they pay like 5% attention to the game cause they have to read chat and do shoutouts constantly.  Which is to be expected since thats just money for them, but i've found myself easily pointing out misplays pretty often from most of them lol.

Yes. I will admit I laugh a lot when he says things like, “I will not fall here. I’m a literal god, the grea-,” and he falls to his death in Dark Souls.

MC has been downed on first lockout multiple times in priv servers so if there are enough ppl to dedicate for it it's a breeze. Attune and lvl 60 is no biggie. The only real folkpoint of this achivement is magmadar kill with an undergeared raid with 1 tranq shot.
---
Thank you fellow lefty.
---
What a idiot. LMFAO
---
Can’t believe these neckbeards still think it’s 2004. This isn’t vanilla wow, it’s not going to be the same. The internet as a whole has changed. Suck it up. 
---
The constant stream man bad posts is just giving them even more of a spotlight.
---
That's the thing though. Being world class has nothing to do with your success at achieving rank 14. It's literally just about who can grind bgs the most hours. Spending all that time doing wsg over and over and nothing else for months would absolutely kill viewership and that absolutely matters to someone whose main income is streaming.
---
you can't really say people have 15 years of experience for VANILLA when everything after TBC turned the game into something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
---
They have Vanilla and BC worth of experience... MAYBE wrath... But Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, and BFA do NOT count towards the experience they will be bringing with them to VANILLA content.
---
Period.
---
The weird thing. If I was a streamer I wouldn’t mind people sniping me, if anything it would make me forced to be better at PvP. I almost want to start a stream where I actively promote people to snipe me, almost seems fun.
---
Not to put any more strain on your already short attention span, but read the next line bucko.
---
I am 33 myself and you point out something very apt. When I was 16,  I played a lot of Counterstrike 1.5/1.6 with people my age now, usually returning military vets. Even though I was 16 and was probably annoying, they treated me great and so I try to do the same for those that are now in my shoes from that time.
---
I was always trying to be respectful to them and what not, so I hope those younger try to learn and do the same with classic.
---
Well, that's what blizzard kept trying to fine-tune and explore and change and address with every expansion. They tried to make things more accessible while still leaving the upper tier of difficult content for people who wanted it. Nobody can argue that for example battle for Azeroth has much more maximum level content available, and much of it available from moment you hit maximum level. More options for a solo player mindset. The game literally changed along with its player base and game players in general as their brains changed from years and years of playing games and mobile games and having a brains adapt to those effort reward systems.
---

You said "The only thing we know for sure is boss armor is generally much much higher than tge 3k KT had on private servers". I believe there will be thematic values. I dont believe they are on average higher than private servers or that you "know for sure".
---
so does this mean it's a separate game entirely that i'll need to shell out $60 for?  plus a sub, I wonder.
---
I know :(
---
They changed it with TBC and it's never been the same since. I really hope they return it to how it was for Classic.
---
My first toon was a NElf warrior which I played for a while before realizing that playing melee on my janky crt was starting to annoy me.
---
Went to pick a new class when I remembered the Dwarf Hunter from the cinematic. Never looked back.
---
This time around I'll be maining hoard, so Troll it is.
---
Yup. My group from back then is reforming.
---
You don't need prebis man, prebis are just the vanilla way of "bring twice as much GS for the raid as it needs".
---
If you have FULL prebis you won't touch that gear till BWL.

Everyones definition of fun is different.
---
From what I understand is that in PvP against clothies, a druid can open with Ravage + Shred, which can easily be over 2500 damage instantly in the opener if they both crit. Around 2000 if one crits.
---
Druids seem pretty fun to play as "Bleedy fucks" where you open in cat form with Pounce, 1 Rake + Rip, and then immediately swap to Caster, Moonfire + Swarm, then Swap to Bear. This kind of dynamic switching seems very fun!
---
Tell me, who is more racist:
---
* Someone for whom the primary attributes associated with the name "Mike Tyson" are "enraged, big, strong" (aka. OP)
---
* Or someone for whom the first, only, and primary attribute associated with that name is "black skin" (aka. you)
---
I didn't even remember that he is black, I had to google it after readong your post. Because to me, the color of his skin, is not an important attribute. It's not something I care about. To you however...well, I think your words so far speak for themselves.
---
So tell me, who's the actual racist...someone who doesn't seem to even see in terms of racial attributes, or someone who thinks they define human beings?
---
Every class will have its rotation. The complexity will come from your role in the raid / guild.
---
Classic is not mechanically difficult, its socially difficult. Wrangling 40 people into a cooperating raid is rough. Being a Guild leader is rough.
---
Regardless to answer your question: Shaman Tanks can go surprisingly far with surprisingly little if you tryhard it.

Bullshit. What they have is a majorly out of touch team lead with zero awareness of what anyone who isn’t just a tourist, wants. And a pudgy community manager who compulsively nodded and agreed with whatever Ion blurted out.
---
The vast majority via threads and polls pointed put they wanted early AV. Ion knows better?
---
RPPVP had strong support via polls and was taken to be a given for classic. Ion knows better?
---
Vast majority does not want CRBGs. Ion knows better?
---
Vast majority does not want DHKs. Ion knows better?
---
Ion is good at one thing: number crunching for running raids. He is clearly not qualified to lead creation/recreation of a game.
---
A very big part of it if you ask me.
---
Hahaha, he played as the warrior darmicoltwoo (sp?) in vanilla, legend has it the first darmicol was banned for toxic behavior, he also didn’t like being outed as that guy. Apparently even he learned to eat a slice (albeit a small one) of humble pie.  During the MC days my wife got yelled at for leaving the raid early even though she gave prior notice that she couldn’t stay for the full duration when invites went out (still stayed longer than she had initially agreed to). That was the final straw for me I told her to gquit after that got her a social invite to my guild and took her on a bwl alt run later that night, she got a drop from every boss and went from 0/8 to 5/8 netherwind in just that one run lol.
---
May I ask what character you played?
---
Yea in Dun. I don't have a ss I saw it on a stream can't remember which.
---
Ok good to know!  I wasn't expecting all 3 at the same time so that's fine.  I just like being flexible.  How easy is it to gear a bear, there enough +defense items around on leather?
---
&gt; Why is this? Is it simply because druids weren't meant to be great at dps or is there something about PvP that makes cat dps much worse than dpsing a dungeon or something?
---
Early WoW game design was pretty bad for most hybrid classes.
---
For example, you get cat form at level 20. You get Claw (Sinister Strike equivalent) and Rip (Rupture equivalent) as this level as well.
---
You do not get another combo point spending ability (Ferocious Bite - Eviscerate equivalent) until level 32.
---
So for 12 levels you have nothing to spend combo points on except Rip, which is a bleed dot that lasts 12 seconds.  
---
As far as game design goes, it doesn't really make sense to give you this kind of tool kit. It feels incomplete. 
---
Early WoW game philosophy for hybrids was, "Since you can do anything, you can't do everything really well. Except healing."
---
That was pretty much the design until Wrath.
---
im not hating on anyone but him and people being smug about beta access.
---
Some people have fun by being good at the game and taking it more seriously.
---
For thoose who are just wondering , Ragnaros would be far from the hardest thing in this type of run. Magmaddar with an undergeared raid and only 1 tranq shot will be the main factor wether they can down it or not in first lockout. And seeing  that it happened many times most likely you can expect it!
---
Lucky eu is best place on earth
---
They got it because people weren't 100% on the meta back then. No one's letting that happen in 2019.

&gt; the most comically insulting thing in the history of blizzard.
---
I dunno Diablo Immortal was pretty bad
---
Hunters are the kings of wPvP
---
Spriests are really good for the 1v1s that happen
---
Warlocks are pretty good cause burst damage
---
"It's funneh, because dps are supposed to do dps!"
---
nice try asmongold, we know its you.
---
You know since the beta started and i'm on retail, when on my priest or mage I have been buffing most people in sight (not a whole lot in sight :/) and its been very common for them to return the favor and we /cheer each other.  So few classes can do that on retail, whereas in classic most have something to give.  Its just fun to do and just makes you feel like an adventurer.

Most of the hybrid classes do really well at healing, and you're not really expected to do any of the other roles well. 
---
There's also not a lot of gear that supports you doing those other roles. Your tier 2 gear set starts to lean towards healing, while your tier 3 gear set is straight healing only.
---
Actually true, you can save 3 names at a later point. The date will be announced.

&gt;I would like to play main tank but I would like if I could play something that forces me to think while I play.
---
Classic is mechanically simple throughout the entirety of the PvE content.
---
If you want a mental challenge, roll a Mage or Warlock, and play PvP.
---
For pve, it depends on the fight completely. Tanks can have a lot of impact and generally lead raids. The mechanics of the fight are typically not insane but keeping your melee Bros in a good position can be a challenge until you're raid melds together. 
---
  That being said, if you have never played an mmo before, you probably shouldn't try to raid lead as literally thousands of people will have 10+ years of experience and will consider you a noob. 
---
For pve, again, depends on the situation. Although there was no arena in vanilla, the bgs all require different strategies. Every class has its role to fill. It would take too long to explain each, but mostly you get into a routine and stick to it.  For example, my guild was 50/50pve/pvp. I main healed the tank/GM in both events. In pve, it's basically spam flash of lights at different rank depending on damage taken, Mana and the raids status.  Although in pvp, it was pretty much, have blessing of freedom at the ready and never let my tank stop moving, occasionally throw heals. Normally people in pvp want to be cute and try to bypass the tank, hence the lack of requirement for healing as the first priority. 
---
It all just depends. 
---
At the end of the day, stay out of the fire for the love of baby Jesus.

Thats because people who dont get frustrated over mistakes generally also dont work to overcome them. Thus lots of "pro gamers" are "toxic" or people find it hard to find a chill one.
---
Rogues and warriors only bring dmg to the raid? No they can disarm, stun, pick locks, interrupt spells, shred armor,  disarm traps in supp room, taunt, kite, ranged pull and so much more that rets cannot. Rogues are needed for supp room and for kicks on many fights. Rets are not. In that sense, they kind of bring more utility than pallies right? Because their utility is actually needed.
---
Really sounds like you dont know much about the vanilla raids.
---
Naxx was 6 months before 2.0 pre patch, so it would be considered such a long time it would be a content drought for most of WoW - the issue wasn't that there wasn't enough time.  
---
The problem was 40 man raiding is just too niche. It's too much effort, burnout is too high, it's unsustainable. All the raiding guilds simply fell apart.  
---
There's a very good reason in 13 years of WoW post vanilla no one has ever seriously suggested they change back to 40 man raiding.
---
Streamers aren’t necessarily bad. It’s their shitty “reaction video” or mundane LOOKATTHISGUYS posts.

No I didn't. I said it was MY greatest vanilla achievement. I never said it was an achievement exclusive to vanilla. The possession was not to vanilla it was to myself therefore not making it a vanilla achievement but an achievement IN vanilla.

I thought about it but realistically I won't have time to gear and play alts and I'll have more fun playing one character levelling so I don't think I will.
---
I know a dwarf when I see one
---
edit: oh shi
---
Because you can SEE their misery, anger, and rage that you usually can't see when you gank a nobody that doesn't stream
---
I am humbled by that. This being in the annals of web history.
---
I am pretty decided on Gnome Warlock, with Tailoring and Engineering.
---
However, the Dwarf Priest with probably the same professions occasionally tempts me.
---
Some people do things simply because it's fun, not because there's a carrot on a stick. World PvP was fun for me and I engaged in it up until I rolled on a pure RP server.
---
Well good news for you they are still making diablo 4 for pc.
---
Good old Laggramar EU
---
Enjoy your sweaty bull, kid. Straight men who have hit puberty roll Orc, Human, or NElf females - the exceptions being minmaxers with a racial preference that doesn't conform to those three races (undead players), and people who play warlocks (they can conjure up some T&amp;A whenever the mood strikes).  
---
Then there's you and your 'weirdboys'; the RPers, stoners (trolls), furries (tauren), pedophiles (gnome), drunks (dwarves), edgelords (non-minmax'd undead), etc.  
---
There's nothing wrong with it, just don't pretend like we're the outliers, here.
---
This is just a concept by a fan
---
It's pretty entertaining. If you look at his sub count, it appears to be working.
---
I might not get into raiding so it would be a personal challenge to see what 5 mans I could "solo"
---
Bears get some defense but you aren’t going to cap at 440 like warriors. Some warriors don’t even go that high anymore. Bear strength centers around stacking stamina and the extremely high armor you gain from dire bear form. You will get crit/crushes against raid bosses - but that is offset by your overall damage reduction through armor and your ability to take those hits with a huge hp pool. Modern healers wearing actual BiS should not have trouble keeping you up. Dungeons are easily tankable by all 3 tanking classes. Bears are stronger than warrior tanks in pre-raid BiS.
---
Like why though
---
Imagine saying you "know something for sure" when you literally just made it up. Then get called out and call me a "kid" as your defense? Gpod chat.
---
Mark Kern, the team lead for World of Warcraft 14 years ago. I believe he has some insight into things like this. KT has been calculated to have 3k armor based on old clips, Mark Kern used KT as an example of a boss with very low armor because of him being a caster. KT is essentially wearing cloth where other bosses might be wearing plate, he used Garr as an example of a boss with loads and loads of armor.
---
Anybody know what that black and red sword is called?
---
This is how I feel as well. While in the "wild west" days, we essentially had unfettered rules, however that didn't mean people just used them. These days, I tend to find people are way more extreme because they feel constrained by cultural expectations.
---
There is an atmosphere of way more animosity now than I ever felt back during the late90s to early 2000s era.
---
Foolproof.
---
Being more genuine would ruin the effect, now wouldn't it.
---
You're going to get people getting very opinionated and defensive in here, but my vote would be healer for the hardest class to play well. All dps rotations are very easy, tanking is a bit trickier but ultimately once you have the rotation down and know where to stand there's not a whole lot to it. Healers are the ones that have to make decision every 5 seconds and where the good players will stand out.
---
Very nice. Any plans on making the colors changeable?
---
I remember playing the sc2 beta and just thinking it felt too balanced and homogenized
---
If you don't listen to reason and statements from the people who made the damn game then yes, you're a kid.
---
Nah I don’t think so, I just think he gets manipulated by his viewers and they’re toxic and he just follows
---
Holy wall of text, batman. It's not 'harmless humor' as any 'humor' that punches down always harms but it's clear there's zero point in trying to show you the truth of that. Grats on an entire warped worldview, I guess?
---
Not to be the guy who is always saying this but priv servers are not 100% accurate. This is known. And considering it was done on private servers before with little margin for error, even slight skews to the formula at every stage which is bound to happen. I think people are overestimating how certain this will be. Im not saying it wont happen, but I am willing to bet there will be a big wrench thrown in somewhere they werent expecting.
---
Can confirm... that's pretty much my setup, and I cant wait for Classic.
---
That was something they enabled in BC / Wrath to a degree, here is a bit of an explanation with Stuns: I'm trying to find the old info for DRs as it would be in Classic.
---
DRs affect their respective CC type (outside of stuns, they’re special).
---
Diminishing Returns reduce the effect of a same-type CC by 33/67/100% if it is done in a specific time window (15s). This means that a 3s CC would become 2s, 1s, and then the target would be immune to that type of CC until the time window is up.
---
It takes 15s for DRs to reset but addons tend to use 18s to take into account server lag/etc.
---
For example, Gouge/Sap are on the same DR. Fear isn’t on the same DR as Death Coil, as DC is a “terrify” effect while Fear is a “Fear” effect.
---
For stuns, there are 3 types that each have their own DR windows:
---
Controlled stuns (Cheap Shot, Charge, Concussion Blow)
---
Proc stuns (Blackout, Mace Spec)
---
Kidney Shot
---
This means that Cheap Shot won’t reduce the duration of a mace spec proc/Kidney Shot since they don’t share DR types.
---
He actually looks like he's smiling with that eye in the lower middle. Guess he's looking forward to killing my Warlock again.
---
I 100% guarantee a bunch of idiots do that with or without the addon.
---
Cat is for fite. Bare is for tank.
---
Thunderfury
---
Yes. But he didnt say that the average boss in, say MC, had more armor than KT did he? So saying that the average boss will have much more armor is reaching. Its not even close to something that you "know for sure".
---
One less streamer to be spammed all over the front page.
---
Lol thanks for the answer mechanically I kind of figured there’s not much you can do with a game about pressing buttons for abilities but main tank sounds fun just to be able to protect everyone else by keeping Aggro on me I just kind of wanted to make sure it wasn’t something of “stand in front and spam the ability that reduces damage while the priest heals you”
---
Essentially the only good raiding ranged weapons in the game are  
---
[MC Class Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers)  
---
[BWL Chromag X Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19361/ashjrethul-crossbow-of-smiting)  
---
[Naxx KT X Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22812/nerubian-slavemaker)
---
How would that be regulated? How could they ever hope to police this?
---
Most streamers from what i've seen (including soda) are pretty ok with getting ganked once or twice.  Thats part of being on a pvp server.  But if you stream for 10 hours and your camped for 10 hours, that's what they have an issue with.  Honestly camping anyone for over an hour even its pvp server should be bannable imo.  So if soda is off stream and camping someone cause he's just being a butt, then he should be banned as well (nothing perma).  Getting ganked is part of pvp servers.  Getting camped for hours on end is disruption of a game service, IMO.
---
Now of course there is a possiblity that getting ganked twice and the streamer is in a bad mood and they blacklist them, that would be abuse for sure.  I dont know if there will be a review of the stream or whatever.  But I understand both sides of the argument.  
---
Sonii has been accused of stream sniping and all he did was a have a rogue stealthed 30 yards for them for like an hour.  Thats called intel.
---
I listened. You just added all this extra meaning to his statement and claimed that it was fact.
---
&gt;nearly breaking my arm
---
Quality content.  Gotta get that gear anyway possible
---
That was awesome!
---
I run 2 monitors, 2 resolutions and 2 refresh rates in the Classic client. It's just the BFA client.
---
No issues.
---
So the phase structure means that you'll have different BiS over the life of the several phases. 
---
Pre-raid is dwarven hand cannon or any of the nice slow crossbows. I've seen arguments for Ancient Bone Bow on Trolls, but once you hit the hitcap the benefit is meh.
---
Next is Rhok'delar from the quest drop in MC. Demons are a pain, so look up the mechanics first and don't get interrupted by lowbies.
---
BWL brings out Ashjre'thul which will be hotly contested by hunters; so save DKP
---
This is neat.
---
Does anyone think that the streamers will actually fan out? Or do you think that big streamers will actually not follow Soda/Asmond? 
---
I feel like once they make their big decision, we should have an easy time avoiding those 1-3 servers ya know?
---
Now that i say it. I woudnt even bother if they did the same on love. However thats near to impossible
---
Currently playing in a private server for fun and playing on a 37 inch ultra-wide is just pure heavenly. So much real estate and easy to avoid mobs when you're zoomed all the way out.
---
Why do you think this? 
---
I only ask because streamers are probably not going to be something that will "go away" if you ignore it. 
---
Mainly because I can see a lot of streamers joining guilds or creating guilds for players to join when Classic launchers.
---
They'll probably get a lot of people to join those guilds. One thing that they have going for them is organizing things and some might even manage a little "army" for themselves. 
---
So they'll be able to camp areas, or start streamer vs streamer wars. 
---
It's going to happen. It may not be "wide spread" but it's going to happen. 
---
Penny-Arcade did something along [these lines](https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/06/the-best-of-wow-insider-april-29-may-6-2008/) in 2008. That was way before streamer personalities.
---
Yaaaaaaasssssss!
---
So awesome dude.
---
They can do stream delays. Very common for fortnite and apex tourneys. Usually 2 min delay. I thought they should do this too but it ruins their ability to interact with the viewers. I doubt I'd watch someone who always has a delay up
---
It's imperfect information, but it's something
---
If you don't like add-ons, don't use them. I'll be over here making a minimalist and attractive UI to enhance my visual experience while playing.
---
I also considered healer a lot and I like to think I kind of know how to pick and choose what targets to heal I played Ana up to masters in Overwatch if that kind of translates over ie knowing who to heal and balance timers on abilities
---
Looking forward to using this, I can't stand these entitled manbabies like Asmongold and Sodapoppin. Thanks!
---
Unfortunately they haven't shared any news about this type of issue with layering, yet. I'm wondering the same as you, because chances are Classic will retain more players than they anticipate, and what then? Collapse the layers and face massive queues? 
---
It's already a huge gamble to put a modern solution like layering into an old game as delicately designed as Vanilla WoW in the first place, where so much of it's success depends on all the ways the community is being encouraged to establish itself by the game design. 
---
Layering is based off methods used for the modern games purposes, but in Vanilla it seems to be really out of place, because it affects it's most important value: The community, and the way it will behave and gets to know eachother (or rather, won't, because there's too many people, and you'll see someone different each play session if there are multiple layers active).
---
Usually, tech like this stays in the background, where it does it's work. This time, it's actively redistributing players within the game itself, even showing it exists, affecting the experience negatively. Players can even actively influence when they wish to change layers through group invites, or try their luck by logging out and in. Again, a change in the games design. 
---
And the initial weeks and months of the game are just as important to keep authentic as the rest of the game is.
---
The magic of WoW can be gone in just a moment, when the player gets a look behind the curtain, and sees the machinery at work. I'm certain at this point it's going to happen, and people will not appreciate it to say the least. But right now everyone is so hyped, that speaking of issues like this is considered herecy.
---
I have a bad feeling where we'll go from here like this. Although very dramatized, this quote comes to mind: the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I hope Blizzard will see in time they strayed off their own path since the announcement of Classic at Blizzcon, and what they were set out to do with the game from the beginning.
---
It wasn’t about time, it was that it was very difficult end-game content set to be over shadowed a few months after its release. Just not worth the time.
---
Please blizzard, there's little reason not to, and many reasons why.  When I make a horde alt sometime after launch, I'm wanting to do it on an RPPVP server, seems like so much fun.
---
MCP affects your attack speed in form, this is why it's so great
---
That would be funnier if you actually picked 4 streamers that all play  the same faction.
---
Whaaaat. Dang it really has been a while since I played. Technically I am remembering off of a character I played in TBC, but thought it was the same. I guess Blizz changed it for balance reasons (it is kind of cheesy for a lvl 5 alt with lvl 1 Enchanting to de epics imo).
---
I am not a Fan of Multiboxing. I know its not a bannable offence but i just find it a SUPER cheap way of doing things. 
---
Only reason i would even think about it is so i can level an Alt with my main. Although i watched Swifty try this and it just seems like way to much hastle for the payoff of having a extra Alt or 2
---
Jesus Christ man, it's just a video game.  Get some self-control.
---
I think it will come down how bad they want Scarab Lord and if a larger streamer wants the realm to be 'theirs' by being the biggest streamer on it.
---
Holy shit guys lol
---
Iirc this exact thing was doable in vanilla and was fixed.
---
Your point still doesn't make sense.
---
My master plan is to drop doomguards on starting towns 4 hours a night
---
I know I’m right. This sub hardly understands streamers or twitch. This game is massive, actually thinking a streamer and their fans can take over a server is absolutely ludicrous and ignorant at best.
---
You can however shift out, pop pot and shift back within moments.
---
I’m hoping when Classic is a massive success that the retail team will do a 180 on a bunch of their policies and game philosophies for the next expac and make retail fun
---
Really glad you enjoyed it so much! But holy crap your username made me laugh, especially when attached to such a lovely message :)
---
Scarab Lord is a big factor, they also have to sacrifice "content" they will lose by not being on the same server as the top streamers.
---
Haha. You must be a fucking retard really. Gl kid
---
You are correct, Blizz deliberately prevents addons from displaying that kind of information. But despite this being true for most of WoW history, that won't stop the haters from accepting it as true
---
I doubt they'd allow paid character transfers to a fresh realm. I'm not even sure we'll have character transfers in general in Classic. Forgot if that's been addressed yet.
---
The hero we needed...
---
Madseason is a really nice guy ye, u should give a shot to Frostadamus too. Really chill dude and content creator. Love his wow economic videos
---
Those guys were free HKs.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Soda said he would give up streaming for 3 months in order to enjoy classic. He won't be going for rank 14 anyways because he doesn't need the gear. I would bet on streamers getting rank 14 first.
---
Using datatables? Nice. I will be using this to avoid them like the plague
---
Ok gotcha.  I knew bears could be crushed/crit but it isn't just a 1 shot?  I guess if you get unlucky with back to back crushing blows you a goner but thats expected.  Wasn't planning on raid tanking really because I remember getting crushed on my pally tank in BC ( i was like 2 or 3% off) and yea wasn't fun lol.  Thanks for the info my dude!
---
"PVP servers are not a safe place."
---
I feel like thats a good guild name. For a pvp guild.
---
Nobody cares what you think.
---
So shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down.
---
Yet you listen to the streamer. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
Blizzard should ban streamers from the main server. Let them have their own server.
---
Haha aye. Someone randomly said it too me and I couldn't stop laughing for ages so I stole it.  Currently going through the whole scorecraft playlist it's awesome so far! Makes you realise how much the music plays a part of the experience when you hear it after so long.
---
Professions gave NO exp in vanilla.
---
What about pet bombs? :)
---
Can you create another one so we know which servers will be infested with private server players so we can avoid those too?
---
Had to laugh at your typo, yes leading a guild actually does come down to a 20-30hour workday (I know you meant real life workWEEK)
---
I'm not but my married friends are planning on playing and the husband plans on multiboxing them both when the wife wants a break.
---
She didn't get into gaming until she got pregnant so she has pathetic, weak dedication.
---
Yes!!!
---
You do realize you're getting upset about people complaining about streamers, right? Now there's a 1st world problem if I've ever seen one.
---
Lets try to be adults about this..
---
This is really well done!
---
Only 800k
---
Get to 60 in under 100 hours so we can kill Rag before the first reset.
---
Skinning only. Not going to step foot in the Auction House or Bank. Will vendor everything for necessary skills and level 40 mount and mail an alt all the rest.
---
I’ve done so many 1 to 20, 20 to 30, and 30 to 40 runs in the last month that I literally dream about my routes. Currently working on my 4th 40 to 50 time trial.
---
Access to WoW classic is included in and available to all players with an active World of Warcraft subscription. No additional purchase is required.
---
How dense are you? 
---
Most people in vanilla clicked their fucking abilities and keyboard turned. Myself included. 
---
Now ppl like me have 35+ keybindings, have 15 years worth of experience with them and don’t keyboard turn anymore.
---
By your logic, someone who started in 2010 during wotlk, played the game for 9 strait years, would be going into vanilla with the same experience as someone who has never played an mmo before.
---
Your just DENSE and STUPID. PERIOD. I really hope your not as fucking retarded in real life as u are in this thread
---
The ranged weapon will be the same like people said, rok -&gt; chrom -&gt; naxx xbow.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
I'm definitely a fan of the name ;) my gf is too!
---
And yeah it's been totally fascinating to explore for me too! Really fun to see people's reactions when I share what I've discovered!
---
I'm heavily debating between playing a Druid or Hunter on classic. I've mained a Druid since TBC (mained warrior in Vanilla) and have always maintained a Hunter alt. Some things:
---
* I like being effective on my own; I don't want to feel like I HAVE to group to get things done.
---
* I really like running dungeons and leading dungeons.
---
* I enjoy healing and tanking, but not enough to do them all the time; I want to be effective on my own.
---
* One of my favorite archetypes in games is "Offensive Support" - I've been playing a Hunter with a wolf pet on private servers and really enjoy taunting off/kiting mobs that get split from the group, buffing allies with Howl, etc.
---
* I like "spinning plates" playstyles; managing multiple dots, tracking a bunch of separate cooldowns, managing a pet, etc. Specs that are more around optimization of uptime are more fun to me than managing procs.
---
* I love optimizing things. When I play a class, I go super, super fucking deep to try and play it the best I possibly can. I love this shit.
---
* I love World PvP and plan on engaging in it frequently, both in 1 on 1 and group scenarios.
---
* I'm interested in raiding, but am not interested in optimizing for raiding; I'll be playing fairly frequently but don't aim to get into major progression guilds, I'm happy to get gear a bit behind the curve with a more chill guild.
---
* I'll be playing Horde.
---
Does anyone have any thoughts or advice here in how these line up with the vanilla experience for these two classes?
---
Thank you, I downloaded WoW Model Viewer and BfA for the sole purpose of making that.
---
Dude this looks amazing, I can’t watch the whole thing right now but I plan on rolling a Paladin for Classic. 
---
I’m definitely watching this tonight before bed. The script seems really well done as well.
---
Well go ahead and bet as much as you want. Time will tell, but I think you will see for yourself in time. I'd also be extremely surprised if soda actually stopped streaming for 3 months, just sounds like another one of his empty promises.
---
nice astroturfing kid
---
I’ve had some shammy tanks in my time as horde. Was skeptical at first but it’s quite impressive.
---
We called him sea-tune in the worst part of the canada
---
Hunters and feral druids.
---
Both has humanoid tracking meaning they will be the ones picking their fights and both have infinite space to kite.
---
2nd tier rogues but they need ALL their cooldowns so if some1 joins in the fight they are kind of screwed.
---
Rest are same basically -except-
---
Lowest tier: warrior. Unless you specifically talent/gear/prof for it you'll be a food for almost every class. Also as a warrior most likely u'll get jumped on as they have hard time initiating fights.
---
I'm always confused what people mean by world pvp. Are you talking about 1 on 1 engagements?
---
Right click reporting is a disaster. If the person didn't offend you enough to tab out. Then clearly he didn't bother you that much.
---
So as soon as your auto attack hit, you attack with i.e sinistre strike then wait the next cycle I guess ? 
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
Yeh but you can't take you PC or Xbox with you
---
My plan is simple, if it is red it must be made dead.  No exceptions.
---
"The cow people are so cute, I'm going to roll one of those! Hmm, this Druid gets to change forms and has nature based magic. That sounds cool!"  
---
Mistakes were made.
---
They literally already have thematic values on private servers that are much higher than 3k.

You think you KNOW that the armor is going to be on average  much higher than that based on Mark Kern's statement about Garr having high armor? Really?
---
Green latency? I see you weren't poor
---
WeakAuras doesn’t tell you what to do when, it displays textures based on triggers related to your character state (i.e. buffs, debuffs, enemy debuffs, etc). 
---
Vanilla was the pinnacle of “play the for you” addons. No expansion since has had such scripted actions available. RIP Decursive.
---
not much incentive for it
---
Salesman of the year award for you good sir!
---
*its
---
Guys I'm set on Druid, but I cannot decide between Tauren or Night Elf. What do you guys think? 
---
I like both sets of models. Both sets of cities and zones are good IMO. Both sets of racials are good in their own ways.
---
So far from the datas gathered and made public throughout the classic beta test as it stands now classic beta will be *easier* than priv servers .  Yes. EASIER. So if they could do it on priv servers chances are they can do it withouth a hunch in classic too :P
---
&gt; The mobile market is not competing with the core of the PC market
---
Tell that to Diablo immortal. They are trying too, but I doubt they will succeed
---
I played a druid main at Vanilla launch ... I'm realizing that 1.12 druid and launch druid are like night and day.
---
So I have to ask ... can 1.12 druids shift out of frost shock?
---
Oh gawd.... lol
---
The only thing I’d argue for is Hunters. Melee and auto shot weaving is not an “easy rotation” it’s an art. After that definitely healers.
---
Unfortunately, we won't have RP PvP.
---
All I could figure out is that the Naga NPC is a leftover from a never developed expansion, but to add something to the post, I think the Ashbringer trigger event was server-sided.
---
What's wrong with private server players?
---
That works for me, I do a bit of dps in retail but mostly because it doesn't really matter if you overheal and with the crazy amount of HoTs I have, I'll usually get bored if I just heal. So I'm definitely looking forward to learning how to heal in a game where it's not mostly mindless.
---
Creepy, looks like em
---
He stopped streaming for a month to play on Nost. He has done it before. He very bluntly said if had to choose between classic and his stream he would choose classic.
---
It would probably be better for the longterm health of Classic, just an example of a gate that really ended up helping a server was Nost when they forgot to put Aquals in the game making it so nobody could clear MC for the first month. 
---
But yeah they won't do it, there would be way too much complaining about the gates.
---
tbh i dont think liriks community would be a problem, lirik is pretty chill and doesnt draw in the same crowd as people like asmon or soda
---
People on this sub would screech at TB if they knew his stance on stream sniping.
---
That’s the character he’s playing. It’s intentional, all big streamers play it up for the stream.
---
IDk how warlocks are strong wpvp class. If enemy has fear immunity (hello alliance locks) You are screwed. For pveing u have void out which is kind of garbae. Also while lvling you don't really have all your spells due to money shortage. They have no  humanoid tracking. Most of your dmg are dots meaning even if you actually kill the enemy they have a chance to kill you first to make it a 1-1. Due to only having shadow and fire spells spell counters hits them hard.
---
The water actually only requires one person and some warlocks strategically positioned for summons.
---
With all this talk about avoiding pserver players how about we avoid dad gamers.
---
Aren't private server players likely to make up at least half of long term classic wow players?
---
Soda just bitches and complains when he doesn’t get his way.
---
[relevant](https://i.imgur.com/oUtUv_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
What in the actual fuck... This is almost exactly what I've been planning.... In my head.
---
go resub to soda lmao
---
Can't post but you can look at armor values from p servers easily w google. KT  : 3795 armor, Loatheb 5491 armor, Garr 4691 armor. Just a few.
---
You think you KNOW that the armor is going to be on average much higher than that based on Mark Kern's statement about Garr having high armor? Really?
---
Not until patch 2.0.1
---
Agreed, you basically always want to level as Ret and then respec once you start getting gear.
---
Did you see that on a Reddit post that mentions ClassiCast? Did you manage to find the time when they speak about it? (it's a 3h cast)
---
I think it's hilarious Preach isnt on this list. The one fucking streamer I think noone has an issue with.
---
Will be curious if people will achieve Rag before first reset. You still have to add few super boring hours of raid farming hydraxian waterlords rep in like silithus. Maybe onyxia ? :)
---
He's still going to be ganked regardless of streaming at this point, his outbursts have upset too many people.
---
agreed, this is getting cringy in my opinion
---
I don't think it's common but sounds like a pretty decent strategy to me, as long as you have time to cast.
---
we are classic players, we are legion, we are many.
---
You're both right! \O/
---
Thats true in some ways and not in others. Plus  data based on BIS level 30s doing things is fairly useless for general mob difficulty. As many streamers noticed, mobs have abilities they didnt on pservers. And as the devs noted there were bosses with very different resists than people thought. We havent seen raid boss data for parry, resist etc. And Blizz can always tweak global numbers from the beta. Like I said, I am not saying they CANT do it. Im just saying there are lots of unknowns at this point.
---
Because you can't kite adds too far from Garr, and because hunters provide much needed ranged dps for the adds when they're being killed as melee can't stay in. It's a much simpler and easier strategy to just banish half the adds and tank and kill them all one by one before focusing Garr.
---
Halo Remastered let you toggle new and old graphics. I would like that. I prefer the old art because I hate the new models. If we can only have one then I'm against a graphics upgrade because I love that you can run classic on a potato. It means no one gets left behind.
---
Kind of, though they did concede to making layering temporary. And it's not like \#nochanges weren't opposed to layering either
---
Dwarf mage. A man ahead of his time.
---
Find it ingame otherwise how would you even know what the guild culture is like?
---
&gt; when they do something he doesn't like
---
Interesting way to say he threatened a hacker who was threatening him...
---
No problem - no you shouldn't get one shot if your healers are doing their jobs. Basically the difference is in vanilla my healers were wearing devout instead of gear with +healing on it, and they had 5 fps in raids, and people randomly disconnected all the time because internet was poor. Back then tanks needed every scrap of survival to get by.
---
The meta today is based on the fact healers will have 60 fps in raids, with steady internet and they will be wearing the correct hear. A damage spike is not the end of the world in that situation, because healers can respond.
---
Im really on the fence still, in one hand the only female char ive been able to max was my dranei dk, every other time i tried to play female i lost interest, on the other, im also very picky on the race\class combos and undead female priest is what i feel is right, so i dont know what to do yet, good thing thats my alt only, my main is set in stone as undead  male warrior. 
---
Ps sorry i went longer than expected
---
About your title, I don't think it's ironic at all.
---
It's about choice. You can't opt out of Bliz changes.
---
Every stream asmon is either alone or with a group he’s going to do a dungeon with. Not sure why people keep thinking they’re just going to be some roaming fucking horde of people following him everywhere.
---
I believe it. There's probably a full 40 of people who had it on farm getting ready to poopsock it.
---
Only if you make up stats.
---
Bro thats the computer equivalent of a potato.
---
I do agree with what you say but they are far from the best, it's their followers and bad attitude that destroy servers.
---
You still need to match the item's Level.
---
Artorius was the demon you'd jump shot and serpent sting while kiting it all the way across Winterspring. Really fun and intense fight!
---
Sounds insufferable
---
He will and with that he's gonna get more viewers, more engangement, and ultimately more money.
---
You wanna hurt the streamer? Just continue not acknowledging their existence.
---
All of these things are situational and even then a warlock that knows what they are doing can shit on most classes
---
Are you a streamer?
---
(Attempt at meta-meming please don’t downvote me)
---
"Also, if this post offends you, fuck yourself." while being offended by post. Lol
---
Sunwell was far harder than Naxx, like many many times harder. It came out about the same amount of time before WotlK prepatch as Naxx did before TBC prepatch.  
---
And yet far more guilds stayed together to finish Sunwell and to go on and raid together for Wrath. You had the exact same situation with gear becoming obsolete in the upcoming expansion. The same time frame.
---
Void is probably the best wpvp demon. The sac shield is an insane amount of damage mitigation.
---
Thank you
---
Its a shame that with things like addons
---
People that are philosophically against them
---
Are forced to use them
---
Just to stay competitive :/
---
He might be relevant to the IRS.
---
Hmmm, maybe it wasn’t until BC that I did it then. It’s been a while since classic.
---
why are there so many dumb fucks who think there were no addons in vanilla and using addons is bad?
---
Private server players are the reason Classic WoW exists.
---
Nope, not a 1 shot. Bears can tank bosses in Naxx as well, they cannot and should not be the MT on every fight. But that can be the MT on several fights. I HIGHLY recommend this guide: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
It explains the math behund Druids, then goes fight by fight in each raid from MC to Naxx on what a feral tank Druid should do. Some fights they can MT, some fights they Should be the MT, some fights they should Never tank, some figths they should DPS, some fights they should heal/decurse/cleanse as best as they can. Druids truly bring a lot of flex to a raid
---
Yeah I'm fairly stoked, too bad about that canceled Starcraft FPS though, I think Starcraft lore/world is 100x more interesting than Diablo
---
So you're agreeing with OP, saying it's silly that people oppose changes like customizable UI because \#nochanges... even though it would make a better game if we didn't have to go 3rd party to get it?
---
Having played a lot of Priest in the vanilla era, I don't recall picking and choosing being much of the challenge. Basically its being able to stare at a health bar for 4 hours without a lapse in concentration. The DPS classes can be better or worse, do this rotation or that, and it doesn't directly affect the fight (except when it goes too long and resources run low), but if the MT or a tank healer screws up, everyone knows.
---
Can you viably heal 5 man's in full feral while leveling (presumably with some caster gear on hand)?
---
Honestly you're just going to look like an idiot trying to weave in and out for melee attacks to increase your dps by 5% so you can go from 17th place to 16th.
---
Has no arguments so makes a new post complaining about private servers.
---
Kid.
---
Pserver players are likely to be the elitists for classic. Nobody really wants to play with people who demand cookie cutter builds and min/maxing racials.
---
&gt; he understands and wants me to join his guild
---
oh shit man my office keyboard is ruined lol
---
Not exactly a 1:1 comparison there with professional sports.
---
If we were talking esports, sure.  Even speed runs.
---
This is the equivalent of people going to watch people play beer league softball.
---
Yeah op. Youre welcome
---
I wouldn’t play if it were seasonal. I hate hate hate hate playing a game knowing my progress will be deleted at a certain point.
---
This is the internet, why proofread for autocorrect when others will do it fir me :)?
---
2019 potato &gt; 2004-2006 potato.
---
You could always buy VR.
---
This is correct.
---
If you're there to heal, you won't be able to spend the GCDs or the resources, except maybe at the very beginning or end of a fight.
---
You're just SALTY. PERIOD.
---
Just look at the salt OOZING from your comment LOL.
---
Nah, I stand by what I said. And I didn't start clicking, cause I'm not trash like you! =)
---
K. What does that have to do with me? He is the streamer. He is entitled to say whatever he wants on his stream. If you feel so strongly then gank him. I don't know why people make such a big deal about streamers.
---
Well done. Thank you.
---
I think he is trying to meme that streamers want to blacklist snipers.
---
I stopped drinking soda a good while back.
---
I'd certainly hope you'd be fucked if you were married
---
He's just some guys dad in the corner of a pub sipping his Newcastle Brown and ranting about wow.
---
I'd drink with him.
---
This is great
---
Very much depends on the gear of the group. Tanks with decent gear alongside dps that shred will make it typically very boring at times. However instead of giving you time to dps and fish for procs, they’ll just pull more/faster.
---
Played through TBC on an EU rp-pvp server. Had a fantastic community but it was quite a small population. RP-PVP servers often seem to have quite a balanced horde Vs alliance population as well so world PvP was quite active, especially with some guilds very active with cross communication and holding alliance Vs. Horde RP events.
---
I did it since day 1 of vanilla with 5 accts. You would have to set up one button for single targets, 1 to 2 for heals, follow, assist, aoe spells, etc. Lots to think about.
---
Actually our plan for the majority of the rep is to clear MC trash and let the instance reset. You still have to kill 30 elementals in Silithus and 12 in EPL, but we’re hoping for as many BoE epics as we can find as most of us are still going to be using quest blues and greens. The only exception to this is the MT and anyone lucky enough to get into his farm runs. He’ll be 60 3 days before reset.
---
It’s an effort of about 100 people. We have one guy who just wants to get to level 25 and farm the mats for Fire Protection Potions. And we’ll have instant-request summons around the globe, never having to take a zeppelin or boat.
---
You're the one who breached the topic. He can say whatever he wants bit that doesn't mean he doesn't have to deal with the consequences. This conversation was never about you, so it doesn't need to have anything to do with you.
---
Exactly this. I don't think you'll find much free time when healing because trying to conserve mana you'll have to spam lower rank healing waves constantly on the tank. If the tank pops CDs or you overgear the content I'm sure this will happen too.
---
Remember: healing in wow classic is all about downranking your healing spells and your mana conservation.
---
How do we avoid those cancerous retail players who enjoy another game, ugh!
---
As I said before keep it up. I've shared it with a few friends already and I'm sure they will appreciate the work gone into it. Glad you enjoyed Aberdeen I'm sure you were welcomed warmly by us Scots!
---
It's youtube. Other people clip him reacting to things and since he reacts to a wide variety of things. It puts him in a bunch of youtube categories that he wouldn't be in if he just played wow. Then the way the youtube algorithm works. I that once he wriggles in there boom every time you try to watch a video. The next video qued up to play will be Asmogold. Then after that it's just comes down to exposure.
---
"If you are a streamer and this page is an error, click here! we have a back door for you!"
---
On average end game dungeon will stress you to a point of using lesser healing wave a lot. Also chain Lightning will ass pull just because it can. Early on while leveling as enhancement with a shield you can co-dps/co-tank early instances even as a healer (if the group has good levels for the instance).
---
Well yeah, some streamers attract 50 spergs following them around, and some don't.
---
Yeah, has rained for me too. Mostly in Westfall(Loch Modan twice). It's really intense like it used to be, seems to cut the view distance almost in half.
---
Dont join there guild
---
Hey. Get fucked.
---
I don't get it
---
Guess it depends on if that's how it worked in Vanilla. Report it anyway, Blizz can always check the reference client.
---
Doing God's work
---
Was it by chance "Pair Hilton's cum-stained bloodfang pants"?
---
Burns 1% of their Mana per thruth.
---
Incredible design! Really love the small self-references you made on the box, but especially the line of “first month of nostalgia includes” made me chuckle (: !
---
There will be a few guilds looking to do that, but there will also be a lot of guilds just trying to have fun and take down what they can in a raid. I see this being an issue that will work itself out tbh. Just like classic did back in the day...
---
I didn't really think of that, healers doing much better hps now just due to internet connection and FPS.  Thanks!
---
In dungeons this could be effective but not so much for most fights in raids as you'll wanting to be utilizing the MP5 gains as much as possible and this requires not casting for 5 seconds.
---
I might dual box level... not sure though.
---
Would probably end up gimping myself cause I wouldn’t be using a program to help, and WPVP alt tabbing between two account would probably end up with one or both dead.
---
Just saw the comments, so it can be fake, but all of them said the same about ClassiCast.
---
All the Pserver multiboxers are fucked for Classic. Not only do they have to pay for each account, but none of their complex macros are going to work. Blizzard also has a policy of “one key press = one action on one character only”.
---
While you are new, I would recommend just healing, using totems and interrupting.  Once you learn the content, get better gear and just become more comfortable playing the game then you can add in the extra touches.
---
I should add that the spec that you're suggesting is a pvp spec.  It'll work just fine for healing dungeons, but while your gear is bad you might want to be very conservative with your mana.
---
Vanilla has never been about playing fair, if there is an advantage you take it. Streamers arent going to change Vanilla.
---
Because you want to improve yourself?
---
This is pretty significant if it's authentic (which comments archived comments suggest) and isn't changed. There's also some archived comments that suggest blazefury medallion and storm gauntlets benefit from spell damage, which on top of flametongue could be surprising.
---
If you remove the streamers and pserver players, all that you are left with are mildy obese 30-40 year olds playing together with their wives sons.
---
It was so popular that nobody used it lol.
---
Oh wow thanks so much for sharing it! 😍😍 Your name sounds even better in a Scottish accent though xD my dad's from Edinburgh, so I'm used to Scottish hospitality - my Davidson tartan kilt for my wedding is being made over there right now!!
---
For fun.
---
I don't either, I welcome the population boost that streamers bring.
---
I also see the appeal to chain ganking them, but I ain't going to do it. I got leveling and dungeoning to do
---
100 hours is literally impossible world record is 116 and thats not at launch
---
You mean in the beta? Where 99.9% of his fan boys can't get there to play with him? Or do you mean retail, where CRZ and sharding means that unless you're grouped with someone they're going to be an ephemeral presence at best.
---
I would not give two shits about streamers or their followers except for one thing. Right click report and the automatic punishments that come with it.
---
They should do what OSRS does and let the whole community vote on updates and potential brand new content
---
&gt;at what point is it ok to make others experience worse.
---
When those others are streaming their game in real time.
---
If you like watching people play games - nice
---
If you like streaming for others - nice
---
if you like neither - nice
---
There are a lot of people who like to min/max though, it's all up to personal preference. I'd say these players have the right to play this game the way they want, and if you don't like that you can just ignore them. No need to put all the hardcore players in a seperate server.
---
I've always been horse so I'm biased. But the biggest downside to tauren is the large model. On a kodo, you will never be able to fit through a door.
---
That’s so hypocritical of them then. Especially when they bitch about stream sniping meanwhile they are rp sniping
---
Oh cool, i'll look into that.  It's just relieving finding out they are not trash and useless in raids that most of the this sub makes them out to be.
---
Can you explain why Rag doesn't have a threat table, and how that works?
---
First off you wouldn't have classic if it weren't for them. Second stop judging others before you have talked/played with them. A lot of them have knowledge having played classic for a long time and are probably the ones who'll you'll group up/help you out.
---
Hey wouldn't it be super cool with mounts that could fly!
---
A LOT of people will be in rare BIS. This game will be very different to what you know from retail.
---
It’s mute point by now.
---
All us hardcore PvPers had opposite faction lvl1 alts, we would track our enemies all the time, it was the only way to find equally skilled pvpers instead of crushing undergeared noobs lvling.
---
After a while we became friends because we fought with respect, we would let people rez try and keep equal numbers, 1v1's, i would even have enemy mages sheeping me to heal me.
---
This was not considered cheating and was widely accepted, we werent grieving, being toxic, taking raids and corpse camping. we were just finding ways of initiating PVP with equally geared and skilled players.
---
I see no difference between making an alt or watching a stream, if someone wants to go try 1v1 their favourite streamer i think they should, if they pay for the game and also sub to the streamer why not?
---
The ability to track enemy players has been there long before Twitch and hasnt really been seen as an issue before.
---
Id be really suprised if Soda didnt have a lvl1 Horde alt in Vanilla, didnt everyone?.
---
That depends on your abilities, mana availability, tank health, group health, situation.
---
Healer doing dps is welcomed, so long as the primary reason they are there is being fulfilled.
---
I planning on 5-boxing as well bro! Have you tried ISboxer software? It is by far the best multiboxing software on the market. Cheap too. 
---
Check out MiRai videos on YouTube and whatnot where he shows and teaches everything you need to know about setting it up for WoW. He even tested WoW Classic demo, I remember. 
---
ISboxer will also allow you to multibox multiple melee chars with eeeease!
---
I wouldn't care about streamers at all if there wasn't right click report and automated punishment.  That is literally the only reason I care.  The ability for a pack of drooling twelve year olds to revoke my ability to chat, and disconnect me because of a slight to a streamer, real or imagined, is reason enough to want to be away from them.
---
They have the same rights to be on a server as we do. Avoiding them is the best we can do to allow both us and them a fair experience, and them providing their server name on name creation date is the most fair they can be to that cause.
---
He specifically mentioned “while leveling”.
---
So what factors would there be for you to change your mind to one? Are you playing PvP or PvE?
---
Man even today there's a bug that doesn't disable pet growl when zoning into a dungeon.
---
You think any hunter notices? I just went through dungeons from 60-80 and I can't tell you the amount of times I've seen hunter pets take aggro from me and die. I also saw a guy using Primal Rage on cooldown which meant we got it when we zoned in and tgen two times after 10 minutes on some random trash packs.
---
It's gonna be the same this time around, just the biggest mouthbreathers rolling on everything and fucking things up without knowing their class mechanics.
---
Bruh, what?
---
I played on a private server and I got to maybe level 35
---
WPL farms with undead + mages would likely be best source of blue/epic world drops due to quantity of those mobs. MC could be farmed for those few tier pieces and whatever else trash drops. As it takes time the 5 reset per hour should never be a problem. BRD arena runs are quick, easy to exceed 5 instances/h, drops some good blues.
---
Correcto.
---
I found [this list](https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons) that covers the weapons most hunters consider BiS
---
If there is red against a green, it‘s time for a team.
---
I mean, they redesigned and removed a ton of core features before and that lost them 90% of their players. But that’s because what replaced those features made the game worse. LFR was a replacement for hard work and finding decent guilds to appeal to casual players. Attunements were removed and replaced with iLVL to appeal to casual players. Tier Sets were removed and replaced with generic armor class sets to appeal to developer laziness. Artifact weapons were introduced and then removed to appeal to people who just want to pointlessly grind forever. The old world was removed and replaced to appeal to lazy players that didn’t want to explore a dangerous and hostile game environment. The world was removed for most players and replaced with LFG so players never had to leave their starter zone to reach max level.
---
I think a lot of people confuse the LFG/LFR system with the Group Finder one.
---
Group Finder really isn't a problem in WoW if there is no teleport/cross server stuff.
---
Note: I am not advocating for it being added to classic WoW, just saying that I don't think the UI itself is one of the things causing problems for modern WoW.
---
Yes any roots or slows can be shifted.
---
Being a MT is arguably one of the hardest things to do in a raid actually. Let me re-phrase, being a GREAT main tank is one of the hardest things to do. Making sure you know the fight inside and out. People will be looking for you to position the boss where it needs to be, use your cool downs when big DMG is incoming from the boss, and yell at people that aren't in position etc. If you are looking for a challenge, that will have a long road, MT would be it, imo. Just keep in mind, there will be 1 MT in a 40 man raid, but a bunch of DPS/heals (1 main healer, but still more than tanks) So what I am getting at is, it will also be very competitive for a spot. If you have never played I personally would recommend a different role for PVE, but the choice is ultimately yours!
---
Owl is a meme, cat is better even on alliance.
---
Based on what you've said here I feel like you're more tending to Hunter so I'd go with that. In the end it's your own choice though, you should watch some guides of both of them in classic to better understand their play styles, maybe that will help you decide.
---
Oy vey the office keyboard mostly works, dont be so wasteful with your money. Let me help you invest in Athari Basin Tokens, my Rabbi predicts a 10 fold return. We just have to give him all of our tokens and he will do the rest
---
It’s my turn to post this tomorrow!
---
Maybe reply to the comment you're arguing with
---
It would only be cringe if someone used this table to stalk and gank them or something, using it to avoid streamers and remove yourself from the weird drama is the most mature thing to do about imo, not cringe at all
---
A portion of private server players will remain on private servers instead of paying for a sub.  Those of them who will join Classic will be much more helpful and friendly than the retailtards and mobile memers.
---
Except it's run out before they even get back to the gates
---
I personally never cared if you used big cd’s. It really just comes down to each person and what they consider bm.
---
LOL. I have more life experience in my left nut than you do in your entire body. Children..

---
While this is true, it doesn't change the fact that these things existed in Vanilla.
---
It's part of the experience whether you like it or not.
---
Yes they fixed it. It seems a little strange that you'd focus on that compared to the fact they made bear and cat form actually have some sort of use and they gave every druid innervate but yes, you can shift out of a snare.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I think the blacklist thing is BEYOND retarded and terrible.  But I think this sub sort of took out of context of what he said.   He was messing with the idea of blizzard opening up a streamer *server* that’s optional where this would be sort of the *rules*.  Not that they should do this on any random server. 
---
It doesn’t make it much better but still context is important
---
User known for blindly hating private servers, blindly hating on private servers. What else is new?
---
I think it was, also what the hell was up with that?
---
Not the first time they’ve done it 😔
---
Also 
---
Shroud, Ziqoftw, Swifty,
---
If servers are announced and there isn't an RP PVP one, you people should organize and choose a single pvp server to act as a makeshift RP PVP server.  Either the server will have a massive population compared to all other servers and Blizzard will have no choice but to notice, or it won't, it will prove that blizzard was right, and at least all the people who wanted rp-pvp will be in the same place.
---
It's not an ideal solution, but I can't think of a better one \**that is within your power to do*\*
---
What are wow tokens?
---
You can not ninja my weapon ;)
---
I know this is an old thread now, but I was wondering what are you guys gonna do if blizz won’t make an rppvp server as they have indicated they might not? Also, how can I join your guild?
---
No.   
---
He was added way way later... in Legion I believe.
---
Dagger rogue will always gear quickly due to still being good, but not quite as good as sword rogue. 
---
(Also Felstriker always looked so freaking cool pre-raid)
---
Haha that's odd. Same family name.
---
Nice ! Glad you noticed it - also had to plug my insta in there too lol
---
You can't really be cat/heal unless you're ok with being #27 on dps.  If you're anything but cookie cutter feral your dps will be absolute trash. OOC/LotP/Furor are core talents to not wasting your time in cat form.
---
Private server players  are going to diffuse across servers, unless you are talking about hardcore elite pserver players. Which would just be the super good guilds like apes, etc. They probably won't announce which server they are going to be on, and unless they stream it, no one will know. Plus, I don't even see a real reason to try and avoid those people. Giving credit where credit is due, they are the reason they are making this happen. Unless you want to PvP on a server full of people who aren't good so you can not get stomped by the hardcore players.

It is our goal to set as few spells as possible to be diminished. We've identified this short list of spells as having durations and cooldowns sufficient to almost permanently slow or immobilize targets but without adequate controls or other limiting factors. When a spell with diminishing returns is used against a target in PvP, the first effect has full duration. On the second use of the same category of spell (e.g. slowing), that spell's duration is reduced by 50%. On the third use, the duration is reduced by 75%. On the fourth attempt, the target becomes immune to the spell. Spells must be used on the same target within 15 seconds of the \*end\* of the duration in order to be diminished. In other words, if a target hasn't had a slowing spell active on them for more than 15 seconds, the next slowing spell will have full effect. The list of affected spells is:

Some people say it was only discover in during legion but was there since the beginning. That's why I ask
---
As long as you're not also claiming to be part of the nochanges crowd, this is a good point.
---
I'm glad to share a clan with you, brother milkers! 😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
---
Won't you be using MoTW? In which case this is the wrong icon...
---
O no I am so hurt by this stranger on the internet ouch my feelings.
---
Grats
---
And the teensy little problem of needing +16% hit from gear.
---
The vast majority of people playing wow don't know who soda is lol
---
What lvl do I get that ability at?
---
Some ppl says it was only discover in légion but was there long before. That's why I ask
---
How on earth do you manage to not have money for your spells when you get a free mount at level 40, and are a dot class so if you wanted to you could probably just skin stuff while your dots are ticking? is it all the bag space for those gems preventing you from carrying vendor trash around?
---
Shit. I did the math wrong. !RemindMe 68 days
---
I “think” paladins and shaman share a color in Vanilla, idk about Classic though
---
Once dishonorable kills come out in p2 people will be a lot less inclined to gank low level players since the system punishes you.
---
Assuming you're talking about Nost, I expect you caught them during their weak timezones. If you got them when they were active, they would bring 1-2 dozen rank 14 characters down on your head.
---
The Blizzard haters won't go to Classic as it's not "a 1.1.2 patch progression, overbuffed and no changes" or because they just hate the company. Plus the most vocal ones - if they go play Classic and say one word to many they get reported and for some Blizzard likely has even a dedicated ban hammer :)
---
Right now people on pservers are trying classic, there are "no beta access" guilds and so forth. Those aren't "toxic elitists".
---
Blindly? I played on them for years. It's the worst community in gaming, LoL included
---
Because it would take away some of the incentive to make friends and be in a guild while leveling. The inadvertent effect of it being difficult to form groups was that social interaction payed off, in that it would be easier to find good people because you made sure to keep friends. A "job board" makes the whole thing less personal and make friends and guilds less necessary.   
---
I don't get why a bunch of people here are suddenly fine with LFG. Did all the retailers come here or what?
---
I honestly don't know anyone who will remain, and because there's so few the pservers will be empty as hell and not worth playing.
---
esfand/tipsout/staysafe are all going to roll on soda/asmon server to chase some clout
---
Lol why would they be reporting you? You will likely rarely even see them, let alone piss him off and have him report you. That’s paranoia talking
---
No shit, it's only fair being bitter about being a 2nd class citizen.
---
You're making a huge assumption here : that WoW fell as hard as apex.
---
We don't know whether WoW is 11th or 999th, nor where apex currently is.
---
Your whole point boils down to "WoW is making less money than usual", that's it.
---
yeah, people shit all over sharding and layering, but if you've ever played without it you realize its a godsend for this game
---
Instead of "Problematic/Popularity," maybe try "Impact" or "Potential Impact" - neutral word that could be good or bad depending on whether you like that streamer or want to be on streamer servers or not.
---
Other than that, the only streamers I follow are chill ones that mostly make YouTube videos. I don't think anyone particularly wants to avoid them, but if for some reason people do, Madseasonshow (NA) has said he's definitely going Alliance, and Frostadamus (EU) is probably going Horde
---
Isn't that exactly what streamers will do?
---
Good catch! Updated the site.
---
lol, no.
---
I'm talking about /y CASINO OPEN, STEP RIGHT UP AND TRY YOUR LUCK [Insert betting odds here].
---
Not some stupid bullcrap where you hundreds of thousands of gold in one night.
---
There will be hardcore guilds that do that but being such won't imply being a private server player. Just like Method on retail such guilds will exist but in extremely small amount. Normal players will be in normal guilds.
---
Incorrect. Without using any of the Pserver experience exploits, we've got several players that can hit 60 in under 90 hours. That record is from 13 years ago. We've gotten MUCH better at the game since then.
---
And even if you discount all our Pserver practice, all but 3 members of our raid team have beaten Joana's 1-30 record on the Beta by several hours and many of them have already beaten his 1-40 record by an even larger margin. This was using fresh characters with no assistance or twinking.
---
On launch, for every person in the raid team, there will be another 1.5 people assisting them in any way possible. Feeding them consumables and gold, summoning, getting anything from cities, etc.
---
Joana is a dinosaur. He's a dedicated marathon player, but he has no idea how to min/max and refuses outside assistance. His record is irrelevant when it comes to rushing a week one Rag kill.
---
China finally wins.
---
Give venruki a shot, he's a great pvper and is pretty chill, except for when he won the duelling tournament and jumped around like a madman :)
---
brooooooooo, this might be some of the best shit I've ever seen.
---
You probably haven't even reached 40 yet. Come back when you have some experience under your belt kid.
---
Soda used to like streaming. But going from a small and manageable viewer base to 30k made him really fucking tired of dealing with retards.
---
It's a lovely green purple. Well the one here is anyway. An you!
---
I would say Priest healing is more interesting.  As a pally all you will be doing is pressing flash of light over and over for the most part.
---
I wouldn't play pally for the simple fact that refreshing blessings constantly would be annoying.
---
So to summarize, you have no arguments to defend your position, and will repeat your same, tired, flawed accusations and insults _ad nauseam_ when called out for it.
---
Glad we sorted that out. I will not be hearing from you again.

Lol did you use that website where you could create your own south park characters? I made so many back in the day lol.
---
I mean they are pretty much the same concept.
---
One plays vs the casino the other plays against other players. 
---
IIRC blizzard banned the former casino type cause there was a vig
---
hooooorm?
---
That's really cool. What a unique way to hit the OG level cap.
---
They did. It wasn’t an issue cause they were faction based.
---
He's smiling.  What's more calm and peaceful than that?
---
We're less concerned about gear (minus the tank) than we are about getting the rep as quickly as possible. We've been doing Rag clears in greens and non-dungeon quest blues for several weeks now, some with as few as 25 people.
---
I removed that column and added it back serval times while making the site... I knew what I was trying to convey, but didn't think I was doing it the best I could.  I like your suggestion as I think brings clarity to the column. I will sit on it a little bit, but will probably switch to that. Thanks for the suggestion, for real.
---
You just lost an argument to someone under 40.
---
I want to say 51?
---
wanst the doomguard on a 1 hour cooldown in vanilla?
---
Yeah. Always knew he was a pervert. He was gazing at my bungus the whole time.
---
Probably because you're in it.
---
Not really. They aren't really skilled enough to absolutely dominate in PvP  except by sheer numbers. Pserver folk are going to be hardcore, but streamers will attract a large amount of followers who don't care about anything except the streamer
---
No problem :)
---
But yeah, for better or worse, like or hate, I figured the overall impact is what everyone's concerned about. Covering both the effects of both streamer and streamer's fans.
---
Sure, think whatever you want kid. It's clear you're a lost cause.
---
I honestly forgot about "dinging". Every time someone in a dungeon leveled it would be "ding!" followed by "Gratz!"
---
Nobody gives a shit anymore.
---
Wouldn't that put you in the category of people you're complaining about then?
---
I agree, not every streamers impact is negative. Small streamers like Sakkar (former blizzard CM Ythiens) honestly would probably be a positive impact; whereas Asmon and Soda are bound to be negative simply due to their size.
---
In my guild we did like 2-3h of silithus running around the mountain. Brain damage boring but 40 people rep done.
---
Swifty is rocking 5 multibox accounts  to level at the start  1 warrior and either 4 priest or  2 priest and 2 mages
---
You do know one of the biggest complains on retail is timegating right? People would hate being stuck at 30 knowing that everything they do won’t matter in a few weeks.
---
!RemindMe 67 days
---
Look up a reckoning paladin build and gameplay
---
The vast majority does not use reddit or the general forums...so what you are saying is just BS
---
I don't remember, tbh. I only helped summon. I've never played a lock myself. Very excite.
---
This coming from a guy who made a target macro for asmon called autism.
---
I believe there is one call “graph paper” on wowinterface that works in BFA. Might need some tweaking to work on the beta.
---
Kobolds for alliance pawns and quillboar for horde
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying. OP is asking for the best class in terms of wPvP but thats tough to answer as it's a broad term that encompasses many different scenarios
---
HotW spec that was mentioned can tank and heal at raid tier, but the problem is that raids usually only bring exactly as many healers as they need. Which means for you to tank, the raid would be down a healer. If they bring another healer, they never really need you to heal. It can work if the raid likes to pad healer slots tho.
---
Usually if you are feral in a raid you go tank and dps, switching between cat and bear depending on the fight. This can be done fully optimally with a deep feral spec.
---
I thought it stood for VanCleef 😅 To differentiate Dire Maul from Deadmines.
---
So... you’re someone who wants to roll on the same server as Lirik? I can’t think of any other possible explanation for why you would think one of who will become a top 5 classic streamer wouldn’t pull in obnoxious viewers...
---
Because he is the ultimate neckbeard stereotype.
---
Lives in a dark disgusting apartment, plays WoW 16 hours a day, Armory inspects players to shit talk them, etc.
---
I'm amazed at your file saving ability. I forgot to save my senior project for my CS bachelor and it was 5 years after this.
---
Ourselves and 3 other hardcore Pserver guilds (2 on each faction) all planning to pick the same US PVP server on August 12th. Our plan after pushing for a week one Rag kill is to team up and grief the streamers on both sides so hard they decide to switch servers.
---
I was killing bosses in naxx when it was current content, tell me what your vanilla experiences were like. You probably didn't even reach 60 on one let alone 6 characters, if you even played back then kid.
---
I’m pretty confident the streamer servers will leak before launch. Keep in mind there is the character reservation period, and the realms will be released by then.
---
That is what swifty is using to level his 5 at the start
---
No, black people being called gorillas and apes has been a thing racists have been doing for quite a while now. The line could have read " Gorilla: Listen I feel you on this one, everyone wants a big fuzzy boxer by their side..." but it doesn't. It's pretty clear what the original comparison is about.
---
Correct me if I am wrong. Wasn't the best Hunter Pet a cat at level 60 because they had 1.0 AS vs all other pets with 2.0 AS.
---
Big assumption, your group will most likely be retarded, ESPECIALLY on classic with all the retail babies coming in.
---
Even on Pservers I consider myself blessed if the tank isnt retarded, pulls at a decent pace, and holds aggro reasonably well. I once grouped with a tank that was never using sunder, asked us to wait before dpsing, and was literally losing aggro to my cat (with growl off). He asked me to dismiss my pet.
---
Because they see me do any of the following...
---
Take a mob that the streamer wanted.
---
Take an herb or node that the streamer wanted.
---
Killed the streamer in PvP.
---
Voiced an opinion that the streamer didn't like.
---
Won an item over a streamer in a group.
---
I do not expect an adult level of restraint or maturity from a streamer's fans.  I repeat, the FANS.
---
I don't care if the streamer reports me.  It's one person, he can report all he wants.  It's the hundreds or thousands of people who are watching his stream who, if they have an active wow account, can log in and report me.
---
These people give gold and items to streamers for the chance to have their name appear on the stream.  Do you really think they're above white knighting?
---
I’m a dad gamer but I also play on a private server your move
---
feels like they already won on ND :/
---
It would except I quit because of all the toxicity. There comes a point when you've had enough of the racism and hate.
---
so a holy build that gets reckoning? Works well with gear youd already be getting as a holy paladin from raiding? if so thanks man
---
idk what you think joana does, but i know for a fact he pays people for these leveling guides and it was a fair amount of business for him.
---
I also dont know if you know that most pservers are reversed engineered from wrath and or tbc, after many nerfs have happened to exp gain, particularly after level 30 when exp was boosted from quests about 40%, must be why you "beaten his 1-40 record by an even larger margin"
---
There is video proof of this, joana has recorded all of his runs and you can compare the exp from quests side by side with any pserver.
---
I guess id like to wish you good luck even tho you came off as a dick, you may of literally not know about the exp nerf, and this seems like you planned alot and i thought you should know.
---
However you have a pretty bad attitude and i have to say it is likely you all will fail to reach 60 in 100 hours, at which case youve already failed your first goal in classic wow.
---
I know everyone is free to enjoy the game any way they want but it seems you are going in with false expectations.
---
Unless you are on some pserver that is a 1:1 of classic wow (which i doubt) id expect the leveling experience to not go the exact same, its also been confirmed that many outdoor quest mobs and popular exp grind mobs have had abilities disabled which also can affect leveling speed., Even ragnaros on some realms doesnt even do a pretty important ability that is waht requires all the fire resist gear in the first place.
---
best of luck
---
Thank you for your contribution! Very informative, strong compelling argument to adequately explains why the server population will decrease as streamers leave &lt;3
---
I'd like some examples of this happening too! 
---
Which faction is best for / benefits the most from Feral tanks? After reading Taladrils tanking guide I'm pretty set on a feral tank. Anyone have experience in raising as a tank? Wondering how difficult it will be to find a raising guild willing to give someone with no vanilla tanking experience a shot as feral
---
I will probably try but maybe only dualbox.. I did it a couple of times with RaF to level alts (before there were paid boosts).
---
I'm a streamer and I play on private servers, I am however not a dad.
---
Would it be difficult to pick up 2 classes 1 main tank and the other something like healer so I can still have a good impact just a spot that isn’t so competitive.
---
I don't, but to constantly live in fear that a big bad streamer is going to mass report you because you A: happened to be in the same area as them and B: Took a gathering node from them, is both paranoid and ridiculous. It COULD happen, sure, but will it? Likely not. 
---
You COULD get an orb of deception to drop, will it? Likely not.
---
We seriously need to ban posts/memes complaining about streamers. It's getting to the point are just using it as an easy way to farm karma.
---
but Moonsorrow never did anything about Lake Bodom...
---
Most vertical mice have five buttons and a scroll wheel. Which is fairly typical of gaming mice too. Sounds like you're looking for an "RPG" mouse like the Logitech G600 MMO.
---
I'll make sure ven and the bois know what server he's on so we can camp him in classic too.
---
Your suggestion clears up the column a lot. I updated the label! Thanks again.
---
Indeed, much less dps lost by warlock banishing than hunter kiting.
---
Yea, if you're down to heal then playing Druid will be good for you. Hybrids didn't start to become good at their other roles (by good I mean competitive) until around Wrath. 
---
Healing in Vanilla was still pretty mindless to be honest. Mainly because of "downranking" your healing spells. 
---
Up until the start of Wrath (I think), players could use the downranked version of their spells. Obviously it would heal for less, but it would often have positive benefits, such as speed and mana efficiency. 
---
Shaman, for example, have a healing talent that increases your target's armor by 25% for 15sec after a crit heal. So you could hit them with a rank 1 heal to fish for that bonus. 
---
Further down the tree you can get Healing Way. This talent increases your next healing wave by 6% (if you cast it on the same target), stackable up to three times. So you could hit them with a rank 1 heal to pump them up to 3 stack, and then spam a lower rank Healing Wave spell for maximum mana efficiency. 
---
So while you are given some extra unintended depth to the class, it also can potentially make content rather easy.
---
If you're subbed, make sure you leave a comment in support of RP-PvP servers [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/rp-pvp-realms-reconsider-one-realm/130723).  
---
I want me some RP-PvP servers, they always had the best WPvP battles.
---
It's not even chat, i played with him  and the other streamers for project 60, and he was already bitching and whining that he wanted to move on to project 70 in under a week. dude has the attention span of a 12 year old and the attitude of it to match.
---
&gt;must be a gen z thing
---
Because WoW videos totally didn't exist in vanilla /s
---
Yeah, he's a an annoying little shit head of a millionaire.

Streamers join server

---
You would be a fool to think a streamer will have no short and long-term impact on the server you're playing on. It will be especially apparent if they are a non-wow playing streamer who's hyping the game and then decides they don't like wow much after their viewer count plummets due to boredom; resulting in them switching to another game.
---
Taunt was a spell.
---
 !RemindMe 80 days "."
---
Exactly but you are only competing against your own faction.
---
? I feel like the majority of them are going to be rolling on a PVE server because they will be constantly ganked if they don't.
---
My plan is to make my main Human Warrior at launch
---
Dwarf Hunter alt he will be my gatherer.
---
Mage lock or mage alt she will be for D/E banking
---
acquire skinning and herbalism, the focus is to have 190 alchemy by 36 for soloing cyclonian
---
also acquire cooking, first aid and fishing, these will be the money makers.
---
at level 10 or first convenient time to enter stormwind buy my guild charter, and invite the boys
---
quest and grind my ass off till 36 hopefully ive been been getting enough mats for leveling alchemy
---
acquire whirlwind axe at level 36, mount at 43 when i would prolly have enough gold naturally
---
level to 60. I plan to only stop and do once - deadmines, stockades uldaman, zf, mauradon (key for thrashblade and other items), sunken temple (maybe)
---
once 60 its time to max out alchemy and get expert riding, id also like to start my farm of BRD and prolly meet up with most my friends for the first time as it appears ill be the only one taking time off from work for launch. I will need ironfoe as it is tank pre raid bis and can carry me a good while.
---
With down time i will start leving my hunter who will go mining and herbalism, as i will need to dump herbalism on my warrior for engineering, id like to max out engineering soon after hitting 60 as this is a big boost to threat and can help trivilize pulls
---
My gnome will be for fun and casual play, maybe make some extra gold doing enchanting stuff
---
Which is why we need streaming free servers.  Then we could be guaranteed never having to play on a streamers server.
---
Your last two links are broken, jsyk
---
Thats not true. It stayed there for a while till they hid it in a later patch. People would ask each other what their 60 number was.
---
It evens out you’re fine
---
Wrong again. We've beaten his 1-40 record on the Classic Beta servers. And we're using Pservers that don't have the exp nerf. We've confirmed nearly every quest exp and mob exp value on our test server against the Classic Beta and they've all been correct.
---
We do know that some mobs are missing abilities, but the amount of time that adds to our routes is inconsequential. There are also several Pserver bugs that make grinding harder, such as mobs ignoring certain slows when they run away.
---
We're also not using any Pserver data that made changes to MC. While we're less confident this is 100% accurate, we're more than confident that our ability to do it with 25 people in greens on our blizz-like server will mean having 40 people will more than make up for it.
---
Few things are wrong
---
Raptor: Damage 9% ,Armor: 4% ,Health: -3%, Total: 10% bonuses
---
Not true. Raptors have 10% damage, 3% armor, -5% health
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=raptor
---
Owls DPS is low compared to cats. Sure, they might hold group aggro, I won't be fighting more than 1 mob at a time 95% of the time.
---
Cats and raptors have the best DPS, as well as skills. Cats get bite and claw, owls only get claw. bite is the best damage per focus skill in the game.
---
So, cat's/raptors are probably the best for both leveling and end game. Raiding goes to Wolves.
---
Sounds good. I guess the pserver guilds will have insight info about their servers.
---
Private server players vs streamers are much different animals. I'd suggest [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM) to have a better idea on how, in my opinion, streamers will impact your realm in a much different way than private server players will.
---
Got me and my mouthful of coffee off guard with the "Giggity". Good job.
---
But it's not even good leveling. You rarely fight more than 1 mob at a time, and it does 3% less dps than a cat/raptor.
---
Wait so do retail players intent to play really bad specs and force everyone else to carry them? How do we avoid retail players?
---
Naga Razer. Full keypad on the side. On my rogue through WOTLK to Legion I only spammed 2 on my keyboard, everything else was the thumb keypad.
---
Before WotLK I had a normal pleb mouse.

As long as you test out your limits both movement and difficulty wise, you’ll do fine, but you need to be in control of every situation, and that includes knowing when to stop. Pushing yourself to do more and better is one of the main things in climbing, but if you know your limit and don’t needlessly push yourself further without proper muscle training  you will probably avoid needless injuries.Take it slow but more importantly don’t let the injury stop you from trying! You don’t have to climb the highest grades, it’s about the journey as much as it is about the destination. I spent a lot of weekends climbing the easiest routes on top rope before leadclimbing, and it was as fun and thrilling as leadclimbing is to me now. You do you, find your pace, i know you can do it and i believe in you friend :)
---
Good to know.  Just looking for some flexibility without constant respecs, i'll look into it, thanks!
---
Wait really? I knew about the tips situation before Asmon baby raged and talked about it, but I actually thought someone doxxed Tips. That’s hilarious if it’s true, what a dumb idiot.
---
Or you did it on accident and you're hiding your embarrassment... Lol
---
Cats are better. Love cats.
---
That said, to solo tough stuff, I will 100% be using Mr. boar. Boars are beast, and will be my best friend to solo hard stuff.
---
Check the articles I've added if you're interested.  They involved the help of two of the main creators of the Nostralius PServer.
---
Jesus fuck, actual Satan.
---
This is the first comment about streamers that has made me happy. Thank you!!!
---
This is the data crunching I know and love!
---
I'm more worried about ending in the less populated server.
---
Did what on accident? I purposely deleted my previous comments because I don’t want to spread false information. As I had false information, it’s best not to spread it more.
---
I’m not hiding shit
---
It's an analogy that I'm using as an example of how you are taking lfg dungeons at level 25 to represent all retail dungeon experiences and imply they are bad. Of course the lfg tool fucking sucks, it's brain dead content you can 2 man and everybody's done it a thousand times already, so there isn't any need to talk to eachother. Point is that it doesn't represent dungeons in retail, same way that lfr doesn't represent raiding in retail.
---
Do like me: heal in PvE and dps in PvP.
---
What about people who roll on these servers and eventually decided to start streaming. What would they do, ban them?
---
I think the only streamer I'd be cool with playing on the same server as would be Crendor. He's a pretty cool guy.
---
I see racism everywhere 👀
---
What if it doesn't get leaked?
---
I would prefer RP-PVP. Also, no streamers allowed.
---
They invited Nost developers in 2016 and reinvited them (Viper and Daemon) throughout the development of classic per articles I've added to my original comment.
---
Kern said they started utilizing Nost data and then discovered a better way.  It seems very reasonable given they were happy to invite and involve the Nost developers back in 2016 and 2017.
---
There's nothing that stops you from enjoying all the content that's there at the end of the second year by creating alts etc. Classic could be out for five years without a single patch and people could still make new characters, level, do dungeons etc and have a good time.
---
The only reason to start fresh servers over and over is for the people who enjoy the fresh server experience and are in it for the racing. Both of these communities are not in any way large enough to support this model for long, and the experience they're seeking is very temporary. You can't have two month droughts of content if the only people left on the server after a month are people interested in racing. The server would literally die, and then once they dropped new content like half the people would return, play for a few weeks, and leave again.
---
I hope they use original server names.
---
I read it as Mike Tyson can beat the $hit out of anybody, and gorillas can as well.
---
At the current state reckoning won’t work like on private server cuz u need to time the sit and crit perfect 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxhMxZZVbLtrcqo
---
This build is also a good choice 
---
You can heal raids and play pvp like a ret/holy hybrid 
---
You have 2 stuns etc.
---
Healer gear has plus healing only. So your lightning spells do base damage. You can do it for fun but just so you know it makes no difference at all.
---
Visit a streamers channel and watch the chat feed, that's what they'll do to the chat in whichever realm the streamer plays.
---
&gt; Edit: and if I come off as a dick, it's simply because I'm exhausted of trying to explain to people that think our goals are literally impossible why they aren't.
---
because until now its seeming to be common knowledge that pservers are wrong and all reverse engineered, like tons of interviews from the nostralius team and other successful servers that worked hard to recreate the experience.
---
I am someone who thinks rag will fall week 1 but not with 100 hours of leveling and not in greens, idk how that gives fire resistance
---
Could someone tell me if the enhanced graphics druids' hair color matters for forms in classic? 
---
I know the classic graphics have a set form for each race, but I am guessing if you toggle the newer character graphics, then the hair color may matter during creation?
---
I don't have the beta or I would definitely be testing this. Thanks in advance!
---
Probably because he isn't big on classic. He said he's having unexpectedly way more fun with it than he thought he would but he doesn't plan on running a guild, raiding on a schedule, or pursuing things like R14 or Scarab Lord. He has more fun raiding in BFA. 
---
If he was on your server you'd probably never notice.
---
&gt; Nobody really wants to play with people who demand cookie cutter builds and min/maxing racials.
---
Sounds like my kind of party.
---
Yes i played a lot with Sancrotis , remember him well UD Lock
---
And nixxiom (if he played NA)
---
Pretty sure the Huhu Stinger bow is an upgrade to Rohk if you are unable to get the crossbow of smiting.
---
That would make me so sad, so it's basically inevitable.
---
Vanilla bosses hit like noodles though. I think dw tanks will still be the case.
---
Yes.  You know it's a streaming free server when you roll on it.  I would say first offense would be a temp ban and 2nd offense would be forced transfer to a streaming server.
---
A normal mouse is fine, it’s just your environment that makes a difference. I use the back of one of my slaves as a mouse pad, if I feel my wrist is straining i just command them to shift their position to give me more support.
---
If that’s doesn’t work and I feel they are being lazy I make them do some herbal or mining farming for me, that usually encourages them to perform better.
---
If you don’t have slaves I suggest a small child, usually niece or nephew is perfect. If you babysit this also helps them feel like they are helping and keeps them entertained
---
I wouldn't recommend anyone go reck unless all they want to do is duel rogues, but reckoning works the same in 60 pvp as it does on private servers. /sit is just a levelling gimmick, you never actually use it at lvl 60.
---
Yeah, those are both good, the opener and the bleeds. I just think you don't generally see druids hanging out in cat form e.g. chasing mages around and stuff, for the most part.
---
Yeah the healer is auto attacking as well, that's why the group dies in the first place.
---
OMG ask Keysoereyz about Darkist me and him were always going off in WSG 1v1ing each other, dont think he liked me that much but we became friends in the end.
---
Can confirm, this is how it’s done on private servers
---
Oh man this is awesome! I'm totally going to do this!

That imbalance is crazy. It seems like Blizz should cap it so that if one faction has X more players no one else can join as that faction until things even up.
---
I used to play on Barthilas back in TBC and got the impression it was a little horde favoured but no where near that bad. :(
---
Stop being such an elitist asshole.
---
Yeah, I was going to have that in this update but I found out that the hunter cast bars and melee parries weren't working as intended so I wanted to quickly fix that.
---
Do you know how dumb you sound?
