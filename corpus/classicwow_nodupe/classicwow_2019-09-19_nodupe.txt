i was fire in vanilla, but i moves to arcane in TBC. arcane + stacked haste gear + obscene mana pool topped dps charts. i wish blizzard finished the arcane spec in vanilla. it‚Äôs basically not a spec at all right now. 
---
also i will never forgive blizzard for basically outlawing fire as a raid spec without having finished arcane first. i absolutely hate frost.

Some people don't know there are two villages of murlocs there. A mage was aoeing everything but no one was at the second village by on the beach so I was able to complete that faster than almost any other collection quest I did.

Love to see this! I lucked into picking the best pvp server apparently. That's fucking awesome.

It violated the low effort meme rule. It broke the rules when the post was made and still broke them 10 hours later. It's unfortunate it got as popular as it did before it was removed, however upvotes and comments aren't shields for the rules.
---
If we were to implement a policy of "it breaks the rules, but it got popular before we noticed so we're leaving it up" it would piss a lot of people off. It sounds nice on paper. In practice we'd just be telling people "sorry, you were unlucky and that other guy made his post while the mods were asleep. Tough luck."
---
That's interesting. 
---
I'll keep that in kind when I can't find anyone to group with. 
---
I wish blizzard would ease up on the server transfer rules, I think a free flow would naturally balance things out. 
---
People are afraid of going to DD because it'll be dead soon because blizzard doesn't allow transfers. It'll suck if I waste days worth of time to get a level 60 in a ghost town. If that happens ill never give blizzard another penny.
---
problem is they overestimate the distance and try to jump at the last second but fall off instead. and the higher the latency they have the easier it is to make that mistake. or probably even more common people just forget or don't know it's there and run straight off without attempting to jump at all. it's a joke of an obstacle if you know it's there and don't overestimate it trying to jump at the last second.

I always recommend druids as a first character. Druids can fill every role in the game, and you can experience all of those roles in the first 20 levels if you'd like. That will give you a better idea of what you enjoy doing in the game if you don't like the druid and decide you want to re-roll. Druids also have lower down time than any other class and they get increased movement speed, meaning they can level up, quest, and explore quickly.

As for 1080p, 2500x1600 (significantly higher than 1080p) monitors have been floating around in the consumer market since around 2004. Even CRT monitors from 2002 could push 1600x1200 at \~100Hz, with the option to display much higher resolutions at a lower refresh rate.

There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding what 2004-2005 tech was actually like.

As of Sep 5th "it appears to be functional in classic" -- this is an addon that I wanted as well.  For opposing faction, there's "Spy Classic", but for same-faction I want something I can attach notes to.

He was possessed while still in his mother's womb, you can't really blame the guy.

i'd say it's hard to measure off of classic since it's mostly going to be adults playing.

You are comparing a class as human vs a class as a non-human *with another class giving it a buff*.  The fact that you even make that comparison shows how broken the human sword spec is.

&gt; Not only do you have an increased chance to miss because you're using two weapons, but 1H weapon natively has more chance to miss than a 2H by game design.
---
Could you back that up? This is the first I hear of it, and as far as I'm aware there's no difference between wielding a single weapon regardless of whether it's one-handed or two-handed. However, when dual-wielding you suffer a hit chance penalty of 14%, bringing your base miss chance from 5% to 19%. You do not have this penalty if you're only wielding a single weapon.
---
When a *player* attacks a *player*, that's what we call pvp. The level of a player is completely prevent to the definition of pvp. This is world of Warcraft. If attacking lower levels was impossible and people did it by abusing a bug, then I'd say you might have an argument. But in wow, there are no level restrictions.
---
Nah I'm basically against and Auto group stuff.

I'm all for summoning stones though.

You are hilarious. You would do well on RP-PvP servers.

It's BiS. Doesn't matter the armor type, doesn't matter the other classes there, it's a warrior's BiS until AQ. It's not about the item being leather or mail or whatnot. It's BEST. IN. SLOT.

That's always plenty of time.  I mean when I'm managing a database I realize it's being used by my users at all times, so I'll preform 'maintenance' on it for 1-2 hours *every damned week* around breakfast time, or when people are getting an hour in before work.
---
Clearly 4-5 in the morning would be unacceptable because no one is on at that time, so I run the risk of not pissing anyone off.
---
Wrong.
---
It's a simple game but with huge depth. Read about them all in some detail and then play the class that appeals to you. Yes Warrior is probably hardest but it's a game at the end of the day and it's not hard like learning a language or playing a musical instrument. Hunter is easiest and quite fun, you get a pet to look after, but it is also quite complicated to master in top end player versus player combat. Just go with your gut once you've done some research.
---
However if you enjoy being especially needed by the community and want to be invited to join lots of groups with minimal effort play a Warrior (Tank) or Priest (Healer).
---
I'm not a blood g'nelf

I loved everything about the game. The dungeons were fantastic, atmosphere was great. My favorite character was a medic. That class was so well made and fun to play, I miss it so much.
---
I see what your saying, but I'm not sure it makes a difference. Without cross realm play, like in retail, across all realm populations shouldn't make a difference.
---
Got very lucky with the split though, some servers have crazy horde-alliance swings. It does go both ways though. Faerlina has a higher alliance population for horde, those servers are a minority though.

I don't know what mouth- breathing developer designed the arcane rotation or why they let such a boring and simple playstyle remain as strong as it did for so long. Slow was fun but not a lot of use in DPS races, and mana was such a big deal as arcane that it was rarely useful to blow mana unless it was the Champions fight in TOTC or something.
---
Can always do brd/lbrs/scholo!  Or I guess DM will be out at that time as well

Because the itemization in this game is out of whack. Of healing and Wrath items are everywhere and basically the only suffix that drops.

So do they rely on their pet for princess, or do you just run around like a mad man (can't imagine the latter, since hunters need cheetah for that to even work)

What WoW classic Reddit does the OP browse and where can I view it because frankly that sounds like a more interesting shitshow than 90% of what goes on here.
---
I don't think I've ever really seen a thread raging at Alliance or Horde on this sub. Sure have never seen people whine for mods to censor anything. The most I see are a few idiots that just whine and shit about the place, but that's kinda to be expected on the internet.
---
We wiped in Cath today 4x because the hunter was pulling or after I pulled, pulling double mobs to hurry us up. The group moaned I didn't hold aggro when we had 4 mobs on us. I was even using chillibreath and oil of immolations to help. Not sure how I remained chill af tbh.

glad to see mods taking reports seriously. absolute dogshit moderation, just like every other subreddit

Honestly, unless they are doing saps, rogues barely have a reason to stealth in dungeons anyway.  Ambush is gonna pull a lot of threat, they might as well just run up with the rest of the melee and open with sinister strike or backstab.
---
I went looking yesterday, they don't exist outside of a meter that requires everyone to have it installed.

Why? It doesn‚Äôt have a particularly annoying sound to it. Although, I guess if you are constantly doing it, I can see how that would get annoying

Hi. First off, you're not banned. Second - even if you were, you would be able to view the subreddit just fine. Reddit has been having a lot of errors the last few hours, so it may be related to that.

All of these people, and no one really wanted the game. They just thought they did. This sure showed them.
---
Thank you. I am new and sometimes veteran players can be really toxic, usually a friendly reminder will fix everything.
---
Sometimes if I feel like our group is over leveled for a dungeon I tend to fuck around a little. I'll throw in some Dps on top of healing because mana isnt an issue and we are dominating all the pulls. I never realized how much this upsets some people.
---
Also didn't know that about power word shield! I will often put it on my tank before they pull and I've never gotten complaints! I use it all the damn time! No more using it on warriors unless they are about to die
---
That power word shield really helps me relax while healing since I dont have to worry you'll take a big hit and die during my cast time. I try to use my big heal a lot as its the most cost effective. I'll try using flash heal more and phase out my PW shield.

Ok, I finally figured it out.  Initially, I uninstalled the Realtek High Definition Audio driver, and this resolved the problem only temporarily.  Windows has a nasty habit of wanting to automatically reinstall and default to that driver, even though there is a perfectly good default driver, so this option is, in the long run, not viable.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The second (and permanent) solution I found was to go into the core files of the Realtek driver.  For me, this was located at C:\\Program Files\\Realtek\\Audio\\HDA.  If you find the files here, go to the next paragraph.  If you can't find the files at this location, you can find your particular files' locations by right clicking the desktop start button, clicking Device Manager, going to Sound, video and game controllers, right clicking Realtek High Definition Audio, clicking Properties, going to the Driver tab, and clicking Driver details.  This will show a list of files in a Realtek folder on your hard drive.  Ignore the System 32 files and navigate to the corresponding Realtek location.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of any shortcuts to the Realtek control panel, but if you know of any such shortcut, feel free to use it.
---
Once you have the location, open "RtkNGUI64."  This will open the Realtek HD Audio Manager.  At the very top, you will see options for your sound devices.  Pick the troublesome one and go to the Speaker Configuration tab.  The  particular configuration that permanently resolved the issue was:
---
5.1 Speaker (on the dropdown menu)
---
Subwoofer check box checked
---
Front left and right check box checked
---
All other check boxes unchecked
---
You may have to play around more with the settings to find what works for you.  Let me know if this works.
---
is there a community for those of us who only played horde for the last 15 years and switched to alliance when classic hit?
---
^(asking for a friend)
---
Grobb Mob !!!
---
Those screens always tell the driver not to get distracted by it and pay attention to the road but damn I wish my car could do that
---
i found it possible to mainly use arcane blast in TBC. it just takes a lot of mana, and every consumable cooldown you can have. it also required perfectly timing your mana pool with evocation. you had to switch between arcane missiles and arcane blast to keep your mana up. and investing in intellect / spirit more than +spell damage.
---
Thanks
---
You need twice as many healers as tanks in raids, and warrior is the most popular class in the game.
---
If you want a raid spot fast, you heal. Everyone who raids knows this, tank spots are fought over.
---
Wait...so only good players play horde? My server must be an anomaly.
---
Greetings from Xaltorin, the Undying
---
Both factions do, it's just the nature of being in a party and having the advantage.
---
That said though, the only time I die from horde is from 2+v1s, I rarely see 1v1s happen.
---
I‚Äôve done 200 runs of sm as a rogue, tapping chests and hitting bosses and I‚Äôve got 750g at level 56. I‚Äôve probably wasted 200g on items and respecs while leveling even so I‚Äôm impressed you did it without farming.

Are you truly so retarded that you can't see the difference between ninja'ing loot, and needing a BiS item???

Dispelling Soul Link off the pet, either with a spell or Serenity, is private server malarkey. It was patched out in 1.9 and already confirmed in Blue Post [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887) that you cannot dispel it.

Sythe, that's prices if your selling. If your buying it's overpriced a bit. It was worth alot more in first week, but alot of 60s are getting their epic mount now plus layering dungeons etc
---
Read my other comment. Only did that bc they had just done it to me. 2v1 and 3/4 levels higher. Yes that is why /spit exists.
---
Well, I answered your questions but you want to insist I'm just power tripping. So if you have anything else, I'll be off.
---
Am a horde, can confirm alliance starting zones are way better than horde ones.
---
Or, you know, follow the flow of the thread and how we were comparing racials.  But you do you man.
---
Not good enough? We'll make our own subreddit! With blackjack and hookers! In fact, forget the subreddit!
---
I first, and last, played Wow around 2010 as a human warrior - i always chose melee classes back then because I was a noob, and though I‚Äôm still a noob I never pick warrior in anything anymore. I‚Äôve played as a rogue a lot of times since in other games but a bit bored of that too. Anyway, I‚Äôve been playing as a hunter in Classic and am loving it. I‚Äôve gone a marksmanship build, and I really like having my pet to tank and hanging back from afar. I play 99% solo PVE questing and exploring and the other 1% is with my brother (questing and some dungeons), I have real trouble playing with strangers online so I rarely group. We have been talking about which characters to make next. Since we went horde this time, we want to choose alliance next. I am interested in almost every class, except warrior and rogue for now, and also want to avoid mage coz that‚Äôs what my brother picked. Druid seems the most fun to me, and most likely my choice though I‚Äôm not sure about spec. Warlock interested me, but seemed too much like a mage x hunter and didn‚Äôt want too much of the same again and I want a fresh experience next time around. I also had some interest in a healing class or spec but as a solo player I expect this will probably be too difficult. Paladin seemed like it might fit the bill but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll feel too much like warrior. 
---
Any suggestions?
---
Horde are grumpy because of their boring af capital cities and low level zones.
---
Reported.
---
Look at retail. Do you trust Blizzard to execute on Classic+ in a way that stays true to the original experience?
---
I wholeheartedly agree. Wailing caverns is ass.
---
I was trying to fish near a few tribes of murlocs, when one randomly attacked me. I didn't want to harm this guy, but I knew if I left him alone he'd kill me, and I couldn't risk him aggroing more murlocs to me through my inaction.
---
So, I was forced to kill him. Upon his slaying, I looted one Murloc Eye from his corpse. I decided that was my character extracting a petty vengeance for the inconvenience of being attacked whilst fishing. I only wish they could be used as lures.
---
Oh man the mud hut part of your comment made me laugh. I play on  a normal server so I play a human pally when I get tired of the horde color palette. 
---
It is really crazy how different their zones are.
---
Horde scum, for the Alliance!
---
Emma will probably want to know that Disc is not really a thing, in Classic it's Holy or Holy with Power Infusion.
---
Yeah that the eyepatch looks way better on trolls which is so much more important lol.
---
As a warrior it is incredibly easy to get in a group for LBRS as a tank even if you are fury or arms. I recommend spending nearly all of your time there since many of your preraid bis can be gotten there for both dps and tank. You can also do quest runs of BRD for exp and attunment. Once you get to 57/8 you‚Äôll want to start the Ony attunment as well as complete the quest line that ends with ‚ÄúIn Dreams‚Äù that is on the western side of EPL. That quest line gives you a very good neck for DPS and has a lot of exp. Also at 57/8 you‚Äôre able to do stratholme and scholo for quests and gear farm as many pieces there are pre raid bis as well. I had 14 of my preraid BiS pieces before even hitting 60 by doing this and it saves a ton of time on things you would‚Äôve had to do anyway but also get exp from.

Where's our horde only classic wow subreddit
---
Typical for the guy whose faction is three races of white people
---
Any pet will attack, hunter or warlock.
---
Yea, but centaurs are 1) mean to our bovine bros and 2) the offspring of that thing in Maraudon, so I think Horde pretty much gets a pass on that front.
---
says "waffels"
---
When you're having a raid at 7 and a baby at 11!!

My main in retail has been a shaman since BC (since I'm alliance) and so it was sad to be unable to roll a shaman again. However I now have the chance to properly try druid which I always wanted to, so there's that!
---
How do you zoom out that far? Makes for a great screenshot
---
That is the thing: The server has a higher Horde population but no matter where I go (contested zones) It is almost always filled with the Alliance.
---
THE JANNIES DO IT FOR FREE!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA

oh hey it's big boy himself.
---
Problem?
---
No such things as a fire mage in MC.
---
That was awesome. Made me want to resub and get in on the Vanilla community shenanigans.
---
Life has a way of making you believe ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason‚Äù. I was in university for Engineering, but after failing out, I got heavy into Magic the Gathering, met someone with ambitions to start an IT company. I helped him during my abundance of free time once he got it off the ground and started my career in IT. Been cruising ever since. 
---
The addiction is definitely back, but with a wife and responsibilities, I‚Äôve been able to curb it. All is well.

Been taking it easy this time around. Currently level 37 warrior

They are for hunters who everyone will deny melee weapons for months.
---
Great screenshot, 11/10
---
It was indeed against blizzards ToS during vanilla so they should be banned
---
Lol your clearly missing the point. Your pointing the focus the wrong way. Everyone has a right to point out the truth. He's using the people who do to drive idiots who don't get it to his "content".
---
The problem isn't me pointing out the issue, the problem is the blind masses that can't pull their heads out of their asses. That doesn't mean I'm going to quit trying, even if fools like you want to try and skirt the blame. Open your eyes.
---
I'm horde though.  want a screenshot? I've played Warcraft since the 90s and just love the lore.
---
Yup, I still do all my addons this way, ‚Äúmanually‚Äù. Its officially begun, I‚Äôve started my transition into my father and an old grouchy man who hates change.
---
Can you no longer character transfer? Friends moved over but I wasn't really sure if I wanted too. Now I don't see the option anymore.
---
There doesn't have to be a concrete agreement, simply a constructive discussion between players of the same game. Apparently that's too much to ask.
---
If they really did a good carving of classic+ like OSRS did goblins would be an awesome neutral race. They're so prominent in the world in vanilla compared to Draenei, blood elves or pandas
---
I'm out of the loop here...
---
Lmao you better take a break fool

Its an accurate stereotype. Its well known in the gaming community.

Or make a way to teleport inside to preserve the mystery on the outside :)
---
Horde might as well not even have a base in Desolace, it's like a whole zone's distance away from everything else and makes you wade through a field of hostile mobs to get to/from it.
---
This is really well written, I wouldn't mind reading your thoughts on opening vs other classes.
---
This isn't a meme, if you're starting fishing, this is the best place to go until about 100.
---
My, you're a tall one!
---
Shamans often dominate the DPS charts until the later levels. And they are able to heal while doing damage easily. Paladins can heal/dps too, but not the way Shamans can.  
---
Paladins are a fucking pain in the ass to level.
---
Sigh :(
---
It said it ended on the 16th
---
That's great and all, but you're kinda forgetting the whole second and third wars
---
Just awesome
---
Haha I'm kidding. I'm not actually going to play.
---
My bad the horde
---
but we don‚Äôt actually match them into battle anymore though. Haven‚Äôt you seen The Patriot? the drummers were on the front lines.
---
As a Priest wanting to do only this quest I recruited 4 others, a tank, hunter, and mage, to "escort" me up to the top. Felt a bit bad leaving after we got to the egg but I did tell them I had only one quest and wouldn't stay for long.
---
Where are these cloth turn ins? Ive done the 60 silk and wool to the troll in orgrimmar but it seemed to be a one time thing? Unless it resets?
---
Old rogue main, druid now in classic. Now, I was not and still am not (I have my good days and bad days) a great pvper but the only way I ever beat mages without help was if I hit some lucky, key crits. I don't have AS much trouble with mages on the druid, but unless I get a little lucky I still eat chalk against them lol.
---
I killed a guy like this in Blasted Lands last night. Everyone was super peaceful before that but within about half an hour we had a 5 man Horde group and a 5 man alliance group warring over half the zone.
---
This is wrong in cata they staggered the jump to make it impossible to miss unless ur just running the wrong way.
---
In vanilla it is like this ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî     ______

In cata it is like this ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî______

Haven‚Äôt seen it at all. I‚Äôm convinced the people who say this don‚Äôt watch him. I‚Äôd love to see a clip. Every time I watch his stream he‚Äôs chilling. Lately he‚Äôs been handling guild drama and it‚Äôs just fun. He won‚Äôt get mad at anyone, just ‚Äúwhy did you do this‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre fitting in‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have a lot of people messaging me about you‚Äù.

Yeah it was a terrible time for quelthalas. By the events of the Third War their population has perished and Sylvanas coming in to their aid was a god send to them. I would hate sylvanas even more if she DIDNtlT reach put to the eleves in the burning crusade. The alliance at this time was equally devastated but there were many human kingdoms as opposed to the One in quelthalas that high elves had.
---
&gt; Or, you know, the fact that "post malone" didn't exist when Vanilla was released. 
---
So you're tellin me post malone actually got his name from WoW.
---
What's a leak? It's 2004
---
Could have been an upgrade, but I also had a Hunter and a Mage need roll this back to back in SM last night.
---
I think they are needing blues to vendor for the 1 gold and justifying it since SM runs are so short in comparison to other dungeons.
---
The biggest difference I've noticed between Horde and Alliance was age. 
---
Not sure why, but every guild I've been in since 2004 with the Alliance has been filled with a much younger roster than on the Horde.
---
The last one is funny
---
The rest are unfunny or okay
---
Thanks for the critique, I'll keep mindless trash talking to a minimum. As for keybinds, I haven't quite figured out where to put my Charges just yet, wanted to wait till I had a few more gadgets and consumables to see where it would feel comfortable. Anything else stand out that you think I should improve on?
---
Man if you‚Äôre having trouble at level 6 you‚Äôre either going to have to change your attitude about the game, or quit. May sound harsh, but Jesus man... level 6!?
---
&gt;Sure. How does that invalidate what I said? He cheap shots to open, gouges when he blinks, and then what? Then it's over? What's over? The fight literally just started.
---
Uh... you kidney the mage because the gouge gives you time to walk over to him.
---
If he ice blocks, then you re-stealth, and re-open on him doing the same thing, and now he has to deal with it again except without ice block. Sprint + Vanish up vs no ice block, he should never get you off of him.
---
If he ice blocks just to break kidney and immediately cancels, you have vanish for frost nova so you should now be on him and the mage should be unable to cast anything with a cast bar without getting kicked barring frostbite procs, which the mage can only get via ice armor or cone of cold.
---
It's cool that these guys don't know the mage vs rogue matchup, it's world pvp after all.  There's no expectation of skill here.  It's pretty cool that these fights happen.
---
But is this an example of good play from the mage...?  I mean... if you consider "knows what his abilities do" ... good play.  But on a technical level, neither of these players know how to fight eachother.
---
The horde were never the villains unless you wanted them to be. The Warcraft series has always been orcs vs humans and you could play either side.
---
Retail subs and classic subs are not separate.
---
Actually no, I avoid PvP. It's not something I find fun. I've just played WoW enough to be aware that these things are part of the game and acknowledge them instead of cry about it.
---
That's true, it's extremely questionable whether they're even capable anymore of creating anything that would be a high-quality and appropriate addition to the Classic game.  No one could say for sure, but it definitely isn't very promising.  
---
That being said, the idea of using it to shape retail has some problems.  On the face of it, it seems the obvious thing to do.  Classic has already been hugely successful, so take notes and do more of that going forward, right?  But no, probably not so easy.  A lot of the decisions that people say "killed" WoW are DEEPLY set into the game now, such as flying, lfg, raid difficulties, isolated continents, etc.  The general "easy-fication" of WoW is not so easy at all to undo, in fact it's probably impossible because some significant part of that current player base probably wants and expects all of those things, and will leave otherwise.  It's actually a lot easier to take the route of starting fresh so that everyone knows what they're signing up for.
---
Yassss

Happy cake day!!!

Whatever you say, bigot.

Because your "need" is just being dictated by greed
---
Miss that shit, honestly.
---
Well, there's a difference on PVP servers if you like ganking more than BG queue times I guess.
---
Would you rather be performing calculations and determining your chance to crit instead of enjoying the game and having fun every now and then?
---
I would venture to say that most of the 20+ year olds would like to actually relax when they play the game than be serious all the time.
---
Hail! Long live Cairn Bloodhoof! - Lothlorien
---
Patience of people rolling on full servers rewarded
---
I did the same too. Kaelthas had his own tragic story in the RTS and I understand why he went with illidan but in warcraft 3 they never showed the side of Silvermoon that was left to fend for themselves. The heritage story of blood elves shows you exactly what they went through while kaelthas was away.
---
Yeah, so the population of horde across ALL server (which you brought up) is irrelevant. Because a Server with a high Horde population is unaffected by servers with a higher alliance population. Because someone playing on Faerlina (higher Alliance population)  cant see people from Herod (higher horde population). Right now it just sounds like you're making an excuse for the alliance being bad at world PvP by saying that horde have a total higher population. When the only time that makes a difference are on the individual servers that have that imbalance.
---
Wow. I was so confused by the comments until i saw there was audio.
---
I used to solo princess as a resto druid, just stay max range, run while she's mobile and dps when she stops to do her earthquake ability.

But it IS low effort if it criticizes Horde.
---
Edit: screw Alliance
---
I almost forgot non pvp servers exist
---
I love this so much and I love you xD
---
Because slower weapons generally have higher min/max damage and since stuff like mortal strike/overpower/whirlwind base their damage off your weapon damage and do not account for speed and are instant use abilities it's always better to have a slower weapon since slower weapons compensate for their speed by having higher damage.
---
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm just concerned they won't get around to fixing it for a while.
---
You make me sick with your sympathy for their kind. They are savages. One of the few things horde and alliance can agree on is that murlocs are not civilized and should be killed on sight.
---
Deadmines
---
Damn, we Horde sure do excrete a lot of liquids.
---
At worst it's a druid bear item i guess. But it's a meme
---
That's a bit uncalled for.
---
Good god man mages have so many redundancies against warriors plz stop I'm over it.   If you think the shit you're saying you're bad at pvp and think everyone else is as bad as you. Bye
---
&gt;can anyone confirm fire water is in the game
---
Definitely is, I picked one up yesterday.
---
Ok for some reason I thought you were in a submarine at first
---
I'm none of those things. I'm gen y.
---
That isn‚Äôt talking about PVP. Talking about PVP is hey, some alliance are near by. What you‚Äôve quoted is whining.
---
Does it really matter?
---
There are a couple of tricks to fighting warriors as a mage and if you fuck them up you‚Äôre guaranteed dead (like blinking before the intercept). Combine that with AoE spec‚Äôd mages who rolled because they heard mages are OP it‚Äôs not surprising you can roll over them.
---
Eh I wouldnt worry about it. Find a guild that appreciates common sense
---
i feel like these rp style stories are the equivalent of homoerotic stories in sports subreddits. 
---
by the way, you can any low level green boe for basically vendor price, and its worth it to increase leveling speed, esp as a warrior
---
&gt;camping alliance in SM is a thing
---
Alliance could easily camp gnomer. Horde get a damn teleport to a dungeon. Fuck that. I camp that teleport and kill any horde as soon as they come though. Make their asses run cross country like we have to do for SM.
---
Good riddance i say.
---
That specs are more important than classes nowadays in retail is one thing, but I think to say that the old talent tree had more meaningful choices than today's is just plain rosetinted goggles. With the retail talents basically every tier has a meaningful choice that can have a drastic impact or at least makes a tangible difference. And these choices are more balanced than anything in vanilla ever was. (Although of course min/maxers figure out the one that's 0.1% more DPS wherever it's possible and take mostly that)

My cousin‚Äôs roommate in medical school got kicked out for failing due to a Civ 3 addiction.  The guy is a family friend and eventually he finished medical school but had to drop out of his residency program because civ 4 came out.  He‚Äôs eventually became a doctor in his 40s

Awesome community

Anyone know where I can find info on exactly how much I will use each of my skills as a hunter on average? I want to give the best hotkey priority to each ability from the start.

Thanks for sharing!

i rerolled twice because i didn't like my creation choices, once at 14 and once at 25. trust me!! you'll be better off rerolling now than getting further along.

...melee? Oh man you're in for some disappointment.
---
At least thia thread hasnt been deleted.
---
Been playing wow since 2007. Mostly alliance. In my experience alliance had a more mature player base then horde. This is just my experience. The meme is the opposite.
---
I just finished the disks questline the other day and, having been away for the game for a long while, I was surprised to learn that nothing really ever came of it. That mystery has intrigued me for a long time!
---
The most likely reaction is to think they‚Äôre a troll only there to ruin the fun, since this is such a common player type.
---
Are there numbers to support this? I play on skeram - and it really seems like a fairly even split a lot of the time. Granted I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs, maybe it‚Äôs just sort of even for the people who are leveling slightly faster and in these zones??  
---
I‚Äôve really been wondering about this.. could just be my perception - but I dunno, I see allis basically just as often as horde - and when I get in fights it‚Äôs basically always either 1v1, or a couple allis against me.
---
Don't really agree with this - Could apply the same logic to any loot, 1G is 1G.......
---
  
---
To me, as far as needing goes - someone actually wearing the thing trumps someone who wants to sell the thing.
---
Yeah, I'm kinda hoping they release a few more of the heritage quests soon, in case that level boost from hitting 60 in classic turns out to be true. Of the other available ones, only the Tauren really interests me. Never been big on either Gnomes or Dwarves.
---
Azeroth is flat, but it does have another side according to blizzard
---
?
---
dear party leader, don‚Äôt get annoyed at me for being a fire mage that doesn‚Äôt aoe everything unless specifically asked. and don‚Äôt be annoyed if i refuse to attack more than one target at a time if im the only aoe class in the group, unless you are okay with drinking between pulls (no one seems to be in classic). and don‚Äôt be annoyed when i use cc when you pull 6 things at once.
---
It's hilarious because I tell you you're confused and you still mindlessly post your link.   They're being banned for exploiting a bug to let them farm dungeon bosses over and over. Like I said you're confused plz think with your head.
---
Thanks! That‚Äôs the build I‚Äôm seeing everywhere. Was hoping there was a more healer feral
---
Combo. Thanks again!

I have never done a ‚ÄúRP event‚Äù but I always play on RP servers for this reason. The other week I sat down at the inn in Tanaris and emote interacted with a horde player for a while and then watched another table get into a fight.

Send the 60 mail every day that says:  "Good job you special snowflake!"

Level 24 warrior and I'm still terrified of tanking. I don't know if it's the social anxiety in me or what, but last time I did Deadmines it wasn't really fun.

They sound like fucking 12 year olds lmao.
---
I've never wanted to punch someone in the face I've never known or interacted with, but my god I'd love to punch that guy in the face for your sake lol
---
Darnassus is the best starting zone in the game.
---
When the rng hits it really hits huh, killed 100+ of this one mob to get a quest item, dropped a blue then the kill after got the quest item. Shits fun
---
Honestly, if I pulled something and no one else was (seemingly) around, I would assume it just bugged and kill it anyway.  
---
This strategy is brilliant
---
just run in circles and DoT her. no pet out.
---
You need demonic sacrifice for 3%hp every 4 seconds, and minor speed on boots. that's all.
---
Barrens chat is absolutely at its best during non peak hours

There‚Äôs Tauren furry suits?

Horde will always be cowardly scum.
---
The problem is that right now there aren't any twinks.  
---
Your target market is either people that will use it right away (who won't have 60G) or people who want to buy cheap and hold it (who either won't gave 60G or won't want to pay that much, since they know it's not worth that much right now).
---
60G is insane right now. 
---
I'm speaking from experience...I got a level 28 twink neck piece that'll be worth 50-60G in 6 months, it's only worth maybe 5-10 right now at most.
---
Does being dazed do anything besides slow movement speed?
---
You get 100% for a 3.5 second cast and it scales down based on cast speed. Wasn‚Äôt the main focus of the video and plan to make a separate video on the mechanic because it‚Äôs somewhat complicated. This is intended for new or returning players.
---
Glad this post was able to demonstrate perfectly the 50/50 divide in the community and spark some constructive discussion. I hope with time we can move past this ridiculous ignorance and become a more cohesive community. It is the internet though.

Peace

NE Druid here.. we're only friends in Moonglade.

so why are you down voting me dude?  nobody is telling you that you have to set your hearth or hub in TB.  I just agreed with the dude and said that TB was the better option.

I think you need to farm in one of your questing zones or pop into SM for a bit

I am 36 and in the same predicatment.. i finished all of hillsbrand/araltec/arathi/thousand needles/etc. in terms of quests.  Apparently all I have left is STV and Desolace which everyone is advising me against.
---
Im getting like 30% exp per SM run so I'm gonna keep doing that until 38.
---
Nice! Good ol pvp
---
Exactly
---
Rolled to Earthfury from Herod during the first day transfers were available.
---
At first, it was grim. By the time the second server transfer was opened it's become a very good server (much much better than Herod was). Now, it's a medium pop server with an active community, rivalries, etc. It's the prototypical vanilla wow server imo, and this is coming from somebody who actually played vanilla on Skullcrusher. 
---
I'm very happy that I switched now, but was hesitant at first. Now the server is basically 55-45 balanced in favor of horde.
---
yup!  I was also out of the area fast than them.
---
For the most part that's the right move. We are usually going to just feign the mobs off if it gets too bad
---
Thanks for the input I am having fun so I‚Äôll probably continue. What would you suggest for a competitive class? I like pvm but I really play for pvp.
---
Yeah, if only we could all have fake jobs. 
---
Must be nice.
---
I use pet attack and defensive and neutral the most, defensive and neutral spam to recal, there is probably a hotkey for pet recall I just haven‚Äôt found it, and spamming defensive and neutral calls it‚Äôs back. I have all the pet abilities on auto cast and just toggle them.
---
As a warrior solo leveling I‚Äôm attacking you on sight - immediately. After dying to you, I will Rez find you and attack you again. And then again. After you die 3-4 times were even
---
Easy. I‚Äôm a Ret Paladin.
---
So... you did a dungeon with master looter on?
---
Yeah honestly for all the 'alliance lul' posts making it seem like Horde is the cool alternative lifestyle, the population numbers and the twitch streamers dictate otherwise.
---
IDC either way, but the bandwagon is *definitely* on the horde side.

Never had a queue on blowmax

Your way of using life tap is the smart use of life tap and I don't have any complaints about it. However, a fair share of locks that I have grouped with are simply life taping away without consideration, expecting the healer to top of their health. Preferably just as I'm about to pull.

Hahah, and horde doesn't do the same even though they have a default advantage of player imbalance? Typical horde
---
Think i did around 35~ to see 1 MH and about 5 offhands however no shoulders yet
---
Try pvping Alliance side
---
Melee weapons on Hunters are stat sticks and nothing else.
---
It's like my panic mode goes off every time someone else pulls a mob. It used to be so easy, but now it seems like someone grabs an elite every time I pull, even after spamming sunder and demo shout. I'm worried that I'd be reprimanded or yelled at or something, and I've heard horror stories about people making a name for themselves for being assholes.
---
What you're explaining is Alliance behavior on my server.
---
A 1v1 battle to the death is about as rare as it comes.

Thank them for letting you know how toxic they are and find a better guild.

I am one of such Brazilians, I'd rather play in US servers because I just find it easier to find good pugs (regardless of trolling, Brazilian players are very... "casual"). I believe we are in the vast minority though as every single other Brazilian I know - either from real life or from gaming communities - plays in Brazilian servers.
---
Yep. Ironically they call Alliance the bandwagon when retail and classic clearly show different.
---
You should write books man. That was some awesome story telling.

You are under no obligation to congratulate anyone. They should be kissing YOUR ass for being a part of their guild, not the other way around. If typing "gratz" is mandatory shit for those guys, just imagine the nitpicky horseshit they are gonna put you through during raiding. Be glad you got out sooner rather than later
---
Why would you need opposite faction characters to be on the same server?
---
I would ask you, do you want your to be free from healing dungeons?
---
If you roll a class that *can* heal, you may end up in that role when needed to fill it.
---
If you go mage you can have big numbers, mobility, and you're certain to not be healing
---
I'm totally sober. It's not my fault you cant justify your own shitty point.
---
In terms of the world , dungeons, and raids, retail is honestly great. The problems are the shitty systems tagged onto it like world quests, caches, and group/lfr. So long as they keep that trash out yes, I do trust them. The problem is trusting then to keep the systems out.

Interesting. This sort of parallels the rise of Indian internet infrastructure in the 2010s, and the related stereotypes that have emerged. I wonder if something similar happens with Indian communities on Asian servers.
---
Ok nice evidence.
---
Which is funny because the stereotype was the opposite.
---
You almost feel like your no lifing meant something :)
---
So any type of humor you don't like is "polluting" the guild chat?
---
I didn't realize you spoke for the entirety of the WoW playerbase in regards to their sense of humor.
---
So undead but for every class instead of just priests?
---
Am hunter: I chuck my pet on the dmg casters (especially when the tank doesn't LoS or losing is difficult) and focus them down haaard, can't block spells and pet is a tanky mother fucker

Does a druid get anything?

The percent of people multi boxing is so small that there's no possible way sub money is a factor. People who say that are children with no understanding of the real world. We're talking a fraction of a percent out of millions of subs. Thats fucking retarded logic.

It's not half as bad as people make it out to be, it's just SUPER slow early but picks up quite quickly.
---
I think how slow they are early really puts a lot of people off tbf
---
Thousands of videos and hundreds of guides out there. Feel free to literally look at the capability of the class.
---
Or just reroll Hunter and kill literally anyone 30-40 yards away.
---
Yea I‚Äôm in that guild. Played with pox and never got the impression he was an officer. Got any evidence to prove he isn‚Äôt? Considering that‚Äôs your point that I‚Äôm concerned about.
---
I fished up a battered trunk, locked at 250 LP skill. Paid a rogue 1 gold to open it, wanted to get that sweet treasure. 
---
1 rugged leather.
---
&gt; Yeah, so the population of horde across ALL server (which you brought up) is irrelevant.
---
When talking about the WoW player population as a whole you should use the aggregated data for that whole.  I am well aware that there are some specific realms where this is not an issue and that this is not the experience for everyone.
---
I'll get more specific with my wording so this all makes sense for you:
---
On average, Horde have a 25% population advantage in world-pvp scenarios. On average, Horde faction players should have no issues dominating world PVP because on average they have a huge advantage.  
---
&gt; When the only time that makes a difference are on the individual servers that have that imbalance.
---
And right now "the only time that makes a difference" is on 19 of the 26 US PVP realms, or 73% of the time.
---
So kind of actually really relevant for the vast majority of players, in fact.
---
they are just trying to get their birth rates up
---
LMAO they sound like pompous nerds, blast that shit to the other guild people I wouldn‚Äôt want to play with lame asses like that
---
I wanted to do this as well in reverse, we did Alliance in retail and on elysium. 
---
Nope, one dude just won't level anything that isn't a fucking paladin, so insert here we go again meme.
---
Whoosh
---

Yeah. I ended up moving to the PvE server since they were pretty much the only one still playing. Ended up liking the character I made there more than the one on my PvP server so I'm just gonna try and ride it out until they decide to let us buy server transfers, whenever that might be, and then I'll just move back if I can.
---
I don't see the problem. Seems reasonable that if you're sitting there killing dozens of guys that you would get plenty of EXP for it
---
Their lungs are definitely present otherwise being able to drown would make no sense. And while on the subject of znation apparently viagra effects zombies quite well too
---
Not that bad really depending on class besides unless your rank 10 or higher pve gear is the best pvp gear. There is no resil. Mage hitting you with a 6k pyro will kill you no matter what your racial is
---
Here is a build you could try. You give up damage and repentance but gain a lot in the way of buffs for both PvP and PvE. Playstyle doesn't change, but getting to use Blessing of Protection and Bleeding of Freedom that much more often is worth way more in group PvP than the damage you give up. Plus Divine Favour is a huge cooldown for all parts of the game 
---
In PvE you have illumuination, and improve BoM and BoW, which is really the main thing a raid is looking for in their pally healers unless you're the designated BoK and BoSanc bot.

He wiped, got corpse camped, took rez sickness to try and escape, got corpse camped even harder, formed like 8 more raids and wiped again, then went to SW and demanded free gold from his followers.

This exactly. I'd bet they lost over half from the WotLK/Cata peak, but I'd be surprised if they even dropped under 4 million.

I rolled horde as a 14 year old because i had played WC3 and thrall's horde, rexxar, forsaken, belves were all awesome characters. Alliance just have nelves and Jaina who is the Skylar of the series
---
Not sure what drives a person to play a human in a cartoony fantasy game
---
What server and guild?
---
eh? its a rogue dagger for sure, there's a few good weapons around that level. Its also level 21, so doesn't hold any long-term value from twinking. You might be able to make a gold or two off it, from somebody leveling an AGI alt, but its nothing tremendous
---
&gt; calling people children 
---
&gt; using the word retarded like you're in second grade

It does not take 3 hours at all. Or rather, it never has for me.

Also, if you can grind 3-5 levels in 3 hours from 17-22, I will pay to see that.

Super nice especially since a pvp death doesn't lower durability

I was just talking shit but in all seriousness it‚Äôs not appealing to be that vulgar. Just clean it up and maybe talk more shit in a more entertaining way lol

&gt;People who picked horde: "No way in hell am I ever rolling fucking alliance, fuck that shit. Im rolling horde no matter what"
---
I, uh, I'm one of those. I tried playing alliance with some friends but it's just not as fun to me. I dunno. People didnt seem as friendly but I was Horde from vanilla up to the wotlk so I'm totally biased. I literally stopped playing with friends because I like the Horde so much.
---
That‚Äôs about the right pace!  47 years old and in IT here and have a 41 Warrior and a few alts in the low teens.  That‚Äôs as much time as I can muster.

Not sure if I already posted it in here or not...

I picked up up a i7 powered ThinkPad t450s with 12gb of ram and a ssd from ebay for 320$. Runs classic at 720p and low settings without issue. Not sure if that's in your realm or not but when I'm not at my desk on my main pc the 40-60fps this gets me is perfect!

---
Why is barrens chat absolutely bananas?
---
Yes, yes it is :)
---
As someone who is often shoehorned into the healer role here's a tip for some warriors out there. 
---
Not every pull has to be a million guys with mad aoe dps, it's often faster to just pull a few at a time and keep going rather then stop every minute to drink.
---
Also please equip a shield when we get a few extra. My mana pool is not limitless. That extra damage you take adds up fast.
---
Honestly it's not a race. This is a pub dungeon run. Not a thirty five dozen pro hax cleave group.
---
I am alliance on Kirtonos. It is tough. Unless you have a group to quest with, you are constantly getting ganked. I am not bitching. I love PvP, but the imbalance does suck most of the time.
---
Not saying I'm the best rogue in the world but I've played at 2.2k rating in most expacs, including private servers/Arena Tournament, and have more HKs and time played over the years than I care to admit to myself.
---
The world of roguecraft series, while certainly entertaining and one of my favs, was made during a different patch. Pre 1.12.

That said I'm new to vanilla so I'm hoping I'll get the hang of things. Just wanted to make sure it's just me and that rogues arent bad at 60.

A comment from another user that I am going to throw out there.  Credit to /u/subbywubby.
---
&gt; dal rends (1% crit 50 ap) is currently not pre-Raid bis for hunters because there are no agility weapon enchants in P 1
---
&gt; the actual bis weapon is peacemaker (1% crit 56 ap) from Magistrate Barthilas in Stratholme.
---
&gt; That weapon is much easier to get aswell and can be enchanted with +22 int if you really want to minmax
---
Step one is to message the healer privately.
---
Step two is to make sure they agree not to heal anyone else who grabs aggro.
---
Step three is to say in party chat 'I'm old fashioned. If the healer dies, it's my fault. If I die, it's the healer's fault. And if the DPS dies, it's their fault'.
---
Mark your targets. Keep aggro off the healer. And if the DPS dont do their job of staying under your threat, then they get repair bills.
---
And friend the healer. If you are a tank with a roster of healers, the DPS are completely disposable.
---
Why can't a blizzard GM just go on and kill him? Seems like an oversight not to have a one shot ability.
---
Almost upvoted but saw 69 nice
---
Have a downvote, Alliance Scum
---
FOR THE WHORES!!!
---
true.  I was looking for help dealing with some players as we were outnumbered and those were the types of responses I received.  Nobody wanted to group up.  Nobody was interested in a small scale fight.  Other players had been complaining so I thought it'd be easy to get some people together to fight back, but nobody wanted anything to do with it.  I logged off very disappointed last night.
---
Be a hunter, oof
---
Most servers are very horde sided
---
I mean, 60 is not even hard, spam dungeons and you'll be there in a couple of weeks max.
---
Again I‚Äôd like to see it in a abnormal way. All streamers have a handful of clips where they are assholes. What would convince me is if he acted like an asshole under no emotional duress
---
They wouldn‚Äôt have kicked you for that, am sure that was just the excuse to get rid of you.
---
You said you were tank.
---
Is it possible they didn‚Äôt want you tanking, thus by removing you, they ensured one of theirs get  the spot?
---
am sure there‚Äôs going to be a lot of loot drama in that guild, if they are already using such underhanded tactics to clean out loot competition.

---
I would take a 3rd mage over a 2nd warlock any day of the week though (for SM at least). It makes runs smoother since the melee mobs will be stacked with the casters. You can do catch in 3-4 pulls and priest can actually top the DPS by mind controlling a wizard mob for that hilariously strong arcane explosion.
---
OP likes drama.
---
There's a quest in STV where a goblin asks you to kill a bunch of Trolls and take their tusks so that he can pass them off as tiger fangs and sell them as such.
---
Think about that for a second.
---
Peak classic experience
---
We just did MC with 30, Garr was a huge pain in the arse, some warriors tanking two adds and a resisted banish meant a wipe.
---
You'd have to tweak it a little unless you want every ranged dps to be a warlock.
---
This is the shit you like to hear about our server. Sulfuras is the best. Lmao
---
As you desperately mash Slice and Dice with the GCD rolling
---
That's been explained already.
---
Yeah. Bottomfeeder was nuts before Blizzard killed it.
---
I'd call that out in a heartbeat. 
---
Need if you'll equip, greed if you'll sell... that's the standard.  If anyone deviates from that, we've got a problem.
---
Bye.
---
Not at all. are you serious? Not everyone is an asshole
---
Who are top classic rogues?
---
Wow, how can you be so petty AND have a group of people around you equally petty to support you and your bullshit. 
---
I¬¥m sure you get in a decent guild next time
---
I know poor Azpad can't help it...
---
Absolutely. So of if the tank doesn't mark targets, the safe bet is to attack whatever the tank is attacking. Most of the time the rule of thumb is to kill mobs that heal first, and then mobs that do the most damage next.
---
There's plenty of other ways in the game to make money. Robbing someone of their BiS drop shouldn't be accepted as one
---
Alright I‚Äôve imagined it
---
but nothing gay happened
---
I genuinely don't understand why appareance change would result a backlash. Let's say I made the ugliest dwarf man that you can imagine for fun then realized it physically hurts to play with such a grompy face and I instead wanna be a shinning dwarf woman. How does this affect anyone in the game other than me and how does this ruin any game experience to cause a backlash?
---
Most of the rage you get is from bejng hit, so losing agro only slows you down more. Mark targets as skull, x, moon for the kill order.
---
Tell dps to wait 2 seconds before attacking, giving you time to demo shout, thunder clap, and start tab-target sundering.
---
FOR THE HORDE !
---
Averagejoe here. You're right on the money. Not only am I weeding out the people who can't handle a little sarcasm/irony, I'm also standing out above the endless tide of, "We're a friendly, nontoxic, PVP, Leveling blah blah blah blah" crap. If you like that kinda stuff, awesome! More power to you. If you want something different, hit me up. I'm on Sulfuras [H].

no im still playing,  but not with people who wont kneel
---
trust me you dont want to associate with keyboard warriors like this, honestly the guy helped you dodge a bullet at honestly the perfect time. You'll have no trouble finding another guild to join, just keep running dungeons and doing a good job guilds will seek you out. As for your old GM/officers people like this are really lacking in the self esteem and self worth.  So they go about doing shit like this to "feel important". Unfortunately how amazing WoW is for the common person, it also attracts neckbeards like this who think spending 12+hours a day 7 days a week in a game makes them a super important supreme commando.  Luckily they are easy to avoid as they tend to attract each other and stick in groups, because frankly no one else wants to put up with them.

Skeram is at least 70% horde. I'm level 56 and only twice has a horde player roughly my level, on his own, picked a fight with me. If it's a solo horde they will never attack and try to bro me up with emotes and shit. As soon as another horde player(s) walks by they attack and the others join in.

Just admit that you were wrong or stfu

Funny story, I actually started playing WoW back in 2007 because of a Murloc. I‚Äôve always flipped stuff on eBay as a way to make extra cash and one thing I used to do pretty often was buy ‚Äúlots‚Äù of old games (a ‚Äúlot‚Äù is just a box full of random games sold for cheap), clean them up, and sell them individually for profit. One lot I purchased had an original physical copy of WoW and tucked inside the box was a lottery scratcher-type ticket from Blizzcon 2005 for Murky the Murloc. 
---
I knew nothing about WoW at the time. I actually thought Murky was a playable character and I figured if he came from Blizzcon maybe he was OP and I could kick some ass with him. Obviously I found out I was wrong after installing the game but I still gave it a shot and became hooked within a few days. I ended up redeeming Murky in Wrath and he accompanied me the entire time while I got my first character to level 80 and beat my first Raid. He‚Äôs a rare boi these days but it actually wasn‚Äôt uncommon to see other players with him back then. 
---
I grew pretty attached to the little guy and over the years I‚Äôve collected pretty much every Murloc Pet you can get through gameplay and bought one or two more on eBay just so he could have some friends down in my magic loot bag. He has a permanent slot on one of my action bars and I still break out ol‚Äô Murky all the time, especially when I‚Äôm passing through Org or Dal just to show off. And yeah, I do my best to avoid the ‚Äúslaughter Murlocs‚Äù quests. I couldn‚Äôt do that to my little buddy.

and actually i have a 30 hunter on whitemane and a 43 hunter on pagle. lol. it's my first time playing classic so if i can do it you can do it!!!!
---
ü§î
---
That's good to hear, hes been one of my favs since warcraft 3
---
I have no idea what you are talking about, I've only lost 1v1 when it was a red level or skull and even then I had them hurting. You are doing something wrong
---
Yeah my client has been the same. Been stuck on 6 min for like 30 min now. Too afraid to try to restart client.
---
2 girls at the same time
---
Sounds like they saved you some time. Can you imagine what would happen when they're raiding and an item drops that multiple officers and the GM want? Oh fuck
---
Smooth moves my man
---
On my server there's a guy named Timmy (or some variation), that just yells "Timmmaaaayyyy!" all night.
---
Combustion&gt;Fireblast gachigasm
---
Yea? You hit 60 in 3 days played? 
---
Stream it. Ill legit pay to see it and Im sure so will everyone else since you‚Äôll be shattering records
---
All good didn‚Äôt mean to come off like a dick my bad

Hi, /u/Dragyn476

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d678ja/testing_something/). 
---
This is awesome! Thanks for this man. Really appreciate it. I remember Cushdawg too! I would love some screenshots. Mine were all lost.
---
Go for it bro, hit me with numbers!!! I work in a phone repair store, I use Samsungs/Oppos/Huaweis/iPhones on the daily and by far apple has the most optimised operation system!
---
99 slayer players would like to have a word with you
---
You could simply comment out everything related to ShowNameplate()or whatever the function is called. That'd remove that bug.
---
Also lookup minimumDropChance or something like that and change the value to 1 instead of 0 to fix stuttering issues
---
fuck the alliance
---
It doesn't automate anything.  The software still makes 1 key press do 1 thing on all the clients.   Which is all blizzard asks for.
---
One of my favorite quests.  
---
(Spoiler) That sword at the end  looks so badass - though not very good.
---
They mentioned it as a possibility in the AMA.  More like 99% fan wet dream.
---
&gt; It's proven
---
With no official information available on the topic.  Sounds legit.
---
Better get a character created for that baby. I'm thinking gnome mage with all the drinking they're going to be doing.
---
Appreciate it
---
Having the same issue man. Weird thing is my brother snuck in and he queued 10 minutes after me
---
That's how mage should be. It helps everyone and these douchenozzles who are asshats will be remembered. I really think there are a lot of people who don't realize the importance of community in classic, and it will come back to bite them in the ass once they hit max level.
---
The split dps is real though. Tanks at 0 rage and people want to open up AoE everything and  expect to not get bitched smacked by that elite. It's a bad habit from retail.
---
Asa fellow warlock, I'm jealous.
---
Still looking for tank for Gnomer PST
---
I think you're right about the display being broken. When I entered the queue, it flashed 1300 and a 30 min wait real quick, then popped me around 496 with a 5 min wait. Been waiting for about 20 minutes or so and I'm at 457 now.
---
Mine keeps jumping up and down by 1 or 2 numbers, as well. Guess I'll go make dinner and see where I end up in half an hour.
---
im just mega indecisive
---
He got it wrong. There is an ignore list in game, which you can access just like your friends list. Same window, different tab I believe.
---
Yay rogue, boo alliance
---
I'm glad you liked it! I have some more I've been working on. Keep your eyes peeled for more shitposting.
---
No worries fuckers, just killed all the Alliance at tanaris for that. ;)
---
Orcs look great in almost every set imho
---
Im not sure if youre being sarcastic or not
---
Delete hearthstone or have it on CD and it won't do that, also there's some areas where you are in no zone that allow you to abuse this mechanic, him putting in a ticket for stuck character that's never logged in is why it's sending him to the default zones
---
You don't need to be a diehard RPer to feel like the world is real.
---
Having a character made out of silly putty that can be changed at a whim just doesn't feel "real". Even if you're not RPing, your avatar stops being a character in the world you're playing.
---
Anything that could be changed on a real person (hair/accessories) is fine.
---
I loved BC and flying so much. That grind and finally getting my gyrocopter felt soooooo good. What I didn‚Äôt like was them introducing flying to Azeroth. Segregate that stuff to a continent and I‚Äôm good, though there probably could have been more reasons to go back to Azeroth, most people did end up hanging in shat/outlands.
---
Might have something to do with the aoe phase is my guess. My other guess is elemental weakness.
---
Rogues and warriors dominating atm minus rag, Baron, and maybe sulfuron.
---
And now we just got in. Hopefully you'll be in shortly as well. Very screwy.
---
Sick grind
---
Hes full of shit. It took Jokerd 3 days 20 hours to hit 60 and that‚Äôs with the layer abuse and other shit he was doing. This guy is absolutely lying
---
How about Mooskeeteer?
---
God damn warlock in SM library took more healing than our tank today. I was beyond pissed and oomed constantly.
---
You‚Äôre acting kinda like an Ass to be honest. Reading this whole discussion, you‚Äôre in the wrong a rule was broken discussion generated post or not. Just because the Mod caught this specific post and missed one that was worse does not give you a right to be an entitled brat.
---
A lot of fun, I'm a returning experienced player but I wasn't sure if I was going to "go hard" or just play casually or what.
---
I got completely sucked in and levelled to 60 fast, I've now finally found a raiding guild and lost the roll on 5 of my tier pieces.
---
Finding a group of people without too many kids in it has approximately happened, and I've not had to ignore half my guild for talking about fortnite or whatever.
---
Bonebiter, from the sm quest line, is the one that is better than ww axe. But yeah, Ravager is better though for aoe.
---
I feel like most undead quests end with you randomly killing an npc for no particular reason.
---
Wtf is a job?
---
So a quick update for all, my display when haywire and started showing my number in queue jumping between 20 to 350, and the queue time went from &lt;1m to 800 min. It gave up after awhile and just let me in... pretty confused.
---
When I was leveling my Shaman, I would always queue as a healer because it's easier to find a group fast. If I would get whispers from other shamans looking to be dps, I would usually just answer them politely that I don't want them in because of the gear competition. More often than not they agree on that point, and would look for another group
---
5 40 man's and they couldn't even get passed the bank? Lmaoo
---
There was a time you could type in :
---
/script PetAbandon()
---
to get rid of your demon.  Then when you summoned a new one it would pull a new name from the pool of imp names.  I'm not sure if that trick made it back in for classic or not.
---
Cool - you have great patience!
---
Well even if it was possible, the competition for mobs would still throw a gargantuan spanner in the works.
---
You never saw the post so how can you say it broke a rule.
---
You literally are insulting the mods and accusing them of power tripping when it‚Äôs obvious the post you are referring to was a low effort meme.
---
if youre on EU then it's scheduled maintenance   
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/breaking/21898767
---
bath? Does not compute.
---
I don't join as DPS. Even with the threat spec you still pull insane threat for the average pug and essentially can't use Mind Blast except for kill shots.
---
Mind Blast being essentially a taunt in dungeons is one of the few oversights I wish was corrected right off the get go.
---
Do rogues still need some herbs for blind and other stuff, not so sure, cause dont have a rogue player in my fl list :D
---
Been horde 15 years, cam confirm both myself and many people I play with are all about it.
---
Pretty much, yep. I tried searching for other solutions, but couldn't find any concrete information on what was causing the issue.
---
You don't need to pay rogues a premium to open things, they usually get skill for doing so. If they won't, it's nice to tip, but that's a lot!
---
This.
---
Second this. I am also a holy priest and bear tanks have been the MVP.
---
Because they are volunteering their time dimwit. Unlike you crying over something stupid,
---
This is on MoonGuard isn't it...
---
How much rep did you get from questing?
---
org is always jam packed on whitemane and i can only think "is it like this on every layer?"
---
&gt;  German outfits
---
Excuse me?
---
Some of us dont care about the noobs and just want to lvl fast. Bring someone slow is not an option. Ill play the game my way, you play it yours.
---
Why is it so accepted to be a slow noob, but being a fast lvler who dont want spend time with slow people is bad? This reddit is full of dumb people.
---
Hopefully she is not disturbing you. They get kinda loud during that process.
---
Lmfao he's all those things except good. Knowledgeable? Yes. Good? Absolutely not.
---
They made FOUR of them!? I was so fucking into 1 on Dreamcast.
---
From the sounds if it a hunter would be a great bet it's easy but can be played at a high ceiling with bad ping just got to get a good shot timer and learn to use spells in between auto shots with your ping. You will be needed in raid for good constant dmg. Gear should be good you will always be competing for it in a 40 man raid but it will be again other hunters and some shareable gear but its not the end of the world. Also you can do PvP with the same spec.
---
there is a link to the post in the top comment
---
Lol I know him IRL and this post just buffed his beef hard
---
Yeah same dude IMO the SO's happiness is more important than leveling. It's unlikely we were getting server first anything anyway
---
The queue only goes down when people log out. 
---
The queue can't estimate when the next person will log out. If 20 people log in the next 5 minutes then you'll jump down 20 spaces and the estimate might think it'll take 10 minutes to log in but it might take an hour before anyone else logs out.
---
I did the math on my mage and I would be able to save up to 20g if I didnt pick up non-essentials
---
IMO that goes against the feeling of classic. It removes the utility of Warlock and begins the slippery slope to LFG.
---
Volunteering to fuck up our sub? Yeah no shit people are mad.
---
Don‚Äôt forget a fucking portal to gnomergan, and also the ability to call in reinforcements within seconds of encountering an enemy 10 levels below them.
---
&gt;Since while leveling no one specs for +Hit 
---
Probably because there's almost no way to do this
---
Little late to this, but I'm rolling my first character.  Haven't played since Mists.  Played Rogue and Warlock in Beta, Druid in WotLK and Mists.  Druid looks kinda boring in Classic so intending to go Lock or Rogue.
---
Used to enjoy world pvp, bgs and raiding.  Any reason to go one or the other right now?
---
Exactly. The general ‚Äúthis is bullshit‚Äù complaints are the reason pve realms exist. If you don‚Äôt want to be killed or possibly camped or griefed except when you‚Äôre the one doing it, you picked the wrong server.
---
I believe a non insignificant amount of boomers who played vanilla want to play alliance because they played horde during vanilla. At least my while family and friends did that.
---
Be swift, young king. 
---
(Disclaimer: it's not mine to be giving out to poor furries on the streets, I only screenshot it. I just wanted to call someone young king.)
---
Blasted lands
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem. US whitemane
---
I'm case the other warrior sucks or didn't get a good DPS group or a whole host if reasons. Fact is they DID get a workable DPS tank and... Oh you're trolling here, aren't you. Or you're 12 throwing a fit cause people didn't let you play with your toys just how you wanted.
---
It‚Äôs rough
---
Or perhaps they have to wake up early to be productive members of society?
---
It's called ADS
---
[Uhhhhhh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAlf0-U7EA)
---
&gt; Nobody playing ESO is arguing whether the Aldmiri Dominion, Daggerfall Covenant, or Ebonheart Pact is best.
---
Ofc not, that's because the Aldmeri Dominion has Based Queen Ayrenn. Not even a contest!
---
#5 is perfect. Can you give reports gold?
---
Im level 41
---
Only gold I make as a healer is from running dungeons since I can't kill anything as a resto shaman and I'm not patient enough to deal with playing the AH
---
Why the huge letters
---
CFCPW GANG
---
He could be on a server alone and it would be impossible.
---
I‚Äôm a human. Why would I want to play as a human (and by extension, dwarf and gnome)
---
Just let me be green bro
---
Oh god are we the smash community of servers?
---
Not Tirion whispering you. Its Mograine.
---
Perfect.
---
Still wasnt my point. Anyway...
---
Also getting this, the queue has moved about 10 people in the last 30 minutes. Said 22 minutes estimated the whole time.
---
bruh ive saved so many allies from certain death how can you just throw me to the curb like that...
---
It's like the game hasn't existed for 15 years.
---
Haha yeah the existence of gnomes is another big factor against Alliance for me
---
What OP did in the video wasn't actually that easy. It took precise timing and actually understanding the full kit Rogues have available to us, which not everyone bothers to. It also cost two reagents, for whatever that's worth. Also, fast and accurate target swapping. 
---
Having the abilities doesn't mean a person has the ability.
---
Ive gone from 250 to 237 over the past hour, herod na
---
Yeah I did and you were in the wrong, you‚Äôre not entitled to anything here. If I was a mod I would ban you from this sub completely. All you do is disrespect and spew toxicity. Good bye pointless talking to wall.
---
Give me night elf warlock pls.
---
At least I got my wish eventually in the BFA pre patch. ..... kinda.
---
stupid i know.
---
‚ÄúKilled 3 murlocs and haven‚Äôt gotten a single eye yet, is this quest bugged? How do I open a ticket? This is ridiculous‚Äù
---
I find it pretty easy to make space when you have 100% uptime on slows.

---
I think *this* is the correct theory. Young kids and adults play Alliance and the "edgy" teenagers play Horde. 
---
You know that kid in highschool who thought he was hot shit? Or the kid that was trying *too* hard to be cool. Or the bully? I think those guys would overwhelmingly pick Horde. But you know the 9 y/o kid? And the weeaboo guy that sleeps with his "anime body-pillow girlfriend"? yeah... they probably pick Alliance. Both have their pros and cons. 
---
I think that this was probably more pronounced in vanilla though. A lot of people now are "playing what they played then" or "trying the other side" or whatever. I just imagine it's more mixed up now.
---
Lok'tar Warrior.
---
lol. whorde.
---
Are you all right?
---
Error, Dalaran does not exist
---
Loving it . I'm actually doing professions this time . Tailoring and Enchanting.  Doing quests that I skipped during vanilla because they ate up to much time . You know , the race to 60 ....... I am 56 but only because my memory came back to me and I knew where to go . Loving my Warlock .
---
&gt; seeing if there is anything handy like place 3 dots  in a cast sequence etc
---
What you are asking for here is strictly against tos. You can have a macro that casts Corruption, starts Wanding, and sets your pet to attack all at once, but you cannot have a setup where:
---
you press one key and it casts Curse of Agony, waits for gcd, casts immolation, waits and casts Corruption as immolation resolves and then begins Wanding
---
I just did the drowning trick tonight. It works
---
I do try. I love playing a hunter. Im deadly when solo and in PvP and can bring some good utility to instances. Huntards are a real goddam thing and they make me want reach through my monitor and throat punch the player.
---
The pet is, essentially, another player that *you* are responsible for. You need to control its every move, even if its just there to Furious Howl every 10 seconds. Youll be a better DPS for it and people wont look at you like youre a burden. Its really only a few extra clicks per fight to make sure that you and your pet are doing what youre supposed to be doing. 
---
And dont be afraid to lose the pet for an instance if people are insisting. Depending on your build and competence it only makes up for maybe 15-30% of your DPS (i admit, thats a rough estimate, but my numbers dont suffer a whole lot  sans-cat at any level. then again I focus more on Marks and use my pets for utility)
---
I‚Äôve been sitting in the 400-500 range for an hour. US Fairbanks. Usually when it‚Äôs that low a number it‚Äôs maybe ~10 mins
---
That was my thought too. My in flight Wifi hasn‚Äôt ever been good enough for streaming.

Anyone getting offended for not get congratulated on anything, in any context. Is a moron and should be avoided at all costs.

Its like those self-centred douchebags that comes up to you and says "hey, its my birthday", expecting you to give a shit. Fuck em.
---
You dodged a huge bullet and should feel haopy about this. Now you wont waste any more time in that crap guild :)
---
I've been playing classic for 15 years and I don't see why I would stop anytime.
---
I've never seen that desk before in my life
---
I would if I got the chance, just to spite the people wasting their energy on hating on a neckbeard basement dwelling gamer making insane amounts of money doing what he loves. I guess he‚Äôs living the dream of some of you people.
---
Yep. Also my work will pay for WiFi if it‚Äôs for ‚Äúwork‚Äù. But usually the WiFi is crap so I don‚Äôt even bother.
---
Id guess the problem is OP is not one of the following classes; priest, mage, warlock or hunter and therefore can't do it
---
If horde you can open crab cages underwater off the shadowprey pier and turn them in on the pier for about 10g an hour plus fishing poles to sell on the ah.  It's tedious but it'll get you up to 90g.
---
Well at least somebody gets her wet
---
We live in a society
---
Oh man I'd love one of those.
---
Oh there's one right in front of me ;D
---
Not in classic servers especially at launch way too crowded. Back in retail vanilla would keep rolling new servers as they launched and you get pretty used to it. Just pay a mage for bread/water and sit in a corner with cushy mobs
---
You didnt see shit mate. It wasnt worthy of being removed. Keep living your delusion.
---
I called someone horde scum after complimenting their video editing skills and I got downvoted so hard.
---
For the Horde!
---
Sounds like they aren't a native english speaker
---
In a dungeon, you will either use your imp to give the stam buff to your group and put Fire Shield on the tank, or you will use your succubus for extra damage and crowd control.
---
As a Warlock myself , I don't see it being impossible.  I can solo elites 3-4 levels above me now . Granted it takes some kiting and use of all my abilities but it can be done lol .
---
Before there was BWL, a lot of Tier 2 armor dropped in Molten Core- my Judgement legplates and helm got a lot cooler upon logging in on January 3, 2006.
---
Nah man bunch of retards riding my dick.
---
Trunks and lockboxes the first loot crates
---
What do you mean? Being higher level doesn't make the distances any shorter lol.
---
??? How
---
That guy should be kicked instead of donated to üòÑ
---
At least he has aspect üòÖ
---
Well shit it's vice versa for me
---
I forgot how awesome the Paladin Judgement set was.
---
Also going from the stupid headband as a mage to the awesome blue glowy orb was one of the best things to happen in Vanilla WoW.
---
Ah its the stuttering that was giving me headaches, just thought it was related to the nameplates. I just had a look through the issues and it seems like there's a lot of good info and fixes in there so will pick something out of there; can also confirm that I first noticed the issues when I picked up Cyclonian so perhaps it is related to that. I guess liferoot has a drop chance below 1 so that should fix it.
---
Which zone
---
 Note that growl just generates a threat spike, it doesn't taunt
---
I still want an expac where the naga becomes a third playable faction along with murlocs and ogres
---
the yew trees never stood a chance against my unwavering desire to have a vape in woodcutting... thats all Im gonna say
---
I guess that explains why he‚Äôs #1 on Twitch instead of the other tens of thousands of people. I‚Äôm not even a fan but the people hating on him so much are definitely turning me into one. Sad shit all around.
---
Damn that sucks but it's up again in 59 seconds. 
---
And it's very useful against more classes than just Mage. I think it's the best pvp racial in the game for Warriors hands down.
---
Everyone has to deal with bullshit frostbite procs anyway, the fuck kind of point is that?
---
Alliance has Alterac Valley on lockdown.
---
I believe it's an add-on called "RealMobHealth" or something similar.
---
Reminds me of the old MMOGlider days lmao. People would post screenshots of the goofiest action bars and you immediately knew they were botting
---
Correct. Imagine if every time you go to fight a boss or turn in a quest to an npc and they arent the same sex or look the same. Sure they have the same name but they don‚Äôt look like they were before. I go into MC expecting to fight the fire lord rag and instead there‚Äôs a fluffy bunny hopping around with the name Ragnoros that‚Äôs pretty immersion breaking. The same rule applies to people‚Äôs characters.
---
If it's the mob I'm thinking of, I think we had three or four people and it was still kinda rough. Goes down fast with that many people but it still hits like a truck and almost downed one of us.
---
99 Agility and 99 Rcing join the chat
---
Was what intended?
---
I know. That's why I said you can do this easier with Intimidating Shout.
---
It's like whats the point of even playing classic without these wacky old innocent fun exploits. Can people even kite world bosses to Cities still?
---
&gt;Subzer√∏
---
Wait, what server do you play on?
---
Right, human interaction is so cringe?
---
It's Tirion in Legion.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PuEnilaz4
---
Yeah I ran into the same issue with Cyclonian and I kept hiding it to fix. But that change to min drop change would be the permanent fix
---
Orkut only lasted 10 years almost because of Brazilians
---
Did it in MoP too I played on his server.
---
I forgot you decide what‚Äôs a real job or not.
---
i have the exact same setup, King Bangalash?????
---
Haha. Op is salty for being one of the lesser classes.
---
So none of them?
---
Nope. Sulfuras
---
My bad. Misinterpreted what you were saying.
---
Can anyone recommend where to quest for me right now? 
---
I‚Äôm a warrior on the horde side and I‚Äôve hit level 33, halfway to 34. 
---
I am not sure where to go to quest next. I‚Äôve done all of Hillsbrad and Thousand Needles including Mirage Raceway and I‚Äôve decided to wait til 35-36 for STVietnam since that seems recommended. I‚Äôve heard people suggest Desolace but the zone is kinda ugly and unappealing to me. Not to mention lots of red and orange quests which are bad news for a warrior.
---
So does anyone have any suggestions to level 33-36?
---
Do you know if there is any macros for marking?
---
&gt;What? No it didn‚Äôt. I mained ret pally for all of Legion, never got any whispers.
---
[So did I, and it definitely did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PuEnilaz4)
---
What if I'm playing in Blaumeux which is often shown as 50/50 or close to it on most realm pop stats? Places like nesingwary are a permanent fight with one faction kicking the other constantly
---
I got one toon to 60 to easily fund powerleveling the other professions and toons.  Create all the toons so they get rested experience while you're leveling your main.  Having a 60 makes life easy.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt actually help. It‚Äôs the cache and the addons still being in. I would try updating them to see if that fixes it.
---
I thought it was funny. Funny enough to warrant posting. My title is satire. Good on them for having fun.
---
Answer: Yes, obviously.
---
Spoilers: there isn't.
---
I‚Äôm convinced that people who farmed to get to 99 agility are psychopaths. All of em.
---
Are you okay?
---
That Judgement set is the best looking armor in-game IMO (well, aside from the skirt).  
---
I had forgotten how terrible the pre-changed Priest set was.
---
One thing I learned is gnome warriors will always attack you
---
Cry babies like you ruin subs.
---
I may get back in. Do I have to buy something or just the $15 monthly?
---
I don't care that he's successful, good for him if retards want to give him money. I respect you acknowledging you would in fact blow him. Signing off now.
---
You lucky bastard
---
Nice, dont expect it to sell for 800g though, theres some madmen on my server listing it at that amount.
---
Goddamn all this thread is making me do is want to go through all the WoW lore again.
---
I flagged myself for PvP while still in Mulgore. Come at me, alliance
---
He didn't ask how to remove someone from the ignore list, he asked about what happens after reporting. Reporting a player doesn't add them to the ignore list.

Anyone know what the pattern for the rich purple shirt would sell for? I'm wondering if this is one of those niche vanilla things I'm not aware of.

My influence is minor compared to nazi mods and their butt bois.

Alts are the best.  Get bored on one guy?  That next level looking a bit grindy?  Go play someone else for a while and have fun there.  What's the point of racing to the end anyway?  You'll just run out of stuff to do faster and have to start an alt anyway.
---
Think of it this way:  Your alt is way ahead of those guys-who-are-already-60's alts.
---
In my opinion, Tier 2 is the signature look for so many classes, paladin, mage and rogue especially so.
---
It‚Äôs cake to mog farm these days in retail (just a lot of weekly resets)... thus my paladin, mage and rogue each have the full Tier 2 mog and I‚Äôll do the same for my warrior I think.
---
Lol so what, do they have to kick 20 people every time someone dings? If there are like 150 people on, there's no way all of them are going to be reading Gchat at any given moment.
---
Do you know what the faction balance is like? I‚Äôm considering jumping ship from Herod.
---
That was a hell of a story mate, write a book. I‚Äôd at the very least expect a free web short story! Put the talent to use!
---
OP be like "In retail I can 7v1, in classic I can only 6v1, what gives?"
---
It's a lot longer with a wider level range so it's less efficient exp.
---
bloodfang is still one of the sickest sets ever imo.
---
OP blocks his name and other players names from the chat box, leaves his portrait uncensored and then leaves the loot roll names uncensored as well
---
mine never get too high though.
---
As a healer I want to see my critical heals in green text over my teammates when it lands. What addon does this?
---
Sp&gt;crit
---
No
---
Be more pedantic. We‚Äôre talking about dungeon finder, raid finder, queued content in general, professions that are ‚Äúeasy to level‚Äù but now worthless because they can‚Äôt make them too good if everyone has them at max with no effort.
---
All the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù things that remove the necessary conditions for positive emergent behaviour.
---
Auto loot, whatever, fine. Aura timers , of course. These are not things that affect how players interact with each other.
---
So Im a mage in my mid lvl 30s (almost 36 atm) and Ive tried leveling by a lot of ways (questing, grinding, SM  cleaves) and on pretty much all of this the max exp i got per hour was always 20k average, so its taking me about 3h per level. Is this normal ? Am I doing something wrong ? Would questing be way faster ?
---
Are you having fun?

The sub is thriving, you just wanna cry about something.

Sure thing see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5yodx/z/f0pwqol) for more details.

Played a shit load of rs gave wow a go and I can say wow is a shit tonne more fun
---
It wasnt my post that got removed. I have no intention of acting nice to these people because they will never change anything. That would require a hit to the ego and a loss of the control they desire so greatly. Fuck the mods.
---
This! Although If you roll need and everyone rolled greed you better equip that sucker.
---
Saw lvl 2 troll running his way to Everlook yesterday to camp the vendor recipes. He was nearly at the gates when I saw him so he must have been running the whole way.
---
God, I can't even imagine that torture.
---
How? I just hit 50 having got a mount at lvl 40 (resulting in 1g) and in the past 10 lvls with no grinding at all I‚Äôm already back to 150g from just questing and vendoring greys
---
Blizzard forums said to flush my dns and reconfig my ip and so far its working
---
Good, fuck that guy in particular. 
---
Good job OP.

Arathi comes to mind, alternative is spend a few levels in SM.

Been a lurker and finally reached a point where I think I might go ahead and start my subscription tonight. Been missing WoW super hard and I'm still concerned I'm gonna wind up spending money on something I'm not gonna like as much as I'm hoping, but fuck it it's worth it to find out. A few questions:
---
If I were to pick up the game right now, would I have anybody else around at my level? Going off the other posts here, it seems like everybody started an account an immediately rocketed their way to 60, are the starting human/dwarf zones total ghost towns now?
---
Also, are there any good mage guides that you guys recommend? I'd very likely be starting a gnome or human mage. Back when I played I didn't really use the frost spec for much, mostly remember using arcane and fire for raid dps, but it seems like frost is used for basically everything in classic.
---
Good for you man. Having a partner thats toxic to your interests is the worst kind of partner
---
yeah! leveling solo is a drag though.
---
what "other warrior" are you talking about? did you even read my story? there was only 1 warrior doing this. and i only kicked 1 person
---
Rogue poisons and windfury are both temporary enchantments so they conflict.
---
They also both conflict with sharpening stones since those are also temporary enchantments.
---
It seems that every time I walk away for an extended period of time, I get **disconnected** instead of kicked to the char screen. I don't think I've *ever* experienced it kicking me just to the char screen :/
---
It's ok. I deserve it
---
Mafia is gonna get ya!
---
your first mistake was assuming im speaking english. im not. im speaking my own custom language i made up myself. all the words originated from english, but some of them have been modified after the fact. i am the only admin of this language and i can change the definitions at will even retroactively if i want to
---
and in my language, for all intensive purposes is not wrong. and as of right now, i just made "intents and purposes" an illegal phrase. anybody who says it instantly get banned. so watch out
---
and why did you say "have a nice day"? thats such a weird thing to say in this situation
---
Problem is that many of those warriors will refuse to tank.

Wow hobs
---
 Now that's a name I haven't seen in a very long time
---
Imagine if every time you go to fight a boss or turn in a quest to an npc and they arent the same sex or look the same. Sure they have the same name but they don‚Äôt look like they were before. I go into MC expecting to fight the fire lord rag and instead there‚Äôs a fluffy bunny hopping around with the name Ragnoros that‚Äôs pretty immersion breaking. The same rule applies to people‚Äôs characters. This example is pretty extreme but I feel still applies and gets my point across. If you want a dress up simulator you picked the wrong game. There‚Äôs sims for that, or perhaps just BFA (battle for appearances).
---
Funny, sounds like the alliance on Thunderfury.
---
I know that you're life tapping, but it really bugs me if life bars are not 100%. So if I have the mana to spare, you're getting healed.

CS + Gouge is 105 energy. This would only be possible if he can time his CS so that he gets an energy tick before the mage can react with a blink which would be very difficult.
---
Rogues are op af and there‚Äôs even a video of a rogue destroying people with little to no gear on at all in bgs, they do insane damage and I love inviting rogues into dungeons.
---
Lol, having the easier road as a hunter was one of my arguments in favor of us going alliance. In the end I was happy, either way. I've already had a 60 hunter on both factions, so I was pretty flexible.
---
Sign me up for 2 counts. Cause I was on my third in the mid 80's when I quit
---
Some item questions...
---
What's a good way to figure out where my hear could or should be at relative to my level? A lot of my armor pieces for example require around level 30 to use but I'm up at 40 now so I imagine I'm missing out on stuff but I wouldn't know where to look to figure out what.
---
Do weapons have specialties? For example, I've been on the look out for melee weapons that have agility boosts because I'm a hunter and want them to benefit my range. Are some weapon types more likely to have agility boosts than others, or is there no real structure to what boosts weapons have? It makes sense that leather might generally have more agility boosts and cloth have more stats catered to cloth wearers for example.
---
This pisses me off so much
---
horde here, i love seeing alliance out and about while questing. ill usually toss a wave thier way.
---
Yeah yeah but all I have to do is sell my tbow and I can afford it yeah?
---
You would have to manually cast wand every time.  Something like:
---
/cast shoot
---
/flex
---
/stopcasting
---
I'm not sure stopcasting works with wanding though.
---
Yeah, I was in Stonetalon and got ganked by an alliance rogue immediately after I killed one of the shredders and was super low on health.
---
I'm not gonna lie though. I'd have done the same thing. I wasn't even mad.
---
At level 25 I got 15 gold, just loot and sell it all, works great.
---
yo what UI addon is that?
---
As a NE I helped a Tauren who was about to be killed by an elite Harpy. I have no regrets, fuck those fucking harpies.

Clearly someone gave up, and thought their grinding was worth 200 bucks lol

We‚Äôll see that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking for proof of. I haven‚Äôt seen him act like an asshole at all lately as someone who went into it knowing these stereotypes.
---
The guy hardly even curses at anyone. I think the most assholey thing he even does is call people idiots, and that‚Äôs not much.
---
i wonder if they did this on purpose. take away the free transfers to make a bunch of ppl realize they actually do want to transfer then bring it back lol
---
I second character notes. If you write a note about someone, you see a red/yellow/green [note] next to a person's name in chat depending on if you noted them as bad/normal/good and you can configure it to warn you if you join a group/raid with someone on your list.
---
&gt;Does anyone follow any specific guide for talent build
---
So at level 40 you will have 31 talent points.
---
3/3 Elemental Precision - This will cap your hit chance against all targets up to 2 levels above you. There is always going to be a 1% chance for your spells to be resisted; so green or yellow, you will have the exact same hit chance
---
2/2 Frost Warding - Because imp frostbolt is useless
---
2/2 Imp Frost Nova - Having this come up earlier is critical
---
3/3 Permafrost - Self Explanitory
---
2/3 Piercing Ice - At level 41 put another point into this to finish it up
---
1/1 Cold Snap - Super useful when a mob resists your nova, cold snap and re-nova
---
3/3 Improved Blizzard - Some guides will tell you to get 2/3 so that you don't override your Cone of Cold slow; this is up to your personal preference. I find it a lot better to have 3/3, and the world first 60 was a frost mage that ran 3/3, so take that how you may.
---
2/2 Arctic Reach - Buffs your nova, CoC, and blizz. Get it.
---
3/3 Frost Channeling - 15% mana reduction.
---
1/1 Ice Block - Get it.
---
3/3 Imp. CoC - More damage on your instant slowing attack. Really great talent.
---
1/1 Frost Barrier - Awesome for pulling and not dying.
---
You have 5 talent points to either put into Ice Shards or Shatter. This is completely personal preference; I like shatter because it helps me burst down players in PvP whenever I get ganked. If you're on a PvE server it's not that big of a deal and you can get whatever you like. Just remember Blizzard doesn't crit.
---
After you're done in the frost tree, put your points into arcane with the idea of getting to clear casting.
---
As for the strategy, pre pull you want to ice barrier, mount up and collect as many mobs (no casters or rangers!) as possible to a centre point. Ice block if you have more than you can handle, otherwise just frost nova and run max range (or blink if you're dazed). Cast a blizzard on top of the mobs so everyone is slowed. Once they get out of that AOE, cast another blizzard just a bit ahead of where they are so they get hit for the whole duration.
---
At this point, you can CoC or just re nova. If they are runners and very low, I like to flame strike into a CoC, and then arcane explosion. If they aren't runners, just run max range and blizzard another 2x. At this point everything should be dead.
---
You should be able to find it now!
---
A lot of people aren't speedrunning from private servers. What you've heard about is a niche minority. 
---
A lot of people are 60. The majority of people aren't 60. 
---
People have low level characters and others are playing low level alts. 
---
There are people everywhere.

Lol dude guilds camp the spawns literally all day long it‚Äôs a war zone out there

Saw a quadbox with 4 level 60s.
---
I promise they do, I had the guards at stv pepper me full of arrows and my corpse sailed back to barrens while I did the run back.
---
Also correct re agro from zone changes.
---
The que times? Yeah man they suck.
---
Realm transfer I could see.  Barber shop and appearance change, no chance.
---
What health and mana bar addon is that you're using? I've been wanting to find one that displays that info closer to the center of the screen without impairing my view, and I really like yours.
---
People will lose their shit if they make layers that don't move back and forth lol. What happens to guilds, friend groups, guilds who have a lot of people all with their own friend groups? New friends you've met that you've been running with all these weeks? That's definitely not a viable solution. Way worse than anything layering is currently doing badly
---
Hope you find your happiness.
---
Your easy
---
lol, my imp is named Zilpad. Must be cousins or something XD
---
I STILL remember a Dire Maul run with this hunter back in Vanilla when I was tanking. I was in the middle of a pull and he‚Äôs standing WAY the hell and gone from Cartagena before opening up on one of the mobs I was pulling. Not even the marked skull, just some random mob in the pack. I was just going to have one of THOSE runs.
---
And then the mob hit his freezing trap. He stutter-stepped back to the group, set his non-Growling pet on my main target, and methodically mowed down one target after another. I was shocked, amazed, and delighted.

this online cult of personality shit should have died with athene

Speaking as a rogue... I'm just most likely to be watching you from stealth like a creeper because I spaced out.

You should always assume there's a rogue just [staring at you from the bushes.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/826c178f3be16eafcc358e1d13a76048/tenor.gif?itemid=11543382)

It seems to be fixed after I uploaded a new version!

---
You can't stall as a wizard against a cc immune warrior. Ice block wont be enough to save you and as soon as you blink away you get intercepted. If you dont blink out of iceblock you get hamstring and now your a dead man.
---
Huh, I'm level 41 with my mount and 50g in my bags lol.
---
Averagejoe here. It's Sulfuras Horde. :)
---
I'm 34 on Thalnos, and decided to just start learning portuguese. So far it has been useful.
---
Not to eat though. We use their bits to create a poisonous concoction for the Alliance to consume. You think it was the Shindigger stout that made them drink it? No, it was the sweet Murloc fluids they craved.
---
The twitch issue seems to be fixed after I uploaded a new version
---
The only class that has an excuse to be 41+ with no mount is Priest cuz they need all their crap maxed. Hunters should be the last ones broke when they need in every roll.
---
Fixed it! Sorry for that
---
Rogue, Druid, Priest, Shaman.
---
Anything I say is [obviously] my own opinion.
---
It just so happens that opinion is gonna be shared by a lot of players (as your screenshot and this thread demonstrates).
---
They are VERY different games. They really aren't comparable. They just serve different niches. 
---
WoW is very active fun experience with things to fo. 
---
OSRS is first and foremost an AFK clicker you play while doing other things.  With content on the side for when you want to do something.
---
When did I say it wasnt thriving??
---
add it to the Config.wtf and it‚Äôll persist between runs
---
I dont understand people that put someone on ignore for any reason other than spam...
---
I have fixed the twitch issue so you can probably find it now :)
---
Even if you level fast and get 60 in 5 days /played that's 120h so you're saying the guy should be making 1.7$/h ?üòÖ
---
I'm not saying I support account/gold selling but noone would sell a level 60 if they're getting 1.7$h while leveling.
---
Some option settings I make always get undone after I log out, how can I fix that?
---
Wtf the fuck
---
I found the Hinterlands had the most but if you're only 40 may be a bit low for it until you hit mid-forties. There's a lot around the ruins in STV.
---
I could be wrong but I remembered ports to everywhere
---
dodged a bullet
---
You can make a macro with cancelaura for every heal over time that you use as part of the pull.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt give wrong advice as fireball, In general, does more damage than frostbolt.
---
If you‚Äôre using a Stealth opener, the tank should be able to build up some solid threat while you get in position. And if your Ambush pulls aggro, then you screwed up; use Feint (or Vanish) to give aggro back to the tank so you can go back to Backstabbing.
---
Fuck yes I want to see what I look like with huge shoulder pads caring a giant sword so sue me.
---
Maybe your just short bro?
---
100%. I will get 60 before phase 2, but I play a lot so that will be easy. I'm not sure how much I've gotten with the alts but, I bought my 40 mount a week ago and ended with 10G. Farmed Exiles for 4-5h, came up with 50G and started leveling profs. I now have about 200G , about 10-20% which is from my main, but I've also spent a good 75G on BoE blues. Nothing crazy but pretty good earnings compared to my 44, and they're all crafting profs, so I don't farm 6 hours a day, just craft good recipes I've found have demand, undercut a few times a day and that's pretty much it. How much gold I've made with them all together really is motivating me to grind to 35 + 300/300 and just milk everything. No farming again, ever.
---
Yeah, but you have a condition. We don't hold that against you.
---
They use the highest rank unless you specify in parentheses the rank after the spell name
---
You mean the majority right?
---
Murlocs, gnolls, and kobolds.
---
There was a post
---
I ran around with robes of argual (from sfk) untill i got a new chest piece from ZF(mid-high 40's dungeon). It's nice having level appropriate gear, but it takes so long to get and you will outlevel it anyway, so just stick with what you got unless its severly bad. In that case consider hitting up the auction house.
---
As a hunter you generaly benefit from all the stats, where the meme "everything is hunter items" come from. If you are looking to stick to a single type of weapon i recommend staffs. You are ranged most of the time though so you shouldnt steal a good staff from someone else.
---
I know a lot of people who do that exact scenario you are describing. I think you are over thinking this, that coupled with the fact you took the time to write a paragraph which i didnt read is kind of depressing.
---
literally the most annoying shit you'll experience as a warrior
---
Casters in classic are REALLY boring. Cast 1 spell over and over again, congrats top dps! (Sometimes you MIGHT get to cast a debuff... maybe)
---
So maybe rogue might suit your fancy.
---
They do gank in herds... \*teary eyes\*
---
Evocation is not a talent in 1.12 . Every mage gets it.
---
Link? I searched and couldn‚Äôt find a post.
---
F*** yes this is classic wow.
---
try miks scrolling battle text
---
What if I‚Äôm alliance on wow and horde on classic
---
Not a boomer but this describes me.
---
Whats that band? I've listened to them before but can't remember the name. Only thing I can remember is something 'MST' or something.
---
You can't immune poly and warriors can't trinket poly either. Even if the potion broke poly you just keep re-poly. Ice block, cold snap, Iceblock there's 30 seconds.
---
Oh nice where is this?
---
You can also create a tasty omlette with their unborn children.
---
World of Rogue craft was in a previous patch, they did nerf them in 1.10 or something
---
I legit about to re-roll mage because how stupid this is and how easy to farm. And you have to catch up to the pack before the market gets abused
---
Obviously you could do this in vanilla, besides laying, but it wasn't the main thing every single person is doing now
---
Did not know that, I‚Äôll edit it out
---
I‚Äôm a priest healer and I love warriors. 
---
The end
---
Dang almost all of that place holder art was pretty bad
---
So what happens when you get to the end? Launch TBC?
---
If there is a demand for it, Blizz will find a way to support it, and more importantly, monetize it. If WOW classic shows subscriptions are up some insane number, bet your ass they offer up the next steps of classic, up to and including a cost.
---
Playing RS makes every ‚Äúgrind‚Äù in this game look like weenie hut Jr. A grind from 1-60 in wow would be like ‚Äúleveling‚Äù strength in runescape from like 90 to 93.
---
No shit Sherlock
---
Some1 needs to stop this man from going to the Ah
---
I bet he can‚Äôt prove it though.
---
What is tagging?
---
Is runescape good?
---
Should have been a troll for sure
---
Oh shit. I remember in classic there was a script you could enter to increase how dense your AoE spells looked. Anyone remember how to do that?
---
Man this post is true to the T
---
All hail the almighty azpad of house impus, first of his name, igniter of flame , king of the underworld and the first imps, lord of the seven slaves and protector of Helleth.
---
Im playing paladin on rppvp and I feel I must always engage horde in areas like hillsbrad for rp reasons. Ill usually make it a fair fight too with a warning. If im in some remote non-settlement area ill see no reason to square off though.
---
Really depends on the time investment I guess. I'm new to playing wow seriously (just dabbled before) so I don't have the knowledge to play the market. Really hard for me to know what will sell and what won't.
---
All I'm doing is grabbing some cheap level 19 twink items once in a while.
---
Before launch I thought I would go heavy on ah but now I realize I can't because of lack of knowledge. I rather just get to 60 and grind prebis
---
On Fairbanks? Ally. For real. They've been doing it ever since people started leveling up to that area. 
---
Stupidly fucking annoying.
---
I had to wait till 3am to finish my quests there because i couldnt get near the camp while everyone was awake.
---
6 wipes in classic is nothing. If it was retail it'd be pathetic, but this is classic reddit.
---
Actually that's for a different server than the one in the screenshot, my bad
---
staffs are great for warriors. Dont be a weaponist.
---
Most of my guilds leadership disappeared. Guild died next day. RIP naxx progress
---
God that sounds painfull
---
Wow this is awesome. I dont know why but I got weirdly invested in this story. I was actually anxious by the end lol. Lok'tar!
---
So much salt xD
---
Sounds like you got ganked and you‚Äôre mad.
---
This.  I /who searched "&lt;race&gt; priest 60" on my server.  Of 26 60s, there were 21 Dwarves and 5 Humans.
---
Why?  Because of racials.  People don't pick races anymore for flavor or appearance, it's all about min maxing racial abilities.
---
If Blizzard ever releases TBC, then faction imbalances for cities and classes are completely wiped from the game.  Leaving only racials.  And as you said, TBC Horde racials are overall MUCH more OP than alliance.
---
So all of those people minmaxing racials?  They're likely to go horde in TBC.  And every server will end up more like 60 40 or 65 35 split.  It's going to be unfun and many people don't see it coming.
---

This item is mathematically better, and far easier to get. You're not wrong, you're just greedy.
---
That‚Äôs so well done! I laughed and bobbed my head along as well!
---
Takes a lot longer to mutlibox 5 accounts to 60. Maybe you can multiply the 1.7$ by 2.
---
Alliance players have time to post on reddit?  Come on guys, all those flowers won't pick themselves.
---
Just need lots of horde priest friends so you can kill all the thieving allies trying to steal from under your nose
---
No man I‚Äôm just watching it and it‚Äôs sad.
---
I've said this before and I'll say it again: Playing horde is like playing on a PvE server. It's the new "carebear" faction. There's no challenge in it. I've been leveling up on Horde and I can count on one hand how many times I've been unfairly engaged by alliances. I honestly thought alliance would have a population advantage like vanilla which is partly why I chose Horde. Now it's just so boring.
---
I'm really glad I didn't get instant hate for posting this in this sub lol
---
To be fair, the Trolls would do the same to you. And make you into a stew as well. And probably use your organs for a voodoo ritual.

If a DPS keeps interfering with me being able to keep the tank in a good spot I will absolutely prioritise the tank over them. You can yell about meters all you want but if you aren't doing your job correctly I ain't going to be taking any advice from you if you try and shift the blame.

Even with that though, he should have his mount. Unless he did something dumb like buy blues from the auction house or max a profession too early.
---
A beautiful saga
---
Oh no I don‚Äôt expect to lol it‚Äôs on my server for 200g
---
Nice to see someone with a brain in between all the shit posts. I completely agree with you.
---
&gt;What's a good way to figure out where my hear could or should be at relative to my level?
---
Honestly, gear isn't too important leveling up. Even until like 48~ I was using a level 18 item because the stats were decent. I wouldn't go too out of your way to try replace something you've had for a while. 
---
Late game check out the pre-raid BIS gear and try go for that.
---
&gt;A lot of my armor pieces for example require around level 30 to use but I'm up at 40 now so I imagine I'm missing out on stuff but I wouldn't know where to look to figure out what.
---
Generally that's fine, even if you miss out on stuff, you'll be able to replace it with better equipment later on.
---
&gt;Do weapons have specialties? For example, I've been on the look out for melee weapons that have agility boosts because I'm a hunter and want them to benefit my range. Are some weapon types more likely to have agility boosts than others, or is there no real structure to what boosts weapons have? 
---
This one is complicated, but I'll try to answer generally.
---
There are two 'types' of gear, pre-determined gear with set stats/abilities, and random gear.
---
Pre determined gear will typically always have the same stats/abilities, and there will only be one 'type' of that item. These will generally be quest rewards, or rare drops off bosses, they will be suited for classes that use that particular item.
---
Random gear is basically the greens that drop 90% of the time (Some greens are pre determined), you'll notice a common suffix, so it's something like "Hunter's Jerkin Of &lt;The Monkey/Owl/Boar/etc&gt;. As a hunter, you want to look for "Of the Monkey" equipment, because this will give you +AGI and +STAM, which are the two most important stats you need. 
---
&gt;It makes sense that leather might generally have more agility boosts and cloth have more stats catered to cloth wearers for example.
---
What you'll generally find is that pre determined gear (rare drops/quest rewards) usually are cater to a certain class/build, so it will be rare (though not impossible) to find cloth gear that gives +STR and +AGI, and you'll more often find mail equipment with +STR/DEX/STAM.
---
That‚Äôs what STV always was tho. We didn‚Äôt call it STVietnam for no reason, my dude.
---
Meet me on the bridge to the Stormpike Bunker in Alterac Valley.

He made it about 30 ft before a lvl 40 hunter 1 shotted him

Also it sounds like they shouldn't roll PvP.

Lol, or what if he gets feared then tailwhipped into the whelps on Onyxia. You suck, bye

That would be like saying WC3s main characters are the villains you fight and playing it makes you an NPC just simply reacting to all of it.

there is also a node of mithrill(?) in stonard that nobody can reach

Thanks! We actually just noticed today that it was on twitch app so we have it now :)
---
Scrub here. I‚Äôm level 26 and just got dropped a sword called the Black Knight from some random monster in Stonetalon Mountains. My auctioneer plug-in is telling me it‚Äôs worth about 3-4 gold? Is thing super rare? Should I hold onto it or sell it now?
---
Genuine question,
---
What did you expect your experience on a PVP server, the most dangerous sort, in STV, a notoriously dangerous PVP zone, to be like?
---
I‚Äôm Alliance, but I still rooted for you.
---
them probably stam if you want to do pvp.
---
Oh really? damn
---
It's about the admiration being a dick gets.  He is leading by example whether or not he means to, and by glorifying such behavior you propagate it.

"our beloved instance-pulling, need-rolling brethren" LOL

Holy fuck, this is the best.
---
What a total LOSER hahaha.  Good riddance.  You don't need that cancer.
---
Check as many time as it takes to arrive at the conclusion that isn't yours.
---
Man, if you ever want 10m gold in retail, you could put him up on the AH and people would be lining up to give you all they had.
---
I'm all for people playing how they like, but what a boring fucking way to play the game.
---
How did I know what this picture would be lmao
---
They never got banned.
---
Thanks! That is exactly what Ive been looking for.
---
You don't need to RP to want to kill everyone.
---
Let people have their own fun, if it involves camping level 30's then that's where they get their enjoyment.
---
It's retarded and shouldn't be allowed.
---
How are you losing to hunters when their feign death is working like 1 time out of 30? I'm talking when you open in stealth on them and not they open on you 40' away
---
Just for a fun reference getting to 60 in WoW (timewise) is the equivalent of getting one 99 in one of your 3 melee stats in OSRS. Aside from that you also have 4 other combat skills you have to level that will take similar times to level.  With a total of 23 skills all of which gate certain areas of progression throughout the game so efficiently you actually have to level all of these skills at least to moderately high levels along the way. 
---
How do people make it to the end game content you might ask? Most don't.
---
Eastern Plaguelands was only a setback!
---
Lmao idk how people get so salty over this, it's obviously a joke. I even know the guy who made the guild, he's my cousin. He just loves fucking with people.
---
Except it didn't look like that in 2004, because the game now runs on the current retail engine with totally different lighting effects.
---
&gt;There's plenty of other ways in the game to make money.
---
Well they should be able to use those ways to buy the boe from me.
---
Unfortunately horde are the only faction that can get a +30 fishing rod.
---
Youd have to get some of the fishing gear from STV event.
---
Too bad fear ward was removed in TBC, when pvp racials really started mattering with arena.
---
I didnt expect any less, I‚Äôm just throwing an opinion out there.
---
Hence the video.
---
I played runescape and osrs years ago but I quit and play Wow every day now
---
It does happen. Usually its over-confident DPSs making things awkward, or a reckless tank that makes the healer sweat IRL, but ya get some gems sometimes. Ive been pleasantly surprised before. 
---
Had a warrior who started off talking about how he was such a good tank and blah blah blah then started pulling entire rooms, jumping around like an idiot and I thought 'here comes wipe-town', but nah... the guy did like no damage, but never lost aggro *in Classic*, and was a communicative lead the entire time. We smashed that entire instance without so much as a close call.
---
Tried a rogue out recently. Low level, Deadmines. The mage and I somehow managed unspoken coordination with our CCs and the tank followed our lead.
---
&gt;useful
---
&gt;not hell to solo 
---
Druid or Mage
---
I think they took the scraps of that old idea, and used it for the Violet Hold in Dalaran/wotlk
---
What, that I experienced more kids/immature types on alliance than I did when I played horde?
---
You have two whole other monitors to use near your wife
---
Lmao wow.  Just wow.
---
Herea to hoping Blizz takes a page out if FFXIV and copy some of the housing ideas from them
---
Nobody bounces like a female night elf. Just sayin.
---
Or they don't and now you are out 500g.
---
What are you going to do about it lmao.
---
Alternative scenario: Everyone needs and nobody is mad at the results.
---
Yes, known fact. This was fixed in a later patch.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.1 "Most enchantments on items are no longer counted against the maximum limit of effects a player can have on them, so it should be much harder for a player to exceed their max limit on effects and have one be removed involuntarily."
---
I always got that rebuttal "Oh, you just wanna play the pretty boy good guys" or some such.
---
Yes.  Yes I do.  If I'm going to spend 1000 hours staring at a character, I'd rather it be pretty like a human and in a pretty place like Stormwind as opposed to a shanty town dumpster fire in a shanty town down dumpster fire.  
---
Also all the city planners for Horde suck and should drug out into the road and stoned.

Hey thanks, I really appreciate the input. I took your advice and gave druid a shot when I got home. Got lost and flew to level 10 it feels like. I think I'll enjoy healing and I'm looking forward to giving the other aspects of the class a try. Thank you very much!
---
Of all the comments this one made me laugh the hardest.
---
Make sure you actually hit logout/exit game. If you just alt-f4 or get DCed then options changed that session aren't saved.
---
Alliance are the real bad guys in wow
---
It‚Äôs just kind of fun at this point, can we go again?
---
Back in 04 I was dealing with a lot of physical and emotional abuse from my family. The value this game had to me.. it was a whole world I could escape to with friends greeting me the moment I hopped on. This game was everything.
---
This exact post was already shared an hour ago, check the front page or maybe page 2. Still hilarious though.
---
Fucking genious
---
I felt pain in my forearm yesterday and had to make adjustments. Any recommendations?

This is the best!

Ofc yeah :P but still cool

Exactly.

As a Fury Warrior, I wish I could farm Strat UD for a pre-bis weapon, but instead I'll have to run UBRS 6 times just to lose the roll on this to a Hunter. ü•¥
---
lol I‚Äôve got 2 million and all the gold sink mounts. No way I would give up my homie like that. Kinda done with retail anyway after whatever BFA was supposed to be. Gonna stay away for at least an expansion.
---
Can‚Äôt wait until I can get a Murloc pet in Classic though!
---
Don't forget herbing/mining. Even if you can't kill high level things, there are lower level herbs that will have some value.
---
Go take an online survey about what class fits your personality.
---
I was in Hillsbrad fighting swarms of keyboard turning level 30s. Someones already got BIS???

Wow, but did you see in A Song of Ice and Fire, Jon‚Äôs friends at the Wall are Pyp and Sam, like LOTR.  How could it have predicted that?

I type Gnomer because it's shorter than Gnomeregan and it doesn't leave me with an awkward LFG Gnome :P

Alright, now for race. I prefer Horde, but leveling on Alliance is so much better.

Great read to wake up to.

you should try a decent feral druid tank sometime :)

Ah, there you go. I started playing in vanilla shortly after BC launched.

This is beautiful

My vanilla imp was named Pizmat. Pretty sure our imps would be friends.

I add half a dozen people to ignore everyday. (And that‚Äôs actual interactions, not just guild spam / barrens children )
---
That's all PvP, it sounds like you don't like it so you just label it greifing.
---
You've contradicted yourself though. Yes it's worth the same to everyone on the action house but someone that can use it obviously gets extra value. You're just being greedy.
---
For the honour of the Alliance!
---
Just kidding, I despise WoW (more a fan of Warcraft 1, 2, and 3)
---
As a rogue, if I want to go for walksies and you dont take me, I will stealth. Next thing you know you're going to get a call saying that they picked me up trying to use pickpocket when it wont work, and that I'll be waiting near the other rogues.
---
Didn't see it. My bad.
---
Only dual wield white hits have a hit chance penalty. Regular 1h white hits and skills have no hit chance penalty.
---
Saw one recently  named 'Pizpad'....
---
Piss pad, Blizzard?
---
Flying mounts are utter trash. I'd even go as far as saying normal mounts are problematic. But flying mounts completely break the game open. It was never designed for such a thing.
---
This. Was. Amazing.

Isn't that the pro LGBT+ server?

Awesome

Detect magic, r1 frostbolt and polymorph until it is over. Nova if it happens to break at an inopportune time

On Kirtonos as Horde my mileage varies

I played both factions back in the day, and there was a big difference back then. I've played Alliance on 2 Private servers, Horde in classic. Not so much of a difference these days.
---
No..this is from the anime
---
This comment wins.....
---
I started playing classic when i was 10 years old(i think, I'm 23 so not entirely sure). I loved the horde for not just being humans and having unique races, so i was for sure a "horde pride" loser for a while until i got old enough to be like "it's an imaginary faction in a video game it's not a big deal."
---
Absolutely! :D
---
finalllllly 
---
Thanks, I'd been using leatrix plus tools for it. hopefully this one works with druid forms.
---
What.. gold farmers don't do it because it's the optimal job that
---
&gt; earn more by playing wow than they can by working a 9-5
---
They do it to survive or because it's more easily available choice. There's no point continuing this since you're so clueless beyond belief. Hit me up with whoever is buying 1 gold for 1.5$ I'll gladly make a thousand bucks from few days of doing dungeons with  friends. I can't believe this is a real discussion.

that's step two

---
I just dislike streamer culture in general. To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure if I dislike the streamer or the fanboy club more.
---
lol I don't think most people enjoy it. Quest XP becomes less and less impactful on your overall XP as you level up so a lot of it comes down to grinding mobs in the end. So some see it as a more effective way to do that. Even speed levelers like Jokerd weave in quests with his AOE farming. Others are obviously being paid to power level accounts or are using it to farm gold. I generally don't have a problem with it but it's just kinda obnoxious right now.
---
&lt;3
---
Game feels like mind sweeper without the ganking - being ganked and ganking. To each his own though.
---
Ah, so now its your opinion when before it was the opinion of the average player.
---
Interesting how that can change mid-thread
---
You hear sumn?
---
Everyone knows rage warrior is the most fun spec to play right? :D. However everyone seems to think arms is more dps until 60.  I'm lcl 43 and have two very good one handed swords at nearly 30dps, whereas my warrior axe is 2 handed and 35.5 dps.  Would I be doing less damage if I switch to fury spec and start dual wiedling right away?  Thanks!
---
These are definitely not the same groups.
---
God I love fishing in this game lol
---
Its an MMORPG, your "skills" that gets you ahead is efficient use of time.
---
Have the right gear, learn the right talents, be in the right place for the right amount of time.
---
What other skills did you expect to factor in? Aim?
---
Nobody is arguing whether or not it makes hunters dps numbers bigger.  It's the fact that you have an objectively better, farmable weapon from a 5 man dungeon, and you'd still take dal'rends over a warrior/hunter despite knowing it. Sure you can justify it however you like,  you would still be an asshole for doing it.
---
Yeah, and what I read is

&gt; This guy has more money than me, and I think its shitty

Even have a 50 min timer on my phone to tell me to head home when I go for a smoke in the woods.
---
Agreed
---
I played both a warlock and a resto shaman in vanilla and got to see it from both sides. At later levels, Warlocks have way to juggle mana and health, that being down some is the norm, and they have the tools to heal themselves within reason.
---
Only worry about them in extenuating circumstances such as accidental agro.

---
is there a command to open options or something? I installed but don't get any numbers
---
That NPC in EPL standing on the road to Quel'Thalas is named "Adon" and stood there ever since 1.1. 
---
Blizzard clearly had expansions in mind when building wow.
---
I think technically on paper it‚Äôs dal rends swords but only if you can get both. 
---
That being said - they are usually not looked at as a real option due to: 
---
A). You need both of them in order for it to be BiS and that can take awhile. 
---
B) if you are running with a rogue or warrior and you take dal rends over them you are on the fast track to being unanimously hated. 
---
There are just easier options to get that come close to the same level of usefulness without pissing a bunch of people off.
---
About 50 rend kills so far, seen 3 offhands and one mainhand. Never even seen truestrike shoulders drop, atleast let me lose the roll for gods sake..
---
Will of the Forsaken friend ;) only person getting feared is you

---
You just lack the refined taste of a caveman. Also we have undercity which is basically a human city with green shit, and thundaboof is fairly pretty. And i guess taste is subjective but stormwind is so fucking blue it bores me. Ironforge and treeland aren't the worst.
---
This is gonna rub some people the wrong way but why is everyone always speculating on "classic+"? Like they've never given any indication of that. Every piece of marketing material they've put out on this game is a side project to recreate classic wow and have been hammering it has a nostalgia piece. I've seen no indication they'll add on to the game, a game that has been thoroughly surpassed by time. Like it is impossible for them to design new raids or dungeons for this game. The way blizz or any dev would make dungeons or raids has completely evolved. 
---
I say make peace with the fact that in a year, year and half all the phases will have rolled out and they'll either go to TBC servers or just let the project sit in auto-pilot.
---
It wasn‚Äôt *nerfed*
---
Are you running class color uf? Wondering if you also had to delete the first paragraph of code, since it colors both the name and healthbar by default
---
And the only thing more annoying than people who complain about people complaining about people complaining about people complaining about factions is getting one of those cut things in the corner of your mouth and realizing that you probably need to up your zink intake.
---
The thing about some of these 'inconveniences'.. they're good when players have tools to help solve them.  Traveling sucks, but that means Warlocks and Mages get to be *super* helpful to other players.  I can't remember the last time some random player whispered me in retail that wasn't spam, but in classic I feel like I get contacted constantly for help by random people.
---
This is why 'quality of life' is never as simple as it seems.
---
Enhance Shammy is a discount warrior, so that's prob second best.
---
Ask Barrens chat :)
---
Bingo.   I follow classic wow but I won't play it.  Instead I play private servers casually.  
---
If they can adopt classic principles, such as bring the class not the player (I chose a niche, I want to be accepted for it), private server stagnation  (if you can reach the carrot, you can do it at your own pace, and your characters remain relevant), with some modern QOL (but not flying mounts), they'd have my money!
---
I'm no doctor.  I can't give you recommendations, I'm sorry.  
---
For my problem, I need to not rest my arm on hard surfaces, or sit and type/ game too long.  Ice usually helps.
---
But again, if it gets worse, stop doing what you're doing and see a doctor.
---
They did you a favor...
---
Slightly alliance favored. I believe no more that 60-40.
---

Will we be able to transfer more than 1 character? I haven't seen this stated anywhere.

Dude it‚Äôs not speculation if you‚Äôve ever played an FPS and been trolled by a teamkiller.  They do something to inconvenience someone, for no gain besides their fun.   That‚Äôs legitimately what the people who I‚ÄôM REFERRING TO, are doing.
---
Big of you to not assume gender in the beginning. However you are being very discriminatory now. I need a safe space
---
I did it solo on a rogue in original, iirc i had to bring fire resist potions to swim through some lava.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the unnamed continents on the map!
---
I do agree with all the doing things super fast having it all done for them is too good for their long term enjoyment of the game, but I do think that if they didn‚Äôt do it that fast, other non streamers would and make their life a living hell to play, which would imo, kill the game faster for them.
---
holy shit this is exactly how I hit 60 too. kneel and everything
---
Pots in a duel claims the other guy sucks...

I think you look funky fresh

tl:dr Low level Horde, made a friend to finish quest. Friends gets attacked by alliance and he sacrifices himself as a way to say thanks... But the way he wrote it.... was WAAAAYYYY better 10/10 read

Reminds me of that time I was in a RFC group with the leader being a Shammy and 2 rogues (one was me), hunter and priest.
---
I left the group whispering the leader that he should replace me with someone who wears mail to not waste the mail drops. 
---
And I got an angry reply back saying "Fuck you noob shaman cant wear mail till 40".
---
Replied saying "did you even read what I typed" but ignored lol. All for the better I guess.
---
This comment brought to you by a huntard.
---
Thank you i loved this
---
Thinking of making a healing alt, already eliminated Druid and shaman but struggling to chose between priest and pally.  My main concern is which one will be better/more fun at 60.  Paladins have plate and are supposed to be much less squishy than priests but I‚Äôve heard repeatedly that their damage sucks and that makes solo play sound terrible (and I frequently go solo).  Will mainly (like 90%) do pve with some pvp on the side so min-maxing pvp isn‚Äôt a big concern.  I mainly want to know which one I can spec into the best healing talents and not have to respec frequently to do other stuff.  Of lesser importance is whichever is easier to play, especially which one has less spells to juggle in combat, which is another point against pallies (I think?). So right now I‚Äôm leaning towards priest but I‚Äôm at that awkward point where I can‚Äôt say for certain and I‚Äôm wasting time I could spend leveling thinking about it.
---
Minor note, I absolutely refuse to play dwarf which is apparently the best race for both classes on alliance (just don‚Äôt like their design) so not sure how much that matters.
---
Same shit with chests. Oh gawd. Once i was clearing mobs to get to the chest, and a hunter came out of nowhere and starting looting it. I had some stern words and the dude stopped looting and said ‚Äúwhy dont we roll for the chest?‚Äù. That pissed me off even more lol. Ppl need to learn chest/node etiquette
---
But Alliance always kills me, and Horde never does

Video games are a problem?  I was loosely saying ‚Äútoo many years‚Äù. Because yeah I could be trying to be a ripped genius millionaire instead of play WoW as much.  But I don‚Äôt see the problem, and why you gotta reply and downvote every comment I make lol.
---
30-40% is high depending on how you define dedicated raid guilds. The ones who have been doing it on pservers already will smash it.

It's pretty typical that BoEs are "everyone need" because some can be insanely valuable due to being twink items. Although it *is* an upgrade for you, reasonably speaking you shouldn't equip it because the upgrade will get replaced while that money would mean quite a bit long term.
---
Anyway, as a result blue/purple BoEs are considered fair game for everyone.
---
You would think if you truly are as great as the game makes you seem, you'd be that big too
---
First macro:
---
/cast Pet Attack
---
/cast !&lt;spell name&gt;
---
Second macro
---
/use or /cast !shoot
---
The ! will take max rank and stop any on/off toggling.
---
I think regardless of how you or I feel about it, these people will continue to roll need on any BoE.
---
What I do is wait to roll, see what other people choose (need or greed). If it's clear that people are need rolling to sell it, I will also roll need.
---
lol not a single mage aoe farming out of instances will face any consequences
---
" Is it time to farm mobs and **dungeons**"
---
Yes,  yes it is!

Yes this, so annoyed if I want to talk about something that happened it must be "complaining" and some edgelords have to prove themselves in general

I personally find TSM overkill for what I want, as well as finding it ugly to use.  I just use auctionator and that is plenty enough for me.

Why would anyone want to be a night elf
---
Definitely not 30s, majority of my guild are really early 20s
---
no it's not, there was no paid service during vanilla for gender changes.
---
being completely honest, i feel like stream culture is the worst thing to ever happen to gaming in general. not that anything really happened to gaming before that. but the thing that has happened kinda sucks.
---
Heh heh you have done well to infuriate an alliance no lifer, noble tauren of the horde.
---
Wow you can actually organize groups to kill Horde on your realm?
---
Surviving is about all I can do! The killing is the hard part.
---
That‚Äôs good that your streamer is nice and kept together, always refreshing to hear a positive about streaming on this subreddit. 
---
As for faerlina, i don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs actually had to much of a queue besides prime time 5pm-10pm. That‚Äôs just me seeing the ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù or ‚ÄúFull‚Äù though. i tried to get in once then though and it was only like a 2-3k queue either way.

I got a feeling that you don't know the whole story. This doesn't seem like a very reasonable thing to have done for something as silly as you not congratulating someone on hitting 60. This sounds like your GM was looking for a reason to remove you from the guild already and this was the best that he could come up with. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong but the fact they had already put you on ignore before you could even respond is telling to me. They wanted you out of the guild and they found a way to remove you from the guild and then immediately put you on ignore before you could argue it because they knew it was unreasonable.
---
They did that on a pserver I was on (coupled with H-&gt;A transfer which is 100% out of the question) and it worked.  I doubt they would do it but it would certainly help.  Even a weighted one that left it above 1:1 would make a difference.
---
I‚Äôm Smolderweb horde too!
---
the only people ive met that can't pay for a mount at 40 are people that were too lazy to level any professions.
---
Didn't they give orcs am option to stand straight in retail?
---
And I'm trying to explain that the two scenarios aren't the same, what you're doing is called a false equivalence logical fallacy.
---
The two scenarios aren't the same because in one you are actively killing teammates which only hinders your team, this is a net determintal effect for your team. 
---
In WoW you kill the *opposing* faction, which is a net bonus for your faction (in a sense). 
---
Just because *you* think they're both griefing, doesn't make them the same.
---
How do I *reeeeeeeeach* theeeese noobs

No, no I'm good

It seems to me that horde players are generally tryhard dickheads, with alliance players just here to chill and play the game. Of course this is a stereotype, but a lot of stereotypes are based in a small amount of truth...
---
Haha wow. Garbage players. Like others said, they did you a favor. The ignores are a bonus, you don't ever have to deal with them again.
---
On a BC private server I got Azpis
---
Asspiss will always be my imp name no matter where I go
---
Is there a was to keybind stance change as a warrior with or without addons?
---
Dude yes! This was mine on a BC server. I was so hoping for Asspiss again :(
---
I can understand that view. In my opinion i think more positives have come out of it than negatives at least in the long run. But I don‚Äôt know everyone‚Äôs story, so it‚Äôs different for everyone. I like the streamers themselves but the only part i dislike is the fanboy culture around them.
---
250BS here, undecided armor or weapon, where can I read about all the restrictions between the two and what I can and can‚Äôt make because of the decision?
---
What do you mean not true to vanilla? Mages could do this just as easily back then.
---
Why I run Improved Sprint for world Pvp. Can beat any mage

People like you are the worst part about this game

I came here to personally endorse this and any further messages about the capturing of this image.

I think if I got a spam about buying gold with this kind of RP  I would vomit blood.

I feel like that subreddit name is missing a bbw somewhere in it after doing a quick browse

Ya. It is bad. That is why we wanted Classic WoW back.
---
You place the Atlasworldmap folder in the interface folder not addons to work.
---
Does your name have anything to do with Bay Shore, NY?
---
Can it be used on the opposite faction?
---
pretty much every healer is capable of soloing without respeccing. you have access to every spell in vanilla my dude. talents only make things a bit easier.
---
No post on sunday
---
They would have to scale TBC to be either a 60 zone, or make the zones scale from 20-60. Make the raids scale from tier 1 - 3. Otherwise that old content pretty much dies.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind streamers and find them mildly entertaining to bluetooth during my many 4-5+ hour drives for work. I am sure some of them are scumbags but honestly a lot of people I know day to day are scumbags.
---
Hey at least when they out level you you can ask them to help you power through dungeons/craft things for you/loan you gold
---
Why are you on this sub? And who hurt you?
---
Used to be the GM of a guild called Latinus Ominous. One of my better guild names imo
---
Yeah im on the same server, just wondering if a repeat of china #1 was inc
---
Sounds like you need a break from Reddit, big guy.
---
&gt; (abusing geometry to freely attack players in moderated contested zones such as Booty Bay/Gadgetzan, stated to be against TOS by Blizzard as exploitation). 
---
Is it? We have a multibotter on our server (5 mages) that abuses the roof of the cage in Gadgetzan to kill people (with one-shots) without the guards doing anything. Some players said it's allowed some said it's not.

i feel like its removing individuality from the next generation of gamers. they all sound the same these days, and i almost compare the streamers to megachurch pastors just playing the crowd for free money lol
---
They aren't out yet. But yeah they are the best potion.
---
He's right, though. Sure, there are probably optimal combos you can perform against easy opponent's, but this is a 15 year old game, and most are going to see those combos coming a while away.
---
In practice, PvP plays out more like a bunch of disjointed "if/then" statements revolving around which cooldowns you have available or how much gold you're willing to burn.

WoW players love to ACHTUALLY anyone in chat they can
---
Horde is literally the reddit faction. And yes, that‚Äôs an insult.
---
Even before MoP, he played on my server in Wrath but only had 15 Shamans at the time and would sit in Org chain healing to make cool designs with the beams. Had the same character names and guild name.
---
He was kinda a dick so I worked with Alliance players to bait him down to Tanaris one time, as soon as he landed a huge group of Alli aoe'd him down, dude just logged off. I'm sure I have screenshots on my old laptop harddrive.
---
He was still playing retail when I quit a few months back but I think switched to Alliance, so yea, 40 accounts and then at least 40 faction changes, dude is loaded.
---
Your wife is having a baby and you are playing WoW that's seriously fucked. Man up

&gt;we killed some ally Mage that tried to come take his farm spot too. 
---
Wow. Beautiful. I tried to get my fellow alliance to help me clear out the Horde from Sorrow Hill GY in WPL and one of the people I asked just emoted the Horde and watched as I died to several of them.
---
Okay, no need to convince me you're enjoying yourself, you sound perfectly happy.
---
Hope you enjoy the PvP server!
---
Truly, reading comments on 1k+ mob grinds has me stoked for end game in WoW - the game isnt ready for the sweaty dedication that osrs has bred
---
also worth noting that the buyback tab is global, you can sell something to a vendor in middleofnowhere and then hearth to a major city and buy it back from any vendor there
---
I was a shadowstep rogue with a resto druid partner. We fought a resto shaman/resto druid pair for 3 hours once. Several times I tried different poison combos, but we couldn't keep debuffs on long enough to actually kill, and they didn't have the damage to out-dps my resto druid.
---
Who needs college when you can put a Kel'Thuzad kill on your resume?

I hated it until I learned to use it. Once you set it up there‚Äôs really not much to it. Just let it work for you and make money.
---
Yeah, it's funny when the horde majority (not all horde though!) gank relentlessly on PvP servers which slowly and steadily turns away Alliance players from that server which in the end renders it a PvE server since there isn't any sharding.
---
They don't just ruin the game for Alliance, they are actually ruining it for themselves too in the long run.
---
Sigmar preserve us.
---
I don‚Äôt see the connection to the streamers removing individuality of gamers, can you please elaborate on that more so i can understand?

And there goes theremore

Really?

Don't forget gilneas.

Petite feet. Feminine step. Sounds like a lady when the tigers start to mount.

Osrs is the ultimate grind of all time. And I always love every second of it. Sorta.

i did :d
---
That's my gear goal too, get that set and then pug finish mc, ony, zg and aq20. All doable on a casual schedule. Getting fully geared out from those raids is another story, im not so focused on getting that gear just clearing those.

Congrats, now you can find a less shitty guild that isn't fully of petty twats
---
It does! It is just a visual bug that has been fixed in today's updates.
---
I just wanna say that the blue post from your update is *amazing.* This is the kind of community interaction I've always wanted to see from Blizzard--treating the players as invested parties and explaining things in technical (game-technical, anyway) detail. They provided such a good breakdown on the bugs causing this behavior. I hope they continue on with that kind of candor through the rest of Classic and beyond.
---
I think it was a joke homie
---
...wait, she did WHAT?
---
His channel is great, i didn't know he streamed but i don't really watch streamers.
---
Only joke here is you :)
---
Uhhhh where have you been. This is literally why people are being banned.
---
lol
---
Going by those comments, I'm not the only one who never noticed anything. So either way it was scuffed.
---
We shall fight on fhe boats... and Mind Control them off!
---
It's Dal Rends but at this phase in the game I don't feel right taking it away from melee classes who it benefits WAY more
---
Definitely what I‚Äôm doing right now. We‚Äôll see if it pays off!
---
But you still get a power creep through more raids unless they add a new kind of attunement.
---
Sure, bud.  I don't know why you're bending over backwards to defend something so clearly wrong, but you do you.  Keep saying dumb shit and whining when people downvote it ;)
---
Oh boy suboptimal runs are the shit, did a 4x mage and sham healer WC run where we had to kite the unslowable
---
By this logic, I should be able to buy my way to 60 because I don‚Äôt enjoy leveling.
---
They're worth way more.
---
The prices are deflated because there are so many more casual players compared to hardcore.. meaning items like Edgemaster's are way more common  than the hardcore people who know true value. Drives the price down.
---
They are BiS thru the entire expansion for warriors. You hit more, you hit harder, you get more rage, letting you hit more and hit harder. It's a compounding effect.
---
You have been productive :) I will think about it tonight, see if I am willing to do again.
---
They actually stated Old School RS was a template for building Classic. That might not mean anything however OSRS has had new unique updates from a seperate development team branching off into an alternate version of itself, hence why people are talking about Classic+.
---
Used to play UO. I played on Catskills, stopped playing about a year after the Age Of Shadows expansion.

Grinding in Runescape takes a lot less effort, attention and skill. Ita a game that you can play while watching a movie, barely having to look at what you are doing.

Use your keyboard and talk to them if you don't have time between pulls.

are you sure it wasn't because the transfer timing ended? on forums there are players saying you can

---
It‚Äôs poorly enforced, but yes, exploiting the AI/pathing of NPCs in order to allow uncontested PvP in those zones is just that, an exploit. Record instances of this happening and record time stamps for when this person has killed you or others. Then report exploitation of safespotting. Repeated offenses are what they‚Äôre looking for. Killing one dude from a safespot is one thing, taking over Gadgetzan with multiple clients abusing the cage and repeatedly doing so in order to ruin the fun of others will quickly earn a ban.

You know those mobs that net you for like 8 seconds and run just out of melee range, but close enough so you can't shoot them?

Don‚Äôt forget that even instances that are out of the way, they can teleport to (Gnomer)

Are you on Herod? Can we be best buddies plz?!?

You seem to have some pent up stress, wanna talk about it over some in game fishing?
---
This happens to me a lot. I suck at being a shamy and whenever I get in a party, I hate having low damage and try to heal and whatnot as much as I can. Whenever I see low levels struggling with strong mobs, I usually jump in their parties and help them finish their quests. I'm lvl41 and still sucking =D
---
why is everything a nazi to you people are you 15 or just mentally diminished?
---
Imo shadow is good for group PvP with dispels offensively and defensively, whilst maintaining distance from threatful opponents. Silencing at the right time, pw:shield yourself and the party. But when it comes down to solo you may have to come out of shadow and fake heal til they silence\kick and top yourself up waiting for fear to come back around
---
Put a \\ before your \^
---
Annnnnd leveling takes forever because you kill as few mobs as possible.

Genuine question, why play as a human?

i don get it

I too enjoy ganking really low levels, very cool!

Mind Soothe is amazing. You‚Äôll be the hero of Dire Maul as your group tries to skip as many pulls as possible.
---
They give less but it's worth doing regardless
---
&gt;hunter preraid bis
---
2x Bone Slicing Hatchet or Peacemaker are practically just as good for Hunter and have no competition.
---
Thanks so much, it seems its better to put talents into fury and then switch to arms at 40. 
---
Do you know if hamstring kiting still works? A few videos suggested doing that to reduce damage in between kills
---
Congrats on your inability to kill a helpless opponent?
---
It is literally off the beaten path with no visual indicators that there is anything there. Its very easy to travel right though that area without even noticing that it exists, if you aren't farming herbs or ore while much higher level than the mobs in the zone its really easy to just stick to the path and run/ride right past Thalanaar. Not everyone is studying a blank in game map for hidden settlements, thats probably the only settlement that is not  on an easy to follow path in the whole game. 
---
Plus look at the contrast of the zones, an Alliance player is probably coming from Teramore so they've ran though a gray swamp, went though the broad plains of the Barrens, though the canyons of Thousand Needles then they see lush wild rainforrest of Feralas right in front of them.
---
You can‚Äôt tell people like that stuff. They‚Äôd rather tag the ones you got to spawn than kill unrelated stuff.
---
Of course it was a hunter.
---
Even the ironbound boxes are worth 1-2g on average
---
I fucking lost my mind when I learned this the other night. I was bitching about not being able to skin gnolls, because come on, they're dog-people or something, they've got leather, but when the dead worgen lit up with the skin icon, I knew there was only one thing to do.
---
Yes and blue or purple but yeah
---
no, but you‚Äôre never shown how to switch them, afaik. languages in retail are great because two opposite faction DHs can chat in demonic, or a void elf and blood elf in Thalassian. i‚Äôve had some good chats like that :)
---
&gt;1: I haven't had fun in years and I hate when others can
---
&gt;1: I always knew the alliance was nitpicking and biased. I win bye bye
---
Rogues seem bad in dungeons because of AoE meta, but I assure you they are top DPS on single target.  At least until the contenders get geared.
---
Good read
---
have you considering bringing this up with him like the adult he is now?
---
True true
---
really the game makes it all possible the software just sends commands to all the clients at the same time
---
I only join melee heavy groups now. The AOE meta only works if the AOErs are competent and most of them just aren't.
---
Coming back to Classic from FF14, rezzing has just become second nature to me when I see someone dead.
---
Only one person can mine a node at a time.
---
Now is the time to gank low levels before honor comes out in phase 2.

It's a female Dwarf!!!

Never going to get through to a PvE'er stuck on a PvP realm man.

I wanna say this is a great shitpost but it's not even a shitpost
---
I almost never jump, I honestly thought the nake the jump thing was just a joke
---
Ravager still hits them.
---
People seem to be under the impression that the way everything is working is, by definition, correct. There can still be bugs ffs.
---
I got told that the bug where running in fear mobs that are near death never eventually turn around and come back for you was just how vanilla was...
---
Smoulderweb has been so much fun. Just about to hit 42
---
What did you think it was? Like timed based? Not trying to be rude btw, just genuinely curious how you thought it might work. 
---
And just so you're more informed now, typically a node can be mined 2-3 times (sometimes more if you're a god) before it disappears. So let's say a node has 2 hits in it (which btw there isn't a way to know how many hits it has left) If you mine it once and someone else mines it once it's gone.
---
If you're concerned someone will try and steal a hit from your node, don't autoloot the node (so if you have autoloot enabled hold shit when you mine it). This will keep the loot the window open and the node can't be mined until you take the loot. Keep the loot window open for like 10 seconds and most people will get tired of waiting on you and run off so you can safely continue mining the node
---
This has happened to me twice now. First time a rogue took them both then got an upgrade the next day :D.
---
Aka, shaman gear.
---
Haha subscribe

Atleast mention which server so i can stay away from it,otherwise this is just a bs story

I‚Äôm not sure if anything is actually more cringe than your comment.

This hate is what propels him forward, literally no difference between these complaints and a jealous persons complaints 
---
Clarification: never seen him
---
The only perspective I have of this game is the experience of levelling a paladin to 16 and a troll hunter to 5. 
---
Can someone explain that dragon and can you even kill it? Where even is this? That's the coolest shit.

I had it drop yesterday on a toon that isn't an enchanter.

Damn smug dwarves...

I'll add him to mine as well.

It really is. The dreadlord reveal in strath is great, but I want the rest of the story!

That's what I need. I don't really care where they are but if I see them cross my path I want to be able to remember who they are. Like at a glance.
---
Heartseeker right now
---
They don't have their own server
---
Clearly that guild and the people running it are a bunch of clowns. You're better off not playing games with them and I will be shocked if the guild doesn't self immolate in a few months.  Sorry that these bottom feeders got you down.

I like a couple of streamers, but I hate the super fans.

I keep it on in the background but some people just sit there and spam their chat? I don't get it

He's paying $600/month. He has a very high paying job with lots of downtime to play WoW. Something about statistics for jewelry companies IIRC.

Noice
---
This legit happened to me 4 times last night and at that point I was just fucking done.
---
Hmm wonder what the issue is ? I sit between 16-19% crit on my warrior without any crit gear and just a bit of agility. But take away the bonus 10% crit from my talents that‚Äôs still between 6-9% which is a decent amount ahead of you still. Your right seems weird
---
I take it every time :)
---
This is the same conclusion I've come to as well.
---
This was a good death! 
---
Cheers!
---
Get rid of that shitty motivational cliche thing and it's perfect

&gt; Also miss having actual towns and cities rather than mud huts and tents with a flight point
---
Someone came from a life of privilege in the world..............of warcraft.
---
You think they didn't tell the other guy about a rather obscure game mechanic that could've been explained in a single whisper because the guy chose not to kill mobs that weren't relevant to his quest? I genuinely don't understand the argument here.
---
Great story. Makes me wish BE were in or Tauren could be pally. ;( I really wanted to roll holy pally as one of my characters so we went Alliance.
---
It's great world building.
---
Check the mirror.  You'll find it no problem.
---
YOU MUST LOG IN EVERY DAY AND DO TASKS NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE THE HIGHEST iLVL POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO REACH THE HIGHEST LFG QUE POSSIBLE NO EXCEPTIONS OH YOU CLEARED THAT FINAL BOSS? TOO BAD IT DIDNT TITANFORGE THE LOOT SO YOU GOTTA DO IT 20 MORE TIMES.

lol guys if we aggro Doom Lord kazzak we can get him to stormwind and watch him kill the entire city
---
I just travelled all across the globe to Booty Bay to get artisan mining....and the goblin won't even talk to me! How much booty Bay rep do I need to get? I've also gotten mixed answers on just getting it in Org...is that a possibility? Thanks.
---
You hit a lvl 40, minimum, multiple times as a lvl 18.  Best player on the server.
---
Replace raptors with a 2 or 3 man squad of roaming Horde and it would be accurate
---
That was wonderful, thank you.
---
Wait, this isn't cross-faction right? Otherwise you could abuse it to communicate with the enemy
---
Yeah you missed some pretty big stuff lol
---
Smolderweb horde is very friendly. Love it here.
---
Are there BETTER gloves for Undead cloth farming?
---
Imagine playing a fantasy MMO and playing a human lol
---
"productive", haha. i have no life just say it!!! 
---
but yes, think about it! leveling up will be quicker since you've already done it once.
---
Wow the story we needed
---
No comparison here I think. People enjoy the game how they want to enjoy the game. The place I think Streamers and their culture overstep is when they get their joy by robbing others of theirs. That aside...I think it's nice that the streamers mostly ended up on one major server. They get theirs. We get ours. This is a game for everyone.
---
That said, streamer or casual, I take much higher offence from people for how they conduct themselves. Streamers tend to be sensationalist and that brings out a lot of bad behavior, but I'll put anyone who acts like a right git directly onto my personal blacklist. No second chances. It's a big world.
---
Wait what got removed? I‚Äôm reading this thread outta context and I‚Äôm not liking it. Too much thinking and assuming going into it.
---
TB is canyons in some mud huts.
---
Eh, Dal'Rend's *does* gives 0.5% more crit at the cost of 2 AP, but a Hunter should still pass on them (assuming someone else needs them) considering they have other options.
---
Even at level 48 last night in Mara I was getting sick of it. Everyone was expecting me to hold aggro on 4 mob pulls (the most awkward number of mobs to hold aoe agro on, 1 too many for sunder tab spam and 1 too few for Demo Shout spam) and the DPS were just opening up on the pull. Sometimes the Hunter was doing the pulling, sometimes the rogue was doing the pulling. The mage was CoC nuking them before I even had time to change to defensive stance after charging. 
---
"Just Challenging Shout" the Hunter said apparently not understanding it has 10min cool down.
---
"This other warrior tank could hold agro off me" said the rogue. Good for that warrior he must be far more amazing than I.
---
"I should have joined a spellcleave group" said the mage after dying from pulling aggro on the stone giants while he was in melee range to CoC.
---
I wanted the classic experience and I occasionally get a dungeon group that is chill and let's me sunder before doing damage. That will CC the annoying healer mobs. That run to the tank of they pull aggro and not try and solo kite it into another damn pack that wipes us. I really hope these players with a "go go chain pull groups now" leave soon. Because they're gonna get a real shock at 60 when none of this will fly.
---
He will burn every bridge in his guild and on the server quick with that attitude lol
---
The data is really bad. If you look at classicrealm.info you'll see that Bigglesworth has 100k characters, far more than Herod and the same as Faerlina. If you look at that Wowhead list, most of them are around 70k characters which means it is woefully incomplete census data.
---
Considering how census collection works (/who spam that takes an hour+) having samples collected over weeks means the data will look very different from if you just run it once. This is *particularly* the case at lower levels, since those players likely play less, and there are easily 2-3 thousand per level.
---
You might have missed the second half of season 3
---
We all know Thrall is the best.
---
This was the main reason I tried out tanking for the first time all those years ago. I've never regretted it.
---
Great story! Although it‚Äôs sad that the priest got away, I‚Äôm glad that the heroic warrior slayed the Tauren in the end. 
---
Grab your sword and fight the horde! For the alliance!
---
Oh no some random redditor that literally does nothing but bitch about hord players thinks I know a fake language and have merchandise what ever will I do?  
---
P.s. not everyone is as pathetic as you. Most of us do infact have actual lives.
---
Once per week, not something you can bank on for weapon upgrades early in game. More so in pugs.
---
Hey that's a great idea!
---
I've tried the feign death +trap technique and it worked a couple of times but idk what I'm doing wrong I don't get to trap all the time, seems to be because my pet is still in combat
---
I know a few people that basically traded account shares to get it.
---
This is what Classic is all about. Well done friend
---
bet me 1000g that I‚Äôm not on horde skeram leveling rn and I‚Äôll give you NAMES of horde 60s that I PM‚Äôd calling them out for being shit at PvP ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Meaning I‚Äôve told people that before , and it didn‚Äôt matter. They just kept running around looking only for what they need.
---
gets baked on stream too
---
How is that cringey?
---
Yes, 43
---
Now here's a true gamer
---
Yes everyone is expecting speed runs and perfection.  Rarely do I even see polymorph or sap used in dungeons. I‚Äôve played with some of the best tanks I‚Äôve ever played with that handle it like champs but others just can‚Äôt and I can‚Äôt fully blame them
---
Warchiefette

Dear Fury or Arms warrior tanking the dungeon.  Please use a macro to mark your target with skull.  Then tab sunder the other mobs and switch back to the skull.
---
Please at 30% health, start sunders on the next target while the dps finish off the original target.
---
Me too and I loathe grinding tortollan rep but the drak iron came naturally as I was playing the war campaign
---
I'm a druid but I totally feel you.
---
I already said I didn‚Äôt expect anything different especially on such an imbalanced server.
---
You accept the rig quest then the teleporter one becomes available.
---
Lol! And his name is even Tinypp. I wonder if he's even aware thats slang for tiny penis. Thats so funny!
---
I have a hard time believing a DPS is best as support. There's gotta be am objectively right way around this, and sinking 40% mana in hopes of juking doesn't seem right.
---
It's a great thought though. Maybe you just stay out of shadow form thereafter, but then you can't 2v1 and I know SP can.
---
I've gotta do more research lol.
---
&gt; This gives you the ability to jump around and play something different if you don't feel like playing the class you played the day before
---
Also my number one strat if some level ?? guy ganks me in the same area more than once.
---
I play on golemagg, when you join around 6pm you are catched in 1-2 hour long queue on daily basis.
---
And i would say that Gehenass or Shazzrah won't be much better around this time.
---
Easier than tanking while leveling.
---
Aesthetic maybe? I know I personally would rather like how my character looks and have worse stats/racials.
---
Oh well, atleast one ad isnt that annoying. Dont know if you have more though
---
Same here, I played a Warrior in vanilla and wanted to play the opposit of that. So I figured either Mage or Priesr and settled on Mage. I'm 57 now,  so no going back lol. I'm loving my frost mage though, its so much damn fun.
---
&gt;Dps is easiest
---
And when you go all out, you become the tank too!  
---
I was once the unofficial trash mob tank on my mage because I pulled aggro too easily, so it just became a game for the healers to keep me up while I tanked the trash.
---
Ranged crit is lower than melee crit. I think it's always been that way. So it's not fair to compare for example a warrior having 15-16% crit.
---
Since other people have answered I'm going to piggy-back from a hunter's POV.
---
Yes, you should be using your pet to offtank if the healer draws agro. Send it at the mob and turn growl on/use intimidate until the tank can pick it up.
---
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre not all spread on different realms. mostly for the faction imbalance side of that conversation though. it would be awful if servers were super one sided. 
---
And yeah, being a ass gets no excuse.
---
I never raided past LFR, and pretty much exclusively played PvP and only ever rolled PvP servers but.. ima  ‚ÄúPvE‚Äôer‚Äù... fuck üòì
---
Yeah, as a dorf with treasure sense, I've had a couple of instances where I work my way through a enemy camp burrowing in to a chest I can see is in there. Any player who comes by when I'm getting down to the last couple of mobs has me like: https://i.imgflip.com/z4gw6.jpg
---
Basically same as regular Layering but in a Dungeon or Raid
---
On a boat, of course
---
Smolderweb horde too!!  What's your name?
---
I started playing classic recently, is there a reason people seem to generally prefer the horde?
---
Incorrect, but continue thinking it if you want
---
A couple years back I had gone back to my hometown to visit my sick mother. I popped in at the local pharmacy and I saw Jared in an aisle. At first I wasn't sure who he was but I knew he looked extremely familiar. It took me maybe 5 minutes when I remembered and went up and introduced myself. It was pretty awesome!
---
He means minority. He's saying the minority faction leaving just makes the imbalance worse.
---
Most of the "criticism" I've seen is people being mad not actual criticism.
---
Ahhh layers. That makes sense. I wondered what was going on with the buffs there.
---
The best thing to do is to enter a fight with 60 or more rage. Pool when you have shit under control. Bloodrage after the fight as you move to the next pack. People start drinking right then. Go pull and build up that threat for a couple seconds while they finish drinking. Rinse and repeat
---
Not always possible but it helps a shit ton when you can. Requires a good cadence
---
Bold of you to assume you‚Äôd be invited to the org
---
I multibox. Not selling any accounts.
---
He's said it himself he doesn't consider it a real job.
---
This was an emotional rollercoaster. Beatiful.
---
I think he makes an appearance in WOD as well as being a part of the hunter questline I think.
---
Wow that guy didnt spend his entire life grinding to 60 since the game launched because he has other stuff in life that probably calls for his attention? What a fucking loser.
---
Memes aside it's actually very well itemized belt that's good or great for all classes capable of wearing leather.
---
- Shamans get AP from Strength and none from Agility (They only start wanting agility when they get flurry, where it becomes their primary stat)
---
- Feral druids benefit greatly from strength (strength gives them 2AP while in all forms but agility only gives them 1AP and only when they're in cat form)
---
- Rogues get 1AP from strength (meaning that although 4agi would be better due to also granting crit and dodge, 4str is still good)
---
- Warriors and Paladins, naturally, get 2ap from strength (and while many might say "But they should be wearing mail!" the through is that many of their best pieces while leveling/twinking and dpsing are leather, such as Blackened Defias Armor &amp; Leggings of the Fang until nearly 30~35 or Truestrike Shoulders &amp; devilsaur for fury/ret pre-raid BiS)
---
This is why when I get attacked by a hunter, I never kill the hunter.  I just sheep the hunter, then kill their pet and blink away.  Sometimes after killing their pet but before blinking away, I walk up to the hunter-sheep, stand or move around in circles for a few seconds, then hit them once with my staff, then blink away.
---
It'll be interesting to see what happens to Faerlina in the next year or so. I'm sure that a lot of hype will die down by then and many streamers will move on. As someone else said, there might be a risk of a ghost town.
---
Have you tried killing a devilsaur for it to be ninja by someone else ?
---
This also occurs in lower level zones, but what you often see is that there are several types of mobs you have to kill, but it's never mentioned that they all share spawns.
---
So put on your murder-cap and get killin.
---
Agi enchants aren't until P3 iirc and Dire Msul releases which makes the argument moot anyway.
---
fuck are you talking about? they easy as fuck with a spider belt I can two shot them with daggers
---
I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool and clean set up with the perfect company.
---
I don‚Äôt want that.  I want to kill people that are also questing in my zone, competing with me for mobs and nodes etc.   even if they don‚Äôt want to fight.
---
Isn‚Äôt 40 accounts $600 a month?  That‚Äôs not bad considering 23 year olds are getting $80k cars when they live with their parents since no rent. 
---
Nothing against it, just saying that how someone uses their money is totally up to them.
---
I hate this.
---
Good luck farming essence as a warrior against the 25 aoe mages at silithus
---
Got mine on my 3rd mob &gt;.&gt;
---
They originally had an item that allowed that, unfortunately in vanilla it ended up in the hands of a player who abused it.
---
Saw a felstriker and chromatic scale (whatever is used for that BP) on the same drop/run and got them both on my warrior circa 2006. I think I was being helped by some old guildies who were onto AQ40 and had no need for it whatsoever so I got both. I was already even doing DW Fury so this was a huge upgrade.
---
You are one of the few.
---
Here are some low-effort and possibly semi-passive methods that you can use to get a steady supply of gold, although it might not be a massive gold per hour:
---
1. Level an alt to level 5, should take about 30 minutes if you're sufficiently speedy. Learn Enchanting and Engineering. Buy cheap copper, make Rough Boomstick, disenchant, craft Greater Magic Wand and vendor. If you do the math this turns out to put the value of a single Cooper Ore or Bar at around 1s20c, on average. Anything below that price is profit. It's not a lot for each, but it really adds up quickly. You might make somewhere between 3 and 5 gold an hour with this depending on your price, which isn't a crazy amount, but it's a nice lump of change of you regularly check for bargains and you can do it fairly passively and semi-automatically with some nice macros. In particular, look for cheap Copper Tubes.
---
While seaching for copper deals you can take a peek at the price of Magic Essences, as these might sell up to 5s below their value based on Magic Wand vendor prices, which also add up quickly. Similarly, look for cheap ilvl 11-15 (for Lesser Essences) and ilvl 16-20 green weapon to disenchant. Buy anything below 5s and 15s, respectively. Any Strange Dust you get is just a bonus, which you might be able to sell for 2s or 3s a piece on good days. In phase 5 the value of each Strange Dust will be 1s40c because of the wizard oils, but that's going to be a while. 
---
2. Take up fishing. At 150 skill you can fish in STV with a +75 lure and get crates from fishing pools. The coast line north of the river gives Iron crates and below it you get Mithril crates, containing bolts of cloth (silk and mageweave for Iron crates, Mageweave and Runecloth for Mithril), leather (heavy, thick, rugged), potions, a bit of gold and often green items. You might end up with a nice 14 slot bag drop as well. There's a ton of pools to fish from, and people are often too just doing quests to fight you. This should be fine around level 33, although you'll a bit of time avoiding mobs south of the river. North of the river there's way less things in your way, although the value per create is slightly less. Wreckage pools give 0-5 crates, while regular pools give about 1 create every other pool. The Firefin Snapper, Oily Blackmouth and Stonescale Eels are also fairly valuable by themselves.
---
This can also be a semi-passive process, depending on how contested the spots are.
---
Now you gotta get full POSTBIS.
---
u need spider belt without trinkets yet
---
Of course people will move on, Classic content isn‚Äôt infinite. But i think streamers that actually care for the game will come back intermittently. Whether it‚Äôs for raid day, or for new phases
---
Who gives a shit about how someone else thinks you should play the game. Play however you want to play!
---
Real shit tho had to remove Gmod from my acct because I would play DarkRP 10+ hours a day for weeks at a time and would do nothing else and be unable to exercise proper control over myself. I don‚Äôt regret it.
---
Dude did I say it was your post? You're so angry you can't even comprehend a simple reply. You're beyond help at this point, good luck to ya.
---
Print screen is a button on your keyboard.
---
All the pvp sets are really good around Phase 1/2/3 (that is pre AQ release). If we assume you have some sort of job or family and you max out at rank 10/11, raid gear is better, but pvp gear is totally competitive. Keep in mind though the PvP gear is tailored to a spec, so for priest that's shadow, or for pally that's ret. So if you don't want to play that spec than the pvp gear really sucks!  
---
When AQ comes out, and then especially when Naxx gear comes out, raiders pull far ahead. Even rank 14 gear is pretty poor compared to naxx gear, but it remains to be seen how popular raiding and getting full T3 is.
---
What a tool.
---
Fuck youre on Skeram in your 30s in STV? You sound like the perfect little shit to corpse camp.
---
That was an extremely wholesome experience. 10 points to griffendor.
---
I healed armory with a 42 shaman in full mail as the tank. Fun and easy.
---
RFD with the 39 shaman in leather took a bit longer.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre companionship is worth the repair bill. Catch you down the line.‚Äù
---
When coming into the Stormwind you can see the Cathedral of Light from the front gates. However, in reality the real Cathedral is too far away from the gates to be seen from this angle.
---
It's a simple trick which makes the city's skyline look more impressive when seen from the gates. It's done by having a "fake" cathedral right above the trade district which can only be seen from the otside.
---
Only cure for stupidity is death &amp; sometimes even that is a lesson they're too stupid to learn.

He‚Äôs an idiot. In the second picture on the listing he shows his character pane, and only marks out his name but leaves his guild name. Here‚Äôs the kicker, he‚Äôs the guild master of said guild, so he‚Äôs making it that much easier to pinpoint who he is
---
Nah dwarf rogue, briefly checked what all the commotion was about. Actually not commotion, it was quite tranquil.
---
Literally the second post I saw was captioned ‚ÄúGet ready boys, we‚Äôre off to Boner town‚Äù accompanied by a photo of a chick. 
---
People in glass houses...
---
There's a more broad set of items.  At least something drops there that rogues can use, unlike SM.
---
Just a fact at this point.
---
Yes! I had screen shots and all. They had macros for battle cries and yelled out their songs. Shit was amazing
---
As someone who was previously interested in the unseemly underbelly of the WoWverse, I decided to look into what grinding/power leveling was going for these days.
---
1-60 was like $1500 or something crazy. I calculated it at the time but I think it comes out to like $10/hour or similar. I don't think it was anywhere near that expensive back in the day. Granted, I think everyone was botting back then and that's probably not an option in New vanilla.
---
Wrong server bub.
---
Don't need it :) got over 12 earth's and 20 airs in the past 2 days. Roll up in a party, ffa loot. Easy Rep and PvP with control.

So there's like 5-6 upgrades every week that might drop from dalrends. Yes it might take a few weeks, but you're pretty much guaranteed one by the time anything comes out where you might really make use of it like honor rewards - and definitely by the time BWL is released.

Same thing as everyone else. It's easy when your full prebis

Not necessarily.  I have a stack of Black Lotus just from late night farming.  Never layer abused once.

For some reason his tank isn't pulling and is charging in, which is a ballsy move for a group thats wiping with a healer that can't get away from the group safely during a wipe.

Perfect example of /r/creepyasterisks. Jesus...

I saw people in the LookingForGroup channel of our server complaining about having their characters wiped to level 1.
---
...because of course they weren‚Äôt using the channel correctly.
---
34 v 40 doesn't mean anything to you I guess
---
Nice.
---
I level whatever has highest dps
---
My favorite t2 has to be... Well, Paladin actually, but I love Hunter comedically. Like, it's just so over the top and ridiculous, it might as well be BC armor. The neon purple base with gold trim and big ol' fuck-off dragon skulls all over it is just fantastic.
---
Pro tip

Don‚Äôt have friends.

"That's just your opinion"

Shared with like most people of the alliance.

Avoid cleave groups
---
Ran Armory with a friendly guy nearly 20 times, and we got to the point where I would know exactly when and where to drink so by the time he had enough threat on the pulls of 4-8 mobs that I could freecast blizzard without pulling off of him.
---
There's such a fine line between that and being OOM constantly though. Props to the tanks who know just how hard to push casters mana so we never have to stop for over 5-10 seconds.
---
Yikes
---
I'm a 47 mage on biggle. I'll keep an eye out for him. Idk what he did but he's on the KOS list now
---
Which nameplates addon are you using?
---
Pathetic power trip lol.
---
It‚Äôs also nice at 60 in Scholo and strat
---
Stealth in, go oposite where they are now (LoS), loot egg, die, take res sickness to save time, since you need to ride back most of the 10 minutes anyway.
---
TLDR : I got killed pvping
---
Why would you even consider equipping them if you‚Äôre going to level past 39? They‚Äôre BIS Twink for any melee class at that bracket and would sell for a lot in a few months
---
Yeah, seems that way.  There are good streamers who, if I get a chance, I'll watch.
---
It‚Äôs nice feeling useful!
---
Man original blood fang was so cool looking
---
ITT this unpopular thread:
---
butthurt people from herod
---
So wouldnt that be like 400 stacks? If you get 65 rep per time?
---
A number of people were banned earlier this week for farming ragnaros doing exactly that. It wasn't intended
---
5 Second Rule Timer is also good for Evocation. Sometimes you are wondering, why the last Evocation got you to 100% mana but the current doesn't - this is because of the ticks.
---
Yeah - I admit I'm feeling Priest. Played mage and warrior in retail before I quit 4-5 years ago.
---
Eh. This is good advice if it was still 2005. Any dungeon this guy has done, considering he's level 47, it an aoe fest that barely needs a tank to begin with. CCing, marking skulls, all that... is unnecessary and probably wastes more time than 'warlocks lifetapping' or 'mages having to drink between each pull' 
---
Some people are just stuck in the mentality that classic = 2005 strats, and that just isn't the case with the game we are playing. while leveling (and even at max level to some extent) everything is super easy, and doesn't need any of this.
---
As a holy priest: 
---
Please watch for YOUR health. Happens more offen than you think that the Tank Starts Pulling when he is Low on Health. It‚Äòs a guaranteed way that I end up getting the Aggro bc I have to heal Instant.
---
Cheers to my warrior brethren!

They didn't advertise it as such :/

Holy shit I literally watched Finding Nemo a few hours ago.

A classic WoW meme I‚Äôve been sharing recently with my friends. Always hilarious to listen to.
---
On a smaller server. No streamers I know of locally.
---
Only affect they've had for me is now people are wanting to AoE speed-run dungeons. It looks flashy &amp; cool on stream, but those guys have better gear &amp; are coordinated. 
---
Must PuGs are in mixed gear at best &amp; just wanting to watch their DPS meter climb.
---
I think there‚Äôs quite a few good ones. You just have to get through first impressions in some larger cases.
---
The real life equivalent is when a bank accidentally has an error in their system and you have $1,000,000 in your account. Just because something was unintentional doesn‚Äôt mean you get to benefit from the error.
---
Of course, rogues shreck people, it is known. :D
---
THATS A 50 DKP MINUS
---
These go for like 15-20g on my server already. So many of them.
---
To be fair your comment didn‚Äôt help the situation either :P
---
I feel like OP is taking flak from everyone else but he‚Äôs kind of right. Like, PvP is nonexistent when you‚Äôre just dying to lvl ?? Players camping your body or hunting you down, or vice versa.
---
In my mind, PvP should exist between players of around the same level where everyone has a fair chance more or less.
---
Can we get the guild name and server so we can all congratulate this guy for making it to 60?
---
He's looking in the mirror and contemplating his life's decisions.
---
Terrible advice, you will be oom before anything dies if its remotely close to your own level.
---
please reroll your giving rogues a bad name
---
Why would a level 25 priest pick a fight with a 60?  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read.
---
Damn, now this is shitposting
---
same in my server. and I mean, that would‚Äôve happened regardless, just not to the extent that it is all over

Too bad it‚Äôs not the future yet
---
I mean, objectively, there are over 600 members in the guild that are consistently active. So there's that.
---
Additionally anyone who seems to find my reddit post appealing and upvoting it. Not to mention the brainlet meme with over 11k upvotes that is currently on the top page of this WoW Classic community with over 350k members. That is by no means a mature post.
---
However, I'm sure that won't be enough "objective data" to dissuade you from your hard-pressed opinion.
---
Helicopter with a 40ft chainsaw ?
---
should go back to retail u can go 1-120 just in dungeons easy.. in only a few days.
---
The only justification you have behind wow being so popular is because of the nostalgia. You make no other references to why classic is successful at all.
---
Half your second reply is scolding me because you got your feelings hurt and has nothing to do with the discussion. I get you're trying to "win" by taking the moral high ground, but idgaf. Take it lmao you're still strong even if let you know that in undesirable ways.
---
Just thought I'd also add in here that trying to come across as an intellectual in a reddit wow thread is the real hilarious part. Just take a fee minutes to re read your post. You literally explained what cash cow means lmfao. How pretentious can you get my man
---
SOMETHING NEED DOING?
---
I'm a prot warrior. Even I need time to get aggro. It's a classic thing. Not only a levelling as thing
---
I JUST ZUG ZUG'D ON THE FLOOR
---
&gt;the skill seems to have been taken out of it
---
lol ok cya
---
Yup, I'm flagged all the time. I'm on a pvp server, why would I want to be completely safe in a horde zone, that's not in the spirit of the world.
---
Ooh shit.
---
You can kill it and it‚Äôs north of Stormwind a ways. There‚Äôs some fiery places, Searing Gorge and Flaming Steppes. When the Dark Iron dwarves wanted a swift victory over the other dwarven clans, they summoned Ragnaros (maybe you‚Äôve heard of him). That didn‚Äôt go well for anyone. Now, we have those two zones thanks to angry little men.

my main is a 46 warrior and i am planning on tanking at 60, can prot warriors pvp at all?
---
Yeah all my 23 year old friends that live with their parents have 80k cars. What?
---
Shouldve responded with cool,or even a na id rather not know when he asked you if youd like to know, or just dont respond, wouldve eaten the attention whores from the inside
---
Isn't the Precision talent a +5 to hit? So his rogue would be at 310 sword skill. So right off the bat they have the +5 hit needed.
---
Do people actually expect quests to take them all the way to 60 without any amount of grinding in between?
---
Heal battlegrounds? They aren't even out yet.
---
I wanna see the alliance version. I‚Äôd buy it.
---
Whats a good pvp spec for a 37 rogue ?
---
They just wait until the item drops/update the list every week depending on upgrades
---
**Dear Warriors:** if you want to tank dungeons lvl 45+, spec as a tank.
---
Ah bummer
---
are BGs coming out 3 months later in phase 3?
---
Thanks for the tip. I did consult ice veins when I rolled lock, defo going with affliction
---
Player housing is the rumor due to private servers exploring the whole of azeroth.
---
I believe that is the housing one and the one in between old town and trade in the water was a dungeon or raid for even deeper in the prison
---
Unless Precision doesn't actually give +5 to hit then you're right.
---
Fake news. Alliance don't gank lobbies.
---
Yes... but half of his complaints were about things that make the dungeon take longer. Like lifetap, or mages drinking, or whatever. 
---
Unnecessary cc also makes it take longer, but that one is encouraged?
---
You can also just drag stances to your action bar from spellbook and click like regular abilities
---
You certainly can be very competitive in pvp with just the pvp rewards. PvP sets usually sacrifice a bit of damage for more stamina, in most cases this is exactly what you want. Trinkets might be the only thing that is different, but most trinkets you want aren't from raids.
---
Honestly though, the difference is not going to be huge, and other factors will be much larger. Skill, team co-ordination, class mismatch will have a bigger impact that a few more points of damage.
---
I'll try suggesting this
---
Lol wtf. Turn based rpg
---
And Arthas is an undead human
---
Yea if you bring the murlocs into the horde you peasants can finally upgrade from your poo poo huts!

You can say that but if that's how you define a "real job" then it doesn't mean anything.
---
Back in the day at age 12 i saved up for months to hire a power leveler to make me an alt while i was stuck camping for a few weeks. Came back to my account perma-banned for botting :(

I‚Äôm glad I just got confirmation that my macro worked lol!
---
I was being facetious.

Welcome to a game that the community had to scream about bringing back for years because of how good it is, no we dont want change.

Don‚Äôt mean to hijack but I have a pseudo related comment. I‚Äôm brand new to WoW and dungeon etiquette.  If I see something I can use, I‚Äôll ask if people mind if I roll greed - which people appreciate. 
---
Just had a sought after sword drop in a dungeon (level 26 required). I‚Äôm a warrior and was tanking. Another warrior was running as DPS. I‚Äôm level 24 (almost 25) and he‚Äôs 26. He rolled need immediately, and I asked if he would mind if I rolled need too, to which the answer was something along the lines of him being DPS and me tanking, but that he didn‚Äôt care.
---
I won the need roll and he left. Granted the dungeon was finished, but I messaged him and asked if I had done something wrong. He said yes, that basically the sword should have been his since he was DPS, but said it was fine. I replied that I also run DPS and was confused, apologized for taking the sword. 
---
I eventually sent him some gold since I felt bad, but I‚Äôm still not sure if I did anything wrong. How badly was I in the wrong there? If I‚Äôm tanking as a warrior, is it poor etiquette to roll on good warrior leveling weapons?
---
Looks like u got our when the getting was good.
---
No damned letters today!
---
It DOES.
---
So this is why I have to wait 3 hours in a queue?
---
Seems like the guild is prioritizing gearing a few people out completely. That might be ok if those people stick around and keep raiding, or if your guild is big enough to bring in new people when they leave after geared out.
---
Another issue is you are playing mage, and I feel like mages are the most common class at 60 right now.
---
Even if the queues aren't long, it's going to be a clusterfuck when layering goes away.
---
There are several of those (the towers in the middle of the canals have them too) no one knows what they were intended for
---
ambush requires a main hand dagger.
---
I'm level 29 atm and only just noticed the instance. I remember watching vids from Danger Dolan and Bellular talk about it. I actually like the fact that there are mysteries like this in the original version of the game
---
That is one overweight lab lol. Maybe take it for a walk in between leveling

I was level 31 when I got stunlocked to death by a level 54 rogue trying to turn in the initial panther quest. 
---
Sorry. Its a pvp server, not sure what you expected.
---
You don't need to jump. Running off the edge is enough. People only fail because they jump too early. I'm so sure it wasn't like that early vanilla, and they decreased the gap later on. #nochanges?
---
 He can get away with a rep as a prima donna if he's a good tank but I would put him on ignore if I were you.

If a drop is ninjad and the ninja is not kicked, yeah leave

Which is why i have that third lol. Most pulls are 2-3, any with more involve the sap square.

Yeah I guess that would need of them to be online at the same time. Kinda hard with out schedule

PvP is for the salt, the more you make the opposing faction taste the better.  
---
Whether it's camping lowbies, or fighting fair, make them cry.  
---
I'm not sure why you think people should follow your code of ethics on servers where this is permitted.  
---
I used to only PvP too, I would still make time in my schedule to camp lowbies to make sure they regret choosing their faction.
---
Mage is Second to only warriors on my server but 19/20 of them are fury
---
I've never seen this guy before but after watching that I 100% understand the hate. What an absolute gobbler. Also he should have definitely had a plan to MC Saurfang. What an idiot.
---
Unnecessary or bad? CC on one guy in a group of 4 or on that pat that came up on the back of your group may not be necessary, but it certainly shouldn't slow your group down. However if there's only two people and you're sheeping one (without some crazy circumstances), maybe don't do that.
---
Just like in real life, you can claim to be whatever gender you want, but good luck changing your sex.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what went wrong with your transfer but I moved 3 characters from Kromcrush to Earthfury in about a 30 minute span.
---
Yeah, my tank and I have a sustainable grinding policy to make sure the quest mobs respawn.
---
You say that it has no benefit, but as a seller *and* buyer on the auction house, I'd rather people cheat and keep prices generally suppressed across the board. Farm what I need, and be able to afford what I can't on the Auction House. It is not, after all, a closed system--we get money from outside the AH too. I'd rather that money be able to go farther.
---
Uncommon play for 05, sure.. lol. Back peddling all over too sheesh
---
Plus mages are often pretty strong against melee - that's not OP, that's how they're designed.

Hunters for example will eat mages alive.

Whoa, 9 gold? I need to reroll warlock :P As a level 35 priest that stopped buying skills at 30 or 32, I currently have 17.5g worth of skills I could go buy right now. Level 36 when I ding would cost 7g if I bought all 6 spells.
---
At what point will I stop being able to get away with tanking asArms? im lvl 37 and up through had no problems  up through SM Arm. I  usually just rock my 2h axe, and slap on a shield for the heavy hitting bosses.. obviously it's not perfect but I don't feel like im handicapping my parties.

It seems so yes. I don't know the ratio for ranged, but for melee I'm getting higher and higher raw crit rate. I'm 45 and already at 24.5% crit which is a LOT

Wool cloth and one run through for the 5-6 quests.

This is my first Shaman, and I just learned windfury. I've been wondering what all the hype was about. So far, frostbrand has been consistently hitting higher dps by a considerable margin. Is this actually a bug or am I not applying it properly?
---
Boo hoo. Who cares? There isn't much to do at end game so why do you care or rush? The servers are not progressing to the next expansion, if they do it won't be for at least a year .
---
That‚Äôs cool and all, but do you know where mankirk‚Äôs wife is?
---
Definitely not, unless you want to run flags.
---
I mean it's generally acknowledged that Alliance are the faction for the older crowd that have more important things going on and like to play casually while Horde attracts the young (either chronologically or mentally), NEETs and Tryhards that tend to take the game more seriously and be more tribal about it.
---
Set your expectations accordingly.
---
Servers were much smaller on vanilla, enough said.

It's common courtesy to ask the person if they're looking for a guild before spamming them with a wall of text for something that they're more than likely not interested in.

Not saying his response was particularly great, but you shouldn't be surprised when people treat you like a dick when you basically send a spam message via whisper.
---
It makes it do more damage? I dont have numbers but i believe thats simply the case?
---
I call bullshit on this story. Barrens isn't pvp zone, so that priest would've had to attack first to get pvp flagged. That sounds unbelievable.
---
I heared the word "loot council" now a second time. And like to vomit. Sounds to me like quasi-pros taking themselves way too serious. Try to find a raid with good, old dkp and that's it. Because it's real, fair, effort based and up to the raiders themselves.
---
"Loot council" - yuck.
---
its a mix of the AoE meta, and the way that retail has reinforced this style of play into players. Sorry that you had a bad group, not everyone is a dickbag.
---
I don't see what you did wrong. you can, and will , equip it. I would absolutely roll need on that, and not feel add. I would also never send anyone money because they got salty and bounced. you can always run a dungeon multiple times.
---
I ran RFD on my druid a ton of times for the shoulders from glutton, because the first time they dropped, two of us rolled and I lost (rogue won, nbd). so I ran it 3 or 4 more times and told the group that was the only reason I was running it. they all passed and let me have it. even if they hadn't, I still wouldn't have left. and I certainly wouldn't have expected the winner to send me pity gold
---
Keep in mind they didn‚Äôt allow you to xfer from a PvP server to a PvE one until late tbc so it may be a long time if at all
---
you v
---
you're an idiot. all i'm saying is that its EXTREMELY unlikely the guy was kicked solely because of the incident he posted and that you're simply naive for thinking such
---
I don't get how this relates to the comment you are replying to.
---
Same, but now everyone just gets offended and has an opinion.
---
Unfortunately they shot that down with [this blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/please-reconsider-your-stance-on-retail-classic-reward-linking/22030/110?u=zombi-sulfuras) in the infamous "PLEASE RECONSIDER RETAIL/CLASSIC REWARD LINKING" post over on the Classic Forums.
---
I'm cool with it.  I want retail and Classic to remain completely separate in every way and I want everything in Classic to be earned 100% in-game. 
---
 I'm sure store mounts and pets will come to Classic eventually but I'm going to enjoy the hell out of it until that happens.
---
Chad Thottbot vs virgin allakhazam
---
Last time I did a hunter, i went with the hatchets. Much easier to farm and so much less drama about them.  the difference is negligible enough to not really be worth bothering, imo ofcouse.
---
Gold is the baseline for value. It has an intrinsic value to everyone who is participating when it drops. Regardless if you can use it, it can be sold to someone who can, in exchange for a baseline currency that will be used to further your own characters progress.
---
Same but another hour later. Have a nice work day (:
---
Yeah and people wonder why tanks are always in need, probably cause a lot of people make their lives hell.
---
Just like the real world.
---
On one hand I'd say definitely not, you don't leave until the dungeon until it's completely done or you got to a mutually agreed upon point, because it sucks to look for more people in the middle of a dungeon with some bosses cleared.
---
On the other hand it begs the question - who got the weapon actually? Because in some situations the reaction, while not appropriate, could be understandable.
---
make sure to let any of your friends in that guild know why you got kicked, I know I wouldn‚Äôt want to play with people like that.
---
Just putting this out there.
---
Most horde players including streamers are obsessed with food buffs that turn them into human characters.

How do you kill that which has no life?

You're a walking and talking logical fallacy https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque. 
---
Again, it's grossly embarrassing because you would never say these things to me in person. If we were shooting the shit over a pint you would probably treat me as if I'm another person with something to offer. Instead you keep trying to reframe what I'm saying, attack my character and suggest my feelings are hurt. It's a joke and extremely immature.
---
I'm not trying to win anything. I already told you that your replies are comedy gold = entertainment for me. Your original reply to me and this one is actually hilarious (I'm serious, I laughed out loud).

It does not

It's inside, you can't root gg.

Makes you wonder where Goonone was...

This is something that I picked up on after a few dungeons to deal with AoE spammers:
---
Mark an enemy with a skull. Pull that enemy. sunder it, and then ignore it to tab sunder the rest of the pack twice. Taunt the skull back when you lose aggro on it and sunder. Then do your sunder rotation.
---
Hope this helps! Doesn‚Äôt always work especially if the mage outlevels you but it can help.
---
I have been dreading tanking so much lately. People don't understand threat at all. Had a group kick me from a BRD run because I couldnt hold aggro. I had to explain to them that these mobs do two things. One, they disarm me. I can't do shit at that point. I've already got a demo shout up and I can only taunt so often; And two, they fucking net me. So I cant move for like 8 to 10 seconds. The mob nets me and immediately switch target and you know what the DPS would do when that happens? They'd fucking run away trying to kite them. BRING THEM TO ME YA FUCKING MONKEY.

Ah, didn't know that since I never bothered with their paid services due to not having a credit card then. Guess we'll just have to see. Worst case scenario is that I'll just have to pick back up on my original character unless I feel like rerolling again.
---
I did it, but died twice because of the level 50+ undead in the graveyard you have to run through by Uther‚Äôs tomb to get to Chillwind, unless you go through Alterac. 
---
I still don‚Äôt see how this is faster considering you have to run through the Bulwark.
---
I'm not sure if it helps, but for PvE priest going troll is the meta. You can argue they are equally good in shadow pvp as undead too.
---
Yea, if you gonna kill me and move on, that's cool. If you gonna camo, you can fuck right off mate.
---
Currently lvl 55
---
Spirit tap / wand specialization maxed. From there do anything you want. Id just go deep shadow to speed leveling since you can heal as shadow until 50+ anyways.

A drop is a drop, Why would it not drop just because you don't know enchanting?

Gotta love it when mages empty their mana bar in less than 15 seconds then whine that the tank can‚Äôt hold aggro.

I did this and it didn't work.

It's the generations that played classic that are doing the meta dungeon running and in fact popularized it in the first place. To blame it on kids is silly.
---
Big part of BFA aswell
---
I've seen theeee
---
Feral dps with only int gear is really bad. They have insane scaling per point of str/agi thanks to hotw and you wont be using it.
---
You shouldn't feel bad. I would have rolled need if I were you and not feel bad when winning or loosing. 
---
When leveling every piece of gear is for leveling, if it pushes your character further it is a need roll regardless of role you were in that dungeon. 
---
For example if I was playing a paladin I were healing, I wouldn't pass on dps gear. BUT I would pass on tank gear if the tank needed. Likewise if I was tanking I wouldn't pass on dps gear, but I wouldn't take healer gear if someone else needed.

Bro, Ally have Redridge, Ashenvale, and Duskwood as contested zones. Don‚Äôt complain about having Hillsbrad.

not when ur guild needs hydraxion rep for mc :D

While it was probably bullshit, some people do keep PvP manually toggled on.

What about a moderately higher level?
---
Was just running SM Grave as 30-33 and we had our friend who is 42 and the mobs were grey to him.  We debated this topic but couldn't tell what we should have gotten.

How much less xp do you get when someone in the group sees them as grey?  What if that person sees them as just bairly green?   Am I asking the wrong questions?
---
Lok'tor Ogar! *Salute*

.. no dude you split up and have FFA on loot your own mobs for rep farm. Not with random people.

I don‚Äôt speak for my guild in most matters, but I can confidently say we have no affiliation with the Enclave. And those of us who don‚Äôt engage in blanket PvP or ‚ÄúRed is dead‚Äù do have KoS on Enclave members.
---
OH! YOURE APPROACHING ME?
---
5-8 yards is called the dead zone for a reason you know.
---
This was never the case until now. Even in vanilla, people needed on boes because they all hold value. Please just stop perpetuating this as the baseline. Its completely open to exploitation. If need rolling is the baseline everyone walks away happy because it provides value to EVERYONE. Boes have a different rule set because the nature of their loot rules is fundamentally different than bops.
---
imagine having admin privileges on gmod rp servers when you were 13
---
Yeah spot on dude.  And after that, they should definitely get mages being able to heal. I really want to feel that authentic vanilla experience again y‚Äôknow.
---
Wait I have to think about what I‚Äôm doing as dps??

Great reading. I hope for more!

There's that property between managers and workers that, if they see someone go above and beyond, they sometimes assume that it's okay to assign the hard worker extra work that the slackers aren't doing. 
---
This kinda seems like that. You busted your ass and your peers didn't. The loot council may be using a pure utilitarian view on this, not taking into account the human factor. In the mechanical context it's fair; they want to have everybody on roughly equal level. In the subjective sense it sounds like they aren't thinking about how this make people feel.
---
Bring back TLDRs
---
i don‚Äôt like metallica.
---
From a Night Elf who wouldn‚Äôt harm anyone unless he had a reason to, strength and honor to you, friend. May Elune and the Earth Mother both watch over you.
---
My approach is always a neutral one. I'll save any horde I see dying to a mob. I won't start any fight until I see them attacking allies. Then I'll join in the defend.  
---
If I see an ally start the fight though, I'll leave them to their decision. Especially when we are in the middle of thousand needles and they poke the hornets nest.
---
Yep, it‚Äôs about a 1 second cast to change the staff - with a 30 minute cooldown. I did put a throw away enchant on it to test - and I can confirm it keeps the same enchant for both versions of the item. 
---
If you plan to use both versions equally, then you might choose the 22int enchant because it will benefit both equally.

Its a world drop. Theyre incredibly rare and gold is the baseline currency in vanilla. It all holds the same value no matter who can use it.

The 60 was the instigator

We need fadeleaf for blinding powder and swiftthistle for thistle tea.
---
I'm almost 45 now and I haven't had to make blinding powder myself yet, I get tons of it from pickpocketing. I did buy a bunch of swiftthistle to make tea though.

I think it matters situation to situation. The crossbow in LBRS created a lot of anger from the hunters when a rogue rolled need. It‚Äôs his BiS, what exactly are we supposed to do? I understand it‚Äôs a ranged weapon and I would have appealed to the groups better judgement. But they went ballistic over me asking them why they didn‚Äôt try to talk it out instead of just losing it. 
---
Also people need to be a lot more conscious of tiny upgrades versus huge upgrades. I left a group when I had a green and they had an arguably better blue, I appealed their better judgement and they said no. Why am I tanking for them if they won‚Äôt be what I consider reasonable?
---
Would be cool if it would become entrance for 8.3 SW raid, if those leaks are somewhat real.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre changing it. No one is arguing that it needs to stay.

Guess he was just having a bad day then. If it was a mage I'd be like "f y'all".

---
Just to nitpick, but growl is not a taunt, it's a base amount of threat, and does not take over from what you build.  Meaning you can let a pet offtank for a bit while you spend rage on the other mobs and taunt off the pet to steal all the threat it generated for 0 rage.  Now, a good hunter will control when auto growl is on and when to leave it off, but it can help control packs pretty well.i play both war and hunt
---
It's funnier my way since it's engineering
---
running a 580 pro dude its all I use
---
I was able to get my transponder no prob, horde side, did it at 27 though.
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt believe it either (at least partially), but someone being permanently flagged isn‚Äôt really that uncommon. It‚Äôs the 7 yards that I can‚Äôt see happening
---
And then someone else needs on both and you roll a 1
---
I to this day have no idea how to pronounce taureh. I never even heard it said out loud.
---
The horde is dumb. Change my mind.
---
All of those sound like good combos engineering works with anyone really. Casters especially gain a lot of benefit from having some more tools that are not mana based.
---
My only word of warning here is if you plan to farm for yourself awesome, but still hefty, and if not the price tag of leveling so many professions without gathering will be expensive even near mid game.
---
This. Play what you enjoy. Market won't be like this forever so take advantage while you can!

5 more levels and I am on that same quest. I do have vague memories from doing it on my vanilla warrior all those years ago.

Could be. Although I haven't see any dps in general have trouble finding groups. Tank shortage would make total sense tho.
---
loot council is crap.

There is a chance that classic + can be great, or there is a 100% chance the game will go to shit with TBC and Wrath.

I'd take a risk over the 100% chance of fucking the game up anyways.

Maybe attempt to focus on the class you can ping 60 on fastest, but just have fun!

Given the fact that over 300.000 viewers watched jokers stream when he hit 60, I'd say there's definitely people out there that cares.

I‚Äôm glad to hear it‚Äôs not just me having problems. Every pack turns into a benny hill comedy chasing mobs around spamming taunt.
---
Legitimately wasn't meant to come across as elitism, it was a genuine question. This isn't anything new, it's why a ton of veterans still play vanilla and have done since flying was introduced. 
---
It's simply a constant on PvPs, it's been that way forever and will continue to be that way forever. There's choices you can make to avoid it if it's that much of a problem but besides that you aren't going to be able to change anything about it because some people sub solely for that purpose and vanilla had no coddling, so classic likely won't. 
---
We legitimately had people on my server that made me rage quit for entire nights multiple times, but it's all part of the fun. Eventually you get to 60 and instantly recognize the name somewhere and camp the shit out of until you feel satisfied. 
---
Vanilla PvP is brutal, it's inefficient and often rage inducing but it adds to the game in a variety of ways. I've already grouped with tons of people to track down and kill high levels who were camping, etc. Tons of hours of gameplay as a result, but if I couldn't handle the bad with the good I'd deffo just roll PvE.
---
Spamming invites means the guild fills with randos that don't form a cohesive community anyway. Just becomes a random chat tab
---
Why wouldn't they prefer Peacemaker exactly? 6 more AP and the same crit chance, you just lose the def and armor, which a hunter shouldn't care about anyway.
---
And then you realize, with melee leeway he can hit you from at least 2 yards further.
---
Nice as alliance on rattlegore as well this makes me happy! If you guys ever need a very active hpally my In game name is righteousnes and I‚Äôm 55 hoping to be 60 very soon!
---
Lol nice
---
&gt; mature guild but also like to have fun and be silly
---
guaranteed these motherfuckers are raunchy as hell
---
Too true..
---
WHy? Wrath was already a joke back in 2008 or 2009 whenever it was released, people liked it because of Arthas but beyond that, it was a shit expansion that was made entirely for pugging.
---
Dwarves are the only good alliance race.

‚ÄúHave you ever wanted a guild with a dude pretending to be a girl who will sometimes tease about ducking your sick? Well have I got the place for you!‚Äù
---
I have a feeling that you're going to keep sending these letters. :D
---
How can you read what he wrote and assume that?
---
Of course he's not saying they should use it instead. He's saying it does more damage.
---
3rd grade reading skills or too much mountain dew?
---
At level 50 you can just distract them and loot it from the opposite side, that's what I did on my Rogue :p good video though.
---
Freaking glorious
---
Why is the dude on the right wearing a horde shirt tho?
---
Maybe. But I think that might just be a symptom of more people on at the same time.
---
Arathi and Alterac. You're also perfect level to start and end Desolace. Theres another place or two more I can't think of.
---
Better than ignoring the problem right?
---
I have no idea what you're talking about friend.
---
Pretty sure Jared still streams. Chill as fuck guy. Wonder if he's playing Classic.
---
It's more like 100-150k/month.
---
Getting engineering up on 4 characters without mining will cost you a fortune and it sounds rather boring. I'd mix it up a little and keep engi for the main.
---
cough cough

Nope
---
For leveling you want something like this. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053250213525100001-050501-05
---
Go through arms first, and choose whatever weapon spec you prefer. There is a lot of axes, so it often makes more sense to go with axe while leveling.
---
I intentially didn't pick any in impale. Since you are leveling, you don't have enough crit to make it worthwhile. While it says 20% more dmg. Because of only 5-6% crit. The total increase come out much lower. 
---
When leveling up fury. Crit is best to start out with.
---
the talents in hamstring can be moved around. E.g into parry.
---
don't take talents in heroic strike. It's an ability you will only use in the low lvls. In higher lvls its more efficient to apply a couple of sunder arms (until target is 75-65% and spam hamstring strike (fishing for dodges for overpowers). Of course mortal strike is better than both when at level 40. Heroic strike should only be used if you are about to cap max rage and don't have any other way of using it.
---
You DO NOT want to play with those people. Whoever kicked you did you a massive favor.
---
Luckily, in classic, without cross-realms this attitude will bite these people back. 
---
Do it long enough &amp; enough people will have this person on ignore that they won't be able to run instances.
---
Both, either, not even Blizzard knows.
---
2x 15agi enchants vs 1x 25 agility enchant
---
This is almost as futile as the android vs iPhone argument.... People are just dicks in general, there is no "better faction".
---
Very well written, made my morning! ^^
---
7am in the bus here
---
That's the point of these posts.
---
Of course it does work
---
DO NOT VENDOR  THE BOOMERANG!
---
Dont sell it that cheap!!! Hold onto it for awhile till people have more gold to spend!
---
Post the guild so everyone can call them huge retards
---
The cognitive dissonance is strong with this one. They are merely animals below to us on the food chain.
---
Lmaoo, sounds like me and my girlfriend soon
---
Just your average joe
---
I dunno. I find loot council awfully offensive. I know that it‚Äôs probably the best for intense hardcore progression guilds but I would feel violated by it. Too much power to the council. 
---
I like systems like dkp that rewards time spent raiding.
---
Classic first 60, sure.
---
Reddit needs a sub for WoW like r/freefolk is for asoiaf
---
48 dwarf priest on skeram here. It was pretty bad for a while, but the horde have been more passive lately. I still occasionally run into some asshole like this (I'm looking at you koko)
---
Probably a serious multiboxer! :D They have an earie feel of being only one fifth of a player and four fifths of a NPC.
---
You definitely need the MS enchant on boots. I have a little over half my Pre-Bis, No raid gear.
---
Peacemaker's technically better now because the +15 Agi enchants aren't in yet. Once they are, dual-wielding is better for the most part.
---
Ah, so 4 more AP (10 - 6) and \~.1% crit.
---
LOL this is genius
---
FWIW I have a Mid 2015 Macbook Pro and do not encounter this issue.
---
Lmao. That's me everytime I help an alliance dude. They always die when i help them and i feel like leaving but then feel it's a bit unfair to them.
---
For druid you have no choice except for faction. So I'd say go with the faction you like, or the one with higher population on your server. 
---
As for mage I'd say undead horde or gnome alliance. Personally I prefer human though. Worry more about faction than specific race.
---
Anything that you can level professions through will almost always been cheaper than the materials.
---

---
i rate improved hamstring highly because i play on a PvP server but if its not your thing i'd put points in to 2h spec then imp charge instead.  
---
When you leave arms head over to fury and grab cruelty first. Booming voice is much better than unbridled wrath for arms because its a 40% chance on hit to generate 1 rage and your weapon swing timer is probably 3.5 seconds.  
---
Axe spec is preferred for all races while lvling because of the axe progression (whirlwind, ravager etc).
---
For a little while, warlocks could speak Demonic to each other as well.
---
You sound fun.
---
Makes me wanna roll an orc shaman. They any good in pvp?
---
It's a painful task! Good luck to you too!
---
Same but going to sleep rn. Have a nice work day (:
---
You have been lucky then. I have had to log off at inopportune times and came back to 90 min or longer queues several nights the past week. Which is better, but not nothing. /r/Usually have been trying to sneak a few hours in before work.
---
Am using Remote Desktop to login when I can and start the queue but can‚Äôt always!
---
Have a guild which is staying and more importantly have a friends list of people I have enjoyed grouping with so unlikely to go anywhere but man the queues are a bummer.

You can do both. On a pserver I tried first skilling Fury, then respeccing. Now I'm deep arms till 40 and then start putting points into Fury. Tanking is sooo much more fun if you have anger management for proper stance dancing with the right macros.
---
hamstring kiting works, not for all mobs though but still works to reduce dmg taken.
---
It is pretty simple.
---
If dps keeps chain pulling stop healing them and let them die. Once they will need to run few times they will learn.
---
If you tank is crazy just tell him to watch your mana. If he keeps chain pulling just quit.
---
Also consider tanks of spells you use maybe you run out of mana because you heal not entirely efficiently.
---
I believe it was ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù dungeons and not player housing.
---
I got mine at 43.. that‚Äôs with 2 respecs, artisan training for everything and then buying a dagger I believe. Should have been a little smarter but that alone was probably 30g.. to not have by 50.... lol
---
There was a horde druid like 3 levels higher than me that ganked me like 3 times last night in Desolace. Wasn't that bad of experience for me because I learned a few things about playing a druid watching him end me several times. I was not at full health each time he got me, but at least he waited until I looted mobs before doing it, so he had some honor.
---
Lvling is slow
---
Even then you can get +25 Agi enchant for 2h. You should have a difference of 5 agility which would be a total difference of 4 AP and \~0.1% crit. Considering how in-demand Dal'Rend's weapons are I just don't see it being worth such a marginal upgrade?
---
Let the body despawn without looting to assert your dominance
---
No it was because people don't care for that stuff in general. TBC had PvP objectives in most zones and they were all dead. People are just not into it.
---
I agree, doubt that this was the only thing that led them to G kicking. Not saying it was justified, but I cant see anyone g kicking a member for that alone, especially considering the officer just now hit 60. If they're  that hard core about classic, their officers would have dinged 60 awhile ago.
---
I'd wager it's almost certinally an ironic message and not indicative of the content of the guild itself. 
---
But if it is, oh god kill me now.
---
There was some good wpvp in hillsbrad this evening, very lovely pvp scene in this server so far.
---
I wanted to leave my job since a long time and step into web development - studied the last 1.5years after work.
---
I am pretty comfortable with web dev now, so I am leaving my job next month. I want to stay a few months at home just to play wow and finish a few projects for my future career.
---
Gonna have a great time grinding.
---
That's what I'm doing and leveling is incredibly fast because I'm not having to stop to eat or drink with Spirit Tap
---
And still a better love story than Twilight.
---
Ya know, the type of person to make a guild with that name, is exactly the type of person to cry when blizzard tells you what they cant do in their game...and then cry some more when they dont have to tell you why.
---
Our guild has done 12ish runs and we current√¶y have 5 deflectors but no skinning knife yet :(
---
If I were the officer that would simply prove what i'm saying you moron
---
She made a temp human and bought the feed, then while she waited near a chicken i made the walk from booty bay alllll the way up to westfall. Once there she did the cluck! Quest and i was able to loot the dropped egg and have my favourite companion.
---
This so much this ! Yes indeed
---
And truestrike
---
That and slowly obliterating warriors.
---
Been making decent money on my server making green lens's and hoping for healing/frostdmg/shadowdmg which I have been quite lucky. Selling for 10-15g ea
---
Not really. It would only prove you're a psycho...
---
Exactly. This is what i dont understand. If you play on a pvp server no one wants to hear about you getting camped/ganked. No one cares. Now if you come out with hey theres about 5 members of the other faction over here can i get some help? Fine. But most just continously complain theyre getting ganked and realistically no one cares. You are whining. Idgaf what op says.
---
I am proud of you for respecting her privacy for as long as you did.
---
So true. But i think, so enabling layer is just the internet itself.
---
I read it and it sounded like I was at the house races!
---
Yeah i make a point to bring a tank for bosses but thats it. Even on my mage one mob isnt going to kill me so who cares if i pull aggro at lower levels. And the boss thing is just a safety precaution. Tanked last boss in RFK on my rogue today cause our warrior tank couldnt hold aggro, but he knew what was up and didnt care cause he was getting xp and gear.
---
This whole post is stupid from the get go as OP isnt even a tank spec and telling people how to let him (a crutch of a tank at best) do a shitty job where a druid would be far superior. Nobody wants to level prot and i get why. But saying your a tank so you can get an easy slot in a dungeon group and then bitching about how everyone else needs to play different because you are a fake fucking tank is laughable. 
---
As for as the compliments, they are thanking you for doing a passable job. People tend not to criticize tanks as we know they are usually not specced for it and appreciate someone who can take a couple hits from us. Also dont want to get blacklisted at 60 from guilds or raids because we insulted someone who sucked at tanking while leveling. That being said ive met plenty of non prot warriors who can hold aggro fine with a variety of techniques.
---
You do have a list of common problems sure. But my complaint is I meet too many warriors who have a 2h build, throw on a sword and shield and call themselves a tank. Either put up with the party pulling mobs, respec, find a slot as a dps, or fuck off.
---

Mmmm tastes like salt.

Some dumb horde player tries to kill mobs around me and hes gonna eat my axe.

Yes?

I will join your guild witg 2 friends! ;)
---
I downvote all this rage comic garbage, meta or not
---
This map is only accurate to 1.6, it‚Äôs missing nearly a dozen FPs and FP connections
---
guess the aggro reset is an exploit, the walking on walls is a clever use of game mechanic
---
The question is what do you want?
---
Get to 60 to do some high end dungeons and raids or do you enjoy questing.
---
If the first one just pick something that's mentioned in the answers and don't switch till you are 60.
---
And if not, if the most you enjoy is questing, why even bother? Play whatever you want at the moment and switch as often as you please. There is zero rush.
---
For me I've decided to roll warrior because it's the most fun class. But it's not that I don't like other classes. Hunter, warlock, rogue, shaman everything seems fun. My goal is to get to 60 first and then level an alt. That's why I'm just sticking to warrior. Even if it was frustrating in some level areas.
---
No, standing in specific spots isn't bannable
---
Generally
---
Would you rather be in a smaller guild?

Wtf? Bye.

Hey! Smolderweb Alliance... I‚Äôll see you on the front lines!

I don't think you need to go to booty bay for artisan mining.

He's been popular for several years now, and is literally a millionaire off streaming alone.

He did Ragnaros all by himself? Wow!

You mad your baby eg/whatever guild is stuck on Garr?
---
Lore-wise you are completely wrong. The Forsaken just broke away from the control of the HUMAN lich king, and are trying to regain some sense of a life not being a mindless army for magic Anakin
---
Hey same! Lasa the druid checking in. :)
---
Mages do cone of cold as we assume we are going to pull aggro anyways because of all the bad tanks. I personally dont do it on druid tanks as I know they can hold aggro.
---
Ah the addicted in Full defense mode. Calm down,  it was just a hint from somebody Who works and tries to Help people to get over their gaming addiction and not a command. When you see how gaming addiction destroys family lifes you see such posts from another direction. Btw i love wow and Play it by myself. Have a nice day.
---
He tried. Actually killed the server
---
Its about 25g per hour if you vendor blues and mine mithril

Extra 25g if you sell blackstone rings to people
---
Wow that's super insane. What weirdo narcissists.
---
AND TB is in the middle of him fuck nowhere. But I guess so is Darnassus...Fine! You win this time alliance
---
It doesn't matter at all. World PvP is a fun side thing, and not the main point of the game for the majority of people. If BGs were a thing already, than most PvPers would be in there and not in the world.
---
&gt;  Doesn't work in all chats. 
---
Learned that the hard way, lol. A hunter took my Warrior weapon in ZG in vanilla when i was like 12. A few days later i learned about different languages. So i did what every reasonable 12 year old would do and wrote a really really relly mean message to him out of spite.
---
That day I learned that languages don't work in wispers. Got kicked from the guild :(
---
"Do you know why I kicked you from the guild? FaceMelt0r, Shad0wV3nom, Dre4mSn1per and I, LordBubblePal, are the founders of this guild. All loot belongs to us and will be distributed to the plebs as we see fit. Overruling our choice by rolling need is NOT an option."
---
Desolace, stv, scarlet monastery, and maybe Dustwallow Marsh?
---
Wands do not get any impact from spell damage, the tooltip is bugged.
---
* spell damage never effects wand damage (yes it lists it in the tooltip but that is a tooltip bug)
---
* wands never suffer pushback
---
good luck getting past the mobs in the rest of the cave
---
If you're a tailor you can farm LBRS for archmage robes pattern then farm essences to craft it.

the most important thing, the visuals.
---
Wife works at a restaurant. A guy was upset about something with coupons not being allowed to stack or something so they wrote a negative review and ultimately played threw out the lame the pitty card of "it was my birthday and I didn't even feel special". 
---
It's like they are unaware there are billions of people on the planet. A little known fact is some people share birth days with others. 
---
On the topic of OP they are better off removed from that guild. It will become, or is, drama central and such leadership will cause it to fall apart or stay forever irrelevant. In the past I've been in such guilds and anyone worth something ends up leaving. 
---
Then high end guilds have their own issues. But up side, at least in the ones I played with, is any issues tend to be confined to just progression raiding. Raid on farm was always nice and easy.
---
how are you gonna get that far in the cave in the first place
---
I know there are addons that will prevent selling more than 12 items in one vendor session to prevent accidentally selling the wrong item and then bumping it off the buy back list by selling more.
---
You may want to check that if you're having issues.
---
Also, I've noticed that if I'm in the buy back tab, I can't sell, only buy back the items. At least I seem to remember that (can't verify right now not at home).
---
I do suppose the mystery of the "makers" has been completely let out of the bag at this point anyway.
---
Holy shit, was the priest name "Phealer"?
---
This wouldn‚Äôt make holy paladins viable. There are too few plate gear that gives the type of stats holy paladins need to be useful, they rely on cloth.
---
Without holy as a viable spec, it would mean paladins literally have no viable raid spec since prot lack a taunt for boss switching, and ret are too weak dps wise.
---
Shit concept, shit guild name.
---
The routing has already been optimized.  Killing everything from entrance to graveyards is down to 15 minutes. Making it any faster would just get you dungeon banned.
---
I'm 6 foot 7 irl and I do play a gnome mage. Let IRL manlets cope by playing characters taller than them.
---
i just rolled a holy/prot pally (won't do ret to level bc im a masochist and i have levelling buddies), what weapon should i focus on levelling? i guess a one handed one so i can use it with a shield. if so, which?
---
&gt;Spell damage is supposed to affect wand damage
---
Absolutely! Makes us depend more on each other which makes it way more alive.
---
I tell mages while they get Mana, I get threat. So if I pull while you're drinking that's fine, unless I need a sheep but I'll know that beforehand. Only mana bar I care about as the tank is the healer's
---
Isnt nerzhul like part of this to some degree?
---
Then go as dps and let druids tank. Easy solution. Or, hear me out, cut the fake tanks out of the equation and ice block pull for spell cleave farm.
---
Your lvl 17 just remake that shit
---
Once geared, warriors top DPS charts.
---
PffffffftttahahahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Exclusive GM hang out zone. 8D
---
No. Just no
---
Wonderful name and concept, and we grew rapidly because of it. We are going to liberate the Alliance from the oppression of capitalist rule. Nothing is stopping me from continuing to advertise as "communist party", the forced name change solves nothing.
---
You think humans look cool because they stand up straight?
---
While levelling I only buy skills for voidie so he‚Äôll have to do! Keep him on passive, and don‚Äôt let him fight the tank for threat. In emergencies he can tank a single mob, or sac him for the shield.  
---
Yeah he‚Äôll be mostly useless but if he saves the healer from dying just once it‚Äôll be worth.
---
The community is way better than it was before.  
---
But people are also so much more sensitive now, telling someone they're bad can be labeled as toxic now.  If that's you...then yeah you're fucked.
---
You have a cleave ability in rotation. Warriors do not. At least I think you do. Swipe?
---
As a mage, do I need to level my weapon skills?
---
unique to this quest, you can use demo shout to totally nullify every mob except for ol will
---
you should use demo shout on everything that hits you anyway
---
Would Love to be able to Set the View distance even Higher, with our awesome PCs in 2019.
---
Gold is selling for 1.5$ per gold atm, some higher, some a bit lower.
---
So level 60's going for the 300's, even 400's I'd find believable especially if they have a massive gold investment on the account.
---
No, the orcs had a perfectly fine home in the POW camps in which they were sitting for participating in war crimes and genocide.
---
Asking for a layer invite is a way to bypass a problem in the later you are in whether it be the mob you want isn‚Äôt up, there are enemy players you want to avoid, or a mining node or herb node isn‚Äôt up.  I can‚Äôt think of a case other than trying to group with someone you want to group with where later invites are not exploiting a system to cheat in some fashion.
---
Has anyone been able to track down any proof that someone was actually banned for this? Suspensions are not good enough for this.
---
I now need to make a Warlock
---
Better than this one guild on my server. Whenever they advertise their guild, this one dude always links a Imgr link which has a compilation of screenshots from their guild Discord. They are very racist and homophobic. Lmao, it's funny that they haven't disbanded yet.
---
WoW in a nutshell, pay to wait grind job.
---
I think you would have to wait longer for prices to go up. More like 4-6 weeks
---
Ahhh so not a pvp server then, I guess you could have gotten the feed from the bootybay AH too if someone from alliance put it on there ?
---
Yes.  I'm no expert on why swipe isn't effective enough, but 3 target is the limit, so maybe that?
---
Nobody gives a fuck you virtue signaling weakling
---
Around level 40 is a decent time to lvl herbalism in swamp of sorrows. (Not for wildvine, just in general). And yeah black lotus are in the 55+ zones
---
Which should I pick, horde or alliance
---
&gt;4) The grind. Believe it or not the time to level to 60 and the endgame grind for items was also accused of being a time sink. Blizzard apparently ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt respect our time‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs applauded as we are ‚Äúmore invested in our character‚Äù.
---
I just want a sense of pride and accomplishment when I log onto the server and see my warlock standing there staring at me.
---
I disagree about the low levels part. Tanking at low levels is not about threat generation than survival. Most arms/fury will put pants into talents that increase damage which in turn increases threat.
---
Okay I'll just try it once every week or every second week;)
---
Whatever you like! You can always choose the other side down the road with an alt.
---
Reminds me of http://www.darklegacycomics.com/comics/107.jpg
---
You're a zoomer
---
Alliance, horde look fugly.
---
Yes, but a warrior can just get up, go get something to eat, go back to the computer, then hamstring the pally, get stunned, then hamstring again and RP walk away.
---
The illusionary rod actually has great damage on it and [you can see that](https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/class:1/quality:3:4/type:10:1:5:8#items:50+3+18) there's not really anything other than BoEs that compete with such an easily attainable item until ravager. the int really only has the minor weapon skill training effect but the stam and spirit are appreciated. Unless you're talking about loksey's training stick then boi what were you planning to do with with that anyways
---
You know what, I'm all for #nochanges...but an Uldum we were supposed to have gotten and Grim Batol I can get behind.

Is buying blues from AH always considered a dumb thing to do? I can't help it when I see a super sweet upgrade üòï
---
Losing every roll I can lose in MC / Ony and Dungeons..
---
Thats what we were going to try but the walk of death had more of a thrill
---
I have a group that I get about 16m runs with but we are all on the same page and the tank/healer are in sync. A lot of groups I see struggle with the pulls, but with this mechanic any group can get to GY without fighting.
---
To your point it doesn‚Äôt even blip on the radar for people who can do the run efficiently enough so maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter. I do expect to see a lot of groups picking this method up due to how brain dead it is, though. You don‚Äôt even need a tank anymore.
---
Whoa. Nice perspective.
---
I would love to be a fly on the wall for the inevitable implosion
---
this is funny
---
I'm British, so you just laugh and shrug your shoulders, "History, am I right?"
---
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles...
---
Global chat channels like World and Global, definitely a toxic cesspool that one should avoid. Starter zone general chats are pretty wholesome(Elwynn) but the Strangletorn's chat seems to be extremely toxic
---
If you're only after 1 thing that might drop; tell everyone, they might just be kind enough to forfeit on it and also be happy for you, if not; tough cookies.
---
Google what level zones are appropriate for you. Sometimes if there‚Äôs no quest you can just grind mobs for a little bit to level up until your next quests are available/easier to do. Also, go ahead and install the add on questie. It will make your time much more enjoyable without having to look up quests all the time.
---
When I'm in a group, I (mage) usually ask the tank if they want me to AOE, or just ST. They usually ask me to AOE.
---
Guess what happens? I'll usually pull aggro.   
---
Something tells me a lot of the tanks are overestimating their aggro generation too.
---
Ignore it, but it afffects how often your spells will hit the target (instead of being resisted). Just like when you equip a new weapon, you have to level up the weapon skill before it starts hitting higher lvl enemies.
---
Who uses W for run forward? Thats a waste of a good bind.
---
Is it actually against the rules to cross faction chat like this?
---
If you‚Äôre in it for the experience just try them all out. If one side doesn‚Äôt speak to you, you might find your answer after you‚Äôve played them all.
---
In retail the story is already predetermined. Your role, how all the pieces come together. 
---
In classic there really isnt a story, besides the one you make. That feeling of freedom classic creates is incredible. 
---
I didnt come back cause nostalgia, i came back cause its a great game, full stop.
---
I don't quite understand this. Maybe I am to low with lvl 34 but I can easily solo elite mobs as holy. If you do dungeons to keep your wand up to date your dps is pretty high, add the ability to heal yourself and I would say that it has been a pleasant expierence so far.

BRD resets - Biggest PvP zone in classic
---
One thing that does go with what your are saying is that Blizzards justification for the last band were that no reasonable person would think to layer a boss. So I guess depending on how easy it is to find the anti-agro corner then you could argue it‚Äôs a more obvious exploit? Idk
---
There's a difference between abilities that will "hit the target and one nearby target" (tank cleaves) and straight up blanket cleaves. The tank one is to force you to bring a 2nd tank, the one is just to punish positioning
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt imagine how they would handle loot distribution in raids.
---
I can. The officers get every loot.
---
Ive been the opposite, cheers!
---
Can‚Äôt wait to do this quest again. I don‚Äôt remember all the details involved beyond the drop needed off a boss in MC so rediscovering it will be really fun.
---
LOL
---
BGs match people not just from the same server but also from a battlegroup, chances are blizz will account for difference in populations when they come up with them.
---
You on Stalagg too? I thought like you until today, and I even like being on the smaller side of servers usually - when it's like a 60/40 split, rather than 70/30. Got killed 8 different times by 4 different groups in 3 different zones. 2 of them were clearly camping me, hence going to entirely different zones only to get ganked more. And I'm 52 at this point, but always surrounded by horde that will rightly jump to the aid of some lone other horde that starts a fight because he'll know help will come.
---
It's actually gotten kind of ridiculous; I think it's already unhealthy to the extent that alliance will stand no chance contesting the AQ gates or anything like that - our only hope would be GRZZLY, but relying on some top pserver guild hardly feels like a faction wife effort. Legit thinking about going to a different server.
---
&gt; OG and SW should always be the most important cities
---
IF was the most important Alliance city in classic, because that's where the AH was and it was the closest major city to BRS, MC, and BWL, while also being right next to Kalimdor access.  Even after an AH was added to SW, IF was still the place to be.
---
That‚Äôs the way it should be. Now if your the same level, sometimes a battle is in order.
---
amazing story :)
---
I do not watch his videos because he is black
---
Fantastic idea, and fantastic bait. How about something snappier like " horde national socialist party " next time - all the same arguments apply and i'm sure that won't get reported.
---
Ah yes, and WoW was the perfect game to replace that with!
---
No shit though I have thousands of hours logged in Gmod... Most of it is from building shit (planes, cars) and making them as realistic as possible. 
---
Gmod was the absolute shit back in the day, and I don't know if I was addicted to that or WoW more. I still boot that game up every few months to build a new project or work on old ones. 
---
FP Studios is also working on a new game called S&amp;box, it's going to be Gmod on cocaine since it's utilizing the the unreal engine. Can't wait.
---
I mean I think so too as an alliance player, but I'd love it if it was backed up by actual statistics
---
those aren't in the game
---
Grobb had Voidroy in world chat.
---
I miss him sometimes
---
I guess its not, im not sure what i was thinking, probably misunderstood what you wrote.
---
i studied IT, have a wife and a child soon
---
i have a level 34 shaman \^\^
---
For me it's horde. The lore, the vibe ... and Tauren.
---
Unfortunately the guild decided to play alliance. But Guild&gt;Horde.
---
There‚Äôs no point in getting it on all alts 
---
There are professions with cooldowns crafts get all of those on your alts since they tend to be worth some cash and it‚Äôs free money
---
Most of the people who are playing classic are shit and they watch twitch too much and think they can do what their favorite streamer does. They cant comprehend the pace of the game is much slower in leveling than in retail, they think their character is unkillable-lol-gg-godmode and when they die it's someone elses fault.  It's more important than ever to find a good guild with good players, because the bad players are worse than they were in vanilla.
---
Jore-Dunemaul on retail.  I don't know if he plays anymore, since I reached out to him but unfortunately, no response.
---
I do know, he did have a set for Feral, and another for Healing at a minimum.  Pretty sure he'd replace a few items in his healing set for his feral stuff so his dps would be higher.  it was a balance of how much dps he'd do, compared to how much healing he'd be able to throw out there before he'd OOM and shift for dps.  We did get him his AQ40 dagger and mount.  We ran neck and neck with an alliance guild on the server for the opening, and man, it was a blast following him around for months to complete this massive epic quest.  Truthfully, miss playing with the guy, since even though he achieved an incredible amount of stuff in game, he was a very humble guy who didn't talk much.  Just down to business.
---
Only spells apply SW.
---
Understatement!
---
Imagine being lvl 60 and getting feared, stunned and slowed by people 40 lvls bellow...
---
People being too busy with their work also destroy family lives. Imagine working in gaming addiction help and then browse gaming subreddits to tell people to get out more when you get home.  
---
Nobody here is waiting for a stranger to tell them how they spend their free time.
---
Why is that rogue behind the casters?
---
Good post. Really wish the sub was full of these sorts of posts instead of memes.
---
Random Answer Time! I got my first gaming rig in December 2005, my 16th birthday. Before that we had a "LAN" room in the basement with computers, but this one I could have in my own room.
---
That one lasted until I bought a new gaming computer 2011. But it was a god damn beast. Cost like 35k euro and had all the BIS components for that time.  My father was a huge gaming nerd him self =)
---
After hitting level 30, I had little hope of finishing this quest. The mobs were too high level, and I had gear that was great... for a level 20. I had saved up 11 gold and used that to purchase the charms and liferoot. I then spent about 3 and a half hours in Stranglethorn Vale getting my digital cheeks clapped by the horde while trying to get the 30 troll tusks required. Against all odds I did it, and was rewarded with finding a group who was going to kill Cyclonian at the same time I was. They even had a level 50 to help out. Thanks to those awesome dudes that helped me achieve what I thought I wouldn't be able to until level 40+.
---
pvp ones are mostly horde, pve and rp ones are mostly alliance.
---
Can we get OP to write instead kd D&amp;D GOT? Gj my man! Gj!
---
Yeah, because socially maladjusted nerds on a power trip never do insane shit.
---
The fact that you can't sell enchants on AH honestly bums me out more than anything, chances are it won't be that profitable a profession unless you enjoy sitting in a large town spamming global channels.
---
Oh thx for the info
---
Wasnt Arthas also under the influence of or implied to be under the influence of frostmourne and nerzuhl as well?
---
Thanks, I was thinking of doing tailoring next.
---
My level 60 raid geared prot warr died to level 36 elites today.
---
I joined one for the name that got removed an hour later so take it with a grain of salt. Everyone else was an insta ignore. Personally ill talk to them if they whisper before they invite but if its the other way around no dice. Just my little way of staying sane while being spammed all day
---
Horrendous.
---
Great story! This is what MMOs are about!
---
Nicely done and grats !
---
It may be the whiskey and coke talking, but god damn was this a thrilling read.
---
&gt;  something big, they choose to be a part of a stew.
---
To be fair, a big stew.
---
You know, I used to feel this way.  Until I realized we pay millions to grown men/women to chase/carry a ball around a field for an hour or two at a time.
---
Sure it's not a blue-collar honest-to-goodness sweat-of-your-brow job, but there are lots of jobs that aren't and we don't call them "fake."
---
Kevin Smith ftw!
---
But what do you mean? I've never been to Un'Goro. Which reference?
---
Sure, if it happens, but how does layering, on its own, lead to these things happening. I don't think you can reasonably claim it does.
---
I have officially seen a complaint about everything.
---
Btw you only get that message when you do five dungeons under an hour. Maybe do something else besides the garbage spellcleave meta or farming a boss while your sheets cool.
---
Same I‚Äôm 32 , specd shadow without shadow form yet and I can easily kill mobs 3 levels above myself and solo elites. I can heal 75% of my health if needed.
---
Some vets can be very toxic about doing dungeons "properly"
---
They get very extreme
---
Beautiful. Thanks for this to start my boring Thursday with a smile. Epic story telling.
---
He makes way more than 50k/month.
---
Fucking epic.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs mostly just in good fun, like rooting for your home team.
---
So it's dead serious?
---
Any really good DPS is gonna know that threat drops are part of their rotation.
---
Go hard, tank taunts and has his aggro slingshotted to match the DPS. The DPS dumps threat and now the tank has all the lead he needs.
---
How exactly is he a terrible human being? That has to be some truly terrible stuff he has done to be classified like that. The only things I've seen so far wouldn't even make him a bad person, but it would make some neck beard minorities that like to get offended about everything call him a bad person. So what exactly would qualify him as a terrible person?
---
I believe the addon IcyHud has an option like that. I know for sure it‚Äôll create bars on either side of your toon.
---
Wish there was a actual feat for dying..loss of items or a Rez sick-like-debuff till you clear (‚Äúx‚Äù) amount of XP
---
I said ‚Äúyes!‚Äùout-loud when you landed that hamstring in your tale. I could see everything! Great recount of your adventure!
---
People actually cared about this?  Like, were upset?  I didnt take advantage of it, I dont really care.  I lost nothing from them doing it, there isnt a finite amount of items or gold.  Bummer that the rest of us have to play the game we were expecting to play?  I guess?
---
been playin ally since early 2006 and two days ago I rerolled Horde.  
---
/silly as an undead male made it all worth it.
---
Depends. Can your dps wait for a sunder or two?
---

---
Bug = game functionality that isn't working as intended. Exploit = use of working game mechanics in a way not predicted by devs and considered harmful to game balance.
---
So it's actually bug, exploit respectively.

Isnt Brasil already a pvp zone?

That‚Äôs a good question. He‚Äôs not even stealthed. Tsk tsk.
---
Communism does not propose or imply genocide. There is nothing offensive about communism as an abstract concept. Nazism describes other races as interior and calls for their extermination. Communism calls for a stateless, classless society. I did not name my guild "stalinist party"
---
DABU!
---
Was leveling my fishing and saw an Orc fighting some turtles. I happen to go stealth when I was done and sneak up behind them as they sit on the ground, eating. 
---
Standing right behind them, I unstealth and /y Boo! 
---
 
---
They jumped and turned so quick, I like to think they feared their pants. I then patted them on the head and went back to fishing.
---
This was my favorite leveling quest chain back in the day. Takes you all over the world and has a ton of steps. Gives a good chunk of xp too if I remember correctly. I‚Äôm level 35 right now but I‚Äôm really looking forward to revisiting!
---
They do suffer pushback actually, play a priest. You have bubble, no pushback. Once bubble goes away, it suffers pushback. Literally anyone with a weapon swing timer can tell you that.
---
Sounds like a bunch of wussies. When my bros ding I say f\*ck you nolifer. I only GZ my wife.
---
Can someone tell me if/ how auctionator is better than auctioneer? I have auctioneer atm not sure if it's worth to switch.

Go buy a shit ton of +arcane damage, and a greater magic wand, and you'll fucken see the difference in damage numbers
---
Yeah that's cute and all now how much will the general goods merchant give me for them?
---
Why am I going to work ffs, I wanna play the game...
---
Perfectly balanced, as an rp-pvp server should be.
---
Hey, whoever said trolls were smart? Why else would a basement dweller like me make a post complaining about a trivial issue on reddit
---
An almost 40 year old zoomer hey? I must be the only one.
---
So does your mums cock
---
This does feel good, and +1 for the name! din elefant!
---
I use Garrote quite alot since i can garrote -&gt; slice n dice and then i got around 30-50 energy and can auto attack twice before bursting with sinsiter strike. I think it works great since the tank gets a chance to more easily build aggro in the first 5 seconds of the fight
---
Oh yea, that's something a stable adult says. Can I just assume your previous comment was just projection?
---
You made like 900g off of Devilsaur hide alone?
---
Damn I need to find me a grind that'll pay off.
---
I'm 7800/21000 into revered and I just can't seem to find a gold farming method that works. :/
---
I appreciate your comment because I did not know this was a thing people used to do. In fact I didn‚Äôt even know it had a name attached to it which is probably why I had trouble googling it. Thanks!
---
I was leaning towards it being a bannable glitch but if it was a known thing in the original then how would they punish someone for it now?
---
that being said I heard someone say that pk‚Äôing on the cage in gadge is bannable and you can report people for it, but I believe that is an old glitch. Do you have thoughts on that one? It‚Äôs the one where you kill people in town without guard agro.
---
Think the icing on the cake is an ally stereotype fulfilled. A epic mount level 60 ally ganking lowbies in barrens as is their custom.
---
Even more Zelda with links awakening
---
You get hardcore guilds, social guilds, leveling guilds, and drama guilds apparently.
---
I came here to say this
---
I was being ironic. I‚Äôm in my30s :)
---
That‚Äôs me. Made a horde toon and was immediately assaulted by really bad memes and edgy shit. Joined my friends on alliance and now just deal with lukewarm memes and ERP in goldshire. Lesser of two evils, I guess.
---
See this is a situation of someone that buys all the BoE's you sell on AH. I remember having the same issue when I started playing WoW originally
---
Evade bug isnt bannable.
---
I'm sure you are.
---
What's so unreal about that? Dancing in the dead zone is like the core of fighting against warriors. I haven't done it since WotLK but I bet I still have it in my muscles because those hundreds of duels don't just disappear. I had a warrior friend back then and even though we mostly haven't been in contact anymore, the last time we met he still jokingly cursed me for never letting him touch me. After like 8 years. That's what he remembered. 
---
What makes you doubt it? I heard people talking about leeway, does that have a anything to do with it?
---
Yes
---
Dal'Rend is bis pre-raid for hunters. I still wouldn't roll for it because warriors and rogues just have a greater benefit from the set.
---
That rogue would be blacklisted for me until blizz turns off the servers.
---
Why blur the name, he obviously wants you to show it?
---
Yeah, I got a rogue on my friend's list who has a habit of ripping aggro, but it's really no big deal.
---
He just pops evasion until I can taunt it back, and we never have a problem.
---
Part of the trick to good DPS is knowing what to do when you DO rip threat, just as much as knowing how to not do it.
---
Any unit frame or ui addon
---
&gt;OP refusing to listen all logic and reason
---
We got that clear from the guild name.
---
Wait, holy shit. I've done this quest at least 200 times and I am just now realizing it's a reference to Chasing Amy by Kevin Smith who just happens to be one of my all time favorite directors, creators, actors, etc. Thank you for this extremely valuable knowledge! (not sarcasm, I literally mean it!)
---
I had to do this and I recently got shoulder surgery... I had one arm, it was frightening
---
It's been explained to me. Thanks for your valiant effort though.
---
How could i mute the sound from my mechanostrider?
---
I used to go server to server mass RDMing lol
---
Right, that's not a lot. Especially considering work out in vs. Outcome. There's a storm of levelers right now so they will sell until the storm is over. That type of item is a one and done so it has no long term abilities unlike potions, food, etc.
---
That was epic.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what it implies or not 
---
It‚Äôs a political thing 
---
Political stuff is banned 
---
Easy as that
---
You don't see anything wrong with coordinated cross faction collution to manipulate an economy in a game centered around factional conflict where by design you cannot communicate with the other faction short of emotes?
---
Fantastic post. I wish this sub filled with more posts like this!
---
how did u sheathe ur 2h sword if u had a 1h and shield
---
They have cd in the buff, Ony head quest will only give out the buff if it‚Äôs been 2 hours or more since since the last Dragonslayer buff was given out. If there is a dragons head on the pike you won‚Äôt get a buff when you turn in the quest, try to layer and find a layer that doesn‚Äôt have the head up for display and you‚Äôll get the buff.
---
Or i could just join a guild where the loot system is transparent
---
You're so dumb even the shit mods removed the post.
---
Either you're full of shit or too stupid to access the internet.
---
Click the button. It will make it all go away..
---
Whoever has more people around that hour.
---
In exchange we get real cities and not two glorified campsites and a literal sewer. Fair trade, I say.
---
Lmfao man just laugh it off and go find another guild. These people are fucking clowns. Whatever.
---
I always hated the warrior one, too many damn axes.
---
I‚Äôm on a PvE- server (not by choice, all my friends who started earlier chose it so I followed) and keep my PvP flag on at all times. 
---
I‚Äôve also made others become PvP flagged as they buff/heal me so iI can easily are the PvP-flag happen.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be offensive 
---
Per tos politics stuff is banned 
---
Your whole explanation 
---
Most likely your guild pissed some basemendwellers off who mass reported the name or sth
---
I was in Timeless Requiem on Ner'Zhul back in the day.
---
Honestly, as much as I love WoW's soundtrack, I only really have music on when RPing. Otherwise I have Spotify running instead.

My first VW was Kraktast.  He was cracktastic.

Well said sir.
---
I was doing something similar for my leatherworking, mostly to find out how much money I would lose/gain from buying leather instead of farming it myself. For 200-250 on LW I found I could make a slight profit by just vendoring the items when Thick Leather is 1g 25s or below per stack. I might flesh it out to something similar to yours though.
---
I did some basic math for a friend who had tailoring and found they were losing like 50s+ per item in the 200 range if they vendored the items, and many were too saturated on the AH to be worthwhile. Felt bad with the sheer number of tailors my server has.
---
! RemindMe 12 hours
---
plenty of less known aoe spots are uncontested

I even bought a blue armor and blue weapon, when you sell all the shit you look you have enough money to buy everything you want and still have money left.

WoW classic is the first time ive ever played this game and I love it. And to be completely real, im just a 24 old dude who likes to have fun gaming and I want others to have fun too. I made a Human mage and have gotten to level 30 so far, and have had a fair amount of horde interaction. Ive never attacked first and, most of the time, im looking to help them. I even saved a level 18 orc from death in the southern part of ashenvale as he was fighting a level 22 mob. It felt good. But I think some of you are just way too invested in this Horde vs. Alliance shit. Its cool having an active pvp element like this but damn, dont be jerks.
---
Hillsbrad, STV, and surprisingly Thousand Needles all seem to be infested with Alliance which makes it incredibly hard to level as they tend to be level "??" too.
---
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.

I've been fortunate to have some generous guildmates to mail me greens that wouldn't sell on the AH, so I've got a ton of materials. I now am at 225 enchanting at 36, though I'm dreading having to go into uldaman for new enchants.
---
The major plot points of any prequels are already laid out and they'll only need to make up details in between, so hopefully no one screws it up
---
I‚Äôm leveling a Hunter alongside my friend and picked up Engineering/Mining. I know Engi is hard to level. But I have more time to play than my friend so I‚Äôm thinking of starting an alt and been wondering what professions would help me supplement my Hunter‚Äôs Engineering? Skinning/mining or should I go skinning/LW to make gear for my Hunter and money too? Any ideas?
---
something something pvp on a pvp server
---
Do you write often? Cuz that was some damn good writing!
---
Yeah but you also have to play a gnome :/
---
Warlocks are really strong in wpvp, fear not breaking instantly on dmg is sooo strong.
---
Oh no
---
You dank it, you tank it, thats the end of it. - Also, after spamming SM as whatever, healers will need to be speced for healing, and tanks will need to be speced for tanking. It sucks, but thats the name of the game. On the other hand, you dont spend even half the time they do, assembling a group. - Aside that, I agree; chill the ffff out, and let us build some aggro.
---
I haven‚Äôt really noticed anything that would suggest it‚Äôs more LGBT+ friendly than others but then again I‚Äôve only recently gotten out of the barrens
---
Man they really wish they affected us this much huh
---
I completely agree. We should never assume anything is scripted correctly. If something seems off THEN REPORT IT. Blizzard can only use their client to CONFIRM mechanics/stats, the game is not by definition scripted perfectly.
---
#showtooltip immolate
---
/petattack [target=mouseover,harm][harm]
---
/cast [target=mouseover,harm][harm] immolate
---
This was the first macro I wrote and remains my favorite to this day. Immolate is my preferred opener as it tags the mob, and requires charging which can be done before combat.
---
This macro charges immolate while simultaneously commanding your minion to attack. The range of immolate combined with the charge time allows your minion to release a spell of their own or close the gap between yourself and the target before you pull aggro.
---
[Target=mouseover,harm] allows you to simply move your cursor over a mob and press the hotkey to attack without targeting them prior. However, make sure that you also have [harm] following the previous condition or else the macro will not work on a targeted enemy without the cursor explicitly on it.
---
Have fun!
---
Thanks, and good points on nature res. Plus even worse with no nature res curse. Maybe if there was a weapon oil or something for that.
---
Not playing a shaman, but seemed slightly unfair that the paladin tanking kit had more work done.
---
But that is not it, lmao. The point is that they put in all this weird and wonky shit back in vanilla, but then forgot all about what about the game cool and fun to play. Im not talking about reusing a specific event; im talking about implementing cool and wonky shit into the game and doesnt need a purpose. On retail every little cave, Stone or tree must have a purpose. In vanilla there were loads of random shit without a purpose. Like a random dragon hidden away in a cave in Silithus. Nothing was related to it, it was just there.
---
That has existed for ages, a satirical jab at all the guilds with latin names. There were tons of them back in the day. Couldnt walk 10 steps in ironforge without seeing someone from &lt;memento mori&gt; or &lt;vae victis&gt; or some stupid shit
---
TBH, I use to roam with a 5man in vanilla, and when we were looking for WPVP, we'd go to STV and viciously camp someone who was low level.  Wasn't personal, we just knew people being camped by skulls would get the reaction we wanted, which was lvl 60s showing up thinking they're going to be heros, but instead get jacked up by guys in T2-T3 Gear who were looking for a fight.  The low levels are just bait for white knights.  When they show up, he can go about his business.
---
Probably both
---
Should I sell green gear or auction it? I have a level 5 alt to disenchant greens but what do I do with the mats? Do I need a level 35 toon to turn the mats into useful stuff with master enchanting?
---
I have a level 11 warrior. Really enjoying so far. It‚Äôs a slow grind, but will pay dividends in the long run
---
Crying. So many feels.

This is perfect, just the other way around

&gt; How exactly is he a terrible human being?

He abused layering to storm Ogrimar and crashed the server for a bunch of other people... there's one.

I play a priest and this is not true. Wands do not suffer pushback

&gt;Getting a bit meta here, but apparently they used to use Dark &gt;Portals for instance markers back in alpha, and there was one planned underwater in Azshara.
---
in the The World of Warcraft Diary by John Staats he stated that it was not clear during the development where the dark portal should be located. they thought it would be nice to have it underwater so for some time it was located in azshara.
---
Somebody draw a short comic about this, please :(
---
Loot council can be the objectively better system if the people who manage it are good at it 
---
The idea of lout council is that every item is put to optimal use while being as fair as possible 
---
DKP is weird
---
Oh damn. That's a fantastic staff. Grats. Didn't even know that was in the game.
---
Caverns of Time exists in Classic. So does Hyjal. So does the Karazhan Crypt. 
---
It's just not easy to get to those places. 
---
It's easy as pie to get beyond the Greymane Wall though.
---
Prot has basically nothing in the way of threat generation, aswell as getting less rage due to taking less dmg.
---
You have to screw with AOE'ing mages when you see them though. Next week the mage will be level 60 so it is a very limited time opportunity.
---
Ok cool, I will have to try it. Thanks!
---
wrll he isnt wrong. nobody sheeps or cc anymore. its zergfest all the way from wc to ubrs
---
"For Warlocks at 60" - As my reddit name show, i'm pretty frustrated about which specc i should play. Either SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin. I've read so many different guides, watched YouTube, and asked players ingame. And everyone is saying always going either one, not a dominant specc. Overall i know DS/Ruin is doing more DMG later on, but it's really bad for WPvP since you lose your succubus. Any thoughts or answers?
---
It is not about handicapping your group, it is about thinking about your Healer.
---
Healers have to drink a lot more when they have a Two-handed Tank and unless there is a Mage in the group he will have to pay for the drinks on his own.
---
It is even worse if the Tank doesn't give a damn about your mana and just rushes in while you are at 23% and just started drinking thus wasting another drink as you have to save his sorry ass.
---
That and I have yet to see a Two-Handed Tank that is actually capable of holding aggro instead of it being split across the entire group which is even more mana intensive. 
---
Technically you could probably use 2h up until ZF but I know plenty of healers that blacklist Two-handed tanks (on my server) and they refuse to run the dungeons with them again.
---
No one is asking the Tank to respec to Prot BUT at least keep your Shield on at all times and use your abilities (Shield Block) to mitigate the damage instead of shoving it all off on the Healer's shoulders.
---
Holy fuck, what a story! Loktar Ogar, friend!
---
If layerhopping in the world wasn't allowed, then blizzard would probably have said something considering that it's been abused by a large part of the playerbase ever since layering was introduced in the beta. 
---
At this point it's safe to conclude that hopping in the world is completely allowed.
---
I made sure every hunter knew beforehand that Dal'rend mh/oh was to only be rolled on by Warriors and Rogues prior to them joining :)
---
I‚Äôd much rather choose from Ugly and green, ugly and blue, ugly and dead, or ugly and literally just a cow.
---
Thank you! This has enough customization settings that I can just make my own how I want it. I Appreciate it.
---
The amount of leashes on monsters is really making the game less fun. I loved taking the pvp guys from Arathi and Alterac all over pservers and now every "important" mob has like a 20 foot leash. Real boring stuff.
---
This is such a pedantic thing to point out lol. Everybody can read his name.
---
Layers were annoying me too. I was trying to trade with someone and could see them even though we were both standing by the Org mailbox within inches of each other.
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been helplessly ganked questing in strangle thorn Vietnam makes this feel extra nice.

They wear armbands with feathers on them, which does suggest sapience at the very least. The "visit the raptor nests" quest specifically tells you that it is *arm bands*, not feathers that grow on the raptor itself, so they have to fashion armbands from *something*, collect feathers and deliberately choose to wear them.
---
Way to answer his question.
---
More like a crane
---
Dunno about him, but I had to use a few CCs in a couple of early runs. I mean like Deadmines/Ragefire early.
---
That was mostly an issue of "Everyone is in whites/grays, nobody has any abilities yet, and we're all still figuring things out" though.
---
I've been going back and forth between mage and rogue. I'm on a pvp server and I like the idea of rogue to avoid getting ganked. But at the same time I feel like mages bring more to dungeons. Probably not gonna raid much at 60. Might just pvp, if I respec to sub daggers at 60, is that spec also viable in dungeons?
---
I agree. Ebonart pact is better btw
---
I transferred from a full to a virtually empty server I /who'd in ogrimmar at peak time and found only 30 people in total. It became completely unenjoyable so I just rerolled on another server instead.
---
Van Cleef. Acronyms annoy the fuck out of me too when I don't know what it means.
---
Alliance look weak
---
Yeah but that's for maximum camera zoom distance, isn't it?
---
Do you have a link to a guide/vod of your run? would love to see the efficiency!
---
You would need the best of the best gear. I did it a bit in BC. But that isn't where we are at now.
---
Prot is useless till you have 10 or 11 points in arms.
---
As a druid I just waited for the alliance group to pull the mobs and grabbed the egg, then stealthed away.  PVE server btw.
---
Apparently you have never quested in Hellfire Peninsula.
---
You're telling me 400g is worth around $800? $2 for 1g?
---
Unless you are hunter.  :)
---
Ez money
---
Can anyone help me out here? Can i just turn runecloth in again and again to earn rep because i did this once in Orgrimmar and i could only turn in 1 stack and now the "repeatable" quest is gone.
---
takes away from warlock class identity
---
Well, I sold my old WOTLK account when I moved from the UK back home on ebay for  ¬£ 250.. Was 2010
---
Can‚Äôt tell you how many times back in the day I would singe or double point kidney shot to get a mage to use their blink, and start the CD duration for my next larger 5 point kidney
---
classicwow.live can help if you‚Äôre ever wondering where u should quest next. the thing about classic is you‚Äôll be needing to jump from zone and a zone can be easy for you until a certain point then you‚Äôll have to leave and level somewhere else and when you‚Äôre ready, come back to the zone you were originally at to finish the harder quests. leveling in vanilla takes a long time bc you don‚Äôt have any special gear yet and mobs are a lot more dangerous
---
You're asking if the guy shouting "LOVE SMALL WEE WEE" knows that tinypp means.....yeah  man, I'm pretty sure he knows.
---
You beautiful bastard! You did it! :D
---
I think the items below level 60 aren't worth to farm a dungeon (except it's for a pvp-alt in the lower brackets). I do the dungeons for the quests. So I would definitely continue the dungeon. 
---
However, if someone rolled need on an item he can't use and another group member needed it, I wouldn't group with the player again.  In a level 60 dungeon  I might even channel my inner diva and give the group the him-or-me-choice ( which is very effective on my healer).
---
Dear non-warriors.
---
Git gud.
---
I just don't think they need additional targeted threat honestly. Single target rockbiter+earthshock on cooldown is really good aggro holder if you have a taunt to reset threat from other people. That is why I worry about mana though, if you're using earthshock constantly you will run into mana issues (popping mana pots on cooldown is a pretty big detractor for jo shmo tanking). I'd rather work around enabling what we have and already works. Simply holding aggro by auto attacking something isn't particularly class flavoured or fun is it?
---
Toughness or anticipation tweaks fall too nicely into general buffs instead of tanking specific ones. This means we'd have to keep them scaled down enough that they wouldn't be relevant in tanking as they are now.
---
I do think it's doable, just have to be careful. Vanilla is very well balanced from a class perspective. Accidentally overshadowing bear tanks which already struggle is a concern of mine.
---
Gods I've missed doing that. I rolled Alliance this time round for something different :(
---
Isn't this whole thread because you DIDN'T see that difference?
---
Hes a rogue hes just in the pic to get loot

His name was Tenderbeef.

---
Lol how the hell do you say that?
---
Although it makes the calculation a little bit more complicated, dont forget the disenchanting quest rewards and BoE's is most of the time a net loss. Therefore you would count that as "spending" money to level due to the lost opportunity cost.
---
I've been in Guilds like that man, you don't want to be in Guilds like that. You need a Guild that is 100% legit and not a bunch of sour pusses who can't handle shit like someone not saying congratulations.
---
Yup. Google gold prices right now
---
its dumb, I have never ran a dungeon where threat or cc was an issue at any point. WC to ibrs is just a zergfest, and if mage pulls aggro with blizzard just drag the pack of mobs along blizz path so he can nova at the end.
---
everything is easy, so peiole wnats to get shit done fast
---
The point is you do what you want to do. You fight monsters that are your level if you want to. You fight monsters lower if you want to. You do quests wherever you want if you want to.
---
But as far as your basic experience gaining you are never stuck because you can always kill something. It's up to you to decide what is the most fun.
---
Wait, you mean chinese prisons made their inmates play wow? Wow.
---
Just checked on ebay. Some dude wants to sell his lvl 60 shaman + 120 rouge for 850‚Ç¨. Keep dreaming buddy

You can always take the Tram from IF down to Stormwind and do quests in Elwynn or westfall.

The towers in the middle of the canals lead into an extended version of stockades that has the zone entry for "The Vault". This one is unrelated but presumed to be for player housing.

All of you who agree with the post need to check yourself. YOUR ATTITUDE is ruining classic. Your energy on such a dumb topic is ruining it for you, you idiots. LET PEOPLE PLAY HOW THEY WANT TO PLAY. If you thought for a minute a streamer wasn‚Äôt going to get preference and gold you fooled yourself. Now play the game the way YOU want to and cut out the QQ.
---
One of the few things I like about the guy is his IRL "Zack" (that's his name btw) channel in youtube, where he doffs the Asmongold persona and just talks like a normal person.  When he's not playing up the camera, he's not that bad of a guy.
---
I have almost shed a tear. Beautiful story brother.

Did you a favour mate, he sounds like a knob

For you it's a traumatic abomination, on a FF14 server it's just tuesday.

I have a priest at 38 and I‚Äôve never suffered pushback on my wand.
---
I‚Äôll never forget that I saw Jared and his crew when he visited the UK all those years ago ! Ahh this takes me back - I wish their series continued because it was hella cringe but so damn good !
---
Dude 5 instances an hour? Did you farm GY?
---
Horde, because on a PVP server you will want to be killing every damn gnome you see. Kill them all
---
That was a wild ride start to finish, thanks for sharing your story.
---
Destro locks have insane burst. It's not as fast as the mage burst but it's still quite easy to set up with succubus charm and fear.
---
 Also you get a free mount in a few levels, stay on the dark side my friend.
---
Head to Goldshire and quest around there until you can move to Westfall.  That will get you set up for Dead Mines dungeon at lvl 18.   
---
I always found the human areas better to look at then the snow where you are.  But I'm horde so... yeah
---
Wait a level 60 warrior gets his by a Psychic scream a charge AND a hamstring first time from a 18 warrior and 25 priest... Holy shit would I be mad at that.
---
And how did you get to the mage for your Kidneyshot?
---
Realized this the other night, I just killed spiders forever till I eventually got all my bears.   
---
Doesn't bother me since people that will camp in an area and wait only for their quest mobs are gimping their own xp.   Aggressively camping toxic horrors in Felwood? Cool, I'll kill treants in the area and nab any horrors that spawn near me.   
---
Same with quests like Dustwallow killing the whelps, I just set up in an area and circled around killing any and all crocs/dragonkin that were there and nabbed whelps as I seenem. Rumor has it people hunting exclusively for whelps are running circles under leveled to this day.
---
Elaborate troll?
---
Male AND Female Tauren?
---
Everybody's experience of the community is not the same. However we all have the same basic formula in crafting our community experience. We read public chat and if something offends or upsets us we are the report it or engage with it or ignore it.
---
We had to do these things 15 years ago as well. It just requires more effort from us to do them now, to craft our community experience now, because we are less immersed in the game because of burnout or how much we played or blah blah blah
---
A truly epic tale.
---
Leveling is slow. You‚Äôll start to only get a handful of quests in each zone at a time and even a couple of those will have you going to other zones across the world just to hand them in or pick up another single quest. Welcome to classic, don‚Äôt be in a rush to level. It‚Äôs about the journey.
---
This is great
---
I'm honestly not sure if abusing pathing mechanics in the open world is bannable tbh. People sat ontop of the GZ cage, the hut in WS and the spot in BB that all allowed you to safely attack the enemy faction for hours at a time back then. I rarely passed the spot and there wasn't a group of people doing it in any of the towns i mentioned.
---
It's possible everyone who did it got banned, but it was simply so popular that there was never a shortage of 60s wanting to safely throw fireballs at people leveling, but i honestly don't know. 
---
Personally never did it so i'm incapable of saying if they banned people for it, whereas i reset mobs in HUNDREDS of dungeons in vanilla with all sorts of random people, tought people how to do it, etc and was very vocal about it but never even recieved a warning for it.
---
Tell him you are using an add on to auto decline reply to ginvites, sorry that the add on is a bit chatty about why they should fix theirs
---
Stick a piece of gum on keyboard to keep W pressed.
---
This happened to me 14 year ago got taken under the wing by a good guild seems far and few between for people to help/understand not everyone is a wow veteran
---
Leather working is hard to estimate as in most cases leather workers have skinning leveled which adds another element to the equation which is time to kill. If i can be bothered i may look at this at one point.
---
I was watching Shroud last night andi really liked his interface. Can you help me discover the addons he's using?  I can see Bartender, but i don't know the one that shows the mobs name with health and castbar. And also the portrait frames and the toem one, i really have no clue.  Thanks!
---
What kind of loser plays alliance?
---
You dont need an illegal program to regroup. The only thing you need is a target, interact with target and click to walk enabled.
---
I understand that there are people out there who want to take the game causally, but for the rest of us there's an addon that monitors your active guild members and posts a customizable message to /g, /w or both every time a person gains a level. There's another addon that can track your chat and auto-reply "GZ" when someone says "ding".
---
Yes the economy is still dead. Wait for a lot of People to reach 60 and farm Gold beyond their epic Mount.
---
Thats the time that People will stark making alts because there is not a lot to do besiders MC and Ony until P3.
---
By then you will be able to sell "low level" epics for a good chunk of money
---
It is only illegal if you get caught ;) Dunno how they'd tell unless they ban everyone in BiS gear and over like 100k gold. I have both and if they ban me meh. Its only a month.
---
Of course. Mobs in dungeons die fast, perfect for an ambush spec.
---
Entaro tassidar my friend
---
The last boss is 47 so I‚Äôd say no
---
I would call you lucky to realize this sooner than you could made it to max level.
---
Skinning mining I would say. Engineering eats up a lot of metal. If you can have two characters funneling ore/bars it will help a lot.
---
Also if I'm not mistaken some of the best LW gear is bound to you when you make it. So having it on an alt might not be the best idea but I could be wrong.
---
I can agree on the no challenge part, but for whole other reasons. While leveling through hillsbrad and ashenvale, I was engaged about 15 to 20 times by one or multiple alliance players. Not even once I even saw their level (some of them even had mounts). There is no challenge in that for me too, because all I could do was fear, run, shield, and pray.
---
The only pleasurable PvP experience for me was a fight in front of the BFD entrance.
---
All of that is on a Horde dominated server btw.
---
Could be worse. Lookingforgroup on Old Blanchy is just straight racism and bigotry 24/7.
---
No. Boss is 47
---
It is better than back in Vanilla. But the anonymity of the internet is the big opportunity for every asshole who is to cowardly to speak his mind eye to eye. 
---
And the younger the audience, the more toxic it gets.
---
If you want to pvp too, succubus is important.
---
 Same but an hour later. Have a nice work day (:
---
I wish you the best of luck getting the high lvl flasks.
---
So its worth on every alt, right? Since you need some Engineering stuff need the profesion to use them, right?
---
I am starting to get really annoyed by players in general. Real vanilla was never this toxic or entitled. Speaking of which: Stop standing on top of me and demanding  "inv" when
---
1) We already have a group. We are just fine,  don't want to split loot with unnecessary extras.
---
2) We already have our quest target 60% dead. 
---
Gimmi a break...Effin wait for the respawn like we had to.  Folks need to deal with waiting. We had some idiot say "BM" at us because he didn't get invited to kill a named quest drop in Ashenvale. Drood, you were a stealthed cat that popped up outta nowhere once we were already killing the mob. No we did not add you, we were kinda busy killing a red level mob and you were not our problem. Wait for the gosh darn respawn instead of throwing a fit. Anyway just ranting, free therapy.
---
Read the first line of the post. He is not talking about STV global.
---
He even statess that he sees several posts about it on this specific forum. Which is my point. Ignore em...
---
Ah man, can't believe this doesn't have more upvotes. Are we that old?
---
I don't disagree, I was just clarifying what the post meant for the person who has now deleted his comment.
---
I was on the same boat but I kept my mage, in classic as a rogue you kited very easily.
---
Yeah
---
I‚Äôm not speaking directly to you.
---
Either. Pick what you want.
---
Horde dumb dumb
---
How hard is it to finish killing the mobs, run to the next pack refresh three totems, then start drinking.  You can keep drinking until the tank is half hp.  Mana should never be an issue.
---
Find better guild or stop raiding. There are your choices. Loot master decides who gets what and thats it. DKP/councel wont change that.
---
It wouldnt be idiotic as its clear abuse.   
---
It wouldnt be impossible as some are doing it in a completely obvious way.   
---
I agree however that its probably not worth their time as the consequences are not that grave. I just pointed out that if they wanted to, they absolutely could do it.
---
Some preBiS lists state Pads of the Dreadwolf as preBiS for warrior, because the were running on different itemisation patches.
---
I feel like this kind of thing comes from a guild started by a few friends who wanna feel like they're in charge of something, but otherwise have a pretty flaccid vision for the guild (if they have one at all).  And they get to feel big when they can kick someone on some trumped up accusations.
---
how did you know it would be a 60% damage increase
---
So its not just Lannisters who pay their debts, apparently tauren do it too, with serious style!
---
That actually sounds like a great idea since I already use Q, E, and R but I don't think I can undo over 10 years of muscle memory using WASD for movement.
---
if he's doing it on classic, I imagine him to do it at retail too. Now think about how much gold he can make Multiboxing 60 Chars through some old raids and stuff
---
But Engineering does need the profession to use the explosives, right? And from what I read their damage is a great addition to both PvP and PvE situations.
---
&gt;Icon: inv\_misc\_bone)taurenskull\_01
---
But why is it so small then? Is it a baby tauren skull? *Where ARE* all the baby tauren?
---
I mean its possible, most people farmed pirates to keep bloodsail rep which why it taked so long, You can kill wastelanders for rep I believe, and keep handing in 5 water sacks for like 40 rep as well?
---
Yeah dude, like others have said: you dodges a bullet there. Fuck those guys, you dont want to play with egotistic self centered jackasses.
---
Watching that gives me another reason to be glad I'm not on faerlina.
---
your server is a 60/40 split server, but whats the online population?
---
im on a locked server that is a 60/40 split, but that means about 3000 more horde than alliance are online when the server is locked. 
---
camping, as in, multiple horde people running around my body, has been an every day occurrence since i hit contested areas.  im currently at a little over 150 deaths and im not even 60  yet.
---
Barrens chat suggests otherwise
---
There is also the giant Naga reflection if you look at the roof. Honestly it was kind of eerie
---
Send him to the ranch!
---
This is WoW Classic.
---
Very cool story!
---
Totally crazy idea right, but how about - now hear me out because this is going to seem totally wild - how about asking him in the chat
---
Good luck and enjoy your terrible future interface
---
What do you mean?
---
Bliz launcher, though thanks for commenting that.
---
Uhhh I think you would be in the minority with that opinion sir.
---
DE and sell the mats on the AH. There is plenty of money in the economy and there is no deposit for mats. It‚Äôs the most value per item.
---
Just more people same toxic %
---
Its a very simplistic gameplay for sure. Put on pain, mind blast and repeat mind flays. But you still have interesting uses for dispells, fears and silence. Also shadowpriest kills both mages and rogues easily. Everything actually, maybe only warlock being tough.
---
I find this so weird, having multiple warriors in the group yet the group spam LF1M tank and go for half an hour.
---
I personally haven't done a single dungeon where I wasn't the tank. 
---
But my god levelling as a warrior is so painful. Sometimes it's more efficient to just grind mobs rather than try to solo some of these quests.
---
You really think that stupid people like this inhabit just one server? :)
---
Yeah just leave the body with the loot and ride away. Come back in a few mins and skin that shit
---
too late
---
Maybe he cleared welplings and ony just landed
---
Or warlock xD
---
Going from Legion Disc to Classic healing is about as big of a gameplay change as i can imagine lol. Legion disc is one of the G.O.A.T class designs.
---
Both humans and dwarves can litrrally choose a dark skin tone you fuckwit.
---
Lmao I was waiting for the mages who got 3x mage groups leveling to start raiding. More of this incoming
---
Epic!
---
Just make a new window for only PMs
---
Im leveling using 2 hander and using the Fury tree. The bonus health regen, crit and attack speed are too good. But once I hit 40 or get the lvl 30 axe I'll probably respec Arms
---
I was grinding in STVietnam and was having an interesting day, to say the least. I saw this night elf Hunter running towards me and started lighting him up as soon as he was in range, the full arsenal. DP, SWP, MB, then fear and facemelt. He just stood there, waving at me... So I stopped, but DP and SWP were still eating him. I waved back just before he fell over. /sorry
---
TL;DR if you are going to say hello to an spriest in an opposing faction, maybe do it from a distance
---
I'm playing prot/holy and I'm using a two hander for solo, one hander DPS is lower than low
---
I'm lvl 26 and enhance with int gear for healing dungaroos. 
---
I hit softer, but can get more shocks/heals in. So meh
---
That's unrelated to your spec. IF the dps wants to blow up the mob asap and pull aggro, even if you are prot specced, they will still pull the aggro.
---
Same but another hour later (also another time zone I guess) Have fun at work (:
---
Shadowform is not some revolutionary thing they will help you kill twice as fast as soon as you hit 40. It mostly helps for pvp at that point. I prefer to wait until 44 at earliest. That way, you‚Äôll have 5/5 imp wand, shadowform, and the next rank of mind flay (mind flay starts getting good from this point). 
---
Also keep in mind at higher levels, it comes progressively harder to heal as shadow. Of course it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs just harder with zero healing talents.
---
OK, then it might just be that communism is a political idea and blitz doesn't want to have anything related to politics in them game.
---
&gt; That's why we have High Queues time guys LOL
---
That's why you have high queue times.  Most of us avoided that server
---
Yep, keep ganking the underdogs and you turn your PvP server into a PvE server.
---
While levelling any class can tank - druid, warriors or paladins. Actually druids are really good dungeon tanks.
---
I mark skull and start the fight. Hunter immediately multishots so I try to get triangle back, then I taunt the skull because I didn‚Äôt have time to focus on it and one guy was actually doing things properly by attacking it, now rogue has aggro on triangle because he doesn‚Äôt know what skulls are and I can‚Äôt get it back, but no need to worry about that because circle has run off to the priest who dumped some dots on it. I chase the priest who is running away from me, skull runs off, triangle is still with the rogue who has evasion so he‚Äôs doing alright.
---
Rinse and repeat every pull.
---
protection from what? Ze Germans?
---
Aight, ty for input
---
Zone discoveries scale with level iirc but yes, you'd expect high level. My bank alt was like 90% just walking to IF
---
First time on youtube? Or dealing with ads liyerally anywhere
---
Luckily ~~chromie exists~~ Blizzard doesn't care about lore or continuity so literally none of this is a problem.
---
Listen man, some people enjoy killing lowbies even when they are max level, it's a power dynamic thing, people of both factions do it all the time. Maybe in real life they are powerless dweebs, but in world of warcraft they are very powerful and they are going to express that power on you whether you like it or not.
---
Ok, ty
---
My first ever char way back when got there with 12 days. I believe my second was way quicker. I am currently lvl 29 on classic so we will see how that goes
---
As a warrior I think you should either try and group up for all of your quests (3+ people in group) or go to zones where most of the quests are green and the mobs are a few levels below you.
---
Druids are much better than warriors on aoe threat. Swipe + tab &gt; Sunder Armor + tab. Druids that disagree really ought to try
---
I could actually see princess being kiting though, theres lots of room, and she often stops to do a channeled aoe cast around her, resetting your max distance
---
what did u tell warriors?
---
Lol, not stealthing are you high? How do you think I make gold in this game? By NOT pick pocketing??
---
holy shit i didn't realize this was a subscription based game until you mentioned it
---
Easily troll. For pure PVE that is.
---
Easiest threat
---
Welcome to Classic. Take your time and enjoy the stay.
---
Focusing on wpvp right now is pointless as there's no honor system in place. Just go full combat until you get adrenaline rush.
---
Stop doing blow and writing stories. It‚Äôs world of Warcraft.
---
Smolderweb all the way. Tauren druid her to serve.
---
Brd has like half of the priest prebis so many priests will run it

Waiting for the tank to build aggro.

Took me around 80~ runs to see my first mainhand, seen about 5 off-hands and countless truestrikes, been living in UBRS for like 5 days at that point :(
---
Druid also don't have a taunt and they can tank even raids. Threat generation on a shaman is way better than on a warrior.
---
Im pretty sure that john staats said on the countdown to classic podcast said it was for player housing.
---
I had a guy randomly whisper me the other day like "Hey man, would you like this (blue chest armor with great stats)?" I'm thinking, whoa is this guy trying to give me this thing for free? I respond, seriously? He says back, "Absolutely! For just 5g this baby can be all yours!" Seriously man? Just post it on the fucking auction house. You're seriously going around whispering everyone on the server with a misleading copy paste message to sell your shit?
---
So there was a chance people were there but to improve performance they were hidden?
---
If you don't know if you should go tank or not: Do it. First Wave is over, many tanks already gave up. Next is the Twink Wave - many tanks will show up for like a few weeks, maybe a month. After that we'll lack tanks for a good while again.
---
How I know? Played the last 3 Expansions. Every time the same.
---
Why does this get downvoted? I don't get Reddit sometimes...
---
She was killed then brought back to life and enslaved, forgiving is hard
---
That's easy I sleep during the day
---
My personal favourite comments are like this: 
---
Person A: "5 man horde group ganking at zul'kunda, let's group up to take them on, those of us who are there!"
---
Person B: "Stop whining, just go quest somewhere else"
---
I can go to a different questing spot?? Wow what a genius piece of advice right there, how didn't I think of that!!
---
Like why are these people even on a pvp server lmao. If you're just going to give up your questing spot because there's enemies nearby you might as well play on a PvE server, same effect. You're an idiot if you're there and don't want to join that group, but you're a double idiot for making comments like that and they're so common that it's baffling.
---
Smolderweb Tauren druid. Here to serve.
---
Currently have a 41 mage but I want to learn how to and play a tank as an alt.
---
I'm tossing up between a warrior and a druid. I know Warriors are better but I can't help but find them boring. My warrior just hit level 12 and I know that level isn't where you really know how a class plays but everything just feels like a grind already. Though I did just buy a green weapon and shield which made things a LOT better.
---
Druids seem so much more interesting and fun for me, the idea behind the class, all of the different things you can do and the most important factor...Fucking nature and shit, man.
---
I have no idea if I'm even going to reach end game to really specialize on the warriors raiding ability.
---
I guess I want to go warrior if I know it becomes a bit more interactive and fun a little later on, but idk I can't help but just want to play a druid.
---
When I started reading I couldn't help but to think "oh great, another post with some stranger being nice - haven't read this one before! /s" but this was really cool OP. Happy you got to experience this.
---
Mithril Casings
---
Hi-Explosive Bombs
---
Unstable Trigger
---
all of these are used for quest turn ins.   
---
Otherwise scopes
---
Lvl 25 warrior here. Smites hammer is for lvling since its  2h and staff is 2h so i dont tuink u can equip it
---
&gt;TL;DR: Give me some time to gain threat.
---
This.  I charge, t-clap, and by the time I've stance danced, the three dps have unloaded each on a different mob.  Skull X Square have become my new best friends, but even then, there are still people who just can't comprehend that a tank in classic can't get 100% threat just by looking at a mob.  
---
Oh yeah dps?  If a mob turns and attacks you, *ffs stop attacking it and run it to the tank*.  Switch targets or stop dps altogether if you have to.  Running off down the hallway does not help, nor does fearing or deathcoiling it into another pack, nor does standing there and saying nothing.
---
Do you understand the concept of twinking?
---
Exactly this. If you see me casting hellfire id like a bubble to elongate my death but by end goal is still the same
---
Detect  Magic is magic debuff and costs next to zero mana. Applying it and polymorph together will allow mage to maintain polymorph lock on you with pretty godd chances of never coming out of sheep
---
Dps (some shorten "damage dealer" as "DD". Mostly on German servers)
---
Or an ear. Or a leg. Honestly, every food will bei fine. We spend a lot time eating
---
So you are Level 40 now?
---
Damn this is both sad and brave. Lone alliance recrutee with one goal in mind, kill hord, disappears at the horizon, never to be seen or heard of again.
---
I cry every time.
---
Not sure which one to main yet haha. Farming ore, herbs or even leather for me is quite boring (even more on Classic with the 3s cast time and chance to fail).
---
But I think you are right, it might cost alot. I probably am not seeing this cause I'm still low level and crafting only cheap stuff, it might get much more expensive later on.
---
U may not realize this but keeping players from seeing each other on a mid pop server is terrible, also yes they could do better they could have had more than 4servers near launch
---
I'm sorry I get called toxic.... But this whole pc bullshit has let tanks get to level 50 not knowing they shouldn't be spamming heroic strike.....
---
If you don't tell players they are bad then they won't learn and you will continue to have 50% of the tank population not knowing how to tank.
---
Don't shit on my lady cows
---
You'd be surprised, but glad to hear you're not arguing that
---
Sounds like you need to play a Druid! One class, can reroll to anything with a switch of gear or spec!
---
You might have bis, but you sure as hell don‚Äôt have over ‚Äòlike 100k gold‚Äô lol
---
Ahh thanks!
---
No one gives a shit about it that's the problem. Take it back to /r/wow where people fawn over cosplay and baked cookies.
---
That's exactly the reaction I had when I checked it out before launch after I subbed. 
---
The game is an abomination.
---
Cant be done tho, they throw down nets that hit for 400 ish and roots you. Unless you spent ages with invis potions and go somewhere else
---
Seems like a good deal compared to the time running that far.
---
It is such a huge upgrade to get a melee weapon so it is such a waste if a hunter gets instead of a melee class. In the same way for a rogue/warrior to roll on a bow/gun that only sits there for some extra stats when it could be used so much better on a hunter. I am fine with hunters rolling on leather and everything else, but rolling on melee weapons over a melee class makes me sad, and I am even playing as a priest. Sure you can need if you want, but I would see it as very selfish and you kind of don't want to play with selfish people in this game.
---
Yeah that was sick
---
The worst part is that the 4 keybind is in the fifth slot. What kind of monster does that
---
It was ironic. Triggering successful. Just reproduced last year and leveling casually because of it :D
---
**LEATHER BELT**
---
I hope that one day WoW factions become as intense as bipartisan politics.
---
That's why the question is do I get staff or hammer with legs, considering the staff is guaranteed and hammer a drop
---
Additionally, horde NPCs have overall stronger stats. I did a video back in 2006 proving the equivalent level guards from Tarren Mill are stronger than South shore guards. Even with an HP disadvantage from the kite, the Tarren Mill guard still won by a significant margin. The best part is this was not an RNG fluke, several other people did the same exact test and even in later expansions when the guards leveled up to help counter higher level players from dominating these towns. Same exact results every single time.
---
Blizzard favored the horde and you'd have to be a blind delusional biased fanboy not to admit it.
---
The space between...
---
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
---
&gt;Just transfer to RPPVP.
---
Are there paid character transfers? I don't see any
---
Did you take away the level range when you /who in stormwind? That‚Äôs seems incredibly low
---
Very few people I have encountered on Grobbulus commit to RP. Maybe an RP-like comment occasionally, but as a whole it feels very little like an RP server.
---
&gt; Also please equip a shield when we get a few extra. My mana pool is not limitless. That extra damage you take adds up fast.
---
Haven't seen a wannabe DK yet, but I've heard they're out there.
---
Saw a hiring ad for 200-600$ per level 60 and thought that was expensive but damn 1500 is just insane.
---
I wanna be that guy when I grow up.
---
I would like to try leveling a healer and am doubting between Troll Shaman or Priest. I won't have enough time to really raid so he'll be mostly dungeon healing with a bit of BG healing (when the phase hits). 
---
I have little experience with healing (did some shaman healing on a WOTLK Pserver) so which one would be easier to learn/master? How are they doing outside of dungeons in the endgame? Do I need to respec every time I want to do some farming? So Shamans have a lot of OOM problems?
---
I know these are a lot of questions but hope you guys can answer some of them :)
---
Im at a loss for words, im just glad i decided to take the free server migration to a smaller server, because this sort of attitude reeks.
---
Sorry it happened to you friend, at best i suppose you can write a ticket and a report them for ninja looting - i don't really know what other category there might be for it.
---
There is no clear stipulation anywhere that skinning other peoples kills is illegal, but Blizz doesn't need written rules to enforce suspensions or warnings - so try your luck with it, that's my only suggestion.
---
If he said beforehand that he would leave after that boss it would have been all right if it werent for the curses. 
---
Corpsemakerruns are pretty common. He should join one of those.
---
I practically never do quests.  Always roll tank or healer, always level in dungeons, always wind up with more gold than I ever need.  Leveling process is smooth, just never stop killing.
---
Can you tell more about it? I'm interested in those differences.
---
Hamstring against a paladin is like throwing a rock at an elephant. Improved blessing of freedom = immunity to slow
---
I was doing my lvl 30 mage quest (items of power) and gathered my 10 withered sticks.  I went to charge them into the bolt charged bramble, the lighting hit and the stick was charged, but I was low from an elemental and had to run. I run back like 1 minute after and it was gone. Nothing in the stone and nothing in my inventory. Has this happened to anyone else??? Is it normal for items to time out and have to redo the whole quest? Im new to wow :S
---
If the staff has higher damage, pick it.
---
Not g—èeat, not te—è—èible.
---
It's a symptom of a wider spread disease which is the current generation of entitled gamers who only care about furthering themselves without any regard whatsoever to the feelings of others or what is right or wrong.
---
Exactly layering was made to help the high pop servers with ques resulting in healthy pop servers suffering from kinda being alone and people just switching layers whenever you are at risk
---
Except it hasn't, privacy is assumed you don't need to clarify that point (in your other comment) although you don't care about yours, so why did you block your *own* name at all?
---
Aye. Not just a chance, almost definitely so if it was showing medium pop.
---
He is litteratly the most viewed wow streamer by large margins both classic and retail, he had freaking 300k viewers raking in money while he was in que, SLEEPING on launch day. His community is the most condensed one in wow, ever. 11-12 almost capped guilds and alot of meme guilds around that and if you actually watched him you would know that he actually tries to manage all of them. Plenty of times on the stream he will get ingame mail about olympus 3 - 11 with problems and he drags people into discord, talks that shit through and moves on. Hes a leader and anybody that says otherwise is blinded by hate.
---
Every few hours?  Black Lotuses spawn every hour, once I herb one I travel to the next zone and hunt for them.  Can usually farm 3-4 in one night just from travelling from zone to zone until the last one has a potential black lotus, then I rotate back and keep hunting.  And just watch Netflix while I do it.
---
If you logged in 'every few hours' you wouldn't need to layer hop. 
---
 There's also no fixed spawns, so not easy to camp them at the hour mark, and even them I'm not fully sure they spawn exactly 1 hour later.  I have no idea how it particularly works.
---
There's at least 7 unique spawns in Silithus spread around the map if you're curious.
---
Who is swatter
---
This is the strategy I am following for now
---
Yes absolutely normal, I am doing this for every warlock pet. It is somewhat useless to do but you gain reputation.
---
Lmao, my server is constant raids of your fair midget fucks running through questing zones picking off people 5-10 levels lower than them.
---
Honestly just level up what you want for end game. The stuff you‚Äôll do with any profession while leveling is incredibly flooded on the AH .
---
I didn't /who, seems like a better idea now thinking that people are more likely to be all over this was just on the trade district
---
As tank you want agility rather than strenght
---
See, this is what I'm afraid of. My CDs being down and suddenly a frost mage appears with sheep, frostbolt, frostbolt, fire blast, frost nova, sheep, frostbolt aaaaaaaaaaand dead.
---
Literally 1 day after my comment I ended up in a 3 frost mage meta group and it was a lot of fun. I would hate to play through every dungeon that way though. Having said that I enjoyed it a lot more than the RFD I did last night with 2 mages and a lvl 44 tank that was taking 2 mins of downtime between pulls and getting up to sheep a mob in 3 packs for the first half of the dungeon......
---
Ah, the nobility of the Tauren. May it never wane!
---
well, 15 years did pass...))
---
If this is a big problem write tickets. It‚Äôs not hard for blitz to put a owner timer on your kill after you loot. To prevent ninja skinning.
---
You can auction them sometimes if they have the stats needed for the armor class of the item. Otherwise just vendor, you won't get much more for green items. If I can vendor something for 40s I might get 70 or so from auction if sellable
---
The threat generation on a shaman is way better than the warriors. Just give them a few seconds more after the pull.
---
Just use joanas guide then
---
you will never catch me xD
---
Yes. Druid is much easier to tank on than warrior in classic. Come check out the Druid Classic Discord for questions and resources.
---
How do you sheeop someone to full health?
---
100% agree.
---
Did the +25 from my still-equipped fishing pole tip you off?
---
yes
---
I bet you also carry every type of poison and the ingredients to make more on the run while leveling
---
It depends what you want to do. If it's more you like go with what appeals with you the most, if you like to min max everything have a look at the racials and see which class race combinations work well. And also consider if you want to mainly pvp, pve or both.
---
Any answer is the right answer.
---
Here's hoping!
---
Warriors have a lot more than agility classes.
---
I am sitting at 32 at this point
---
Priests have so few buttons.. crazy
---
‚ÄúMoraxus? More like... More. AXES. Hahahahaha.‚Äù
---
it's not deleted?
---
Probably Herod and Thalnos since they were the ones available 2 weeks prior to release
---
I crush every single scum rogue I see(especially undead swine). As a dwarf warrior all they can do is try and run...they don't get very far though. No need for a group. On the flip side, horde are always running around in packs like a bunch of scared deer. 
---
I don't kill anything more than 3-5 levels lower and spend most my time fighting at level or higher. I particularly enjoy finding people having trouble getting away from honorless horde and smashing them until they go away. 
---
P.S. To that stupid rogue in redridge who thought it was fun to attack low levels when you are 28 and they are 17, I really hope you enjoyed dying for 30+ minutes over and over and over.
---
Question about phase 2...
---
So is killing a low level player vs a high level player the same in terms of how much rep you will get at the end of the week? day? Doesn't this incentivise high level players to camp low level areas to farm HKs? 
---
Do you get lower rep from repeated kills?
---
DHKs is only for civilian npcs right? 
---
So from what i understand, since ganking towns is disincentivised, the fastest farming method to farm HKs is to camp low level zones?
---
It is a sandbox so it's what you make it. I made planes, cars, tanks, turrets, and other such nonsense using wiremod and later with ACF. You don't have to roleplay. You can race watermelons.
---
Man I really loved my old priest T2 turban. I mean the new design of the transcendence set was pretty dope because of the helm and shoulders effects but compared to the other T2 sets priest was really left behind imo
---
I was the upvote that made it 7,000. Gods, that was satisfying!
---
For a guild run I completely agree, but in a pug I don't expect a hunter to pass up on preBIS just because "it's a bigger upgrade for the other guy".
---
No food, no water!
---
Swatter is a outdated ui addon that catches lua errors and is bundled onto classic addons sometimes just delete it
---
With good gear the later works and is even more efficient than using VW for the fight. Right now you can't get gear good enough for that to work reliably so you pretty much have to use your VW to bate out the dust clouds.
---
Or just do w/e you want and what feels right lol. Chill out.
---
As long as you get the core healing talents you're good to go! In terms of variation, the key is to ask: What is the composition of my group? What are the other Paladins bringing?
---
First, a digression: I hate *Holy Shock*. [Even this theorycrafting blog from back in 2006](http://paladin-guide.blogspot.com/2006/01/mana-pool-and-healing.html) talks about how bad it is.
---
A 30s CD? The worst mana-to-HP ratio? Ugh. It's a trap! No raid mechanics in Classic are so movement heavy that you're ever going to miss Holy Shock. It's especially ironic since Paladins already have the fastest, most efficient heal: *Flash of Light!*
---
You'll never see me take 31 points in Holy. Most of my time has been spent chain-healing 5/10-mans, so [this is my current build.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0550302052125-503251000311) It gives me the most versatility when PuGing.
---
My personal rules for myself were: I shouldn't need *Holy Shock* nor *Consecration* nor any points in the Ret tree anymore.
---
One of the things I learned while chain-healing Scarlet Monastery is that melee/cleave groups allow your *Judgement of Light* to do an insane amount of passive healing. This is great! Unfortunately, as you know, your *Judgement* is only refreshed by your successful melee hits. Missing a couple hits, or spot-healing the tank too much would often cause the *Judgement* to fall off halfway through a fight.
---
Because I'm not spending points in the Ret tree, I don't get *Benediction*. This means all my *Seals/Judgements* are 15% more expensive. I just can't afford to let *Light/Wisdom* fall off‚Äîespecially during a big trash pull with hard-hitting mobs. This influenced my choices to make *Light/Wisdom* last 30s (two points in *Lasting Judgement*) and to increase my hit chance (*Precision*.)
---
I never had to recast a *Seal/Judgement* on the same mob ever again before it died. Problem solved!
---
One of the things I've learned is how valuable *Blessing of Sanctuary* is for tanks, especially in 5/10-mans. Very rarely will a tank be pulling single mobs; it's always mass AoE. *Blessing of Sanctuary* provides great mitigation‚Äîand for Warriors with shields, extra DPS!
---
Unfortunately, taking *Blessing of Sanctuary* means I can't put five points in *Improved Blessing of Might*. This is what influenced my decision to throw a point into *Blessing of Kings*, as an endgame replacement for BoM.
---
Of course, really good DPS players won't ask for *Blessing of Kings*. They will ask for *Blessing of Salvation*, because they understand that what limits their DPS isn't main stat or Attack Power‚Äîit's threat! The less threat the more they can go wild.
---
The final choice was whether or not to max out *Improved Concentration Aura* or *Improved Hammer of Justice*. It's actually amazing how good *Hammer of Justice* is, not just in WPvP, but also in PvE. Stunning enraged mobs is huge! Having it up every 45s felt really powerful to me, as you can interrupt powerful casters more often.
---
That being said: In a raid I prefer 3/3 *Improved Concentration Aura* and only 1 point in *Improved HoJ*. You can switch those two around based on what kind of content you're doing, but it's not too big of a deal.
---
The only other build I'd really consider is dropping *Blessing of Sanctuary* and picking of *Improved Blessing of Might*, but I haven't needed to. If you're in a tryhard guild group with multiple Paladins, it's fun to get together and tweak each person so that everyone fills every others' gaps.
---
This is one of the reasons I love Paladins in Vanilla. It really is the best, most versatile support class. :)
---
Make a rogue - so fun and stealth lets you quest in unique ways
---
prebis is prebis buddy
---
Have you ever seen how it affects gameplay
---
Post the guild name and server, please.
---
I level as Fury and tank dungeons all the time. It\`s even easier as Arms, cause you get some relevant talents.
---
Funny how that's the argument you choose to interact with and not how you think Dal'rend is BiS over Peacemaker.
---
r/ChoosingBeggars
---
Hunter checking in, what is food/drinking for even?
---
Need the info too. For a friend.
---
Horde players the type to wave and dance to an Alliance member 1-4 levels lower, just to wait for more horde to show up and gank.
---
Seems like I've entered a dark, dark dungeon. Maybe the darkest.
---
Set your flight path then go take a shower, cook dinner and let the dog out. When you get back you should be halfway to your destination!
---
I guess prat dies that for me. I put lfg in a separate window. I can minimize that window
---
what quest log mod is that?
---
High paying job
---
Lots of free time
---
Is it possible to handle such power?
---
That the channel where he shows off the Infowars merchandise he's collecting?
---
I always backpedlle when I pull a mob in the open and I want to make my way towards the rest of my party or to the next objective or mob
---
I am groot!
---
Felstriker offhand warrior is the definition of owning meters big gratz
---
They shouldn't have to ask though, that's the thing.
---
Why are Dal Rends considered BiS for Hunters Phase 1? Are there truly no other weapons that provide better stats? I briefly combed through the stats and it looks like the only pertinent stat is the 1% crit chance on the main hand.
---
I had to suffer through one tonight in Uldaman. It was BRUTAL. He had decent threat/rage of course, but i pretty much had to spam Greater Heal on this dude to keep him alive.
---
There are plenty of addons that use external programming, that doesn't mean they break the TOS.
---
What are you? Are you heals?
---
I think everyone realizes that the launch was not well executed. 
---
But going forward I see this as better than current options: long queues and free transfers (basically the same thing but with risk of dead server and loss of name) or Blizzard giving in and keeping layering somehow.
---
Maine yall some fucking nerds.
---
Why your graphics looks much better than mine even tho i play on everything ultra with maximum render size downscaled to 1080p?
---
Early on in BFA multiboxers also made tons herbing (because the flowers can be herbed many times after they've already been picked).
---
I focused on gold until Level 40 anyway for mount. Now I'm doing professions. The later you leave professions the more expensive it will be to level is my assumption. I leveled leather working last night and went from 0-137 probably for roughly 2G max. In terms of buying lots of Light Leather and Medium leather and just vendoring everything.
---
Yeah I'm really thinking the story might not be 100% true. It is a nice story though.
---
Laughs in hunter
---
Shout out to Phiir of Deviate Delight for gifting me 25s, after my sword was made. I missed this community.
---
i know you don't want them harassed but you really should tell people who this guild is. People will just waste time getting invested with a bunch of morons.
---
You absolutely dodged a bullet there btw. gkick for not saying gz..that guild is fucked.
---
congrats you just dug your own grave alliance scum just for this post i will kill the next 11 of your brethren i encounter on my quest to level up fishing. zugg zugg mother fucker
---
Yup through desolace and stonetalon
---
Might, but I don't think priests have an instant damage spell.
---
I remember selling my account with 60 gnome warlock (mc gear + epic tiger mount) and 60 orc shaman for 700euros back in 2006. It was still allowed back then on eBay. It was alot of money for 15year old me
---
Nah I'd say that's a pretty good reason, probably the only good reason, hence my comment
---
Is there a chart to show how much gold you should be attaining per level? I'm level 23 with 6 gold 88 silver. Am I rich or poor?
---
&gt;&gt; How exactly is he a terrible human being?
---
&gt;He abused layering 
---
lmao is this satire?
---
I got camped by 3 horde yesterday.
---
I‚Äôm level 25, I just wanna kill my quest stuff. They stuck around for ages. I even went and got a cup of tea after I died to see if they‚Äôd get bored.
---
Nope.
---
I‚Äôll get my revenge one day üòÇ
---
I love playing to my class fantasy. I also try and chase after nearly dead players to try and save them with heals. And offer them priestly advice haha
---
So they have 100 chars spread out over 10 accounts paying 150 dollars a month and spend about 1000 hours to level so they can RMT and get their accounts banned within a week?
---
Or just put the spell ID
---
Same thing goes for the Rocs in Tanaris, for people trying to get their giant eggs for cooking. You have to clear the spawns of Hyenas that are inevitably left there.
---
Had a rogue sit in stealth while i cleared spawns, only to try and tag the Rocs as they spawned...
---
You don't, its randomly generated
---
The bugged out giant lol
---
I recall the rumor of the stockades . ‚ÄúThe Sewer‚Äù, the escape quest chain.. prisoners got out.. scrapped dungeon and quests.Again, old rumors.
---
&gt;Horde handed him and his scrub followers their asses today lol
---
Horde was useless, Saurfang had to step in to repel the invaders. (Damn he is OP)
---
Did you ever find a good solution for this?
---
An affront to the great horned rat.
---
to respawn instance bosses you just have to click "reset".
---
She eventually found Durotar where she became friends with the farmer Mankrik, after a night of heavy drinking at the Mankrik farm she ended up killing mankrik's wife in a drunken william tell game and is not serving a life sentence in the Orgrimmar prison.
---
Then their alts
---
it does indeed, last night i saw horde doing it in the badlands and then when me and a friend were off levelling away from the shit going down a group of alliance run past us, all about our level some 1 or 2 levels lower some higher but no ?? or greys, stop when they see its just the 2 of us and proceed to kill us and camp us a few times, but thankfully i haven't had that too much outside of STV,
---
&gt;- monster spawn rates are nerfed to oblivion, thats why it takes 1 hour for a stupid monster to spawn. it is written in "not a bug" list under blizzard forum. why would even this get nerfed? blizzard want people to suffer even more? i totally don't get the idea behind this
---
I get that it can be frustrating, but let's not exagerate ..
---
normal monsters respawn after a couple of minutes and named monsters in less than 10 minutes, I have not noticed hour long spawn timers (my highest char is 35)
---
if you have kill quests in an area with other players around, what I do is this:
---
I ask if anyone has a group, or if people want to join me, more than half the time you will either get an invite or you will be able to invite someone else
---
if the area is really overpopulated I go to another area, there are always options
---
the only time where it is extremely annoying to do qsts is when mages decided to aoe farm leaving everyone else without mobs
---
&gt; - First of all i have a full time job which means i come home at similar hour with other idk,millions of people. Which means there is queue issue 
---
ah a full time job like almost everyone else it seems
---
millions of people on your server? I guess you chose the wrong server, but in reality though, you should look up how many players per server and I think I read it was 25000 (with player still in queue)
---
You have no idea what you're talking about hahahaha. I was 19 when I started playing and went alliance. Everyone I raided with was older. Military guys, husbands/wives, even some people bordering on retirement.

Meanwhile my younger brothers (12 and 14) both picked horde from day one back in 2005, all their friends picked horde and when I made a horde character to play with them all the people they raided with were my age and younger. LOT'S of immature teens in the 13-16 range. The attitudes were ***completely*** different. Lots of scumbags and douchebags. Hated it and quit that shit, went back to alliance immediately.
---
Ah, I actually didn't know much regarding the wand (my brother plays a mage and apparently a wand is a nice tool to have). I'd hoped to continue playing to the point of doing well in the shadow tree, but had far too tough a time.
---
Yaaaay!
---
‚ÄúBut I like the horde mindset‚Äù
---
This won‚Äôt age well in 15 years...
---
Most probably a bug. I played warlock in vanilla but its so long ago i obviously cant remember it fully. It should be investigated further.
---
Also what did u do to get 300g to start with.
---
This is pretty true. While there is money to be made if you get on it, it isn't really a make or break and really doesn't have much of an impact if you're just casually playing the game and not focusing on the best farming spots. You might delay your mount a few levels further maybe, but that's really very dependent on a lot of stuff. You might find a guild that pools money for everyone's lvl 40 mounts or friends that will do the same. You might also find a Staff of Jordan in your 30's and be set for awhile. Luck plays a bit of a factor is all I'm saying. 
---
The big tradeoff for me and why I decided to take my crafting profession now, is that I much prefer leveling it as I quest than running around at level 60 farming low level mats. It's almost certainly less efficient but it feels better and creates more immersion. I'm already going to be doing plenty of farming for the good stuff.
---
Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree but you're complaining about people potentially in their late 30s when I'm almost certain you're referring to teens right? Millenials doesn't mean "literally anybody born after 1981".
---
Most unneeded post of all time
---
&gt; Blizzard will have to deal with this in some way because there is no real way for a streamer to prevent everyone from just showing up.
---
Is called layering you twat... you know, they thing he circumvented.
---
&gt; And it is definitely nothing that makes someone "a terrible human being"
---
You're right, people should be allowed to orginize  huge events that crash the server for everyone.... i mean pfssh
---
&gt; And people should not get banned for that and so far haven't been in classic.
---
People have been banned in world of warcraft for crashing the servers with these type of events in the past. The layering is a way to deal with this and Asmongold specifically used layering in such a way to bring many full raid groups onto the same layer. It is most certainly something people have gotten temp bans for in the past. It doesn't matter if it's happened yet or not on a classic server that just launched.
---
Kudos to you for knowing the 5-8 yard kite :)
---
Night of the dragon book (or was it day?) there are intelligent raptors helping Rhonin and crew in Grim.Batol.
---
Great read! Well written.
---
You need either revered or exalted with tb.
---
Druids are pretty good raid tanks too - great armor mitigation and a ton of threat in exchange for no shield and lesser defense.
---
I did indeed notice the priest was sufficiently leveled that the mobs he faced would be green to him. I usually avoided greens on my characters (druid and paladin), but I can see how it would be different for a priest.
---
Horde are just misunderstood
---
Me neither. The BSH is a defacto hunter wep so I rather go for that and let my rogue bros need the rends
---
Im just amazed they even noticed your lack of gratz when the whole guild spammed the chat.
---
&gt; lmao is this satire?
---
Is it? Watch the videos of the stream. You can specifically see him bringing multiple full raid groups into the same layer.
---
No, just prepare to wand and mp5
---
other people are annoying too, so it's like flies to shit.
---
What happens if you die on a pvp world?
---
Is it exactly the same as mob deaths? Is there any reward or incentive for opposing faction members to kill you (xp gold loot?)
---
https://discord.gg/WVfVfS Welcome to the pack!
---
That's pretty smart! Never knew that, will check that out later.
---
I have not. My Classic experience has been almost entirely holding a spot for my son in the Herod queue. Once it popped before he got home and I was able to run his mage through Westfall killing only a handful of mobs but getting his First Aid leveled up with cloth he had gathered. 
---
I need to buy a new computer before I can play Classic myself. Probably not until December. So I have extra time to think about stuff like this and I am concerned about the future of the game.
---
Yeah, but that is only for the arcanite rod. You have to account for the other rods, which probably adds all the rods to around 200g. 
---
Then you have the pattern costs (not sure if you added that in your calcs, but from trainer some costs like 2g). Arcanite Rod costs 2,5g from a vendor. You need another 2,5g pattern from UC / Stormwind etc. 
---
Some of these are camped and sold on AH for over 10g each. 
---
To make a more educated guess, I would add about 250g for the patterns / rods needed (Might be a bit lower tho).
---
While what you're describing can be frustrating, I'd like to present you a different point of view. The majority of questing in WoW Classic is actually grinding with a burst reward at the end. The low drop rates, big amount of enemies to kill and all that is just an excuse to have you grinding. 
---
So the solution is to never stop killing. If the mobs of a quest are not spawning fast enough, kill some other mobs nearby. You won't be losing any time and eventually the other mobs will be free. Unless you really want the reward, learn how to move on.
---
It depends.  If they ever did that but balanced things for classic mechanics id be down with that.  If it was just a straight progression like what happened in retail, I'd quit.
---
Yeah anyone have go thinks ravager is better for soloing than WW axe is delusional
---
Just wait until you are killed by the other faction enough times. You only need more time :) I'm already at a "stage" where I help fellow ally/allies even when I know we are outleveled/outnumbered. I just can't help it but instantly think "how dare those cowards attack".
---
But there are of course and funny moments on the other side of the spectrum:
---
The other day I was in a big Tarren Mill / Southshore battle. I was low on HP and moved sideway of my raid team to eat/drink when suddenly a low level troll rogue appeared infront of me making campfire. So we both camped together with this big PVP battle going next to us, with players passing by and not interfering. We finished the meal, waved each other and got back to our guys.
---
Alot of people are fondof discussing whatif scenarios, but blizzard has not said anything about the future plans. Most of the C+ stuff comes from how Runescape handled it.
---
Rogue would be my suggestion too. First time I rolled a rogue back in Vanilla I was shocked by how different it felt. Decent amount of flavour and as said above, stealth can be great fun and very useful. Also stunlocking people in PvP is cool.
---
I do not think there are any addons that could display how much gold you will need to hit your mount level in terms of a calculation. The only advise to be given is what has been repeatedly stated about making gold for your 40 mount, which can be found with simple youtube searches. My own tip would be if you can hit 225 herbalism at 35, you can start getting blindweed, which is a very expensive herb to sell on the ah
---
Might have to tell my buddies about this. We've got a decent KOS list but haven't found a way yet to make one in game.
---
Just to clarify, Honorable is within 10 levels of yourself.
---
People have been looking on Westfall for the past couple of days and, I assume, have completed it without issue since they never stated otherwise. Submit a report or wait until next server reset.
---
Here's the thing with these situations.  One of two things is at play here.
---
First of all, your GM is a sociopath and you are lucky to be rid of that whole group of players.
---
Secondly, there is more to this story than what was contained in your post and you may have deserved this.
---
Neither of these situations warrant sympathy, and given that your reaction to this situation was to make a whine post on Reddit I certainly lean to the second option.  Grow up find a new guild, tons of them in trade chat.
---
Hope you didn't find out the hard way

As a human, do you need to grind rep to use the NE mounts?

He wasn't prot spec, no warrior levels prot spec. Just because someone is playing a role doesn't mean that's their spec.

Level engineering and start utilising bombs in pvp as stuns. Pretty hard to get them to land but will make you even more devastating
---
I use the InFlight version from the curse website and it remembers all flights I have taken and its time. Remember that for example something like does not display until you take both routes:
---
Stormwind -&gt; Westfall ( i.e. 1:34 )
---
Westfall -&gt; Stormwind will only display a time once you've taken that route once, it will not display the 1:34 from the travel *to* Westfall since the routes can, and most of the time will, be slightly different.
---
Perhaps that's what you see. I can confirm it works with the latest version of WoW Classic and the latest of InFlight.
---
Perhaps it might clash with another one of your addons too?

Well if I enable a cast sequence macro and then just bind my mouse every 1 second press 1 and assign the macro it just fires through them

how can you suck as a shaman? Sham only sucks against mages and maybe hunters.

Like if you cry everytime
---
Yes it‚Äôs normal for some quest items to ‚Äútime out‚Äù and you‚Äôd have to redo or sometimes abandon/re-accept the quest to do once more.
---
In situations where you need to use a quest item and you are unsure if it will disappear upon failing the quest/dying I recommend you clear the area you are working in to reduce the chance of a mob killing you or interrupting the looting quest item cast as most of them have a 5 sec cast/channel time to loot or complete.

From 1-60 druid can tank anything fine just like a warrior, it's only in raiding (40 man groups) that they fall behind warriors. So unless you are specifically looking to tank raids, you will be fine and even then you could make it work.
---
It is bis because of the attack power bonus, but getting them is kind of a dick move to do to all the other warriors and rogues who will benefit a vast amount more than you would. Your better off with bone slicing hatchets.

Do you know by any chance how to set up to show aggro in elvui raidframes? I remember in retail there was an option for this that added a red glow around the players that have aggro but can't find it now

Horde say the same thing and it gets upvoted.
---
It apparently also resets when you zone, which can lead to some embarresing momements when you're being racist toward the 3 horde gnome races in Taurahe on the zep to undercity.

I mean you can just demo shout all the mobs before BW and take zero damage since they get feared so it's not that hard.

I played ele shaman and I DEFINITELY did not have that many choices as well as that many choices of gear so idont know what you are talking about... I played in mostly 1 spec which was far superior to anything else at m+ and while not the best i was doing usually around +15 so definitely not lfr casual.
---
Disgusting Oozling is a non-combat pet you can farm from oozes in various high level zones (from the Oozing Bag), usually EPL is farmed for it. Having it out applies a debuff on you of -20 defense and resistance. When people got to C'thun, some people found out you could make a macro to spam summon and unsummon the pet to apply a ton of debuffs on yourself, as each summon would apply a new debuff that lasted for like 1-2s after you unsummoned it.
---
People used this to force debuffs off themselves, specifically C'thun stomach acid, allowing players to stay in his stomach permanently and making the fight much easier.
---
you should just post the guild name, reputation matters in classic. If they behave like shit, its their fault and people need to know who they should avoid.
---
The Sacred Mallet drops from Qiaga the Keeper on top of the Altar of Zul in Hinterlands. You then bring it to the top of Jintha'alor and use it near the altar to turn into the Mallet of Zul'Farrak so you can summon Gahz'rilla in Zul'Farrak.

To be honest i mostly tank with two hand weapon as arms warrior and eventually put the shield for bosses. Like charge or pull -&gt; demo shout into thunderclap, whirlwind and cleave feels like much more reliable source of aoe threat than putting on shield and spamming sunder armor and revenge.

there are addons that let you know how much they vend for and how much the potential value of disenchanting it is. generally dont bother disenchanting stuff until your in your 40s and 50s. it also depends on what gear your get. weapons you will prob want to vend cloth braces for example at level 50 you will want to disenchant

Then he had the right to be pissed, but not to quit. As a low level warrior he needed that axe cause leveling as warrior is rough, and you, as a enh shaman could‚Äôve easily spare it. My opinion

Never understood why some people try to argue in a case like that. You're just feeding into their power trip. Just tell them off and move on. You're a tank, every guild will take you
---
If you are a Tank you are going to have no trouble finding another guild XD
---
&gt; Imagine a nice fluffy world where that sick drop you were looking for comes along and no one snipes it with a high roll so they can buy their flashy epic mount sooner.

Yes, precisely my point. It's wishful thinking and as long as you cannot trust people to do this, the proper answer for the foreseeable future is to need all boes.

If you google dun Morough to wetlands skip there‚Äôs a shortcut where you can climb the cliffs nw of ironforge and drop down into wetlands. It will probably save you mins of running.

---
The orc stun resist is over rated, I'm playing an orc and I have yet to resist any stuns at all.

If you are playing as enhancement then the additional axe skill is significant though

I bet you use enemy castbar addon as well as addons to track enemy buffs though.

 Check [http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/flamelash](http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/flamelash)  for data with active + inactive accounts. Quick caluclation of active  players shows a 46/54 ratio as of this time, which seems reasonable. Do  you experience a ratio such as this or the one that is shown in your  figure?
---
The other way around:  There are servers that, based on faction accounts, seem to have decent  a/h ratios but the activity data shows different. Check [http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/stalagg](http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/stalagg) for a 1:2 active ratio for example.
---
I believe your server is fine
---
But why ask the kicked person and provide a reason? Seems to me like the GM really wanted to provide this reason.
---
Castles, caves and magic trees or huts, dilapidated castles and sewers ?   
---
Humanoids or roided aliens, cows and humanoid corpses ?  
---
Good guys or bad guys ?  
---
Blue or red ?  
---
Faster bg queues or world pvp dominance by numbers?
---
I don‚Äôt remember what it was but some flight has like air line 10 min walk without mount but the flight sends around the entire continent (literally)like it goes counter clockwise around the coast until it reaches the point

Are you just trying to piss people off with this?
---
It's broken as hell, 35% resist chance is crazy.
---
Fake news! According to the latest research nature magic is perfectly safe. And 60 year old druids are the only ones that can safely shift roles at a whim without the need of qualified training expert overwatching the process.
---
Is this addon similiar to AAP?
---
I originally just wanted a KOS list. This was my hope when searching for a KOS list: i wanted an addon that allows me to add players to a list and when i see those players they would have somekind of an icon next to their name letting me know he is on my KOS list. 
---
But the stealth thing is not the most reliable, rogues stealth all the time fighting mobs, you cant trust it 100% or even 50%. Also as a rogue, they can stealth from further away and then move closer to you, that way the player cannot get notified.
---
But i definitely see your point.
---
Well game-wise horde are stronger than alliance too, regardless of the player pop. Better transportation, ease of access to dungeons, and shamans are stronger at both PvE and PvP than paladins. Pallies are basically just a healer/utility class in vanilla. Although ret can be strong for PvP.
---
It'd be more about saving mana, would have been amazing for greater heal into renew with both for free. I've tried it out since and it doesn't work though
---
it is nerfed,

Is the questline hard? Saw some guide that involved a group and you need a lot of potions and min maxing to even make it.
---
Being nice these days is so rare that when it happens it now feels uncomfortable
---
It will work, but you'd be at a disadvantage compared to the powerful orc passive racial.
---
Taurens can stun and heal. This is pretty important since shamans dont have any stuns.
---
I play a troll shammy and am planning to go eventually elemental/resto pvp so I wanted the troll racial as its one of the only abilities in the game to increase cast speed. 
---
It really depends on your play style but yeah in most circumstances you'd be a disadvantage, but its not a make or break.
---
Like I said before, this was only really an issue when the 8 debuff limit was around.
---
Many boss abilities at the time were coded as auras either due to coding restrictions or as a workaround and were not made visible to players.  Some of them were also coded as debuffs, again to save space or something.  The side effect of this is that when the boss gained that aura, it would push a player-created debuff off.
---
Yes, it's absolute bullshit, OP describes an armoured warhorse, so it's the 100% mount, meaning the warrior is level 60 and has farmed 1100 gold, thus is probably also geared from running dungeons. level 18 Tauren is insta one-shot, the priest too.
---
Auctionator does
---
If they had the original creators of WoW, absolutely.
---
I don't trust the current team with Classic+. I don't trust them to do it right at all. Give us TBC and Wrath.
---
Probably correct. Given how greedy actiblizz is for Money. And how Classic hopefully is/will be a success.
---
They will msot likely just think to themselfs that re-releasing old expac's works fine and to TBC and then WOTLK. Until they realize nobody wants to Play that shit.
---
That is when they might think about doing a new one. But by then it'll be too late
---
remember that this game is only 3 week old, so folk dont have lots and lots of gold to splash out on lower level epics for alts.
---
I got the Dazzling sword epic in STV, and same as you looked to see what it was selling for on the AH. 1 other, at 18g. I'm not selling it for that, and as I am already level 43, and have my mount, I'm sticking it in the bank for several months, and will look to sell it once Twinking is a thing, and folk are spending silly money on low level items. 
---
Nightblade is a brilliant Twink item for the level 39 twinks, so this will sell for a lot of gold in 2-3 months time. Stick it in the bank on an alt and forget about it for now.
---
Still cheaper than a Warhammer addiction
---
On paper yes, in practice no, I'm nearly lvl40 on my orc rogue and not once have I resisted a stun from another player.

As a mage who farmed the last 16 hours ZF in AOE groups. (1,,5h - 2h per lvl)
---
1) Set up a chain for frostnova with other mages
---
2) Stay on max range to melee mobs while spamming arcane explosion / coc
---
3) Use your frostshield 30 sec before the pull so you have it ready midfight (dont use it while the pull happens, using frostshield while the tank bodypulls mobs will make them attack you)
---
4) dont hesitate to use your frost block if you drop to 1/3 of your health and still have mob aggro
---
5) if mobs dont die fast enough and spread, designate on mage to blizzard (with imp blizz). If damage is good enough, everyone keep bombing with ae, coc and flamestrike
---
6) start aoe'ing when all mobs are around the corner and fully grouped
---
7) tell the tank to kill the totems and not focus the mobs aber the aoe starts
---
8) always have a mana stone ready for emergencies
---
I rly need to play some rppvp. This sounds like a lot of fun. Oh I forgot. There are no rppvp servers on german servers
---
Good share :)
---
What is this bug you speak of?
---
I use this to reset myself to graveyard if I run the wrong way
---
Instead of Prince Malchezaar, the final boss of Karazhan should be Teron Gorefiend and maybe have the raid as a whole deal more with Black Riders of Deadwind Pass, the Worgen, and Scythe of Elune. That's kind of what was originally suggested to be the story according to the Horde Player's Guide.
---
A scourged Quel'thalas (basically retail ghostlands) and a reintroduction of Zul'Aman (tier 1.5 equivalent) and Silvermoon/Sunwell (tier 3 equivalent) raids would also be neat (note: Sunwell was inside Silvermoon in WCIII).
---
It's like a normal mob death except you don't lose durability on gear.
---
The reward from opposite faction players is honor which in turn over time ranks you up to reward gear. Right now the honor system is not in the game though, so people just pvp for fun, to secure mobs or resources(if enemy dead they can't take it !) or just to piss off the opposite faction. We're at war after all !
---
A good warrior has many tools in his arsenal.
---
This makes me so glad I was ahead of the aoe mages on my server. 
---
I can't even think about how shit it would be to show up to that zone with actual quests only for 2+ mages to be stealing EVERYTHING
---
&gt; Wrong, Peacemaker is objectively better
---
No it isn't. BUT Peacemaker will provide 1000% less drama which makes it better if you hate drama. (I loathe drama)
---
I'm trying to decide between priest and shaman. I've already started leveling the priest, but I'm not sure anymore. I want to roll a class that can heal or tank so that I'll always find groups semi-instantly, and I'm also fine with healing on raids. But in addition to that I'd also like to be a valuable addition to battleground pvp. There I'm fine with both healing and damage dealing, as long as there is some depth. Shadow PvP sounds a little linear to me, and shamans have the cool 30/0/21 (or I flipped the order) spec that both blasts people and heals. Plus building up a PvP gearset in raids might be easier because caster mail has no competition. But then again, spamming chain heal in raids feels like it has less depth than maintank healing. Do the totems add much flavor?
---
I'd like the weakauras aswell please
---
I am sure MANY guilds will happily take you in.
---
Ps. I‚Äôm not sure if this allowed but can we know the server/guild? I‚Äôd like to avoid it like the plague lol
---
Hmmm... Never noticed tbh. I never had Problems with quest items not dropping either though.
---
And I usually don't Play in Groups a lot. Every 15th quest or so
---
You‚Äôve done 1k needles but have you been down to shimmering flats. There‚Äôs a good set of quests there that just involve doing a few loops around the track and killing everything. Great gold if you‚Äôve got skinning too.
---
For real though I play mograinne and stormwind/if is not even close to this. Mograinne is a full server!
---
Its paywalled now.
---
From my experience loot council just kills your motivation to raid. I've been in multiple guilds like yours and after busting my balls to see a bunch of bis gear go to a random timmy in quest greens pulling lower dps than a tank is just killing the fun of raiding. Even more when the afromentioned timmy still bottom dps's after being decked out by loot council. I'd suggest going to a guild that uses some version of dkp since there you are actually rewarded for your effort.
---
Is 55 with the human racial?
---
savage druid moonkin lookalike monsters, the "pvp" quest which was about killing some elves next to a pond, gathering something from the trolls, all of these were pain in the ass and took my hours.
---
i don't even wanna talk about STV lol.
---
once i realize i can never get them completed, i did other stuff in the game, then i come back just to realize i will fail to do them again so i did different quests and stuff. at third day i could complete all of them because each day i could play like 4 hours something after i come back home.
---
People like to assume the negative idea that horde PvP players want easy racial benefits, rather than the positive idea that players who prefer horde are more willing to adapt and overcome the unique challenges of a server in which unexpected combat is a given.
---
The irony
---
I think your missing the concept of this post. This is a post describing how much it would cost if you were to buy all your mats.
---
I mean I went afk with my friend on /follow having no idea the jump was coming up and my charachter still made it.
---
let them casuals their fun. They will see when horde beats their ass again.
---
I have absolutely the same opinion, every expansion slowly made the game worse, it outweighed the improvements and because we already know what to expect from the old expansions, I would quit WoW the same day TBC gets released.
---
Cant believe i read the whole thing
---
Shadow priests sometimes get unfair comments like this and I want to correct you, so misinformation doesn‚Äôt get spread around.
---
You can spend 8 talent points total on threat reduction and doing this absolutely allows you to use Mind Blast in group content. In Vanilla tanks need a little time to build threat so usually you want to open with SwP and 1 or 2 Mind Flays before Mind Blast.
---
When you know you‚Äôll only be dungeoning or raiding with non-shit and/or well geared tanks you can even shave some points off the threat reduction talent in the disc tree, depending on what your threat meter says.
---
Ironfoe is technically pre bis for warriors.
---
A great read. I could almost taste the atmosphere.
---
So you basically gave no reason for your argument other than "I dont like it so make the game how I want."
---
yeah but your a human male, that's ugly.
---
Then read it again, it‚Äôs free!
---
You couldn't have picked a worse one because the maraudon gold farm is all about killing 2 bosses and VENDORING the blues. You're not getting any big ticket items because you're not farming mass amounts of mobs with 0.01% world drop chances like mages are. You port in, kill goblin + princess, reset, repeat. If you are fast enough to do 5 instances per hour (instance lockout) then it's about 40g per hour.
---
But that's it. It doesn't increase, it doesn't decrease. It's just a very consistent mediocre gold farm.
---
Lol some scrub on the internet talking shit OFC
---
What server you on?
---
Im on horde side on ES and we're active. Theres tons of ally at 40+ range. On lower lvlz tho.. I Kinda doubt youll find ton of ppl. This might change with the free transfers opening up again to ES
---
Congrats on very rarely having stuns cast on you or being an incredible statistical anomaly.  We know the chance to resist stun no need for shitty anecdotes.
---
Exactly my thoughts lol
---
Now that.......Was an awesome story. Man, this just really sums up why Classic is so great. And seeing stuff like this just makes me love it even more.   
---
People helping eachother, having fun, and a sense of community. And the epic stories we can tell around the campfire that is Reddit,  after the day of such.
---
They aren't prebis. They become prebis in phase 3 with the release of the +15 agility on weapons buff. But before that they are not better than the polearm from strat(which is way easier to get). 
---
Some bad hunters still go for them for whatever reason, probably because private servers usually had the +15 agility buff out earlier than classic will.
---
The only way that is ever ok is if you declare it in obvious fashion *before* the run starts. The others can then decide whether they want to tag along or not.
---
read that comment again, then look through his post history, and enjoy some irony.
---
Same but another hour later (I'm from an alternate universe where you work in your sleep and so yeah just fell asleep and typing this from work) have a nice work day :)
---
Sounds like me 15 years ago.
---
Off topic but how do you get the class colors in chat? Is it an add-on? I couldn‚Äôt find an in-game option for it.
---
Brah I'm 24. Just chilling with my mates
---
Can you even get benediction yet? I thought Kazzak didn't spawn before phase 2?
---
I can kind of understand that with the bigger ones. but are you talking about them or like 100- viewer ones? because that seems a little rude if it‚Äôs the little ones.
---
And often these battles are spurred on by ganking. Lowbies report in chat ganking. A guild then turns up to protect them, which brings more of the other faction.
---
Congrats OP, great achievement :)
---
He patrols the whole of Desolace and Feralas afaik
---
Yea but it isn't much. Those level 1 today will be absolutely fine finding Deadmines/Naxx groups.
---
This, while i do like help. Doing stuff below your level is a big plus. Even elites can be solod with proper use of your abilities (and retaliation).
---
In general the amount of times i see people doing stuff like 3 levels the reccomended level is staggering, like up to lvl 50 there are generally multiple zones to do quests in for every level bracket. Just because it says 20-30 does not mean it stops giving exp at 30
---
As others have said, the economy hasn't kicked off yet. The game is simply too new, people don't have liquid cash to throw around. Wait until P3 when BGs are released. Once twinking becomes a thing people will pay out the nose for seemingly pointless items.
---
Play a bit with the settings. Im not sure why but for me when i activate anti aliasing it looks foggy.
---
True.. But he's getting punished for being a more invested player isnt he. So it cannot be just black and white whats the best for the guild. If this happens whats to stop him from just slacking like the others and rake in gear? He actually deserves it more than anyone. Imo lc is a popularity contest for the most part and dkp is far superior for a semi-hardcore guild
---
A lot more try hards now then before
---
Then what is the hard bit?
---
This exactly.
---
Look what the current development team has done to the game.
---
If they are on the project then classic will be killed if they developed it.
---
Least with Tbc and wrath, yes we know what's what etc but it was good. Doing daily in wrath were best days of my life. Grinding for the wooly mammoth, sitting for hours in one spot trying to get the time lost drake.
---
I just don‚Äôt loot it, rather have it despawn than someone else get it.
---
Also that isnt a GM.
---
Good old 7-11 39
---
I don‚Äôt think the buff mods work, and no I don‚Äôt use cast bar mods.
---
The poleram from stratUD is prebis right now.
---
All I‚Äôd say is Mind Control.
---
Overall population increasing or decreasing?
---
Which isn't paying attention at all to the point i was making.
---
Both your statement and mine can be equally true.
---
Horde having a higher population isn't a decision that anyoneone made while rolling because they were all fresh servers with long queues.
---
Everyone who rolls on a PVP server clicks knowing that at any time during questing after a very short period they can enter combat.
---
There's a reason horde often outnumber alliance on pvp servers and the common basic assumption is "oh they wanted the racials, they knew they'd win in pvp" when the question never is "perhaps people who *prefer* the horde simply prefer the pvp setting independently of their racial choice.
---
Or put another, simpler way most people I know who play create an cross-faction alt most of the time, which means picking a totally different server.
---
When horde chooses an alliance alt, anecdotally *it's still always on a PVP server*.
---
If people were just rolling PVP for horde racials our alts wouldn't be on PVP servers as alliance.
---
Some people just enjoy the fight, which I understand is very difficult for some to relate to because the difference between playstyles is vast.
---
You are wrong and you would know this if you actually played in Vanilla. Needing for the purpose of selling is the definition of ninja looting.
---
If you need, you are expected to equip it on the spot, to prove you are not just stealing the item.
---
Like I said, every single time this was polled, people with your viewpoint were absolutely slammed in the results, the majority of people agree with me and disagree with you. End of discussion.
---
Why blizzard will 100% do tbc and not classic+:  selling content you've already made that was popular is better than using resources to create new content of unknown popularity.
---
There's no way we get anything other than tbc.
---
Dear tanks and hunters... use traps
---
I see they updated the client today, maybe it's fixed?
---
It appears that it's not affecting everybody, based on the threads from yesterday.
---
Guess I'll have to test it myself.
---
it's literally just you.
---
Bone slicing are worse, but yes easier. The current prebis weapon is the poleram from stratUD which is easy as hell to get.
---
no more than 2 netting mobs in any pack, you have greater range than they do, learn to sheep, learn to blink, learn to escape artist, learn to iceblock..... Learn to mage
---
MY LOVE
---
Also, they're forgotten about. It's stupid that in retail you're fighting Azshara, and we hardly even see Tyrande and Malfurion, who should be the first over the top when it comes to charging her citadel.
---
She's mostly to blame for everything that happened to their people.
---
Ok tourist.
---
Yeah taking an extra 40 mins just to find 3 mages. Lol.. then everyone wanna play hotshot and pull more than they can handle and just wipe.  While normal groups already cleared it twice in the time.
---
What a bunch of pussies, re roll the opposite faction and camp then it's the only appropriate response
---
... like how you omit the fact that he crashed the server several times... but hey, do whatever you like even if it crashes the server for everyone!
---
Fuck off
---
Well chain lightning really does insane amount of dmg but ive just received a new rank so that might add to it.
---
Yes, as i said they both give the same reward - Succ and 12 souls bag, but they quests themselves are different as they require you to kill different people for their hearts.
---
&gt;Imagine getting kicked partway through a raid progression.
---
Imagine getting kicked when you saved 321 DKP to save up for Lok'amir and the second highest caster has 253 DKP and you're reliably clearing BWL every Thursday. :(
---
I got one on stream as well, watching wow videos when in queue
---
Big yikes
---
I cried
---
You still salty about Grobbulus?
---
Try undervolting
---
At least you found out they are dicks now and not when your first bit of loot drops in mc and they give it to someone else because you didn‚Äôt say thanks when the priest gave you Stam buff.
---
omfg its nuts
---
Hi, I tank with a 2hander in arms spec. AMA.
---
Suuuure... and the dozens of initiates in asylums for having half their brain stuck as an animal brain or have been traumatized into dyfunctionality by not being warned about mating season in the middle of said species' territory and have been mangled by wildlife for having the "wrong form" are being sweeped under the rug.
---
Employing "natural selection" to test your pupils is not a humane way of education.
---
Playing a priest, my warrior doesn't like being called a "pet" :P
---
I bought greater magic essence at 15s a piece and made wands only. Got over 100 wands made like that and it leveled me to 135 no bracers necessary in like an hour.
---
Left of chat there is a button with a comic speech bubble on it. There is a bunch of cool stuff, emotes and languages are one of em. Keep in mind that when you write in a language that other races don't know, they will see gibberish
---
Damn some amount of grind then. Least it's all worth it. Do u still have enchanting or did you swap it out.
---
Fine I'll bite, I've been playing orcs for years both on retail and various incarnations of private servers, and yes sure there might be a mildly increased chance to resist a stun but it is not the game changer everyone thinks it is. Certainly not enough of a difference to be stressing about race selection.
---
Some decent tips there. Just another addition on spirit tap/mind flay: the most important part is timing. Try to stop using mana in time so spirit tap kicks in when your natural regen kicks in. This way you can use a single MF early on already, helping a bit with incoming damage (since mobs are slowed down).
---
Also, healing the high level instances as a shadow priest is no issue. I've single healed UBRS as shadow priest in almost full T0, it's all a matter of how your group pulls and works the mobs down. On a random group you're probably fully stressed out. In a guild group on discord however it's all smooth and easy.
---
Agreed, it was my favorite Cata zone.
---
Than rather just leave it on classic, at least a few servers.
---
He gave a nice long response to you, your response was "it does"
---
How are you calling him out? Rofl
---
The war is over, the Alliance have won as soon as she comes ashore
---
Okay now do it with Spiderverse.
---
"That's all it is, Neo. Just a leap of faith."
---
I mean, technically...
---
Level 35, if you level very quickly, would be about a day /played.
---
24 hours of pay, unless you get paid minimum wage or close to it, would be much more than $200.
---
Not condoning this practice at all, just stating why *someone* may actually pull the trigger on this.
---
As a healer I just wanted to add that kiting is fine but that means control.
---
Once the mobs aren‚Äôt slowed you aren‚Äôt kiting, you‚Äôre running and that usually means wipe.
---
Head to tank or even better, stand there and eat it. I‚Äôll try and time and heal bomb to land just when the tank gets aggro back but if I don‚Äôt, plz see above!
---
farming mobs in starting courtyard, and about 30ish other mobs that can be accessed.  There to farm random drops and cloth coffer keys and DI residue, not the greatest money maker but its similar to open world farming in places like tyres hand.
---
From what I can tell the only factor is the players current rank.
---
I would say increasing, just my opinion though
---
Grobbulus is RPPvP and is one of, if not *the* most balanced servers in all of classic as per the wowhead census.
---
&gt; And they are the closest thing to a rogue counter that exists in classic.
---
Dwarf warriors though
---
is it at all feasible to do this as a moonkin?
---
Deal.
---
Well, on paper, Seal of Blood does about 7% more damage and scales with strength. Seal of Command scales with spellpower, and also gets a 10% increased damage buff with T4. However, wonky itemization make SoB the better choice. Seal of Vengeance scales with spellpower. It is great for long boss fights and for holy paladins.
---
Could be but I always loved the aesthetic of horde more.    
---
Also, Horde gets all the good flightpoints which makes me super salty that I'm always alliance because all my friends go there.
---
He already threw his shoes at the enemy
---
Why would anybody ever want to watch this ?
---
Depending on how much gold he has and the server it's on, it'll sell pretty easily.
---
A friend of mine just sold a 60 warrior for 650 USD about 3-4 days ago and he just started a new account to try again. If you check gold selling sites it costs at least 700+ USD on most of them just for a level 60 without any gold.
---
There was a meme about taking the name "thex" even blizzard put him in BFA a few weeks ago
---
Yea i saw it, pretty hillarious :D
---
Hello OP, I‚Äôm glad you are interesting in joining the Druid community.
---
Druids are good tankers in 5 men, and even in raids they are doing pretty great. Some encounters however are (almost) impossible, like Nefarian.
---
A very complete and precise guide can be found [here](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) 
---
It‚Äôs a very good reference in the Druid commodity and as another commenter was proposing, check Skarm YouTube video too.
---
Have a nice day
---
Easy /gquit.
---
There is no reason to run loot council in classic other than officers funnelling their friends loot.
---
If you read one of my previous comments I do say that this is an option to a cheaper way of doing it. 
---
The wand, if you want your money back you should sell on the AH which costs money and time. The guide that I follow for this is designed for a quick leveling now cheap leveling. 
---
That is for another post.
---
Mods: Please allow horde to downvote horde bashing posts. tyvm
---
You are at the start of the game you can just reroll.
---
Well sure, you joined a guild that is advertising in public channels. The real "close-knit group of friends" and "Vanilla veterans" are in smaller guilds with 20 or so people who are selective about who they invite.
---
If you are a solo player, or playing with just 1-2 friends and you're looking for a mature guild, you should be paying attention to the guild of people you group up with for pugs or dungeons. Often the way into these guilds is a good conversation and just asking.
---
These guilds do want to grow too, they just don't want to open the floodgates to the masses.
---
You can also sell the BIS ring to melee dps classes that drops from princess. Adds another 25g about every 4 runs.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
I can't think of a good reason to ever use cheap shot in a dungeon. If you're combat swords you shouldn't even be stealthed unless you need to sap or maybe if you want to Garrote a high armor target.
---
He could not attack lowbies in the barrens unless they provoke him first and get pvp flagged.  Barrens is horde homeland so every horde is blue to an invading alliance unless they attack first or  recently entered the barrens already pvp flagged (wears off after 5 minutes)
---
Paladins and Druids do really well because they have good AoE threat, especially with the Demo shout change.
---
Druids are just fine in Raids even, in fact I bet the first guild to down Four Horsemen runs at least 3.
---
Paladins unfortunately will have to resign themselves to healing or DPS. Not having a taunt just isn‚Äôt worth it and their AoE threat potential isn‚Äôt worth it one really any boss, and their damage mitigation is entirely based on being crit, which just isn‚Äôt going to cut it compared to Warriors.
---
You get a lot more than auto-attacking tbh. Seal of Crusader + judge to pull mobs will leave a juicy debuff on them, making them take a lot more holy damage. Follow up with Seal of Command / Judgement rotation, add Hammer of Justice to activate extra judgement damage from Judgement of Command on stunned enemies. Use Concecration for good cleave damage, and also good single target damage. Concecration uses a lot of mana though, but it's possible to downrank when needed. Finish mobs off with Hammer of Wrath, which looks awesome.
---
Yes but I get very bored if I run dungeons non stop.
---
You can farm the elites in south winterspring
---
Depends on the pet. Wolves would be growl-bite-howl-dash. Cats have even more, I'm not sure whether it's better to leave off bite or claw if you want to have prowl. 
---
Basically most pet families have enough abilities that you can't have cower without losing a damage or utility skill, and it's just not worth it. If you're controlling your pet properly it is never needed.
---
Also wands drop off pretty quickly. You end up not getting one level per enchant after about 130-140
---
I wish I got one of those
---
I got the Tankard o Terror, but those would have been nice as well
---
exactly this.   
---
I have a lvl 34 char and I have over 2 days on /played. thats a huge amount of time which I only could pull off because I was on sick leave.   
---
I personally would not buy and account but I understand that some people want the lvl 60 experience and they might be willing to pay for that. 200USD is absurde for lvl 30 in my opinion but for some people this isnt a lot of money.
---
I won't bite you're wrong and if you think you arent then you lack the prerequisite knowledge to see how powerful it is and no one has the time to teach you how to wow.
---
For most of the people here, that have played the expansions the reasons why classic is better are just too obvious, no need to explain.
---
but he is worm food now!
---
A lot of druids spec into gift of the wild.
---
20% intellect big brain
---
I don't think you get my point. It's an **MMO** game by BLIZZARD, do you seriously blame asmon for a layer crashing because there was 100-150 people extra in it than usual? Don't be fucking stupid.
---
**ACTUALLY** Demon/~~Dreanei~~ Eredar 
---
Dreanei are the Eredar that fled argus. Man'ari are the corrupted Eredar that became part of the Burning Legion. 
---
 ^^^^Damn ^^^^i'm ^^^^such ^^^^a ^^^^nerd
---
my record is 8. 8 flip in a row, without a normal jump. best minigame while leveling a night elf
---
Can't you type the polearm's name?
---
I have 0, stop showing off
---
You can definitely pick it up at 50. You can probably grab it at 48, but the mobs around the quest spot will kill you repeatedly.
---
lol @ anyone who thinks being a guild officer actually carries any weight. These are people who can't achieve anything IRL, and need this to feel like they have any value. 
---
Fuck 'em, you're better off now anyway.
---
South Park. Nice.
---
No u
---
Ill check itout later! But I disagree with something I saw immediately. It said orc and undead are about equal for warlock pvp. I call BS -  having 30% chance to resist stuns is OP, since warlock trinket does not break stun [it does break fear though, like wotf]. 
---
Orc racial is so op they had to nerf it many times
---
Haha
---
Is there any advantage having 315 herb?
---
Something like it's more likely to hit 3 herbs?
---
&gt; learn to escape artist...... learn to mage
---
racial talent, learn to mage? ok dude
---
Mario and Luigi is there as well. They are called Muigin and Larion. Never noticed that before I did the questline yesterday.
---
Well it's in UBRS anyways.
---
Like others are saying you are lucky you found out before level 60 and being invested in the guild. You still have time to find another and when you do it can only be better... hopefully, that is.
---
There is not way to be sure until after 45 days tho
---
tldr upvote
---
Clearly wrong. Your stats priority should be:
---
Herbalism skill &gt; agility &gt; arcane resist &gt; defense &gt; bow skill &gt; strength &gt; hp 5 &gt; minus stam &gt; strength &gt; stam &gt; intellect &gt; melee crit chance &gt; spell hit chance, and finally mining skill
---
Gj on the vid. Its helpful.
---
How awkward will it be if he wrecks your shit and tea bags your corpse while chanting "bug" though?
---
why would you even be mad about that? best thing that could happen to you before investing any more time into this crapguild
---
Gotta make sure them Turtles make it!
---
I see your logic here. Personally never had much use for dash except as a charge type move and cower just made feel better in general. I mean let the smelly tank and loudmouth burst DPS take the hits and leave my precious fluffers out of it amirite?
---
I do agree, actual real-time pet management does make cower moot in the grand scheme of things and I honestly forgot about the 4 ability limit.
---
No enchantment...?
---
Or reroll a druid and gank them whenever. Life is easy when you can powershift out of anything.
---
Two reasons:   
---
A) feeling powerful/important because you are the guild leader of a guild with many people   
---
B) planing on taking advantage of your guild members, like doing raids with "loot council".
---
People live outside of server time zone.
---
That Guy was a noob.
---
If your item does not drop you fake dc and go for a smoke break.
---
Yeah, they only pretend to be furries!
---
Ahhh I see. Thanks for the insight, I'll definitely do that once I'm in my 50s

It's a pain in the ass dealing with pretention pricks on a 24/7 ego trip about "owning" some virtual turf and being so rich from monopolizing it's resources in a videogame....
---
I work nights and I like to take a nap before I head out. Monday a tank (which is high demand on Westfall) advertised they were LFM for a full Mara run.
---
I left out of work Tuesday morning feeling dead but still had a bit of dopamine from completing the scepter quest and knowing I wouldn't have to run it again. Been awhile since I felt that type of accomplishment.

Do questruns. Much more chill for all. I play as a paladin who mostly heals. I can keep AOE spam fests up but its both hard to do due to lack of aoe heal and stressful. But a normal group that has a tank with shield  who can actually hold aggro without needing permanent healer attention is fine.
---
Op: Don't have food to eat with me for a quest that i know is hard
---
Me, internally: oof
---
Op: pot pre fight
---
Me, internally: bigger oof
---
Op: switch to 1h and shield
---
Me, internally: BIG OOF
---
But really though..
---
Just kill the little ones quickly and eat when big will is there. He won't initiate and even says that he will wait until you are ready. Charge in and activate your 30 min counter ability and kill him in 30 secs. 
---
Source: am a warrior who did it with lvl 30
---
As others have said, priest is fairly easy to level.  Some guides suggest 5 spirit tap, 2 holy and the rest in disp till you hit 36 and then speccing into shadow.
---
Currently am 39 can sit there and chain consecutive mobs two points higher than me for ages.  PW:S and fear give you some utility when you accidently pull a couple of mobs.
---
Where things do fall down a little is group kills, as you won't always get the killing blow so no spirit tap buff.  When in groups I let someone else pull, dot, one mindflay and then wand.
---
Also wand is important as alot of you damage is going to come from that, if you search around there are some good wand progression guides.
---
Finally, if you stack int gear it is possible to heal instances with no points in holy, just bring lots of drinks!
---
This dude is paying the sub fees because he‚Äôs got a good job.  But since it‚Äôs the same subscription for retail and classic, you could just pay for them with wow tokens.
---
the problem is, many of the things that made the game worse where improvment that were both asked and necessary.
---
Many people bitch about the LFG/LFD/LFR/whatever you call it, but when the playerbase is divided on 3 continents, 80 levels and with 85% of the players being level max, finding a group for a dungeon in azeroth/outland become an absolutely miserable experience.
---
Generally the people who come up with such responses like these also enjoy ganking lowbies themselves.
---
The question about playing on a PVP comes down to: how much do you enjoy getting griefed by high levels versus doing it yourself when you're the high level. There are specific mechanics in the game to prevent lowbies from fighting back (anything 3 levels higher or beyond gets a hefty additional dodge/resist bonus per level). It gets worse the later you join a server in its life cycle, as there's more people with higher level than you.
---
I played on a PVP server in vanilla and enjoyed the fights between about evenly matched opponents in the open world, but those were few and far in between. Most of the time it was just getting 3 shot by level 60s. But then, when I turned I finally got my revenge... for about an hour... I simply realized that I don't enjoy ganking lowbies, it's about as exciting a fighting mobs that are grey to you. That's why I'm on PVE now and glad about it.
---
&gt;You can order your abilities on the pet abilities bar and the first abilities (furthest left on the bar) most one will have priority if they're on autocast.
---
I did not know this, thank you so much!

---
10 hours a day killing 3 bosses over and over with no variation, jesus that's grim
---
Personally prefer classes and skills in BC over vanilla.
---
They give barely any rep if the quest is grey for you, needs to be at least green to be viable rep gain
---
Probably still the same amount percentagewise. Its just that now they have easier ways of sharing that info.
---
I used to always browse Elitistjerks forums for stuff like this. Now there are like a million more sources that are more easily accessible.
---
The portal is gone since cata
---
The boomerang comes with it no matter what, it‚Äôs a choice between the sword and offhand.
---
Except dragonstalker, that one just looks comical.
---
I see lots of horde players that simply have PvP on at all times.
---
You can find them here:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/spells](https://classic.wowhead.com/spells) 
---
Or better use an addon, there is plenty of them, like idTip or TiniyToolTip
---
Sometimes I even see PServer ads on YouTube so....
---
Deftones
---
Doesn‚Äôt sheep bring back HP? Sounds like a bad move after all that.
---
Also was on a server where 2/3th were Horde. Took a free server transfer to a low pop server and leveling has been going so fucking smooth since then. It's a dead server though so you have to live with that, but I hope by the time I reach 60 we get paid server transfers so I can go to a normal server. 
---
I say it's 100% worth it, the horde didn't let me play in my previous server. Now I can go and quest wherever I want.
---
Help people out by telling them Rexxar's location. Having to find him 3 times can be difficult if you are unlucky. I got lucky and found him twice easily and the other ome time someone inved me and held rexxar up for me. I gave him 5g for helping out i hope it helped him with his mount.
---
I was assuming after taxes but sure. Including his YouTube channel too
---
Its something most DPS and tanks struggle to understand. Yes healers can heal through almost all damage in a 5 man group. But not mana efficient or with reserves for the inevitable asspull or someone who thinks 1,5k mana are enough to handle the next group.
---
Yeah, also i dont see a problem for people asking for help if they are camped. Maybe the camper is higher level, maybe they are 2-3 people camping him, maybe its just 1 same level and more skilled. Why cant he ask for help in general, maybe someone is willing to help, why is that always taken as a complain, i dont get it. Some people are way to sensitive about others talking about pvp.
---
I thought I was on r/wowcirclejerk for a moment. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Tbh I find the constant ‚Äúgrats!‚Äù kind of annoying.

---
BOT: Do you know why I did that?

Only if you do the Hinterlands pre-quests for mallet :P
---
This is why I don't really like the whole "DING" trend. I feel like people are just fishing for praise, but it is what it is and that's ok.
---
Well I wrote a real reply, but it vanished.
---
Short version: You reminded me of things long forgotten and I totally understand and agree.
---
Also, real-time pet management because it cant be said enough. Lol
---
I‚Äôd say (and I should take my own advice) concentrate on your main. If your getting bored of the play style maybe change up your talents or focus on dungeons etc for a while, your coming up to SM soon and that‚Äôs a ton of fun.
---
I'm speechless. I can relate very much since I play a Tauren Warrior aswell. Considering I play tank and I feel it is my duty to protect my fellow players from any harm, even if it means giving my live for them, I feel this story very deeply.
---
I do it all the time because it works. It implies that you are opening a group and will take care of filling it. When I was trying to get into Gnomeregan I wrote "dd lfg gnome" for hours without any success but when started writing "ldm 2dd, tank, heal gnome" my group was full within 10 minutes. People are just lazy.
---
I almost grabbed a bag of popcorn. 
---
well told my friend, well told.
---
it's cheating for ppl with netbook without numlock, thus ban
---
idk
---
It's actually walking through the small pond.
---
Druids tanks are a lot of better than warriors in dungeons.
---
Not inviting someone when you have room so they can grab credit for a kill or loot an everyone-gets-a-copy quest item is just being spiteful. It sounds like you want others to have to wait on a spawn just because you did.
---
A server culture where everyone does this when they have a spot open is good for everyone. People complained about the Chinese on private servers, but the Chinese players have a great culture of doing this. They'll do this for you without hesitation.

That's a pretty long gouge, you threw talent points in that on leveling?
---
Perhaps mention your faction and server, we can‚Äôt help you if we don‚Äôt know what/where you play.
---
Just play, eventually you will be invited to one, or you will see advertising in barrens chat!

Chat class colors are supported natively, although prat is quite a nice addon still.

/console SET chatClassColorOverride ‚Äú0‚Äù

They did you a favour here, really.

Anyone petty enough to kick you from a guild over not congratulating someone on a level up in chat are not people you want to spend time around anyway.

Its great if you want to raid, but let‚Äôs be real, the actual game is the 500 hours you spend leveling, and it‚Äôs important to have an enjoyable time doing it.

is Barrens a location?
---
Literally everyone that tells people warriors are good also says they're super gear dependant, trash at leveling, and bad in solo pvp.  It's no one's fault but your own that you ignored those pieces.
---
not that I'm aware of
---
I just want to tank while leveling, maybe change to feral or balance at max level depending on whats more fun :)

Dps Shamans please don't use Earth Shock at the start of a pull, it's basically a taunt with it's high threat modifier.
---
Cheers mate, that will help a lot. Unfortunately I‚Äôm on Oceanic servers in Australia but I‚Äôm sure someone will be able to help now we know where you are. Good luck Lok‚Äôtar Ogar friend.
---
Imagine unironically liking the Horde. Savages
---
I've got a druid up to level 45 and have enjoyed it so far but I've found in world PvP I can't kill anything 1v1. I mean they can't kill me either, but it always ends up with one of us managing to run away (me having no slows, and also me being able to remove slows on myself)
---
I'm tempted to role a shadow priest or a rogue purely for the PvP side of things. I've played a rogue in vanilla so know them well, but how good are S priests in PvP? I honestly don't remember
---
Sweet what's your other one
---
Yeah, come guys to Dragonfang, I know it is EU so i wrote to EU readers.
---
No queu, easy questing only finding groups for elite quests in high lvl zones are a bit difficult when you are not playing "rush" hours.
---
Im pretty sure is 30% total
---
5% inherent that eberyone has +25% from the racial
---
Yea and once you get into higher levels you can kill 3-4 mobs when your aoe cd and evasion is up. Rogues have a much better toolkit for leveling
---
I was one of them! Your welcome :)
---
If your Horde, deadly blunderbuss is part of a quest requirement at splitertree post in ashenvale.  The issue here is not as many people go there compared to tauren mill.  But there is a small chance hunters/warriors might desire that weapon as well.
---
Thats very true man, thanks alot for the input. I played and got a druid to max in bfa but i just didnt know which spec to pick so ended up getting irritated at the spec. But in classic with the very (all rounder) way the classes and specs are going. They look very fun. Also not alot of people play them so they have stuff they can bring to the table that arent that common. Like how you said you can offtank :)
---
There's nothing wrong in any of the locations listed - also the title is "ocean fishing" and BB water is ocean water.  Read before you reply, fool.
---
yes, and u have the right lvl for collecting swiftthistle now, fadeleaf is 35+.
---
Yeah, got my set in about 4 hours with shit gear as a 60 rogue
---
I was in a guild called Hazard 14 years ago. EU Trollbane?
---
Ganking Redridge in raid gear on my epic mount, what else?
---
So you're taking time off from work to level? Perhaps it just isn't really viable to say that whatever you earn at your work is what you make at home. Because guess what, playing WoW is a hobby not a job.
---
How much do you make at home? Most likely you have negative income.
---
They /ignored before you could reply because they knew what they did was wrong.
---
Yes but it causes them to shit in the woods.
---
He's a good watch. Also one has to remember its an act, a well paid act. He trolls and fuels the haters that pay actual money to tell him how much they hate him. Its quite hillarious.
---
I'm very grateful for this professional. Plus extra thanks for the guide &lt;3
---
we (warrior tanks) definitely need some more aoe threat power, simplest solution would be to fking give us thunderclap in defstance and a little better threat tuning for existing abilities... I really questioned my class choice tanking BRD yesterday busting my wrist tabbing and sundering/revenging whatever mobs just to lose aggro to one wand shot from the warlock... crap tuning
---
Yes, mage is the deadbrained class. Everyone knows
---
Ftfy
---
honestly being that much of a dickhead should be bannable, noone wants people like that in the game besides other assholes like them
---
Thats what I felt while healing!! They are literally bears xD
---
This was the icing on the cake xD
---
I love it, but it gets repetetive after spending 5 hours in the same zone
---
wait till you get to BRD...
---
Why would you buy beer at target
---
is there a way to run MSBT on the twitch app? or are there similar addons?
---
or are there addons to change atleast the dmg font?
---
Thats what i thought
---
Very easy to wait for energy tick. The hope is that he actually blinks the cheap when you gouge. Some people are slow, some are fast
---
Ohh okay thank you mate, wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a blizzard thing to detect banned addons
---
Try wowclassic.live
---
The game can be better than the current state and thats why you ask for new content, what i would ask is some balance in classes, hunter for example is a full dps class and cant hold it against other only dps classes, warrior is a tank/dps and outdpses everything, shadow retri, shaman,balance etc should be viable, not on par with full dps cause they are hybrids but at least not being meme builds that are almost never taken into raids.
---
Those classes can be fixed with new tier sets or some talents adjustments and imo i would love that, classic isnt perfect, vanilla wasnt either, its just way way better and more simple than what retail has become, it doesnt mean that new content for classic or some balance would ruin the experience, i think it would be good
---
So whats called when those 2 roll on the bow/gun and mail(warr)?
---
You dodged a bullet
---
It's 20%more movement speed but actually a 50% increase. Which is pretty substantial.
---
I haven't found it in ElvUI (not saying it isn't there, but I just didn't find it). Prat 3.0 has got it... sort of kind of. Prat supports dragging to expand like Leatrix as well, but unlike Leatrix, the chat pane stays where you left it when you release. But the last thing I need is a toggle. To switch between the normal and expanded size of the chat pane. There is a one, but it's only inside Prat's settings menu, the "remember last position" button. So almost there, but not quite. I don't think any other chat addon that is available has yet got what I'm asking.
---
What every hunter needs to think about is how they would like warriors and rogues rolling against them on whatever the BIS ranged weapon is.
---
And then only play when they can play
---
For me the absolute game changers for the worst were the removal of the classic talent trees and the expansion that radically changed zones like barrens and ashenvale. Allowing paladins and shamans on both sides was sad too but not as bad as the other 2 things I mentioned
---
On certain realms the boats were nonexistant during launch day. The first realm I chose was Atiesh and the boats were working, then decided to roll on a PVP server and settled on Kurinnaxx with my buddies.
---
Sitting on the docks in Menethil, I thought to myself, I really need to pee but I KNOW as soon as I go this damn boat is going to show up! So I waited. And waited. Soon I was frantic. How long had it been? Am I going crazy? I don't remember the boats taking this long, surely if I go use the bathroom now I'll miss it. Twenty minutes passed. I started sweating. /1 Does anyone else know what's going on with these boats?
---
No answer.
---
Fuck it, what do the forums say? THE BOATS AREN'T WORKING?! I was simultaneously severely disappointed and greatly relieved that I could finally use the bathroom without worry of missing that damn boat.
---
what lvl r u?
---
Gratz! Go RattleGang! :)
---
Are you the developmentally delayed GM and his officer clique posting from the same account lmao
---
The orcs literally committed genocide against a peaceful race of Draenei
---
I‚Äôd love TBC but given the Classic touch, say 3yrs after Classic‚Äôs launch or something. 
---
Remove all the QoL things that actually ruined the fun (flying mounts, dailies, etc etc), get rid of the shared capital city and we can enjoy new questing/levelling, new metas, new talents and new dungeons/raids. 
---
Would be great if Outland zones/content were actually within Azeroth though to keep Azeroth alive, i.e do away with Outland and have the content within unfinished current zones or use Zepplins or boats to initially access maybe 1 or 2 zones, if they really wouldn‚Äôt fit in. 
---
They‚Äôve already said it would be much easier to do TBC than it was for classic as they have the framework now, so they can spend a bit of time sorting TBC out and not making the same mistakes given the success of Classic.
---
Obviously keep some servers as Classic only.
---
"It's a priest drop"
---
That sea giant be like 'hang in a minute, that last one doesn't belong!'
---
Druids benefit heavily from weapon upgrades just due to the sheer stats on some weapons. Getting the Manual Crowd Pummeler made for a massive power spike. Weapons that would normally be turned down by other classes are perfect for Druids.
---
They're a long-term investment that only gets good at 60. Very clunky to level.
---
staff of westfall will last you a long time,ignore the haters that say the stats suck,spirit is great for reducing downtime and it hits HARD
---
I was just adding my 2c, not need to get your panties in a twist about it.
---
All characters look goofy as shit in classic it‚Äôs part of the charm.
---
Tell me what it's like to be this lonely
---
Please enlighten me about the valuable prot talents a warrior gets that make him a a better low level dungeon tank. 
---
Not arguing about the druid part though. Their only disadvantage is that there aren't enough of them.
---
I love being berated by my dps as they are all single target classes refusing to focus a single mob while a wind fury totem is up. Do they expect me to get a Thunderfury proc with my level 38 sword or something?
---
20% stun resist on orcs is insane, it's completely broken.
---
Play the race you want to play, the last thing you want is to be disappointed.
---
I personally like orcs more than trolls, so I'm going orc shaman.
---
isn‚Äôt pick lock max just your level * 5? just like the level of the mob you can skin?
---
but is prot spec really making that much of a difference? I know there is some more +threat skills and stuff but I doubt it really helps the AOE threat game that much
---
Would make sense, 10% of 50 is 5 :P
---
Lol, The amount of power trippin gms and officers with pety attitudes are to prominent in classic. Your better of without them mate, their guild will die come phase 2 if They are this pathetic
---
It they don't do shit against it in Retail I doubt they will stop it in Classic :(.
---
It's hard. You "need" lot of buff and potions but you need to do the quest alone, without any intervention of others. Otherwise, the quest will fail.
---
Yeah misstyped, still nearly 1 in 3 stuns missing is bonkers.
---
I am leveling leather working and skinning . I can make my own armor it‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
Dude you are lucky to be out of this guild tbh lol
---
Enjoy BRD when you get there. At first I thought, hey level 60 warrior. Then I've seen mask of the unforgiven (leather) devilsaur set (leather) and a big two hand. Deathwish on cooldown and berserk stance half the time. Had to pump about 15k worth of health in him per pull not even counting the frequent heals the wl needed Hellfiring next to the pack. 
---
I strongly recommend getting a damage meter addon that allows you to filter for healing taken/damage received. You can quickly spot  if its you having an off day or if the group is shit.
---
I chose warrior because i love plate wearing melee... always have, in every fantasy game ive ever played
---
I loved this. The Horde prevails, thanks to your heroic deeds this day!
---
The issue isn't kill time, it's mob spawn time and drop rate. Grouping up doesn't change this time. They can potentially tag more mobs, if they split up, but then that defeats the point of grouping up...
---
It's hard for us to judge your autism. There's nothing objectively wrong with that character but in your head things seem to be different.
---
Not sure if that won't happen to you with every character you make. You should probably just stick with this one.
---
That's why I play alliance on an RP server.
---
People are so nice.
---
Only alliance can get the quest so buying the feed wouldn‚Äôt work
---
I think the strat is something like getting your blue to tank her for as long as possible then finish her while kiting.
---
You can also make her derp around some pillars and rock around the room after dotting her.
---
Thinking about classic + makes me think of Cataclysm.
---
I would be excited about ideas such as,
---
 Leaving the level cap at 60. 
---
Adding more low level dungeons, and adding more quests to existing ones.
---
 I would like more storyline quests (for example the burnt Inn in dust wallow marsh is unfinished)
---
I'm not opposed to the new races. Blood elves and their zones were amazing and they are what I miss most in Classic WoW.
---
Honestly more zeppelins, more boats, something that goes from the east coast of Hinterlands to the west coast of Desolace would be amazing. Plz Voljin. 
---
Theres so much I love about Classic WoW, but I think there's so much they could do add to it without changing it. There is so much empty space. Today, in /1 someone asked what is south of Silverpine? I said Gilneas, it's quarantined. If they do add worgen again, I hoe they consider doing it without the whole packaging of the Cataclysm expansion.
---
He‚Äôs kinda forced to though. You can‚Äôt change servers so that‚Äôs probably the only guild on the server with many high levels.
---
How many fucking bugs and exploits are in Classic?
---
Damn if it's hard I won't be able to do it probably :( don't got lot of gold for expensive potions either
---
Wrong wrong wrong. It's not the kill that matters it's getting the kill. There ain't even honor in the game. No combat sword rogue which is 85% of them is buying ambush levels and keeping a relevant dagger with the dagger skill up. And sit critting doesn't work in pvp you fuck up
---
Yeah, I'm trying to find the guy to train past 210.
---
Yeah no changes is gone mate there's loads. Unlucky.
---
Looks fine but if it bothers you a lot then a reroll isn't the end of the world. Think it through first though. 
---
 Personally I have rerolled a couple of characters because I didn't like the way they looked. Highest level would be a female tauren druid that I got to like level 20 back in TBC. Rerolled into a male tauren and played that character a ton. So was worth it for me.
---
/reload ?
---
hahaha
---
Yeah goes up by 5 at 45 you can open 225 making all boxes pickable.
---
That was exciting, brilliant and well written. Cheers to you!
---
They think they like it, but they don't.
---
They think they don't want to play BfA ever again but they do.
---
mvp
---
Thats the dumbest shit. I sometimes congratulate people when they say "ding" and sometimes don't. It's whatever. I'm dinging 60 tonight and its not like I'll make a big deal out of it. Find a sane guild!
---
oh go away! ... you make me sad! ... i still have 25 level to archive xD
---
Classic wow &gt; Retail wow
---
Someone just bought an account lol
---
Well thats what my warr friend is doing, while hes not online i level fishing + cooking and alt
---
If someone is camping your body then you just take rez sickness and go somewhere else or switch to an alt.
---
The main problem I have when I try enchanting is that to make any money, you have to standing a capital city and advertise. Which is a lot of opportunity cost when you could be grinding out somewhere else. With other professions you can just make stuff and sell it on the AH while you‚Äôre doing other things. I feel like if you take into account all the lost time standing around spamming the trade channel, it‚Äôs actually a lot less gold than if you invested a similar amount into tailoring or blacksmithing
---
Wotlk was wow‚Äôs peak btw
---
Wait wow I remember this quest. You have to chase his (really fast) dog right? Good memory.
---
a lot of the ffxiv NPCs that people would complain about not being able to click have a no touching zone, which is why its not a problem there.
---
the best I once saw was this:
---
"LFM 0/0 tank, 0/0 heal, 1/3 dps"
---
I'm not sure which dungeon he was looking for but it was barrens chat. Man, they had no chill with their roasts
---
And ruin what we have now rather than something we know works? I'll have to respectfully disagree
---
You and Me are like the only two people in TB...
---
I feel like it should be a bit bigger and have the orgrimmar zeppelin they added in wotlk.
---
As much as I want classic+, I agree with you both. The most logical and lowest risk plan would be to go with TBC. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there is a small team already working on it.
---
If you haven't yet, do sunken temple and try to get a few of the quests done.
---
Then at 52 start tanking BRD prison and arena farms, followed by lower BlackRock spire at 56.
---
I did this until 60 and worked great. Good luck!
---
I agree with almost everything...except that you should tank as Prot, and by doing it, actually be able to keep aggro, instead posting on reddit, complaining about something that will NEVER change :
---
Most people are idiots, and they will keep break CC&lt; they will keep attacking whatever else but Skull, they will start AoE the second you charge, their pets will still be on auto-taunt, etc, etc.
---
You want tanking with big dick numbers on the screen? Or you want to actually TANK ? Because if you do, do it as Prot, starting from lvl 45.
---
Imagine getting kicked with all of that but it happens because that 253 dkp wants the drop you both need and she's the GM's gf
---
But the chat is more annoying than him and they are watching him
---
Are you the guy that kicked OP?
---
ok honestly no one cares beside you what your character looks like. 
---
I'm more concerned that you're playing a female character in game, that to me just makes me think you get 0 pussy irl
---
The hell? Why would people do this instead of just finding a tank in LFG.
---
I stated this further up but I'll say it again.
---
Killing a grey player is exactly the same as killing a grey mob. They literally cannot and most of the time do not do anything.
---
So pvp to me means fighting people where there is an actual fight. Not just dotting something up uintil it dies.
---
Clearly PvP means different things to different people. To me its juking it out until the best player wins - to you and some others its, its just running around and 3 hitting players 'cos lol'.
---
assuming op has proof... you cant just assume he isnt lying
---
there is always a punishment, even when only 1 level apart,
---
the bigger the difference the less xp goes to the lower one
---
Getting this staff as a server first in vanilla is still one of my favorite gaming moments of all time and definitely my favorite moment in WoW. The alliance had gotten the Eye of Divinity to drop one week prior but their priest had not been able to complete the quest after repeatedly failing the event. The Eye of Divinity dropped and I got awarded it after what seemed like a long period of debate from the loot council (which I later found out was a contentious and heated decision). All I needed to win the race was to beat the event. Lord Kazzak was in the game at the time and my guild already had the Eye of Shadow banked.
---
Word spread through the grapevine that the Alliance priest was going to try in a few hours. Someone had seen her account post on another realm's forum asking for advice from people who had completed the quest and she stated she was going to try after their guild finished raiding that night. One of our guildmates jumped on an alliance spy alt and saw the priest and her guild were still in Molten Core. 
---
My guild acted quickly. We did not even finish our MC clear. The raid was abruptly halted while some lower level warlocks risked life and limb to get in position to summon me to the plaguelands. 
---
There was no time for pots or elixirs or anything since we typically popped those only for Ragnaros. I believe the only buffs I had on me were MOTW and Arcane Intellect. The warlocks summoned me and my four best friends for moral support. One of the warlocks transferred me the Eye of Shadow which had been given to them by the guild bank alt moments before in Orgrimmar. I had already heard none of my friends could help me though I would not have wanted them to anyway.
---
I had been waiting for a good class quest the entire time I was leveling and finally the time had arrived.
---
I started the event, took a deep breathe, and began. It was challenging but, for me, felt exhilarating. Using everything in my disposal to keep myself and the peasants alive. My friends up on the hill couldn't see the mobs but could see me in some sort of fight boxing shadows. Ventrillo was dead silent and anytime someone spoke someone else would shush them.
---
Then, my attempt came to an end. Ventrillo was dead silent. None of them knew I had aced it the very first try. I was silent because I was in shock. I never expected to win I just knew it was my only chance at beating our rival Alliance guild at something. We had always seemed one step behind. People started asking what had happened in voice chat. With hands shaking, I combined the Shard of Nordrassil with the Eye of Shadow. 
---
When I linked the staff in guild chat, Ventrillo erupted. A post was quickly made by one of my friends on the realm forum with screenshots announcing the server first. I ran back to the zeppelin with the light of Benediction trailing behind me and felt like a quarterback being carried off the field by the team after a game winning Hail Mary pass.
---
I went to the one place I knew it would be seen - the top of the Orgrimmar bank, astride my white raptor, friends in a mounted semicircle around me. Suddenly people began gathering on the bank, inspecting me and the new staff, seeing it in person. I felt like a celebrity. 
---
Some time later, still flushed with pride I got a whisper from a level 1 troll priest. I noticed the same little troll priest was standing beside me. "I just wanted to say congratulations. I'm glad someone cracked it. :) Could you make it change?" It was the Alliance priest. She had created a Horde alt just to come and walked it through Durotar to come see the staff and congratulate me. 
---
In retrospect, I think I was successful because I was deep into discipline spec, had tons of mana regen, and had done a lot of world PvP with a 40 man raid healing big groups of people in heated and unpredictable situations. I also had nothing to lose. No one expected it from me - not my naysayers on the loot council, most of my guildmates, or even myself. 
---
Anyway, I'll close this novel by saying congratulations. If you did this quest the way it's meant to be done, you know that it feels amazing. In the modern gaming world, I am sure there are harder things out there to do but at the time it gave me an incredible sense of pride to know I had done something others in my class could not do under pressure.
---
You reckon? That does make me feel happier to keep playing this character thank you :)
---
Honestly I think there aren't too many layers left compared to the first couple of weeks.  Wanted to layer today for a few fishing nodes and the 4-5 guildies who invited me were all in the same layer.  Had to have a non-guildie friend invite me to actually layer.  Or it could just be getting better at keeping guildies in the same layers.
---
Troll ftw!
---
Why not fullscreen
---
SK IS the best. My guild on Retail has used it for 13 years. Completely fair, nothing left to interpretation, no drama.
---
We should have them, but only as they are now. Meeting stones that can be used to donate a dungeon location and an area for people to meet up at.
---
It's the best game ever made.
---
To be honest you couldnt really raid with resilience gear though. Well i guess feral druid could but that was exception. 
---
I suppose weapon was worth picking up, i know i picked it up on my tankadin to have more spellpower but overall i prefered my blue tanking gear to the epicks from honor
---
Skin color: lots of people roll NE as another, leaner figure, human and so pick a skin color that is the closest to those available for humans. So not blue or purple. That character stands proud with a true NE skin color. Looks great.
---
Markings/ritual tattos: you picked the serpent. Quite a powerful and wise totem.
---
Hair color: you picked a color that doesnt translate into another color for markings. Which makes for an harmonious look IMHO. Silver hair translate into dark purple markings, purple hair -&gt; red markings. Could be a pain to match with a skin color.
---
Hairdo: short, combat efficient, less clipping with cloaks, spaldrons, crowns etc
---
Face: thats the face a I like the most. No silly lipstick, simple and clean.
---
Now as others said,
---
That's because they are. Shadow priests are stupidly strong and very simple. You kill every class except warlocks without much struggle, but it doesn't feel very good because you didn't outplay, you just picked a stronger class without many options.
---
Some of the most engaging PvP I've had has been elemental shaman (30/0/21), hunter and rogue.
---
Realistically, you could get to level 18 over a weekend so it‚Äôs early. If it bothers you that much right now it‚Äôs easy enough to rectify.
---
Look at the bright side, if you start a new character now, anything your old character has that is soulbound can be sold for cash and anything that isn‚Äôt (money, bags, resources etc) can be sent to your new character in the mail. Then your setback of starting over is slightly offset by having some free assets. 
---
It‚Äôs too early to hate your looks. A brighter future with a better looking you is only a few clicks a way ;^)
---
But it says 25% additional reduction. So 5% base with additional 25% so it's 6.25%, right? I highly doubt Blizz would give an actual 25% bonus compared to stats other classes got.
---
They have 2 separate accounts and thus 2 different characters. The player then plays one character with one mouse and keyboard while letting some programms do the multiboxing part in the background (1 keypress results in 2 abilities cast)
---
Take this with a grain of salt, because I have only read that they did it this way,  I am no multiboxxer. Maybe they have changed how to multibox aswell
---
I didn't know you could view items on your character like that, good to know!
---
Alright I will check out some gear, she does look ready to rumble, and it does make me feel a less down about my choices, thank you :)
---
Warriors are by far the strongest DPS in the game at 60. Even just in pre-raid gear.
---
&gt; With layering and limiting population, the world feels empty af.
---
I'm honestly surprised anyone would feel that way lol, I'm so, sooo happy if I can just find like 3 mob spawns that aren't already camped by 2 5-man groups from different factions. There are people fucking everywhere. I was told they'd stop playing. Goddamn at this point I just want my own layer or something lmao. Getting 15 kills for a quest takes 40 minutes because everyone is camping the same spawns.
---
Weak Auras
---
What‚Äôs the 39 for?
---
you strafe with mouse buttons? ew
---
üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
---
Weird.  Literally just did 150-300 fishing these last 3 days or so without any noticeable problems.  Roommate got to around 250 before he stopped but also didn't really see anything.
---
Wrong. You want more Prot Warriors, not delusional DPS Warriors that think that they don't "need" to be Prot to tank.
---
Sure you don't NEED to be Prot, but it makes a shit ton of difference if you are Prot.
---
Don't gnomes have +15 bonus?
---
This is the truth.
---
As a rogue who cheap shots constantly... I‚Äôm sure... I wil garrote them from now on.
---
I remember when i first started tanking with my paladin in TBC. Loved the feeling. Tanking is the closest thing to feeling like "THE hero" in a mmorpg because you really are facing, literally, the foes.
---
Yep, half the chat is about making fun of him.
---
I never found issue with resilience gear. Flying i agree on though.   
---
In regards to attunements i dont get how people can say there were no attunements in tbc lol xD good joke \^\^
---
Let him, if anyone is adding that amount of people to ignore literally every day he's probably one of them.
---
Thanks for the tips everyone. Looks like rockbitter is the way to go, with flame tongue in dungeons.
---
If you go HotW spec yes
---
For sure! She has that "Ronia, the robbers daughter" or "Arya Stark" vibe! It fits perfectly for the woodland mystique, fierce female druid!
---
Level your cooking too and make yourself some buff food. And please bring healing pots to dungeons.  Can save you in those oh crap moments
---
/r suspiciouslyspecific
---
i think thats what makes me dislike him more, knowing that he is just playing up to his viewers and looking like a moron doing it, just feels really cringy
---
How the hell do you get over 10k runecloth
---
I enjoy leveling quite a bit so wasn't that big a deal for me. I mean sure it sucks losing progress but it's not like I am not having fun playing even if repeating same quests.
---
I decided to go with your suggestion and stick with the lock üëç
---
It can't be prebis when the 15x2 agi enchants for dualwielding isn't in the game yet.
---
With current enchants, Peacemaker is going to be better.
---
Good luck. All the **good** devs that made this game so good have left. The current devs shouldn't even try, IMO.
---
And he is streaming sometimes
---
That's crazy lol I mean, it'd be nice because so many things engineers make require engineering to use, so they could share with each other.
---
I think it's worth it to explore all the professions. Especially the gathering professions.
---
i would call him a rat faced mother fucker but i feel that would be an insult to rats
---
Ever thought of offering to help?
---
Why do people takes this elitest approach to this.
---
You're argument is as dumb as 'if you dont want to hear people whine then turn off the chat'.
---
My point of the level 60 ganking greys is there is no PvP there....you may as well dot up grey mobs - its the same result. Player vs Player (but this player is tied up to a tree).  
---
What swell gameplay bud.
---
Of course it‚Äôs worth it. Real question is, is it realistic?
---
ESDF is the way to walk.... AQWRTGZCV for ez spells then also get a mmo mouse and you‚Äôre settled.
---
Didn't know people with downs kept track of each others raid progression.
---
But well done to him.
---
/w them on an alt to explain and also tell them to go fuck themselves. As for the guild, sorry for your loss but also it sounds like you dodged a bullet there tbh
---
It's been ages since I played, but wasn't there a neutral faction in winterspring that also had a feline mount (it might actually be alliance, but it's been ages since I've last been there)?
---
Go into the details tab, there may be some hidden processes still running.
---
Personally, I think that the ore amount needed to level engineering is seriously overrated. On my main I have 225 engineering, and noted that I do quest a lot (basically no dungeon grinding) I never had to go out of place to mine extra ore for leveling engi. 
---
From 225+ you'll need a LOT of mithrill and thorium, true, but for that you'll have to go out and farm them anyway. I don't see how having two toons instead of one for that will help.-
---
Imho, you are much better off with skinning+lw. The extra gear can help you, plus selling the better prieces can make some money.
---
Bc content with level60 limit would be much better. Still some work for ea but its better than making all level60 content + items obsolate at once. Many people couldnt see end of naxxramas because of bc... All level60 content became useless.
---
Just kill it off why you making Reddit posts about this wtf man
---
There is literally no work to do TBC, as it already exists in Legion (basically unchanged). While 1-60 was entirely reworked.
---
So... TBC is basicaly entirely available in the legion client right now
---
Well now I won't be as surprised when a level 18 can hold its own against someone with a epic mount at 60
---
Wow that one non-white shintone dwarves have is so dark it's almost Italian!
---
It might take a year until people understand that Classic is NOT BfA and spellcleave is just too reliant on player skill to be reliable with strangers.
---
Yes, it seems like that is the only purpose of doing this, to annoy your guildies with pointless spam.
---
WoW Classic, where their quest design process was to throw darts at the map of Azeroth and where it lands is where they place quest items
---
50.
---
49.
---
... 47 BABY
---
Shave your neck, fatty
---
I got a 24h mute for less than this
---
Well you're twice their level so
---
I used that boomerang for ranged pulls on my paladin. 14 years ago.
---
Im going to roll a warrior (my first one) and I have few questions
---
Will most likely start with either 14 5 32 (deep prot, just anger mangement, cruelty and rest into prot) or 17 3 31 (arms+prot impale variant). Is any of those viable if I intend to focus heavily on dungeons or should i anyway run deep arms or deep fury despite wanting to tank?
---
Whats the situation of warriors in the endgame, can I assume I will be able to tank or will I have to fit guild needs maybe going fury?
---
Last one. Im probably going to reroll on totaly new server so Im wondering which one is highly populated but without quees, EU btw.
---
Something to do with it becoming "required" for endgame raiding while being immersion breaking, not sure what the exact argument was.
---
shoots a good load of bait ;)
---
instructions unclear asspulled another patrol
---
How do you know TBC works?
---
imagine putting 50,000 people or however many there are on Outlands, they will have to keep layering indefinitely.
---
WoW, I bet you're a fucking nazi too.
---
At 46 you can get the essentials to a [Hemo spec] (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300104--500243100230101). Leading towards something like [21-3-27] (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105041-3-500243100332121), Cold Blood-Hemo is one of the most versatile and easy to gear for PvP specs you'll find. I personally played my rogue on one of the p-servs as this spec from like level 44, dropping some of the points in Lethality.
---
Obviously this won't grind as well or as fast as combat, but it's still very reliable for leveling.
---
Because of money, hence the need to prioritize fixes.
---
My guess is that unfortunately Blizzard will do this raid buff fix first because of the revenue these streamers generate for them, versus fixing more important bugs that affect vastly more players.
---
Can alliance actually raid him?
---
The unspoken rule of vanilla wow is that you finish when everyone in the group is finished. Nuff said
---
You can't remove flying from TBC as the continent itself is designed around it, plenty of farming spots or even dungeons are dependant on flying.
---
One keypress is one action in 40 games*
---
ORE WA OCHINCHIN GA DAISUKI NANDAYO
---
Thanks mate!
---
The real question is why do you want to make it harder for people to interact with you.
---
If you don't mind the problems it will create, do it. Otherwise use an alternate normal character. Fx o instead of √∏ etc
---
It is super annoying.
---
I sometimes send out wands and bags to low level characters and i avoid any with alt key letters in their name because i dont want to spend time guessing them.
---
It is also annoying when you have to get someone else to invite.
---
When layers are removed your server will have a nice pop. full pop servers will be back to absurd queue times.
---
AWF WITH YE
---
Yes but that is not a perma ban, that is a temporary ban. You said perma, hence, forever. If they ban people for 3-6-18, that's a temporary one, not a permanent one. Hence, literally no difference.
---
&gt;There's no way we get anything other than tbc.
---
Hopefully we can create a push for it, as a lot of people don't want TBC and all the conveniences it adds to the game along other issues.
---
So from where I stand its better to take a chance to add something great to the current game over going down a route I know that I won't like (and yes, I have also played TBC recently so I know what it includes).
---
Neither and come up with a different one
---
Teebu used to sell for silly amounts.
---
How the fuck do you get so much runecloth? On our Server they are like 10s/per and it would cost like 600 at least to get Exalted.
---
Amazing!
---
I dont see why it wouldnt be, you have 2 dots.
---
Quite ironic that you find him annoying, you watch Pewdiepie.
---
Don't ever mount me or my son ever again.
---
Just the Gobtip!
---
Shout out Deviate Delight! I love t that server. I see the goofiest shit on there.
---
Is his knife better than finkles skinner?
---
now we get to play the fun  game, troll or just retarded?
---
It was cheap on my server's AH.
---
They cycle pretty fast. 5-10 minutes.
---
'-'
---
Because it might be weeks or months until you replace said blues.
---
Bears tank raids easily if not better than warriors for the first 5 phases
---
Do people really want classic+? Id much rather get the actual expansions in their original order than a new fork.  I simply don't believe the guys that brought us BFA are capable of developing classic+ into something enjoyable.  At least at know what we'll get with TBC/wotlk
---
Lucky you then, I haven't fished in the last 3 days because of the bug.
---
But I tried just now in OG, worked for me....Will try to fish in Azshara now.
---
The most autistic &amp; ugliest streamer on Twitch by far.
---
I 100% regret taking herb/alch on my lock. Wish I just went skinning/herbs. I'm level 46, heading to Un'Goro (eventually) and know that I could make bank from Devilsaurs (PvE servers so if i can tag on i'll be fine). I'm still tempted to drop alch (it's at 250) for skinning for the final bit of levelling as thick/rugged leather will be widely available.
---
But at least they will have a community that can do things, Normal Population Servers will struggle to do MC or Onyxia on Saturday evening.
---
I don't think wrath was good. Half of it was okay and then ToC was released and everything went to shit real fast.
---
It was the ideal pug expansion, but so is retail.
---
&gt;Would it be better if I just add an x to the end?
---
Legolasx doesn't sound so bad. In all seriousness, those special characters can prevent you from being invited into a party or add unnecessary hassle.
---
I wouldn't.
---
#nochanges
---
Whats the lifebar addon ?
---
I mostly ignore people with alt letters because dealing with it is annoying. Unless I can right click on their name to invite them, I'm not bothering tbh.  I'd pick a name that doesn't involve alts of X. But that is a personal preference.
---
That he plays WoW....?
---
This is why I‚Äôm really enjoying Classic. The community is awesome. I‚Äôve not had a problem finding groups and people to help out. Even if they were done themselves. 
---
And fuck the drop rate in this game. And the crazy town aggro.
---
Then I genuinely feel sorry for you.
---
Quick question. In a dungeon (or really just whenever grouped), if you sap 1 target in a group of mobs and get unlucky and unstealth, the rest target you. If you vanish before anyone else in the party draws aggro (heal/damage whatever), and no one else walks near the mobs, will the mobs just totally de-aggro?
---
Basically, with the 10% risk of losing stealth, are rogues still decent dungeon/raid ccers?
---
That looks like the writings of a sane and well rounded human being
---
Necrosis is good sound alert

Don't know if I'm in the minority here, but if I'm in a group with randoms, I will need on any item that I actually need, simple as that. We're all there for the same purpose, we're using need before greed, not some kind of semi loot council that only becomes activated once a specific item drops. We all joined the group, saw the group composition and went into the dungeon, fully aware that some of us might share loot tables. If you want to do loot otherwise, feel free to create your own group and set it up to your liking. Your example with Dal'rend is a good one. If I joined a random group and there was no agreed upon loot priority for Dal'rend, then Dal'rend is free game for any class that needs it and they all roll on equal terms. 
---
If I'm in a group with guildies though, it's a different talk. We're there to improve our own characters and the guild (and have fun, obviously). The needs of the group surpasses the needs of the individuals and we will put the items where the group benefits the most.
---
WITNESS ME!
---
Don't you mean unofficial?
---
She looks fine. She's got one of the best looking female faces (there are 2-3 really good, the rest are weak), she's got the best face markings, she's got a good hairstyle (ponytail and brain make female NE faces look way too thin) and the only thing I don't like of your character is the skin colour.
---
It's good.
---
I'm like 99% certain that Az from HeelVsBabyface would love that little imp. üòÖ
---
I think we should vote for the hyena he dodged as king. 
---
After all who has a better story than hyena#15720502?
---
So you didn't play vanilla ?
---
As a lock I always tell the healer not to worry about me, I don't need heals. If I do - it means I screwed up myself.
---
Healthstone, health potion, bandages, food, vw sac - I got all these tools to keep myself alive.
---
I had a shammie get mad (but still stayed) because I won the roll for this as a warrior.  His reasoning being I could just get WW axe (I was I think 30 at this point but it was literally 2nd day of launch so GL finishing WW axe).  Used it until I got a ravager around lvl 38.  I would still have stayed for the full run if I had lost.  Would have been salty though as it was my 6th full run and his 1st.
---
You invite the prospective owner into your group. Do your solo thing and if it drops master loot it into his pockets. Then he'll pay you your blood money or you try again. 
---
Hunters did it since vanilla but pretty much any ranged class can sort of do it.
---
alliance doesnt sleep they aint human 
---
 i dont think any human have the mental capacity to choose that filthy faction
---
This level of assholery is a sight to behold
---
According to that data there are  51909 horde on Stalagg and 33778 horde on Faerlina. If you go in Org at night there are like at least 3x as many people standing around on Faerlina.
---
I mean I guess that is created characters, not active players, but still. Doesn't seem very helpful.
---
Shaman is way better at tanking, earth shock is an excellent way to pull back mobs others have aggroed.
---
How is it nobody posted the Vent Harassment video of this?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIVTT4fgPQI)
---
Why would the strongest DPS class not deserve them?
---
Horde filth.
---
I've literally played 120 hours since release. I'm level 42. 
---
In the eyes of many, I'm a casual. Holy hell.
---
Yeah, the ammount of times when we gave boes to appropriate guys for them yo post it on ah is too damn big. I just need on boe's now, call me a ninja idgaf anymore.
---
cool story
---
Was it even good or just fashionscape
---
Which realm?
---
Yup, me and another warrior were getting chased by 4 of these fuckers..
---
Who's driving the truck?
---
Happened with my Druid's T1 shoulders, except the GF didn't even care about them, the GM just gave them to her 'as a welcome gift' when she wasn't even Level 60 and he'd be the one to level her char for the most part. She didn't even really understand that she received something cool.
---
You are wrong. Go watch the duelling competition on beta, literally people resisting 3 stuns in a row. Go do the math on that on a none Orc
---
I don't want balance
---
Which one is the winterspring one? Gotta farm for that cat mount.
---
I never die simultaneously with my mobs in retail but in Classic it is a win.
---
Let this victorious warrior be known as Druss, The Legend
---
This is great. Thanks for sharing. This game is the 1st mmo I've ever played and I've been a gamer for around 30 years. I'm thoroughly addicted and my favourite moments so far are helping strangers out of sticky PvP situations. As a priest I try to stamina buff every friendly I pass as I never know if I will be crying for their help in 30 seconds!
---
It'll definitely be a while before phase 3, when the agi enchants come out.
---
the way shes just crouching over there like some rabid zombie makes the screenshot great.  
---
what was that level 1 doing there as well tho
---
You should check out EVE Online.
---
Can somebody link the alliance molten core one?
---
ez clap
---
Yes I do the same, Alliance in a Horde region though I feel we need to supress these incursions. Not killing half dead fighting mobs but the ‚Äòraiders‚Äô on full health running through our territory as if it was their own precious stormwind; the arrogance.
---
Have helped alliance many times and happily, amazing how emotive a character can be without using speech or emotes and you know the good ones. I personally pat everyone I mean no harm too or sniff if in ghostwolf form.
---
I hit 60 and no one in my guild congratulated me. I was only the second person to hit 60 too. Needless to say, I really didn't give a shit lol. Good riddance to that guild.
---
Have you seen any kind of polls about expansions? Wotlk is one of the most beloved ones.
---
Do you know if they layer hopped during leveling or in dungeons?
---
You dont need riding tho
---
Sounds like you just saved a lot of time spent with a bunch of assholes.
---
Pickpocketing everything in a pull is my fetish.
---
Also, it is pretty useful to put a rogue on a low-armor caster, kicking and stunning all the spells. It's a form of CC, except it also actually kills the mob, and it starts out with a Cheap Shot.
---
private server with only classic or going to TBC or woltk or anything else already exist anyway. If they "ruin" it, we can always go somewhere. It's the only chance for us to have something else, that is truly new and original.
---
look it up. It's true. It seems weird to us because we are egoistical beings. It's not about someone sharing a birthday with YOU. It's someone sharing a birthday with someone else. That's a lot of possible combinations. That's 23 people looking at 22 other people who might share a birthday with them.
---
It has objectively better offensive stats, what are you talking about?
---
i dont want to be banned, I do want blizz devs to stop lying. The statement made about banning exploiters was unequivocally false.
---
Same, I am a fan of "perfect imbalance" where every class just does different things as oppose to every class being relegated to pure DPS, tank or healer. And instead have more specialized uses for all classes
---
I don't understand how more people aren't picking up on this. Should be instagib with what OP describes.
---
/g (insert text)
---
Though I would try out whatever you are wanting to do with /say first to get it correct and then once you are happy with the results do /g
---
Hammer if it happens to drop and you win.  Staff otherwise.  The staff is probably enough of a DPS upgrade to make it worth it even without any str on it.
---
Are you including crafted BoE Epics? IE: Lionheart/Titanic Leggings, Nightfall etc then.  
---
Otherwise Edgemasters, Cloudkeepers, and Freezing Band.
---
You might have a few quests in the burning steppes, the blasted lands. You will soon have access to winterspring and wpl I think
---
I am glad you had fun the second run as well and didn't feel that decision anxiety.
---
It's from [Ravandil's Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azOvRwrqz2M), based on the game Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat.
---
i'd say decreasing, but it's perfectly normal
---
O M G
---
No, the weapon damage won‚Äòt affect your spell damage at all.
---
+ Spell damage increases your... well... spell damage.
---
Int only increases your mana and crit chance for spells in classic.
---
Joined one that asked first in a whisper before sending an invite, that just asked whether I wanted a guild with nothing more than that, without trying to sell me on it with a load of fluff about "planned activities".
---
If approached like that I'll consider it, but I've no delusions about that guilds recruiting like this rarely being any sort of permanent fit for end game.
---
it is for a shaman. once you get put in a stun lock, your done. 
---
stun resist means that one of those 4 stuns are likely to miss. you die to rogues as a none orc shaman every time
---
wow like violet citadel in dalaran
---
I had this exact same problem. I had level 15-18 mage, druid, warrior &amp; rogue. As all my IRL friends began to out level me, I wanted to stop and decided on a hard rule:    
---
    
---
I'll decide what to play at the character screen, no overthinking it, just go with whatever I'm feeling. First toon to hit 20 is all I play until 60. Now my rogue is 30 and I'm having a blast murdering folks in STV. I reccomend this method!
---
Im lvling a mage so my warrior lvls in blues, i didnt come here to fuck spiders
---
My knowledge is from BC, and since I'm a horde player I can't really verify if it works in classic, but the key to prot pally leveling is grinding. If built correctly, it's difficult to die. Using redoubt and holy shield, you can pull half a zone, make sure everything's tagged, and tab out for a few minutes while everything kills itself on your shield. Consecrate obviously speeds things up if you want to take a more active roll. 
---
Seal of righteousness scales great with spell power, so if you find any of that, try to incorporate it into your gear, though iirc that's extremely rare pre bc.
---
sleep who needs that?
---
whats the addon that shows the the debuffs on top of the health bars, i cant find one for classic
---
If you level with a mage then you can go ele. I play enhance, and heal dungeons with my brother who is warrior. But, I've grouped with an ele mage stack that did mad dps.
---
I still see a button with 2 dices that allows me tl get them so... if you wanna complain, we hunters dont give a fck stop rolling on agi mail so we can start talking...
---
This is brilliant - great story!!
---
I would agree, however the majority of solo content I'm doing is felwood and mara princess runs. Where moonglow spec comes out ahead imo.
---
That's definitely the plan. The alt is a warlock and I'm planning on getting him that high (and then possibly stopping once I get what I need. The specialization will be tribal (that's the leather stat boosting one, right?)).
---
How viable would a Warr Prot alt be, in terms of levelling in dungeons only ?
---
It's most efficient to finish all the DM quests and do quests in Redridge and Duskwood to pick up Stockades quests, then do Stockades around 25 with all quests except the Kam Deepfury one. But if you want to see more of the world you can look for groups for Shadowfang Keep or Blackfathom Deeps around lvl 23. Then around lvl 29 you can do Gnomeregan or Razorfen Kraul if you feel like going out of your way.
---
I'm Alliance and I physically recoil in disgust if I create a new character and it randomly opens a Horde race.
---
For Stormwind! For the Alliance!
---
Found the hacker
---
That‚Äôs what it is about
---
Gold is a lot easier to get in this version of classic.  Not sure if it has to do with increased green drops due to 1.10 items being added in or what.  Got my epic a week ago with change.  Not pre-bis tho.
---
Since no one has decided to say this yet, you get like a 5 second loot window where you can skin your shit after the devilsaur dies. So just loot and skin really fast. Don't wait there and type out stuff, just skin asap.
---
Ye, all i had to do is the quest turnin and i could ride it.
---
it's a bug, just hide the Player frames ... shift+v
---
Maybe reaching the top rank in CSGO/league/Dota. Because it actually requires a lot of skill and training, not all people are capable, regardless of time. With enough time in this game there's nothing that everyone can't achieve.
---
How many people you see will depend on your layer, but the chat should have equal activity at least.
---
I get it you dont wanna name and shame, but including the name of the guild and server could help people to not make the mistake of joining it.
---
Wrong. A server with medium pop nowadays has more players connected to it than a server at full capacity back in the day.
---
Does this even make sense?
---
What addon are you using for your actionbar?
---
Ah the good old "prove this, but your proof doesn't count"
---
Glad to hear this.  Been running my druid and tanking much more than dpsing.  Don't really have much problem with agro so far, but always wonder if I'm making the healer work way more than a war due to no shield/def cooldowns.
---
Sorry, but that is just a dick power trip move buy the Gm and his guild.  Name and shame, shit like that is pathetic and why anyone would want to join such a horse shit guild in the future should be made known of this behaviour.  People need to realise your actions have consequences on a classic server.  Hopefully you find a replacement guild.
---
I was thinking the same. Makes no sense at all, and in D2 they had well working methods for separating physical and spell based attacks. Still don't like how they implemented things in D3.
---
Balance the classes to tbc and give me arenas
---
Between level 15 and 50, the same spec (all points in feral), can dps or tank in one set of gear, and heal in another.  I have one bag for my extra set, and I‚Äôm always ready to jump into any dungeon as anything.
---
Even with kings buff which you are suddenly assuming alliance it is not better.
---
The weak.
---
Pretty sure he is the president of Blizzard so I very much doubt it
---
I doubt he got fired, at that time Blizz most likely agreed with him on it.
---
No.  He was guy that got to announce Classic.
---
From my experience there are 3 kinds of horde ganks:
---
* Skulls camping your corpse &amp; following you wherever you go
---
* Several hordes that's a higher lvl than you gangs up &amp; kills you on sight.
---
* Undead Mages polymorphing me, killing my beloved pet &amp; then runs away laughing, followed by me grumbling *why didn't I roll a Druid like in the good ol' days*
---
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPquarz16wQ).
---
Peak in popularity, it just wasn't that bad yet and still gaining users, but it wasn't the best expansion because of that. I would never play WotLK again, there was barely any player interaction left by then.
---
I would think that as a joke, but this game has so many weird people playing so i dont know what to believe.
---
Warriors do have a place in raids.  Fury does really good DPS, and since they have some abilities to heal themselves a little, they tend to take a little bit of the load off the healers.  Warriors in general are great for raids since in places like MC, some encounters will need an MT, or 2 MTs, and 4-6 Off Tanks which can basically be any spec.  MS is also welcomed in raids since some bosses do have ways of healing themselves, which are usually interrupted or mitigated in other ways, but to cut the healing in half which they do manage to get off, is nice especially when you're in a race with the clock to beat an enrage timer.
---
he‚Äôs the president of blizzard now. I dunno whether to laugh or cry
---
Why do you care what other people do? Dont you have something better to do?
---
Yes but it is prebis in phase 3 though and no respectable guild will have given a hunter a better weapon before that.
---
&gt;Untrue. Two people killing at the same speed they normally would (or possibly quicker depending on makeup) should statistically get the drops in the same amount of time.
---
This is incorrect unless there's enough eligible mobs that you can't run out of them, as the killing speed will be capped depending on the amount of mobs available. The more mobs available the are, the better a pair can make use of their strengths. With a low amount, it can be detrimental.
---
For dungeons, Int, because you might have to spam and not profit from Spirit out of casting regen (5sec rule). I'd still get some spirit on the side though.
---
For levelling, Spirit gets way better because of the regen talent at the beginning of the shadow tree, and because you can be out of casting for a while after putting your dots on and when you start spamming wand
---
It's always there.. watching.. waiting...
---
&gt;No escape tools.
---
We have hamstring though... :)
---
Rogue isn't stealthed wtf
---
No. Instant attack damage is directly based on your DPS (ie. weapon DPS + attack power/14): `(Total DPS * Weapon Type Multiplier) + Mortal Strike damage bonus` ([source](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Mortal_Strike&amp;oldid=91723)). The weapon's speed does not factor into it.
---
What *might* factor into it is the weapon's damage variation, though I'm pretty sure that's just universally 80% to 120% of the weapon's average damage on all weapons and that is what will be applied to the normalized damage variation of the attack too.
---
THIS IS BRILLIANT! been following your D&amp;D series!
---
do the sunken temple next!
---
Twinking was crazy on private Servers. Those people know. They will be rich.
---
Because he could. Good for him lol.
---
Well to me it‚Äôd be cool since I started with cata right after the golden days 
---
But I can understand why classic fans would hate it
---
Fun. It is fun. You should try it out.
---
i sayed it a thousend times ... no thunder armor when we stand in Water! ...
---
I have had more success with ambush in world pvp against mages. 
---
So you‚Äôre saying a good rogue would use CS on a mage, the mage would blink and your job as a rogue is get the mage under cc again, while blink is in cd and then you burst and kill him?
---
Remember, it's a secret to everyone.
---
Imagine trying to justify rolling need on the best item they can obtain, it's crazy.
---
For real? How did the community react to this? Did the guy ever acknowledge his ignorance?
---
No you cant change.  
---
Just reroll or stick with it
---
Yeh perhaps, but we were still having fun. We were just struggling. I'm not one to kick off at mistakes unless they're purposefully fucking things up.
---
"Looking for more strategy. Dead."
---
An MMO stands or falls with its active population, you should care.
---
I leveled to 40 as a ret paladin with the holy tree filled out just till consecration. I could tank easily, I could dps, and I could also heal with ease. It's honestly the best spec.  So tldr:
---
You need consecration to tank as a paladin pretty much so get it first
---
Both, at the same time!
---
I'm thinking about rolling a Tauren Hunter, would this be stupid? I'm not a min/max player and I don't PVP at all, but would my experience be bad enough to rethink my choice? I really like Hunters and I really like Taurens/really hate Trolls...
---
Same but another hour later (just woken up) have a nice day everyone
---
Good thing we're horde
---
How to play protection. 
---
Step one log out
---
Step two create new character 
---
Step three make a warrior 
---
Step four spec protection at 10
---
First time I ever play wow, my char is an elf druid. I'm going the heal way.
---
I'm lvl 25 right now. My mage friend has a staff in main hand and a wand in his offhand, are druid able to get a weapon in their offhand as well?
---
What stats should I look for while leveling? Endgame I know what I will need since it's written in guides, but for leveling since I need to kill stuff by myself for questing, should I aim for something different?
---
Are named mobs that drop stuff (not quests ones) prevalent around these levels, is there a list of them somewhere?
---
Skinning and mining are usually a favorite.  The gathering ones in general are great for making money.  Endgame, I find Tailoring, BS, LW to always fall short since any raid items tend to be better than whatever you can craft.  Not saying that they don't have their perks at times, but Ive always found gathering just to be a solid way to earn cash.
---
He's the CEO, who's going to fire him ?
---
I need a better computer
---
7.8 million characters? How many of them are alts of the same account? Would love to know a rough figure of concurrent player numbers for classic alone
---
If you actually go back and watch the original video where he says that, he‚Äôs like ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt remember having to find people for a dungeon because now you just press a button and it‚Äôs done for you‚Äô. Lmao the dumbass doesn‚Äôt even realise the damage they‚Äôve done to the game.
---
than i'm weak xD
---
What's the advantage of anything you do in the game?  He's having fun and his victims are salty
---
Watch yer bek
---
Welcome to tanking, the EASIEST way to communicate this to people is to just let them die if they pull agro from you with one of the ways you stated.
---
After dying twice they will adjust or just never learn.
---
Also Macro's with a simple explanation of how you like to tank i.e I will do the pulling with my ranged weapon, give me 2 sunders before attacking with your abilities, please focus skull and don't AOE etc etc are a great help and very easy to set-up with a huge return.
---
Playing warcraft in general just doesn't seem like a very effective use of one's day... And yet that never stopped anyone from playing.
---
Spirit for levelling &amp; healing - int has more value for endgame DPS (including shadow PvP I would guess)
---
As a general guide for healing:
---
Spellpower &gt; Spirit/Mp5 &gt; Int &gt; Stam
---
The same could be asked of you, showing up in a thread you don't seem to care about just to be negative.
---
It triggers some people to whine on reddit. For some that's reason enough
---
Is undead warrior good? I have to reroll from a dead server and wondering if I should do an orc or an undead warr, kinda afraid I will get tired of the orc look but that axe spec is a big advantage..
---
I tend to agree.  Swipe is nice, but rage hungry and not something I'm spamming most pulls until agro is kind of settled anyway.  Think thorns feels at least as effective in the initial chaos.
---
Look for BattleForAzerothUI_Classic on github
---
damn i wish you drew that mace, also your drawing looks way cooler than he really looks lmao, looks great man
---
The net-and-switch is awful. I was tanking Gnomer the other night and the guardians in there did the same thing. It hurts my confidence as a tank to see mobs ditch me mid-fight, but even realizing that it isn't my fault doesn't help because the rest of my group probably doesn't understand. They just see "tank lost aggro, tank must be bad".
---
If i get a whisper for a guild invite and you aren't standing 2 feet from me i'm not interested.
---
I on the other hand didn't think there are that many quests. Reagent Run, Buzzard wings, Study of Element: Rock (x3), Frost Oil / Blue Pearl (Frost Oil is ridiculously OP in my realm so skipping it, and don't fancy going pearl diving), Broken Alliances (x2) and I feel I am forgetting 1 or 2 without significant followups. What else am I not thinking of?
---
I ended up going back to STV as almost 42 to finish off a few previously orange quests, and could stick around in STV still but feel like doing Uldaman now (will be healing, so reckon 42 is fine).
---
Now that's cool af
---
Care to name that 1 thing?
---
I've seen few people in the wild with a horde symbol tattoo... I've yet to encounter one with an alliance one lol
---
I'm doing that right now and it's scaring my cat.
---
Which is a feat in and of itself as I don't have a cat and I'm at work.
---
He got promoted
---
Lol. Just lol. This is so ridiculous, I don't even know what to say except that you should be glad that you got kicked out, so you didn't waste too much time on pretentious assholes.
---
20mins later
---
haha "fuck asmongold" wins the internet for me today!
---
I originally wanted to play on golemagg and still plan to play my alliance toons there, just wondering what is the faction balance like? Is it really 65 horde to 35 alliance or is that inaccurate?
---
Your comment was phrased as if it is impossible to fire a CEO, and I addressed it appropriately. I stated no opinion on the matter of whether or not that should be done.
---
It‚Äôs funny that you can tell these stories are all nonsense just by having general knowledge of the game. So the level 60 didn‚Äôt resist fear, charge or hamstring? And he didn‚Äôt just auto attack with his bow/gun?
---
Ok thanks bud
---
Muigin and Lario are great. Just cramming video game references in
---
You can write pretty complicated movement macros into it that do far more than just "one keypress". Shit like automatically spreading your dudes into formation, and return-to-leader functionality if you eg. happen to get feared.
---
Multiboxing more like multibotting amirite.
---
One of my all time favorite quests. My main on Retail still has the faded photograph in his bank.
---
It just sucks because I love when experienced players do tell me what to do. I love learning those things and passing them on to others.
---
It's really just impatientence. People can't wait for anything. It's much better it classic.
---
How dare you are!
---
That‚Äôs a good point, I think it is alliance though as there was also a troll one in Un‚ÄôGoro that had you do similar quests to hatch a raptor, think that was the horde equivalent, but I may be totally wrong! 
---
And I have a sneaky suspicion that they weren‚Äôt out in the current version of the game that we are playing.
---
I've a feeling horde side went like:
---
Female orc: OMG why aren't you guys helping?!11!?
---
Other orc: Mak'Gora
---
Female orc: OMG help!!1!
---
Another orc: Can't. Mak'Gora.
---
Third orc: Hands tied. Mak'Gora.
---
Female orc: You damn losers!1!! He's killing me!!
---
Fourth orc: Mak'Gora.
---
Female orc: OMG /gquit!!1!
---
It's spelled "Cookie's Cavern"
---
Yes, rogue.
---
Oh thanks - I had thought they said it was some reset bug that used to happen back in the day occasionally as well. Well, that throws a bit of a different light on it if that‚Äôs the case.
---
Then you got incredibly lucky.  Just vendoring greys and questing doesn't get you that. Easily anyway
---
It depends on your level of desperation. If you get enough money for mount at 40 or decide you can live without it, save them on a bank alt or 3 until the economy turns, else vendor/AH them for what you can get.
---
And the level 25 managed to fear him. And he managed to get a hamstring off.
---
I def need a target.
---
Is there a way to remove the mist or at least make it farther away? Many zones would look great if you could actually see it all ...
---
Hunters don't really stop scaling with gear. The plate classes become much tankier late game and you need to really kite them a while to kill them but any leather, cloth is literally 3 shot with bwl/naxx gear. Any mail class is also quite susceptible to burst.  
---
Hunters are also a very easy class to level and are excellent class for world pvp, early and late game.
---
Rogue
---
@
---
Money isn't everything
---
Lockboxes are usually 225 or 250 skill required. Opening boxes from 250-300 is a pretty chill way to skill it up, although I would take a fee none the less.
---
PvE: Human or Orc. Specialization is so insanely good in late game.
---
Is that hat model in retail any longer?
---
Alliance PvE: Human  
---
Alliance PvP : Gnome, but Dwarf is great too. Night Elf is more of a gimmick with shadowmeld, but I think it's one of the most useful flavor racials in the game.  
---
Horde PvE: Orc  
---
Horde PvP: Orc, maybe Undead if you hate warlocks more than rogues.
---
I would love to try work out the cheapest way of leveling enchanting. Try calculate average dungeon run times, average mobs fought, average loot dropped and then work from there. Would be cool to see how much time it would take and ultimately how much cheaper it would be.
---
(364/365)^(23*22) = ~0.5 or 50%. 
---
Have you done the maths?
---
Screw capes. Real heros wear Baguettes ü•ñ
---
Do it. I never played Vanilla and wanted to avoid Classic as I dont even play retail anymore. After I got bored of PUBG I decided to resub while drunk and I am having a blast.
---
Classic has by far the best community I have ever seen.
---
I see, thanks mate!
---
When people start rolling alts, which is at least a few months from now (my guess). Until then, either vendor it for a small profit now, or (if you aren't desperate for gold) save them and sell them when the prices go up. If you don't have the bag/bank space, make an alt and mail them everything, but don't open the mails.
---
I do level prot.
---
Shamans are certainly better tanks than pets. Sure, they don't outperform warriors by far. But in 5 mans, a good shaman tank doesn't go slow. It's just fine.
---
With effective groups instances are way faster
---
It's quite efficient to spam dungeons with an exp group. You just have to have a healer and you can assemble a group in about 5-10 minutes.
---
As a tank, can I have you in my group? I get tired of mages because most of them just seem to want to AoE every single thing, even if it's just 2 mobs. I'd rather have good solid single target DPS who can CC if needed.
---
hahaha that's the most hilariously pathetic behaviour I've ever seen.   
---
Does he think it's the queen of England that got lvl 60 or what. When you get kicked out of the guild for not congratulating someone on a level up, you know that you don't belong in there.  
---
What a crackpot. 
---
Find a better guild :)
---
Yeah as I said they can spend a bit of time making Classic TBC, spots that actually matter for flying are fixable with a flight path or a portal for example, you don't need a flying mount to get to Naxx
---
Ouais, Finkle :) Jcommence √† prendre mes marques sur wow mais j'ai encore du chemin, jrencontre pas mal de gens qui attendent plus de moi en switchant entre forme humaine pour heal et ours pour tank, notamment pour les qu√™tes √©lite.
---
Seek professional help.
---
those diehard hordies tend to have fragile masculinity tbh
---
My point exactly, charge them for the food and water. You are providing them a service even if that service is low effort.
---
I provide my services for free for my friends and my guildies and a charge everyone else. I take locked chests in PUGs because without me it would have gone unopened. People should not be afraid to charge for their time.
---
I think the anime hair colours don't really fit WOW as much as the more natural colours, and being a "Night Elf", pale skin seems to fit.
---
This is exactly the response I'm hoping for when I ruin some nerds day
---
I would recommend any priest, including holy, to get wand spec and spirit tap as a priority if you intend to do any solo questing at all. Then you can dump all the rest of your points in holy. Spirit tap has nice bonus synergy with Spiritual Guidance as well, which is often neglected.
---
You, sir/ma‚Äôam, have great storytelling skills.
---
Morning all. I'm considering giving classic wow a try. My friend is stuck in STV on a full server and wants to re roll to play with me. What's the least populated server on EU?
---
still insane to me that i can fish for 2 hours around mid-night pull out 30g and that being 30 bucks that is 15 bucks an hour and i am only level 39.
---
I recently learned on Reddit that tanking doesn't matter in low level dungeons and everyone should just zerg everything to death.
---
This is one of the cases where you definitely dodged a bullet.
---
Thing is about wow guilds, you get attached to the people you play with every day.
---
The officer and gm's are probably IRL friend having a laugh at kicking you, and that's the definition of a toxic environment where the guild leaders\officers don't respect or even give a fuck about their members.
---
Good riddance, make new friends in your new guild! :D
---
Thanks for all this, really solid info!
---
No. The MaxDPS is way higher on the staff. Makes killing mops easier and faster. Theoretically...I went with the hammer and the trousers...
---
As a paladin, I used the boomerang as my ‚Äútaunt‚Äù when I don‚Äôt want to wade into a gaggle of mobs.
---
The queues also shrink because excited players who plan to stay  just play less.  It's like being in love, the first weeks you think of nothing else but her/him and want to spend every waking second with your beloved, but after some time you return to your other duties.  That doesn't mean you will leave, but just return to a normal schedule
---
My blue cloud is called "Kragmon". Every time i see it's name i think of Digimon. I disliked it at first but it kinda stuck...
---
*Consciously makes character on PvP server.
---
Complains about PvP.*
---
This. Also, pre-30 shamans who are running around with Rockbiter on their weapon. Both are extra threat generators and massively annoying if they are left undetected.
---
In time, I think he just needed to paws for a second.
---
Should Priest/Mages/Druids/Paladins charge people for buffs?
---
Damn you're daft!
---
If your wife doesn't play WoW with you, she's not a wife worth having.
---
What's really nice with classic is reconnecting with the **kind** players you've met throughout your wow career and an opportunity to start a new journey with them.
---
Also the old style of realms makes kindness and cruelty have actual consequences.
---
next alliance I see is getting ganked
---
Are there mobs good for farming Green Hills of Stranglethorn?
---
I play a druid and warrior both (thus I am fucking slow at leveling &gt;.&gt;) and it really feels like my druid has a way easier time holding aggro for some reason.
---
Can't I axe a question?
---
Don't roll on the least populated servers. Pick any High server with a name you like. My personal vote is Noggenfogger because the community is unique.
---
&gt; Off hands are a different thing, used by a mage or lock alongside a 1h sword or dagger... You also can't equip those :p.
---
That's incorrect. Everyone can equip the "Held in off-hand" items, and it's typically mages, warlocks, priests, and _druids_ that use them (alongside a 1h weapon, and as an alternative to staves or 2h maces).
---
So, a pally basically has buffs and 2 healing spells that they sit there and spam.
---
Priests have AOE Healing, 2 heals like paladins, renew, shield, stam shadow spirit buff, inspiration, just a ton of healing talents which make them the best.  Paladins can keep their mana up and buff, but they spam heals, and in a situation where it's aoe damage to a 40 man raid, paladins come in short on multi target.  Priest is viable in all situations, which is why they're generally the best choice.
---
If you have a problem with people running away and not having much slows shadow priests also only have mind flay and it's a very lackluster range. Many classes will be able to outrun you unless you pop nifty trinkets, root net, swiftness potion etc... So in that regard rogue would be a better choice imo.
---
As it comes to druid, early game might be rough but you really have to make use of bear form charge and nature's grasps and entangling roots. They have means to stop people but yes they don't really have a slow. But they also can't be slowed due to shapeshifts and have faster movement (also a Dash every 5 minutes). This is the trade off.
---
&gt; hunter for example is a full dps
---
Absolutely not. Hunter has some of the most utility in the game. People just don't want to use the utility because they think everything is based around damage. A good hunter will trap, slow, root, stun, debuff and weaken the enemy. A hunter who just focuses purely on damage, is't using the class optimally.
---
Not all classes should be on par, nor should damage numbers be the defining feature to measure them. If you do that all classes suddenly become homogeneous and uninteresting.
---
All your issues: Transfer
---
Quests are grindy to get you to 60.
---
It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre mad to play classic for being classic.
---
It‚Äôs a grindy timesink type of game
---
yeah game compagnies went hard on the fonction side in the function vs flavor problem.
---
My family tried to contact be yesterday since they haven heard from me for more than 3 weeks and were afraid something had happend to me. I was like "no, everything's fine, work you know? And also a new game I like to put my freetime into..." - My Mother: "Don't tell me you ignore social contacts **AGAIN** because wow was released again."
---
At least not in this case. You should at least think a little bit about where you put your points. Throwing them all into one tree is pointless for nearly every class.

I'm still listening but I I get confused, it seems you think people are getting banned for open world layering abusing. But that isn't an exploit but intended and none is getting banned for that.
---
It's the dungeon layering which is a exploit and people get banned for.
---
Am I understanding you correctly?
---

---
Can provide you with a rough guide to server populations/faction balance.
---
It successfully filters the type of players you want in your guild.
---
I'd stick with ret for leveling, and use warrior gear and a good 2-hander.
---
Once you're 60 go protection for solo farming purposes, you can solo pull huge groups and let them kill themselves on your shield.
---
Not sure if prot would work before lvl 30 for aoe farming and leveling but it is something you could try for sure.
---
Back in the day I ran a prot/spelladin hybrid and had great succes in solo content and pvp, endgame content however ie raiding I was always forced to be a healbot however.
---
In pvp you are incredibly hard to kill and sometimes people will even give up and run away :p
---
Bro what's your /played?
---
I LOVED how many people expected to be summoned to deadmines... Lmao no those are just meeting stones.
---
How is that at all the same? I mean if you are running about open world and someone asks you to buff them, go ahead as them for some money why not but as a part of a group its sort of your job
---
I don't hang around trying to sell lockpicking. If I'm at the org bank and someone asks for it, I'll invite them and pick it - mainly to be helpful, but also because plenty of people tip.
---
Night elves would love this I assume
---
Classes are certainly more balanced in BC, there's no denying that. But my preference is still with Classic.
---
 Was it me in Tanaris or Hinterlands? SmileyFace
---
It successfully ensures the people who expresses interests are likely to want to join.
---
Sadly what you want sounds like a paladin. They have much better means to tank compared to shamans and even as a retribution or protection  spec they can bring invaluable utility to BGs and group pvp. 100% recommend holy paladin.

---
Id say lock since they tended to be OP back in the day when geared.  raiding wise, they usually did destro spec and would spam shadowbolts since the limit on debuffs made affliction locks useless.
---
Correct - but that is why many guides state it as being the better option.
---
This is win :D
---
Well there's a really nice quest in Westfall about killing 20 harvest watchers.
---
I think Worgen are the only race of Retail I would like to see in Classic (besides Zandalari and the Orc guys).
---
Thanks! To be honest though, it's pretty temping to do that, I might have done it myself once or twice :p. I do have a few specific cases though where I will not do it such as to an enemy that's more than 2-3 levels lower than me or a warrior of similar level or lower since they already have it rough anyways. If I see an opportunity though for a 1vX clip, I'm all in since that could be a highlight and a good highlight could mean a new follower (road to Affiliate is a tough grind :/).
---
That‚Äôs a question I out there a bit later in the episode - I was unsure if any bans were being handed out for the world farming with layering. I know they‚Äôre being given out for the dungeons. Some posts seem to make it sound like both are being hit but I really wasn‚Äôt sure so couldn‚Äôt say definitively.
---
Don't you feel like it should be worth more than that? $2/gold seems extremely cheap to me but I'm on a server where you can buy a Staff of Jordan for 135g. That's $270 which is about 2 days working at $15/hour (maybe 3 if you consider taxes, gas and food, etc.). It takes a lot longer than 3 days to farm up a SoJ.
---
RMT ruins the game experience because it cheapens everything and makes it too easy, but I totally feel like it would be cost effective thing to do if you value your time at more than $15/hour.
---
That's just like living in Dublin.
---
Yes, it's amazing for bandaging mid fight or escaping. The alternative talent that gives you dodge chance seems a lot worse.
---
I sure hope by the time you get to SG, 99c is worth flying over wasting like 15 mins
---
Rexarr, yikes
---
I see. Thanks.
---
oh no totally, if you wanna level through lockboxes go for it, just saying theres money to be made while doing so
---
source?
---
we've known that about huntards for a long time now
---
You mean being undead, or are you refering to his username?
---
I did something way worse. I used this horde scort quest to tank and koll the mobs for me then I killed the horde
---
Best oart you can sync it with friends and or guild
---
Nicely played. I don't think the rogue was fully aware just how dangerous a well-played druid is. 
---
What was the item you used to put the guy to sleep in the start of the fight?
---
Some of us have lives
---
Note that this was my third attempt! First time they dodged the gouge. You also need to click the egg INSTANTLY after gouging, as there is only a 0.5 window of error. (5.5sec gouge, 5 sec loot time)
---
Yeah you don't see where I'm coming from,  the point is perspective
---
"But it's a PvP server! I'd get ganked!"
---
I kid I kid, nobody serious about WoW would every say something like that right?
---
Oh I do. I also report anyone in my faction that drops N-bombs. I‚Äôd encourage anyone to do the same.
---
Do you know the droprate of the Hammer? 
---
Wowhead says 17%. But i've also seen 5%..
---
Ah nice! Another empty captial city that has no meaning like most things in retail.
---
So tonight I was about to get off and go to bed when some random guy walked up to me on SW steps and whispered ‚ÄúDo you want to tank SM Cath for us?‚Äù I was about to be like ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm off to bed‚Äù but then had a change of heart: ‚ÄúFuck it. Why not. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
---
I was the highest level of the group &amp; tanning ~85% of the damage. One of the humanoids ran and I sprinted after it, executed it, ran back to the other 2 enemies, jumped over them with a perfectly executed front flip, AND auto-attacked one of them mid-flip. The auto was a crit, took aggro, tabbed to the other mob, taunted, and when my feet hit the ground they were both aggroed on me.
---
Easily one of my favorite moments playing this game so far. The front flips are so cool.
---
&gt;Edit: in order to keep the spirit of classic; further raid content must preserve the need to run earlier raid content.
---
I don't think this would work very well. At some point you would have to carry a new player through 7 raids just to get him into the most recent one.
---
Besides, even in Classic you could skip stuff. You didn't NEED to do AQ40 or any of the 20 player dungeons to go for Naxx.
---

Aw ok. Thought we were talking mains. I‚Äôd say Ret. Although it‚Äôs boring as hell so the fun you‚Äôre looking for won‚Äôt be there, ha.
---
Frostsaber rep.
---
Well 
---
90 gold in 7 levels then if it comes to it u can go fishing for cash or farm somewhere
---
That's great, means we have amazing diversity. Love that I got downvoted for being in a certain age group lmfao
---
Because of the fact 99% of the time I play forsaken on the Horde, I un-ironically thought "Country roads , take me home"
---
But at least he can do them with level 60 dude. Better than nothing.
---
Dad bods????????
---
Yes, I main priest and really enjoy the class. A few more tips: invest in a good wand and take the Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap talents no matter what for leveling. The rest is preference. Going full shadow makes you kill things slightly faster but you can still play solo just fine if you spec discipline/holy as long as you have Wand spec and Spirit Tap.
---
Well, the tanking I meant more as in I want to be able to heal or tank, rather than just DPS, either is fine. As for holy paladin, maybe I should look into what their endgame is like, both in raids and battlegrounds. Being a blessing bot doesn't sound appealing but maybe it's not that bad.
---
The leveling will suck, but that's life I guess.
---
They sound like a bunch of weird bellends in that guild
---
my favorit part about leveling with the wave as a warrior is i can group up for quests and do them without having to go back.
---
One of my friends keeps telling me we should switch to a low pop pve server because he find leveling so frustrating.
---
I keep telling him that end game will be real boring on a low pop server but he won't listen :p
---
We are currently on a high/full pvp server and while some zones can be frustrating, it's gonna be feel much better at lvl 60. I've was bothered by pvp in the early levels but now I enjoy it even though I feel like I'm being murdered more than I murder the horde. 
---
It's so hilarious with world pvp some times. Last night I was gonna go BRD and a horde warrior tried to kill me as I entered the mountain. I then feared him and mind controlled him and jumped over the edge into the lava. 10/10 moment
---
Helm of Wrath not having a charging headbutt use effect is still the biggest blunder of WoW.
---
I think i can! thanks a lot!
---
Level with combat swords , update dagger when you can , use macro to equip daggers for backstab and ambush . Works well to open with ambush, autoattack a bit with swords untill full energy, use gouge  , equip dagger again for backstab
---
Sick
---
Definitely the top 2
---
Nah, first Karazhan, then Karazhan+, where you go for what is under the tower.
---
Is this a real request for an addon (over using a timer on a phone, stopwatch or regular clock) or a humblebrag of your solo farming skillz? 
---
I'm sure you can find out for certain via Google, but IIRC you'll get locked out after doing 5 resets+ within 1 hour. Which sounds like the case, given that you started your 6th run in 1h5m.
---
Free character transfer will become available today, again. It will resolve your problems.
---
What is VC? That looks like DM on your screen.

How was he mounting if he was in combat? Mounting the bullshit train maybe.

Well, after all he is an oomkin.
---
Or you know game on all three monitors.
---
Realistically, if this classic success is gonna continue for at least 6 months, blizz will 100% release burning crusade . I already think it's going to happen and so will wotlk.   
---
Go have a look at some pserver populations (wotlk in particular).   
---
That's a lot of players that would pay subscription for blizzlike experience.   
---
Also am all for the idea of classic+.   
---
I know my way around original azeroth and played horde for the first time ever specifically so I get a fresh experience and didnt look up any guides/bis lists in detail so that I'm not just following a template.   
---
Having something new in classic would be incredible and there's lots to expand on.
---
Hyjal, Stormwind portal that was never opened. Uldum, Karazhan classic and many other things that could be released and/or released as classic versions.   
---
Arena in Classic would also be an awesome addition
---
Stonetalon mountains
---
You're right about tanks being needed more as time passes but it has no correlation to the last expansions of wow. It's not that easy in classic to just keep 3 different sets and bag full of epics like in retail and respeccing costs get brutal after a few. Some people get so geared as tanks they hardly ever respec anymore and even grind as prot. You have a lot less flexibility. 
---
The reason more tanks will be needed is simply because tanks get geared very fast due to progression and they start not doing any of the previous dungeons etc. So they simply start raid logging and fucking about with other content like farming or leveling alts or whatever. 
---
Comparing last 3 expansions of wow and classic is like saying you're an apple expert cause you've tasted all kinds of banana.
---
Where is the problem with adding stuff that worked nicely?
---
Does it really? For example, the FP coverage of EK for Horde is atrocious, while Alliance FP density in Kalimdor (a "foreign" continent for them) is pretty great.
---
Yes, but vanish is a waste of time. Sprint towards the tank.
---
Horde has a teleporter to gnome we have to walk to sfk and Scarlett
---
Check this out, very very useful: https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
I'm not trying to brag, I would really want a addon like this. Say you are searching for Jed in UBRS and you just came from doing 2 scholo runs. People are usually not keeping track of situations like that. My runs take about 8 minutes so I deliberately have to wait. i thought it was fine after I waited for +1 hour to pass.
---
people have pointed out the exact opposite of that though?
---
Because i can open them all and if you dont ask for a tip people usually tip decently.
---
Very entartaining to read! Congrats!
---
Lok'thar ogar father,
---
It's been about 3 weeks now since I finished my training at the Valley of Trials, and left home to become an adventurer. I have to tell you all its been a wild ride! The experiences I've had have really been something special.
---
My first adventure has been in Razor Hill. It's a small town in a scorched desert land, though there were plenty of jobs for an aspiring shaman such as myself. After talking to a seasoned warrior I was tasked with scouting the Skull Rock cave. Father, do you remember when Uncle Kor'tak used to mine copper and gold there when I was a kid? Well, now it's home to a group of nasty Burning Blade cultists, apparently they've been in control of the cave for some time now. After reporting what I discovered the locals placed a bounty on the cultists and boy did I collect! I brought back the cultists' searing collars as proof of my victory. Boy were they bloodthirsty!
---
One of the most excruciating tasks I've gotten to do is help a mother find her lost son. It started with me just killing crocodiles off the shore of the Southfury River and eventually culminated with me finding the boy's medallion in the belly of one of the crocs. I tell you what, mother would've been in tears... It was like something out of those Lordaeron horror stories you hate so much.
---
In terms of room and board, the lone scapes of the vast deset has been letting me have a shelter here and there to rest under the starry sky. The desert is a rough place, the rocks are comfortable enough, though at night and on the weekends the boars can get a bit.... how do I word this "excited" but they are all harmless.
---
As I write this I'm actually about to make my way down to the Tiragarde Keep . Apparently there is an issue with some Kul' Tiras Marines as well as a lieutenant called Benedict that is causing serious issues. It should be an grim adventure and I will write you all as soon as I can!
---
Strength and Honor,
---
Sol'zad
---
P.S. Tell Grandfather that his old mace really came in handy when I took on those cultists! Also, thank Grandmother for the warrior spirit she gave me, it saved me from ambush many a night.
---
I remember buying an account from a broke at a lan back in the day that had  lvl 41 warlock on it. 
---
I paid 200nok witch translates to about  22,36 US-dollar in current exchange rate.
---
why did you tell em to get fucked?
---
Thank you üëç
---
Really cool tbh, its not easy to do this kinda thing solo. And I like the attention to detail.
---
If I see a low level alliance with a mob, I'll run up and frostbolt it down for them and /wave. Most are so suprised they /wave back and jump up and down in thanks. And that's when, BAM FIREBALL ONE HIT KO BITCH WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS!!!!
---
if your not going to name the character or guild what is the point of the post?
---
whatever happened to the good old days of name and shame, being accountable for your actions. now you cant name them because...? you'll hurt their feelings??
---
What he's saying was always wrong tho, even before the blue post, but it's been thrown around as fact.
---
Being at war with someone doesn't make you "The bad guys"
---
It makes you evil for them, sure
---
It is possible to have arguments for both sides being right/wrong
---
Alliance is super racist, sure there was a time where orcs were these blood thirsty demons but not anymore.
---
They had enslaved the descendants of those orcs, who did nothing wrong
---
They literally dislike the forsaken because "Fuck you, you're undead", when many of then didn't even had a choice to become or not become undead
---
The taurens were caught in battles that they could not win, orcs helped them. Taurens decided "You helped me, i'll help you"
---
Alliance: Well fuck those cows, they're buddies with the orcs
---
That narrative doesn't work when the Horde leaders commits war crimes such as the usage of nukes of pretty much mustard gas on steroids
---
Any weapons like this that can change?

That's the theory, but if you use judgment often you'll run out of mana every 3 mobs, also you only get hammer of wrath at 44, I couldn't wait that long, I was already super bored by level 28.
---
I challenge myself to reach 60 with def/arms. actually pretty ok, love the sound of blocking shield.
---
No way this happend
---
I find just getting a good efficient dungeon group do be a great farming source. Emty your bag before you enter and you will get lots of cloth, greens and grays. If your doing high level dungeons you will also get gear as you will need it.

---
The only specific talent that prot has for increasing threat is Defiance which increases threat generated by 15%. They gain additional threat by proxy of increased rage generation from blocking, improved bloodrage rage generation, cheaper sunders, and just having access to taunt 2 seconds more often. And, of course, Shield Slam as an amazing ability. Also, revenge causing a stun is pretty great as well. But that is separate from threat generation.
---
None of the prot talents help with AoE threat since defiance only applies to attacks as well.
---
You have most of the info on the mallet now. You don't need a quest to get the mallet, as killing Qiaga the Keeper drops the mallet, and the mallet starts the quest to upgrade it into the Mallet of Zul Farrak.
---
You don't need the mallet to complete the dungeon, however SOMEONE needs the mallet to summon Gahzrilla; there is a quest you can get for Gahzrilla which rewards Carrot on a Stick (a trinket which increases your mount speed).
---
When you get your Carrot, keep it forever. Don't vendor your Carrot.
---
If you're looking up this quest chain and thinking "how the hell was anyone supposed to know how to do this?" some NPCs say "The trolls of Zul Farrak know the secret of calling Gahzrilla", and then when you run Zul Farrak, there's a trash item that the trolls drop called "Ancient Tablet". If you read the Ancient Tablet, it gives you full, step by step instructions on how to make the mallet.
---
Alright, fair enough. Do some Google to confirm the lockout time and just try to keep a timer on your runs, take some breaks to brew coffee / stretch inbetween if it looks like you're approaching the lockout timer. Or log a bank alt for some time and flip some items / level up a Hunter bank alt to 20 for Aspect for saving time running between AH and mail box, getting Enchanting in the process to DE stuff.
---
'merika
---
UD Shadow Priest is my personal favorite, but I also play on a PVP server, so Devouring plague, SW:P and Mindflay is a nasty combo.  The additional healing DP gives plus damage makes it a nasty debuff in 1v1 or 1v2.  Plus, touch of weakness adds stacks of weaving plus a nice curse debuff.  WOTF, and undying breathe I like for longer time underwater.  I've killed a few by just MCing them underwater and keeping them down there with me.
---
Not to be that guy but I dualbox a shaman and a warrior and run two-handed on both, I solo instances more or less at current level (library at 36, armory at 40 and cathedral at 42) because fighting for quest drops/items/spawns for two characters is simply hell on one of the higher populated servers.
---
What I mean to get is that if I manage to kill Mograine and Fairbanks whilst two-handing on a warrior, with an enhancement shaman healing, and not having the luxury of an additional 3 DPS burning down the boss and still manage it there really shouldn't be a case where in a full group the warrior using a 2-handed makes or breaks it.
---
At 60 if you kill stuff 1 by 1 it's not worth using anything other than shadowbolt. Dots are only good for multiple targets and pvp
---
They aren't BiS for hunters though, so maybe learn your class and "gitgud" yourself.
---
Is it good? I'm going with Hurricane and IArcaneShot. Level 46 atm.
---
Blizzard lost a lot popularity because of that.
---
Hord players on EN/US are the "special" units
---
Didn't say it was my g, but spending 10 hours a day for two days inside the one dungeon is just a grim prospect. I'm going to be spending 20 hours in mara to get my mount, just not over two days!
---
Yeah, brotha. It's actually specific utility each dps has that makes you situationally favorable to party with. This is an MMO game after all, easier played when you try to get along with people.
---
I've never played runescape but I doubt the situations are similar.  If runescape had its version of tbc that was beloved by a majority of the osrs players there's no way it wouldn't have been released
---
Some black on it would've made it a lot better instead of that ugly purple. We were after all in a raid about the black dragonflight.
---
On Noggenfogger too, the community is indeed pretty ‚Äòunique‚Äô. Don‚Äôt have an idea of the alliance/horde ratio though, one site said it was more horde and another one said it was more alliance.
---
I think this one. Not sure

So, I played horde in vanilla, and just to be upfront, how it was back in the day, if you could heal, chances were you were healing in a raid, and in a lot of cases, guilds would gkick if you didn't want to heal anymore and do another spec.  There were some guilds that didn't care either way because they played for fun, but the guilds which were competitive and wanting to stay at the top, would want a specific spec, and may even tell you to change a part of your spec to suit their needs.  If not, cya.  
---
Raiding in Vanilla wasn't fun at times.  Sometimes you had some really shitty and mouthy raid leaders, and I wouldn't stick around for that shit.  Likewise, with the demanding people to do shit, it happens.  If you want to raid and get far with a group that is forming raids down to the talents and gear people have, you'll have to play by their rules, probably heal.  If you don't care about progress, there will be plenty of casual raiding guilds which probably won't care about your spec since they focus on the invididual, but it will definitely be harder if there isn't a high expectation for cooperation.  Likewise, I don't think you should be forced into healing if you don't want to.
---
Yeah i saw that one Drops in my Last run.
---
Yeah though I've noticed not many keep it fair. It's always a game of numbers when it comes to ganking. Ganker should be 1 vs many, not many vs 1. No skill in 2 people killing someone at 50% health out of the blue.
---
They dont mind the extra cash being broadcasted into their wallets, we all know that's the real reason.
---
See? Horde is totally braindead. FOR THE ALLIANCE ü¶Å
---
Gotta love this sub and their hate for asmon. sheesh lmao
---
How is 56 ap, 1 crit, 25 agi better than 50 ap, 1 crit 30 agi?
---
I wonder if this will be the new thing to install on ATMs like Doom?
---
&gt;Tell me 40 dollars is way too much to spend on the Blizzard store for a brand new account and all the expansions.
---
You're a bit out of date. The most you need to buy is subscription + latest expansion, and that's only if you want to play BFA. If all you want is Classic, it's subcription only, no extra purchases needed.
---
So wanna tell me and others how to play a videogame? Because we are not going to follow the advices literally nobody asked for lol.
---
Clean your tears after losing rolls bruh
---
If you can somehow kill yourself right in front of the gate of Searing Gorge, you can get inside.
---
As a warlock, you can just spam hellfire until you die, then spirit rezz in thorium point and take the FP.
---
I am not discounting your pain, and I do feel it.
---
However, Battle Shout is your best friend for AoE threat, just go absolute ham on it, especially if you're disarmed.
---
As for the fucking spiders in Strat UD that net you for 6 seconds with the lovely tidbit of silencing you as well however, that's just bending over and taking it at that point.
---
I'm so torn between just having fun and grinding out some damn gold. Just like IRL, more gold makes it easier to have more fun. Time for me to lvl my mage and grind some gold.
---
tell that to a shadow priest that is taken to raids just for shadow weaving, 1 spot in 40, yup thats it. thats not an issue of penismeter, its an issue of clearing content.   
---
if you want new content like you say, for example new raid, a new tier set will come out, and it will bring class balance anyways with it, so yeah ignorance is a bliss.
---
Not so sure about that. When the difference between increasing your playerbase by 30% and decreasing it by 30% is $18,000,000 per month, you can afford to make some new content. And it seems like the vast majority of people would rather see Classic+ than just a re-release of BC.
---
I'll allow it if it's filled with Moonkins.
---
I'm not crying you're crying!
---
It's literally a parody of a famous meme
---
I'm not sure. But I've run Deadmines three times and had it drop twice.
---
People do sound it out because it's fun to say, but it's also meant to resemble a face. The U are closed eyes, the W is a mouth.
---
Depends on your tank though. I‚Äôve had quite a few tanks that say exactly that but drop to 50% before I even get 2 ticks of the drink. People are sometimes just impatient
---
You are entitled to demand payment for your services. But nobody is forced to use your services. Supply and Demand, if someone else does it cheaper/for free the are also entitled to do that and customers go to them.
---
Simple as that.
---
Not even go into the tank repair bill discussion with a rogue who probably only uses vanish if its a wipe
---
I tried leveling with two friends where we were 2 warlocks and a priest (don't ask why). While getting gear was a PITA, the leveling experience was hilarious as we could plow through everything end NEVER stop moving.
---
Hardiness gives you a massive stun resist as an orc. It's a much more powerful tool than occasional fear breaks.
---
Hunter seems to be the clear choice. If you don‚Äôt act like a tard and you are willing to improve, nobody will have a problem with you.
---
Also Druids and Enh Shamans are just as stigmatized as Huntards are.
---
Haha these people should be pointed and laughed at
---
You will be the living nightmare of both those classes at endgame. Once we have pvp gear and some endgame raids the shadow priest scaling goes over the roof and you will literally poop on both those classes while throwing emotes and sipping a drink in rl. 
---
I can't convince you on fun factor as I think both mage and rogue are way more fun in PvP BUT as far as effectiveness... Shadow priests only get better and better as content evolves and gear becomes abundant. Trust me on that.
---
You can get there from the water?
---
thanks for the helpful answer buddy
---
On my server, skins up to thick leather (not including) basically go for vendor price on the AH. You should check the prices on your server. I don't have herb so I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure everything past silver leaf/peacebloom is better on the AH than vendor.
---
ALL THE POSTS? Lol  r/exaggeratedandgeneralise
---
&gt;well, in the barrens, it means he was attacked first, most likely, so he just returned fire.
---
Or he just likes to runa round in PvP. Or he accidentially attacked an NPC (there is an alliance NPC group roaming around that area).
---
depending on if you want to be more DPS or more tanky, a tauren has some nice beefy bonus HP.
---
How come 45 days ?
---
what was the goal?
---
And the anti-fear ability is nice while tanking.
---
There are some really bad DPS out there. My recommendation is to start your own groups so you are the leader. Communicate with them. Use markers (bind them to a key).
---
My worst groups have been the ones I joined last minute to help people out instead of putting together myself. Note who are the good healers and DPS and befriend them. 
---
Tanks are rare at the end of the game because it requires effort to be one. I think bad groups are the death of more tanks than anything else. I've had to stop tanking for a couple of days after some bad groups, but I always come back to it.
---
Blood fury!?
---
You must hate your bloody healers mate
---
Because that's what community is about. Help eachother if you can
---
God bless the sacrifice of the mighty warrior!!!
---
druids minimum gear is lower than warriors makes them the better tank at the start come fully gear and ready for BWL it is about equal but then warriors pull ahead so for AQ warriors are better and in naxx to some extent you should really be using exlusivly warrior tanks.
---
it just comes down to crushing blows becoming to big of an issue.
---
My orc shaman is on level 52 right now. Some friends rushed to 60, some are behind me. I'm just enjoying the adventure with questing, socializing, some dungeons, helping friends with difficult quests.
---
The community is awesome, i just can't do anything else in my freetime at the moment - haven't cleaned my flat for 2 weeks, something i definately have to do today lol.
---
I'm going with herbalism and skinning, dropping skinning at 60 for that sweet engineering. Weird combo yes, but i wanna provide the mats for my raid consumables myself as I am a consumable junk, and leveling engineering up with the money thats left from selling herbs.
---
I'm having a blast man. Wish time would stand still outside for a while.
---
Lmfao honestly that's hilarious, you should be happy that happened to you. You Dodged a serious bullet my friend. Hey at least you have a hilarious story to tell people. The level of stupidity on that guild's behalf is staggering. Enjoy your experience without that garbage toxicity
---
That was amazing dude. Ty.
---
Please post more adventures
---
Indeed. Beautifully written, quite compelling. Glad you were able to help out your priest friend, and on behalf of the Alliance, I apologize.
---
&gt;How are you calling him out? Rofl
---
His whole demonstration is turned around the fact that "EA is a cast but doesn't matter", while it does, i won't answer to a whole post based on this single sentence while i judge it wrong.
---
come any closer and you'll be bread
---
Yeah endgame dungeons might be harder when your not even max level and in shit gear
---
Almost all PvP servers have more Horde.
---
Well played and well written.
---
Trolls are prob the best for tanking, Orcs the best for PVP and PVE damage. Undead have will of the forsaken in pvp which is kinda handy but hardiness is better.
---
Can I not dislike more than 1 thing? And I wouldn't say I hate him that would imply I go out of my way to cause him grief I just dislike the way he is on streams, some of his guides are really good but he is completly different on streams when playing up to the Muppets that follow him like a cult
---
A whole second? Lucky you. Last ZF run, on multiple occasions I saw a mind blast land on a target while I was mid-charge. And of course, by the time I've saved that idiot, the rogue is tanking one and the warlock has decided to fear the one on him in the middle of an uncleared room. 
---
That was trash pull #3.
---
Doesn't matter, got Big Bad Pauldrons.
---
Ok I knew this was fake when you said the warrior had his epic mount

Pretty sure Leatrix plus can do that for you

I think many people are now hitting the level-range of Un'Goro? I saw 3 posts about this quest chain now.
---
No, I remember how much it sucked to die and run back, so if I see a corpse I'll invest the mana in making that person's day a little easier.
---
You are very lucky that they kicked you from that guild.
---
This is a typical guild organized by people who have no idea that the world does not revole around them.
---
I hope that you have not invested a lot of mats and stuff in that guild.
---
You did not post server and guild name so I have no doubt that what you posted is true. (Would not have been conviced if you denunciated them with full name!)
---
Where should i go at 152 fishing to level it up?
---
What's your btag so I can forever blacklist you?
---
Ct bottom bar....
---
If you're training mobs onto someone else's quest NPC, that does count as griefing &amp; is punishable.
---
Stick to ganking players.
---
Worst part is that they most likely ganked you because they themselves got ganked while doing it.
---
It's a permanent viscous cycle.
---
I got that shield w thorium shield spike but what do you farm with it? WPL is too tough
---
SL spec in PvP is godmode but okay...

Yeah the people on my faction that say "just roll pve"

Gank somone within 5 lvls of you cowards i would never gank somone so low lvl.

It only seems like that because every person who has a problem with classic is like hurr durr we can put this change in classic +.  The tbc crowd already knows what's coming no reason to talk about it.  If the majority wanted classic+ we wouldn't have had no changes.  Tbc is happening

Yeah. Just jump

Thanks Josh. Also I had another thought.

As testing for practical population purposes for example, at 6:40 AM EST I used /who again to test for population in Durotar and Priests and Shamans level 26-28 (healers for BFD) and got:
---
Shamans level 26-28 on Stalagg: 5 ... Faerlina: 11
---
Priests level 26-28 on Stalagg: 7 ... Faerlina: 11
---
New characters level 1-4 in Durotar on Stalagg: 7 ... Faerlina: 14
---
\_\_ Basically Faerlina seems to have about DOUBLE the active population of Stalagg available to play with. This holds up for any level range or whatnot I seem to check. You can't just /who 60 or you'll get 50 maxxed out each time. But when checking specific levels you can get numbers.
---
Like I said Faerlina is full more often. But Stalagg also can be full and seems like it should be at least somewhat close as a 2nd. But it just seems dead AF and it seems like the only option to have people to play with is to play on Faerlina (and deal with massive queues sometimes)
---
I really think this is being done wrong and they need to let more people on a server before it locks people out in a queue.
---
Play whichever class feels most fun to you... all of the classes are usefull in the endgame

In a world where you're looking to farm dalrends, which are tiny negligible amount better, against every melee in the game while peacemaker drops regularily without contest.

He obviously means a druid tank.
---
You don't play female at all since it's weird as fuck
---
Both are strong. Rogues have a bit more advent age in world pvp especially early on. Locks level 10 times easier than rogues. Locks are much more needed in raids and dungeons. Locks are insanely powerful in pvp late game. Free mount for locks... If you love rogue, go rogue. But a lot of good things going on for locks but you have to be patient with it.

Good story. I could feel your frustration. Some people are just too downs with the sickness to play with others.

Especially since it's a really fun and rewarding dungeon.

Don't even need distract. I did this as a feral druid and snuck out alive after

You never said anything about his success.  You said he wasn't entertaining.  He's entertaining tens of thousands of people who throw money at him relentlessly every day.  Is it deserved? That's not really for us to decide, we're not his fans.

---
Well, maybe he likes the feeling of beeing needed.
---
OP class player spotted ^
---
A lot of us would have hoped that our original classes in vanilla would have been more viable. And that most certainly would have been the case if they continued patching like they did. 
---
Many more specs were poor before they got patched into better shape, and the game got better for it. Idling on 1.12 is a private server baby's mantra.
---
Feeling regret already? Better re roll now bro it'l save you time in the future.
---
Who says I'm a pve player? I'm just a lowly quester not ready for the world of PvP ;)
---
I honestly never saw that wow 2 would be a good idea until I experienced classic. I think it's too late for retail to change ... they have moved far away from what it was. Today I think it would be best to make a new wow with the classic bases where everything has a purpose, where immersion is everything.
---
You keep ignoring the fact that +15AGI isn't in this phase.
---
Bartender 4 is great, a lot of customization and you can hide the griffons, hide the background of the blizzard bar and even change the griffons to lions.

What an ironic thing to say

**FOR THE HORDE!**

And then realize you'll never get raid gear because there's 20 other mages rolling against you.
---
The ol joke excuse.. coward
---
Thanks. So seems like you‚Äôre grinding when you are quite high level and when you have decent gear
---
Because JoL doesn't return mana...
---
its not like we ignore them on purpose, the silentmode on the phone just doesn't work well with headphones on.
---
not our fault
---
It never procs tho, kind of shit trinket
---
&gt; and you just wanna get on with questing 
---
That's not about respect, it's about not wasting your own time on pvp if that is not your goal.
---
If that is all you want, then Gryphons remover will do it.
---
Also icy-veins (not sure if they have a classic section)
---
You‚Äôve clearly never gone in there with anything but a warrior tank and people who suck at using skills to stop runners.
---
The only worrisome pull is if you don‚Äôt clear rooms before the fearing boss.
---
This may be a silly question, but I hope I can get some kind of answer: what is the most fun/rewarding class to play on a PvE/Noral server? (for someone that loves PvP servers).    
---
Let me explain: a close friend of mine is playing on a PvE server (havign 3 kids makes it hard for him to play on a pvp server, he says. He has never been an open pvp kind of guy to be honest.) I tried playing with him but I feel no drive to continue there, since for me WoW Vanilla was greatly about the world pvp, the conflicts, the tension of questing with the enemy faction closeby. Fights reaching an instance entrance, contending a boss and just general wild ganking or getting ganked are some of my most fond memoris from the early WoW days. So, while I tried to play with him on the NORMAL server, I also rolled an alt on a PVP one and I've ended playing mostly the one on the pvp server. I was wondering if  maybe there is a class more rewarding to play on a PvE server, that will give me a drive to keep going while waiting for phase 3 to get some BG's to quence my need for PvP. I am open to do any role, even tho in vanilla I used to do only DPS. If you had an experience close to mine and found a solution I am open for suggestions. If I find no way I will just stick to the PvP server and, oh well, it will do.
---
Yeah, everyone is ganking left, right and centre. I think what got me so butt hurt is the fact I just spent 15 minutes barely surviving this escort quest solo and seeing the finishing line, dying and getting the failed quest sound, cut real deep.
---
SHADOW TRANNCCEEE
---
I think this legally qualifies as dead
---
Another care bear enters the conversation.
---
As an old school prot warrior, I feel your frustration. I now only make my own groups and I go against "meta" completely... There are more knuckle dragging warriors now than ever to be avoided! Personally I like a group with 5 different classes. What I don't get is how these aoe / cleave groups can stand the loot competition!?! Good luck to you in the future, my parting advice is build a friends list and group with them, if you're a decent healer that shouldn't be an issue.
---
I don't believe it's a bug.
---
Blizzard said they were going to do something about the LFG addon, it's possible they're now restricting the API they think could be abused for stuff that shouldn't belong to Classic.
---
It's inevitable that by doing tat they may impact other addons that don't do anything wrong.
---
Que for the "GET PVPED ON PVP REALM AND MOAN" comments lmao.
---
Its scumbag movements to do that stuff imo
---
Then it's up to you to yell at him for us.
---
Its just annoying i dont like hateful cowards who hide behind computer screens. If this was real life I'd beat you up for being such a little bitch. But meh i have my flaws but atleast im not a miserable pussy
---
For real, what a neeeeerd.
---
It's actually a DOUBLE reference, two in one.
---
It's also referencing to the ape Amy from the movie Congo who is able to communicate with hand gestures. Blizzard smartsies.
---
&gt;Do you have any kind of numbers on that
---
Well the upvote ratio on this thread is pretty decent even though it's basically spam at this point and the 500th thread on the same topic with no new ideas whatsoever.
---
Another stupid post
---
I think it's possible but you only have two DoTs and the time taken to kill is going to be that much lower you're better off looking to other places to farm. That's what I understand anyway.
---
why u heff to be mad
---
Eng game pvp is my goal, but pvp with no honor system on unfair fights doesn't bring me much joy.
---
I love the class, people are way more likely to group with you if you can off heal if someone is gonna die, or ress etc. You almost never die (shields, healing and fears for the win) But i do think their damage iss pretty bad, if you full out burst they die quickly, but then your mana will vanish after 2 mobs. So you kinda pop some abilties on them, then wand them to death xD
---
I hope this is a joke
---
Elitism is the best part of being in a hardcore guild. Embrace it.
---
Is it viable to go back at lvl 50 to do the low level quests for this? Do you get less rep?
---
Well i mean innervate is on a 6 min cd if I dont remember wrong.
---
Yes, not maxed yet, currently at 286.
---
Maybe some new races like High Elves for the Alliance and Orges for the Horde?
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Oh, yes for sure. But healing aggro isn't really a issue most of the time for me. That can be postponed long enough with a thunderclap. Holding aggro against the dps on the other hand is not as easy. Which I think druids do better on pulls of 4+
---
Is it impossible to do it early 30s solo?
---
Okay, it's just a minor gripe.    
---
Why does the Everlook flightpoint for Alliance have to be all the way at the back outside? Or the bootybay Flightpoint be such a maze to reach? Not to mention horde actually has a flightpoint halfway up STV that doubles as zeppelin access. And a flightpoint in Swamp of Sorrows. The flightpaths in Feralas are at both ass-ends of the zone. Felwood, horde is halfway while Alliance all the way up fucking north. Thousand Needles doesn't even have an alliance flightpoint unless you count that shit Thalanaar one in Feralas. Desolace again has alliance crammed all the way up at the north edge of the zone.     
---
A lot of minor gripes... :P
---
Wowza what a good description.

It also happens to be 100% true.

Your care is much appreciated.

Silithus at level 17. Should be amusing

If it's gonna last me through several phases I don't see a reason to rush and get it done ASAP. Might as well chill on it and buy what you need when you've accumulated enough gold through just playing the game normally.

Enjoy ret outside of raids, in solo pve content and pvp, you will have fun no doubt about it. If people make fun of you for being ret, just ignore them, it's your game, your playtime. Your own fun should always take center stage over other peoples petty remarks and comments!
---
For raids though, most (probably all though) guilds will ask/demand you go holy and become a healbot, now this can be boring but it is dead easy, and it might be worth it for the gear, then once you have the gear (tier 2 &lt;3) you can go full ret or whatever spec you want to try in solo content and pvp and just leave the whole raid game behind. It is how I did it back in the day. Pvp is always way more fun and engaging than raid content, but raid content can be the easiest way to get op gear.
---
Link is the name of the elf looking main hero of the Zelda franchise. 
---
Zelda is the princess he saves.
---
The fact of the matter is both are good, stun resist for orcs is good, axe mastery for orcs is good, blood fury is shit though 50% heal reduction is crippling if you are losing. I'd say trolls make better ele shamans and orcs better enhance, but berserking with a 2h weapon and wind fury up is not to be underestimated. Play what you want and what you enjoy it's a video game, you will die in pvp at some point no matter what anyways, but if you are with other players (like BGs when they come out) you should be able to rely on your team to cover your weaknesses whatever they may be.

Yes, Wintersaber trainers faction. They are alliance only.
---
Imagine being the hunter that rolls up to a group or raid with both Dal'rends. 
---
Like just imagine it. Even if you pay people to farm them with you 24/7 you are going to be known as a greedy hunter asshole by like half the people that see you.
---
All of that for a half dps per second upgrade at best.
---
It's like a Thunderfury on a rogue. Sure it's BiS but I am never going to even try and get one on my rogue. I don't want the stigma. This isn't retail. You need these other people on your server.

I also got the frostsaber back in vanilla on my female gnome who - yes, had pink pigtails. Bad ass.
---
Currently 41 on my Ret, a few bars from 42 and progress has slowed to a snails pace. Questing is so much more stretched out that I spend most my time running between quest points instead of gaining
---
exp. I tried doing cath runs yesterday and after maybe 4 or 5 runs I had only gained about half a level. Is this the pace I can expect for the rest of my way to 60? Do things pick back up or, god forbid, get even slower? And what would you recommend for leveling? Continue questing, grind mobs in the world or dungeon grinding? I probably enjoy dungeons the most but the times that I play can make it really difficult to find groups.
---
*That name was already taken*
---
I'd recommend against mage if you you're looking for interesting combos, mage has a couple specific spells they just sort of cycle through when farming, it's not particularly engaging.
---
LOL. Those people sound like real weiners.

Sure. Im not saying that im average in that regard. Im just saying that all those characters that stopped logging in arent all retail tourists

I haven't played 'the modern game' in years. I'm just speaking from my leveling experience so far. Sure there's been PVP fights and all-out wars but in this situation, it was just very pretty. I'm talking about meters from finishing the escort, I'm at 50% hp, they just walk in, stand there for a few minutes watching me, then suddenly jump me. I dunno, it just made my blood boil. 
---
I agree it's all about being opposing factions and murdering each other on sight generally, but in some situations, I think it's fine to also turn a blind eye.
---
&gt;It's clearly a toxic environment if they are willing to gkick people for complete nonoffensive inaction.
---
It isn't clear because you haven't been provided a shred of evidence, and the fact that you want the guildname to act on absolutely baseless claims proves OP had the right idea by keeping the details to himself.

Can you rememeber / list the music used in this video?

You're  the one trying to act tough, claiming you will beat me if you met me. also not in the habit of giving out details on the internet, especially with children, they put you on a list for that.

Last night my brother irl and I grouped with 3 other questers while hunting and flipped the script on the same sort of camping at the outpost. We moved as a pack and at one point killed two ?? Priests and a 42 warrior with only 1 death from our group. Eventually most high level horde left and the horde players there to quest, unfortunately caught up in the massacre, switched layers or logged. 
---
I used to get mad about being ganked but now my attitude is just attack first instead of hoping for the best.
---
If the Kurzen camp is not completely overrun by other players, those humanoid mobs are probably a good starting point.
---
Are you dumb? im playing classic right now
---
Because plenty of people have proved themselves not worth interacting with again?
---
when he picks without rolling call him out in chat or kick him if you're lead
---
I definitely deleted the tools T_T thanks friend I'll have a look.
---
Continue shielding pre-pull if you need mana, so you can drink during the pull (for the 1% of groups where the tank knows what the fuck to do, the other 99% will continue to stare at you while you drink as if letting the mages get full mana before they even think about pulling will somehow solve their aggro issues).
---
Take flash heal off your bars.  Shield is your emergency heal.

Damn they got the NPC who respawns in like 10 minutes. Damn they won at wow. Time to delete
---
‚ÄúAnd now that you‚Äôre LF1M Tank‚Äù ...nicely done.
---
It's somewhat good for leveling as BM but outside of that it's not that good since you want a slow weapon to maximize aimshot, multishot and your melee weaving rotation
---
All the mages and hunters will look up and shout "Save Us!"
---
And I'll look down and whisper "no".
---
If he was getting honor for it, sure, but these kills have no honor. I feel there should be dishonorable kills too (there actually are but it's not active yet either)
---
Yes because that doesn‚Äôt happen anywhere else
---
Hold onto it and use it for Instance Bossing when you have Rapid Fire ready. The lower damage will not draw aggro as much, but the damage will still be comparable to other bows for you, plus, it makes DPS easy mode as you'd sit there and just auto and melt the boss...
---
You'd be a true Windrunner with the .7 attack speed.
---
Yes, you are literally the only person who has even considered doing that.
---
As a shaman/druid you will be forced to heal unless you make friends that allow you to play meme-speccs. With that in mind hunter seems like a safe pick as it is hands down the most efficient end-game farmer next to mage which wasn't in your list anyways. Further, between druid and shaman, druid suits your needs better.
---
Seen a few "LFM Tank + Heal for &lt;foo&gt; with &lt;blah&gt; reserved!"
---
Being able to dispell polymorph and mages iceblock is amazing as well
---
Thank you! Makes me feel much better.
---
This sub downvoted you because you‚Äôre calling out OP for saying people should ‚Äúdie in a fire‚Äù. Wow.
---
Trust me, a lot of us love a good ole fashion public ridiculing, but it is against reddit's TOS to instigate witch hunts.

You obviously never had events organized over halaa fights. We used to spend our whole weekends in there on my server !
---
Saurfang IS the Horde, you fool.
---
Thankfully for you, level resistance in PvP seems to be completely broken.

I am getting hit by nearly every spell by players 20-30 levels below me when I should have 99% resistance.

how come? There are plenty of logs with 23-25 ppl on ragnaros, people in blue-green items. Wouldn't say its a challenge.
---
Possible, but I think there is more overlap in Classic+ wishes than not, and not a lot of those wishes overlap with BC. For example, everyone either wants no level cap increase or a really slight increase (61/62 tops). Also everyone wants the old content to stay somewhat relevant, so no level 61 greens (*if* that happens) should be better or even close to level 60 epics. And new raid tiers shouldn't make the old ones completely obsolete. That's echoed by literally everyone who wants Classic+, and it unfortunately is exactly the opposite of BC. So even if there are going to be other contentious issues, nobody who wants these things would be very happy with BC.
---
Racist comments incoming
---
You played during BC. You never played classic till now. Now you want things added to it? Go cry mate.

This is the exact opposite. The addon doesn't whisper the addon user "GZ!" when the user dings, it gz's everyone else. It's an addon based solely on spreading joy, though it's quite hollow when it's automated. Also yes, these existed for retail as far back as WotLK as far as I remember.

It really changed in TBC because Ghostlands was so damn effectively setup that you were actually going slower by not going there (although it sucked as a shaman because SilMoon legit had no trainer there until Wrath).

It was actually me who deleted the categorically incorrect, as I was the first one to reply. I edited it because I didn't want to sound belligerent not because I think it's a difference of opinion. Having tools to break both stun and fear is clearly more effective than two fear breaks. Especially as stun is more of a hassle to deal with anyway.
---
As always, great episode Josh. I really appreciate your work. Please don't stop.
---
I mean look at his account name, hes clearly trolling.
---
It's not a good comparison. One is a side effect of playing normally (killing mobs in a raid), the other is an obvious exploit requiring extremely specific, repeated actions by players to benefit (layer hopping inside an instance).
---
Imagine choosing a hunter to multibox as in vanilla. That aimed shot x4 is going to hur...The target is too close!

---
You are dead fucking wrong and the prototypical example of the problem.
---
Well not everyone is you. I personally like the shitfest that unfair and uneven pvp is, even when I'm on the receiving end. It feels genuine. You don't need to feel the same, heck you can feel whatever you want, but don't go talking like being nice and reasonable in wpvp is the norm, it's not. Expect it to be a shitshow that it is and will always be, saves your nerves. Now I play Alliance but I expect you to ding 60 and go ham in Redridge/Duskwood. That's what you're supposed to do.
---
And also, don't do long escorts solo, it rarely is worth it in xp/hour. If you want to do it for the lore, then do it when you overlevel it by a bit to be safe. Take precautions against pvp everytime you venture out.
---
Does anyone know of an addon which disables and later reenables General Chat when passing through The Barrens?
---
You're not wrong, I'm just saying it makes a boring character
---
Nobody knows for sure if this is supposed to happen at some point.
---
I think it's like 20% of the rep
---
I would be so sad if this comment wasnt here...
---
1.3? Isn't that a bit early? A lot of things got easier over time in wow classic. Re-itemization and class overhauls to name a few, but they have to have one patch that fits all. Naxxramas was released in 1.11, it would be vastly overtuned with 1.3 itemizations and talents.
---
Granted, the consequence now is that earlier raids like MC and Onyxia are too easy, but it'll even out.
---
This just sounds like racism with extra steps.
---
And you can bet that they're all dicks. Every one of them.
---
You think they can but they cant.
---
I started late TBC and never got into raiding in both TBC and WotLK but I do think the state of the game as a whole was pretty good in those expansions. I hope they will re-release those as well after a good while, but for now I am thoroughly enjoying Classic and since we are only 3 weeks in I am not bothering with what they are gonna do after.
---
Also I don't get why you (and a lot of people)  threaten to quit already this soon. How does that contribute? Do you think anybody cares? Or if Blizzard cares? 
---
It's a business they are running and that means you can't just cater to everybody. As they are trying to make money what would be the most sensible way to go you think? Create new Classic+ content or just release expansions they've already made? The ROI will be way better on just releasing the expansions that require less manpower creating/writing because that has already been done.
---
While they will probably lose you as a customer, there will be plenty of people interested in that if Classic Content stagnates at some point. In the meantime why not enjoy the game?
---
It's not that hard. Toons stay in follow and you have key bindings to instruct your toons to follow your main should they ever get their follow broken.
---
Which makes it even more awful... why do people follow such retarded "acts"?
---
Dodged the bullet. Be happy you found out now they are pretty af rather than when a piece of gear you need drops in MC and it goes to the guild offer over you
---
I mean that's legit, why the fuck are you fire joining a spellcleave group?  Spellcleave is all about the imp blizzard and CoC.
---
You mean sunder clap right?
---
You should probably look into writing short stories and take it from there. Very compelling read and I can relate. Hopefully, there are more like you in Azeroth and IRL.

You can offset the crits by having 20k armor and a phat health pool. I've been researching it like crazy for my guild, and I honestly think they are better than warriors for progression raiding in phase 1. Once BWL drops they'll be behind until they can get the gear from there, but their phase 1 preraid bis is fucking nuts. Check out skarm's videos on it. Dude is a legend for us druid tanks.
---
Run Dm buddy the mail legs are the best choice on that quest. Get the axe or mace from DM and you'll be all good till 30
---
Not an expert on the subject but i would asume Youtube have some people that approve the ads before letting them on their site? Maybe im wrong.
---
&gt;but being able break free 2 in 2 times is better than 2 out of 8 times at random.
---
WotF is on a CD, hardiness isn't.
---
That's why I think DPS meters (at least while leveling) are the same type of cancer as gearscore/achievement linking is in current WoW expansions. If people want to circlejerk over their DPS they can, but I wouldn't want to be in their group anyways.
---
I suggest, marking targets in every group (you can easily bind Skull + X to hotkeys), so you know you should focus threat on Skull, and X is secondary. Doesn't hurt to tell your group "Foucs skull, then X". You can also tell them "Please wait a few sec before attacking them so I can build aggro". Most people listen and all is good.
---
Of course some people just don't know any better, and some don't care. In those cases I try to say it again, not passive aggressively, but simply a reminder. If they still do it, I see how the dungeon goes actually. yeah you might just be tanking with taunt at that point, and maybe one additional mob, since threat is all over the place, but if you are not in danger of wiping, it's not a big deal, let them have fun. I would talk about it again when it's really becoming dangerous or we're about to face a boss or something. 
---
If you wipe as a result of them not caring about aggro, then it's obvious to everyone what went wrong, since they got plenty of reminders and warning. So I would decide if I wanted to simply leave the group or give them another shot, since leaving here really doesn't hurt your reputation for getting invited into groups by actually decent people. Yeah, it sucks what they did, but it's INEVITABLE. There are so many people, it's always gonna happen at some point. I even have friends who aggro like crazy and even cause wipes sometimes. I understand it's their way of having fun, and it's fine, I know what I get myself into when I group with them for a dungeon, so I only do it when I feel like I wanna have that experience :)
---
P.S. Please don't come into a dungeon with a prejudice against your hunters/rogue/etc. whom you've never played with before just because of something somebody else did on the same class. You wouldn't want to be judged on the behavior of other tanks they've played with.
---
Do you even actually use other people's talking points in debate or just repeat one talking point?  Sorry to call you out like that, but I've made points you refuse to address and it's really irritating.
---
You don't want to grind dungeons all the way. It works decently well from 30 with SM+ZF+BRD if you go for an aoe comp, but until then the dungeons are very inefficient compared to questing.
---
Why would there not be? It's not like I run out of mana just by writi
---
Seconded, wtf?
---
This 1,000%
---
&gt; it is totally anti-classic and totally not a classic experience.
---
Lol.
---
guys I forund the hunter
---
Really doesn't, your type show up too much.
---
What's that slimy zombie doing in our beautiful green fields?
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
Vanish drops all aggro. If something is sapped when we Vanish, they remain sapped until they take damage or the duration wears off. 
---
One thing to note though. It's more difficult to be stealthed around mobs that are a higher level than you. They have a higher chance of seeing you and breaking your stealth.
---
I play dwarf. They get the unique racial spell Fear ward which can come in handy, but I didn't really consider that when starting out and just picked dwarf because I like how they look and sound.  
---
There are not many skills you can pass up on, just 1 big one. After getting a wand, you can stop buying ranks of Smite. There are a few skills that aren't required for playing effectively like Mana Burn, Mind Vision and Mind Soothe but I recommend buying these anyway because they're fun and when you do make good use of them you feel like a genius.  
---
For the majority of leveling, your rotation for killing mobs by yourself will be: Pull with Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; PW:S yourself &gt; Wand till they're dead &gt; Repeat. You can keep this up without mana/hp breaks with any spec as long as you have wand spec and spirit tap and you kill mobs of equal or lower lvl than yourself. It's quite efficient if a little boring. Once you get Mind Control, you can solo a lot of elite quests with clever use of the skill.  
---
However, you're always going to be more effective in a group and even if you spec full shadow you're gonna be most effective as a healer. Most important thing about healing is to keep yourself safe. You draw a lot of attention from mobs with your fat heals so make sure you use your Fade skill when you draw aggro and if that's not enough Desperate Prayer + PW:S on yourself. Don't Psychic Scream because the mobs will run everywhere and pull more mobs. You also want to get a feel for the 5 second mana regen rule and play around it as much as you can. Heal in bursts to top everyone off, then wand while letting your mana regen a bit before you need to cast more spells (ideally you get a killing blow on trash mobs mid combat to activate spirit tap). There's more but the advanced stuff will explain itself as you go. Enjoy the ride!
---
I did it recently... 12 minutes if I remember correctly.

Good opportunity to grab a drink, go to the bathroom, etc

Nice cherry pick there, I also said you can resist stuns 8 times in a row. Like the next sentence.

+15 agi, the enchant that isn't in the game? Is that the enchant you're referring to?
---
for a female the choice is easy ....
---
Unless we switch Weapons or get a random Disarm or just leveled, yea I'd say our skill is full.  Sometimes our ranged falls behind as well.  I would fully agree that any melee class would have skills leveled more than a dedicated caster typically except maybe wands.
---
Oh sick, didn't realise the anime had adapted that far up. I should catch up.
---
Why don't resub then?
---
People suck everywhere. Yesterday I was randomly messaged by someone 20+ levels higher than me on a different continent wanting me to join their guild, how I can get free enchants and raid slots (I‚Äôm lvl 31), etc. 
---
I‚Äôm not currently in a guild because the old one merged while I was away and none of the officers were on at the time. I kindly responded to the guy ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù, and he immediately replied ‚Äúfuck you then‚Äù and blocked me. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
You have to kill a level 50 ish troll in hinterlands and then go to the top of the elite area and use it at the altar.  It's pretty hard to do this unless you're already near to 50 and/or have a 5 man grp and/or are ok with corpserunning through elites to save time.
---
Most likely does have a 'real job'. It's also quite likely it's better than yours.
---
Yes you'll be laughed at by jerks. Ret won't top the meters but as a spellret you can do decently. Find a casual guild who will take you .
---
Not everyone is a private server tryhard.
---
34 tauren shaman on smolderweb checking in.
---
Im getting flashbacks of all the weird runs ive done.
---
Every frost build needs 5/5 frostbolt lol.
---
Its one of the best pre-raid offhands what I've gathered for damage/healing. For pure +heal, there's a better one of Emp in BRD.
---
Too late, unfortunately. I spoke with all of my friends and my guild on Thalnos Alliance side and no one wants to move. They are perfectly happy with the alliance/horde ratio on the realm and don't want to risk going to another that could end up being massively horde dominated.
---
Like what?
---
I want patch 1.2 balance, let's just face it, patch 1.12 already destroyed all class balance and ruined unique feels of different classes. Like for examples mages do good dps now and have a tons of slows and CC, unbalanced as hell.
---
What were the old stats?
---
Rouges smh.
---
Is level 18 too high to run RFC and complete the quests? Would my time be better served skipping it and running WC at this point?
---
Take the transfer.   Earthfury is nice and pretty balanced
---
It's not even a quest!  You kinda just have to know how to do it.  She drops the item and you use it at the altar, it probably alludes to this in the quest text for ghazrilla but those steps aren't actually quest steps at all.
---
Combined with a good mainhand, im pretty sure the overall higher +dmg is better than the stam.
---
I'm on Sulfuras, and I don't remember exact numbers I've seen on player surveys, but they're pretty similar to that.
---
Just fyi Orcs can easily get 45% stun resist with talents. 5% from default resist 25% from hardiness and 15% from talent. It's really not that random to resist anymore at that point lmao. I'll take that any day compared to a fear break that that warriors already got in their toolkit.
---
&gt;et must be getting an awful lot of buffs now, seeing as you're level 52 and learning about this now
---
First time playing wow ;) figured out pets can learn ability at like level 32 or so ;)
---
the offhand is for those lonely cold nights...
---
I didn't realize the Timbermaw Rep items were locked behind P3.
---
Not if the group is setting up more CC, like a polymorph.
---
&gt; and the mallet starts the quest to upgrade it into the Mallet of Zul Farrak
---
There's no quest, you just use the mallet at the altar.
---
No he *is* talking about finkles skinner haha
---
I'm more concerned about the difficulty of low level dungeons and xp gain.
---
Oh man there was a song by them I loved years  ago that was used in a Prince kill video from TBC. Have spent the last 3 weeks painfully trying to remember the band name. Thank you so much boss!
---
Except that +15 Agi is not out until Phase 3, when Dal'rend is no longer pre-raid BiS, you have to be trolling at this point yeah?
---
Let's say it was pre-raid BiS in phase 3, you're arguing that it's fine because it'll be relevant for them in 6 months.
---
Fishing has worked since day 1 idk what you're on about.
---
Thanks for the in-depth response!
---
I played a lackluster paladin in vanilla WoW up to BWL and I feel like even then I would have definitely agreed with you when it comes to Consecration and Holy Shock. I saw them everywhere, but I felt like I was taking crazy pills and didn't understand the popularity. I never fully questioned it, I just assumed others knew something I didn't. Lasting Judgement sounds like a good addition as well, always been a fan of the enemies doing the healing for me.
---
I'll definitely try these recommendations when I hit 60. 
---
Thanks again.
---
Well, I unfortunately it's too late. The beast has been let out of the cage. Good or bad, all Alliance must die.
---
Pretty sure people on Whitemane have cleared Rag.
---
Nah me and a warrior friend, who funnily enough I was helping try get his whirlwind. Got bored of that grind and decided we would go look for some PVP. We also decided if we come across any lone horde we would take it in turns who fights in a 1v1 and the other would wait to see who wins. People always forget there literally is no difference to what the other faction experience in pvp. The same shit happens, people get ganked, people get 4v1nd etc. Dont feel so hard done by from a particular faction because it happens to both sides.
---
fresh pasta?
---
You misspelled ‚ÄúLiterally every drop‚Äù.
---
Sick, congrats.
---
&gt;sadly for orcs there are few good tanking axes.
---
there are also few good dps axes endgame.
---
the owlkin and the elf quest u mention in hinterlands were both kill quests, why not grp up? I did both as a 2-5 man grp with randos and it certainly didnt take hours. Same with the troll quests
---
Why does it matter that it's not in the game? Does this mean that once it's added all hunters suddently get rends?
---
It's useless for a pure AoE build.
---
A guildie got me the axe at 30.  It makes me giggle all the time
---
No, and it induces 30 sec cd outside combat if u swap
---
Hmmmm depends on where they're from, if American this was posted in the very early hours of the morning. If European they wrote this around late breakfast time. Neither implies this person has any commitments this Thursday.
---
It sucks to be you.
---
It helps in that you don't fucking die tanking a dungeon boss 3-4 levels above you and can actually let your healer focus on the adds. Try running ZF as Arms MT when you're at the entry level 43/44. The difference in not just aggro retention but in survivability is incredible.
---
I tend to play nice my self (Ally) and for once we agree on there is no honor in that....
---
What a miserable human being lol
---
I shall do the same from now on.
---
Idk man, seems like everybody is crying about this all the time, while most servers are between 35-75 and 75-35 (there are some terrible ratios out there, but it does not seem to be your case).
---
Also, when you complain about fighting horde in contested zones, don't you realize that you also have less competition in alliance zones? I mean, it sure hurts to be ganked by the horde, but yesterday farming in Ashenvale we were almost more horde people than mob spawn points.
---
Spent 30min to try to farm 15 of one item in the zone. Went to sleep with 12/15. And no, I don't want to abuse layering.
---
Oh well then bring the phases.
---
Its going to be phenomenal
---
I respect your opinion, but I disagree. I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs any rush. If you rushed to the end of the game and are now bored, that‚Äôs your own fault
---
Lol leveling from 52 to 60 is the same as waiting for a later phase to be released by Blizzard?
---
Something something vanilla community
---
Bfa bad 
---
Vanilla gud
---
I'm not sure how much gold you have, but I wouldn't spend 50g on that. Just do some dungeons or just keep questing. Are you noticing a huge drop off in damage? WW axe can carry you pretty far.

---
1. As a Hunter a large component of your DPS comes from your Auto Shots, which is why Hunter rotations always weave Aimed Shot and Multi Shot inbetween Auto Shot. Faster bows means you're clipping more of your Auto Shots while charging an Aimed Shot, lowering total DPS.
---
2. Aimed Shot and Multi Shot damage bonuses are based on your Auto Shot damage. As such, high-speed low-damage weapons result in weaker Aimed and Multi Shots as compared to low-speed high-damage weapons.
---
3. You're consuming substantially more ammunition to do the same damage as a low-speed high-damage weapon.
---
The slower the weapon speed the better when it comes to ranged weapons. Ideally you want 3+ seconds, but those are rare.
---
And gotta run the whole.damn.thing because you can't lava skip to 7d :|
---
Says everyone except the guy who aoe farmed to the first level sixty
---
&gt; omething being BiS for classes right now and it being BiS for another in 6 months is not irrelevant lmao
---
It is completely irrelevant, if Rends got replaced outside of raid ever there might be a difference.
---
&gt;  And, is the HOJ warrior analogy the same thing?
---
It's exactly the same thing, you can't use it now, but it will be the best item you can get later and as such you're preparing for when you reach that point.
---
&gt; The warrior can still level up right now, as opposed to 6 months from now.
---
Sure, and HoJ can be farmed in a day easily where as dal'rends can take months, so it's the same thing, just on a different time scale.
---
Character moves means realm swap?
---
That's actually insane lmao
---
Nah 
---
keep p1 for a couple more months plz
---
I don't think getting a group for MC and BWL should be a huge problem as a Druid Melee DPS, especially if you find a guild where the general consensus isn't that everything has to be min/maxed. 
---
If/When progress starts to halt however I wouldn't be surprised if you would be expected to play as a healer instead. 
---
If you're into PvP you will probably also have a lot of fun as a Druid.
---
Going off of absolutely no data I would say 3 or 4 characters per account.
---
7,800,000/4 = 1.950,000 subs.
---
You can make everyone in the 10 man raid leave, reset, enter and spam /target jed for 1 minute (he patrols) standing in the first left corner up the first slope. Join the one's party that has Jed spawn in it. Reset again if noone found him. Be careful so noone get the "entered too many dungeons" by resetting to much.
---
Dreamfoil, Gromsblood, Sungrass (but not too much, this is dime a dozen), Icecaps are biggies, along with Black Lotus.  I got in many fights in WPVP farming.  
---
Alch, Elixirs mainly.  Though, some other pots sold well.  Free Action Pots, Swiftness, Invis pot, come to mind as popular, but some of the mats such as ghost mushrooms grew in very specific spots so you'd be limited on farming them... in addition to fighting whoever else is trying to pick them too.
---
This has happend to me twice already, anyone know anything about this? is it normal?
---
No chance you‚Äôre playing a warrior, rogue, or perhaps hunter, is there?
---
The problem with any such sheet is they are likely to be biased by the class preferences of the creator.
---
Full disclosure- my main is a druid, and the shit we catch in groups is amazing.  I close most loot windows rather than greed rolling just to keep the clutter free.  If I listened to everyone else, I shouldn‚Äôt roll on any gear since every other class ‚Äúneeds‚Äù it more.
---
If this was a part of some movie, this is a great plot.
---
Good for you
---
No, you're right, one requires effort the other happens automatically.
---
someone was trying to be nice and putting it for a cheap price for lowbies to be able to buy it and this guy buys and vendors them
---
Just feint or vanish
---
I replied to Aceabee, but the reply was also directed to you as well.
---
Would welcome this nice addition back into the game, I was saddened to see he wasn't there when I started up my tauren char.
---
So you‚Äôre saying Classic Sylvanas is still best girl?
---
Lol okay Sherlock Holmes, take your deductive reasoning somewhere people give a shit.
---
I agree with everything you've said other than the Reddit post part. This post has given me the newfound internal rage to ruin all Alliance I see. I'll be sure to kill them when they're at their weakest.
---
Can I heal dungeons comfortably while levelling as shadow spec? I wanted to go shadow because of world pvp but dungeon healing is pretty much my main appeal and I‚Äôd rather not make the experience less convenient for me than if I went for a disc/holy build.
---
even stuff i dont need but can pass as if i do need
---
I got athene, I still don't get asmongold
---
I had the same problem! You the man bro
---
Where would I type this?
---
That would make leveling horrible, honorable kills are for lvl 51's and up if you're 60 already.
---
Just wait and by p2 most people are lvl60, then u get fair matches. And fair matches is of course
---
what you want, right? ;)
---
I'm coming for you, Alliance trash.
---
Sure thing you fucking troll. Next time don't exaggerate by an order of magnitude and some people might believe you.
---
60 gets honor from killing 51
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBIS‚Äù or not, I‚Äôm just here for the conversation. However when you say ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs not BIS for you‚Äù that confuses me a bit.... Isn‚Äôt there only one item that is BiS at any given time per toon?
---
Want to be a priest healer so when I hit 60 I plan on going full healer build , but before that what build should I use for leveling and healing in dungeons? Dicipline and shadow or holy and displine?
---
I have the feeling that a lot of players are dedicated but don't have as many time as they used to. This way a lot of people ain't level 60 yet and still enjoy the world how it is now
---
You don't want to play with them. 
---
He did you a favor before you got too deep.
---
What else happens when you disconnect? Does any other services stop (voice chat for example)? If it is only WoW I would first try disableing all addons, and if you have no luck then try reinstalling the game.
---
He had 5/5 imp frostbolt
---
The patch we're on now doesn't have dual spec, does it? It's a full talent reroll?
---
fucking yes, can't stand the guy, be it real or an act
---
Close his chat and his stream is much more enjoyable to watch.  His chat is about as bad as xQcs
---
Sorry it took me 6 days to reply, but indeed CCC was (almost) exactly what I was looking for. I opened up weakauras and had the feeling I was in advanced astrofysics with all the options available. A guildy took pitty on me and help me find CCC, been loving it ever since
---
That guy had next to no competition for mobs, now you can barely find anything to kill
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Because of what? Don't talking about piss constantly? EN is also european.
---
Indeed it is. Random question, how do I add the class/faction thing to my name?
---
It's not tho, if it was, every X-Pac to retail would be a 'slam dunk' and you might as well just play that, why is there classic at all.
---
Asshole
---
Nice enchant
---
Pet has the same name as my Pet.
---
Ty for sharing. Ur a wordsmith. Enjoyed immensely.
---
Maybe he's moving from pserver to classic.
---
Honestly I would just cut the losses and move from Faerlina. That streamer culture looks like something I couldn't stand. You probably get the option to transfer to a different server when you have long queues right?
---
wrong.
---
I love when rogues try to pull that bullshit. I'm a warrior but have levelled BS pretty consistently as I leveled so I always have a few skeleton keys on me. If a rogue try to pull some shit like that I always kick if I'm the party leader or leave I'd I'm not. Maybe it's pretty, maybe I'm being a diva, but we're all working together to clear the instance and I refuse to condone that type of behaviour.
---
Its not. There is anything only one person called No and its not him. He is a dumbass imposter
---
Well... yes and no, its not the same gear depending on the talents/race youre playing but mainly yes should be 1 only
---
Illidan so little of column a / column b
---
Look at the replies I got, people give a shit haha.
---
Lol if they pushed Phases out to cater to the hardcore crowd we would be seeing Naxx by the end of the year. The vast majority of player are not 60 and have not started raiding yet. If you are bored than perhaps find another game to play in the meantime.
---
I found that Druids were in high demand on horde side since we don't have 2 plate classes, so feral druids fill a void, and if they have good gear, can heal too.
---
&gt; Mages don't Charge for Food and water.  
---
Some actually do. Just not in instances.
---
can you triple skin?
---
I'm not sure on the specifics, but gaming has evolved into min/maxing now. You don't have to follow that meta (I don't), but that's why cleaves exist. If it was harder people just find another way that wasn't around much back in vanilla to speed things up. This isn't just true with WoW either, many other games are about doing the most efficient now.
---
Also, I'm not sure exactly which patch it was, but I remember when I first started playing WoW flight path's didn't connect. Meaning you had to go from one point to another and jump back on the FP. If 1.3 is before that change, then HELL no I wouldn't want to go back to that. It was miserable.
---
60+25 is 85
---
50+30 is 80
---
So it's whether or not you think 5AP or 0.094% crit is better (It's the AP).
---
So yes, Barb is better. And do you see how this has devolved, you're talking about the literal best upgrade you can get for all Warriors and Rogues, making an enormous difference to their gear. And you're trying desparately to hang on to the only thing that could make it justifiable, that it's (((BiS))). 
---
You have an unequivocally better item in Phase 1 and then another weapon releases that becomes better in Phase 3, but you would still rather argue for the sake of it rather than not be a tool about it.
---
Reported for language.
---
And you clicked the ad. Then proceeded to post it here to give them even more exposure. Just report it to YouTube and forget about it.
---
Because there is a demand I guess. Sad but true.
---
Well your character does move when you realm swap
---
It do be like dat
---
so that's why i couldn't find any on the AH..
---
My server never had people waiting in line like others did. The unsaid ‚Äúwhoever tags it first‚Äù rule is definitely on my server. Damn Sarkoth.
---
BITCH WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK THIS IS
---
***#HowToAdvertiseInDisguiseOnReddit***
---
While certainly technically achievable, I unfortunately think that this is rather unlikely as you‚Äôre asking for basically zone redesigns. A lot of world areas in BC and WOTLK were basically designed with flying mounts in mind and asking to keep the world area while removing that aspect is basically asking for a brand new xpac. Think of all the bugs that would arise too for tiny missed details. No, I think you‚Äôre far more likely to just get as-is versions of the expansions with updated clients like classic.
---
August 8th 2019 is 2 days before your post.
---
Love them too. Then I realized how juicy rewards the Hinterlands elite quests have, besides the mallet.
---
You have the power as the healer. DPS don't. You can choose your group, especially as it's so busy right now. If they're spastics just walk.
---
Exactly my experience, i absolutly love it :D and you are right, it in fact increases player interaction
---
Maybe in TBC but ever since Every Man for Himself pvp has been massively human-based.
---
Depends on race too. If you were human it would be hard to justify an offhand that wasn‚Äôt a sword or mace. Weapon skill is just so valuable to rogues because of their high miss rate from dual-wielding.
---
For pvp it matters a little less and the fastest offhand you can find will offer great poison application.
---
It‚Äôs because when you break it down it equals 3:6 roentgen.  
---
Which is UNIVERSALLY agreed upon as not great, but not terrible.
---
Go to the classic wow sub page and then the three dots in the corner, and add use flair. Should be a load of options so you can choose you faction and class :)
---
r/wholesomecomments is where this belongs.
---
Yep, vast majority of viewers dont even talk in his chat. Its normally the same few hundred or so people spamming stupid shit.
---
That's not true though sub counts went up through tbc and wotlk and fell in cata.
---
There's a simple rule: if you don't want to tank, bring a shaman/paladin. Zero downtime, all the kills.
---
just wait until Vile Reef quests. best buff
---
i would really like to see classic taking a different path, like if it was an alternative universe.
---
tweaking classes differently, allowing classes to get tier according to the spec they want to play.
---
adding more content past naxxramas. cause right now classic has an end line, once it gets to pre burning, thats it, no more content for the rest of classics life...
---
adding arenas?
---
tweaking useless/nonesense talents/items/abilities.
---
&gt;My faith in Alliance / Horde quest-truce-respectfulness is gone.
---
The what?
---
And none of it was necessary anyway.
---
It is like that. It certainly was 3 weeks ago when I was leveling on venoxis in the barrens.
---
I'm nearly Exalted already. I think 21k Rep is like 420 Stacks or something.
---
&gt; 60+25 is 85 50+30 is 80
---
Haha, of course you don't know shit about hunters and that's why you're arguing.
---
Let me fix that Math for you.
---
60+50 is 110 and 50 + 60 is 110 and then we add kings and it becomes 60 + 55 is 115 50 + 66 is 116, and again, that's completely ignoring both crit and defences.
---
&gt; you're talking about the literal best upgrade you can get for all Warriors and Rogues
---
True and you're literally talking about the best upgrade you can get for hutners.
---
&gt; making an enormous difference to their gear.
---
No it doesn't, compare rends to Krol + Mirahs, true, Rends is better, but it's not a huge difference.
---
&gt; then another weapon releases that becomes better in Phase 3
---
Again, where is that weapon?
---
if you run it with a group of cloth wearers that isn't an issue
---
I have never whispered for a Guild offer.  I typically don't even extend an offer until after/during I party with said person(s).  Even more so I am casual about it. None of that "PVP with goals of raiding XYZ night from x-y time, casual leveling" pre-crafted message either.  If I ask if your looking for a guild you get a unique offer.  It may not be more than "Hey you guys looking for a guild?" but it still has that sense of "I am asking you specifically not everyone in trade chat" feeling.
---
I think you're still missing the point. He kills X (unspecified) at a regular pace. But once every 3.5 minutes, he can pop his CDs and kill 4 at once instead of just one.
---
This is in addition to X. Likely 2-3 per minute.
---
Personally as a Combat rogue, I can only kill 3 or 4 at once if I use AR as well as Evasion and BF, so I don't buy the 4 at once. But that's well off into the weeds.
---
Every class can mess with people 15 level under them. Is this post a joke?
---
Hardiness is still better hurr durr
---
I'm about a quarter into revered at early 50s. Any suggestions to push  towards exalted? Feels like all the quests dried up
---
As Lintecarka mentioned, there isn't much before BRD. You can go into Sunken Temple and get the Erankus(spelling?) trinket which poisons all mobs around you. It's decent for an additional dot if you pull a few mobs.  BRD will introduce a few and I believe you may get some from questing in the 50's as well.
---
Definitely get Carrot on a Stick though if you can now.
---
&gt; Of course I stand before you today because they failed. Dead not by my blade, but by their own overconfidence.
---
They died
---
Hmm, wonder what folks think about Tauren hunters. Tauren druids always seem like orc hunters, super chill.
---
Califordaeron.
---
You display your own name?
---
That was a permanent thing, maybe it wasn't even intentional. The value 64 is not blocked anymore.
---
Yeah cross realm is a problem, but also the teleport part. I dont mind the LFG where the group is just brought together, but you have to find the dungeon etc yourselves.
---
Please do it, since you raised the first statement, and then we will reply.
---
No, the 2nd fear break is usually not preferred. Go to wowhead and read the best rates guides, or look at top PvPers.
---
Hunters are desired. They are necesary for some kiting tactics and traps can be really usefull. You can use the stigma of the huntard to your advantage and prove everyone that thinks they are stupid wrong. Be the best hunter they have ever seen :)
---
Not terrible, not great is kind of a meme from the TV series Chernobyl. If you haven't watched it, do it now.
---
\*Cries in 6 Arcanite Bars price\*

Guess it's the meta, and people just assume you're frost..
---
Got mine at 30. just team up.
---
The rest of your party will be glad of you. Go do RFC.
---
You see this is the thing, I dont know how much I can trust these surveys, because it really depends on who actually takes the surveys where as  a vast majority of the player base would not have taken the survey. For example I read somewhere that in classic horde has a majority younger player base. But again I feel like these surveys are not accurate and that you cannot base a judgment on a few surveys.
---
I imagine hes having an awesome time with all this content hes never experienced before.
---
10/10 my experience exactly, this far into the game. There's always the same setup of people. The Mr. Know It All "OMG" "FFS" "L2P" shouting guy, the AFK guy, the guy still in town.
---
I wonder who of them I am.
---
My first guild was shit. Now i am in a much better place with much better people. Wishing you the best!
---
Well, there are not enough quests to get by.
---
But grinding outmobs 2-3levels below you, is much higher xp/hr than even level mobs.
---
It seem this warrior is trying to get their WQ axe though, which is a goal worth struggling for.
---
why do you havee 6/6 precision that is mostly for raiding? you only need 1/3 for pvp which is all this build would be good for
---
God those trolls.  Did they need to use the same quest drop as the collect 9 tusks that never drop off of these trolls that all have two tusks?
---
No worries G
---
With every fiber in my body I hope the people who pm guild invites or just straight up invite you would get muted because its all the fucking time.

7 hours on a single level?

Haha, those are the words of someone knowing he ran out of arguments. I'm 29 years old and I've been in tons of random groups on the way, played with guildies and friends as well. I've never had a problem or complaint along the way. I've been slightly disappointed how easy it's been though. You can just take a look at any competent warrior streamer from say APES. None of them tanked or are tanking as prot in dungeons. They are even respeccing back to arms sometimes when they are about to farm dungeons.
---
I loved fallout new vegas!

Prose* go lap up a dictionary Kyle.

Wonderful story. How noble of the Alliance priest too :)

lmao no wonder they killed you I woulda too
---
You need to run through Timbermaw Tunnel in the north of Felwood. You'll be hostile with Timbermaw unless you do some quests and reputation grinding in Felwood first.
---
The Timbermaw WILL kill you. Probably a few times. You want to jump off the right side of  the first bridge you see in the tunnel, and take the passage to the right; it's almost a 180. If you don't jump off the bridge, and just follow the path straight, you'll end up in Winterspring.
---
So, I am a new player, the release of classic was my first ever experience with WoW, I just missed it 15 years ago and never tried it...
---
So can someone tell me what the fuck is with Barrens chat?
---
"Mining attempt failed"
---
THE GOLDEN GOD IS NOT TAKING QUESTIONS
---
Just my 2 cents here after reading some comments .  
---
the horizontal progression seems indeed more appealing . And if look at the [cosmic forces and magic sources](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/thumb/7/72/WoW_Chronicle_Magic.jpg/800px-WoW_Chronicle_Magic.jpg) you can se we can still make new raids without more pwoerfull gear by using the resistances and magic schools already used.
---
so we already have fire , nature , frost and shadow used in game . There is a lot of room to create new stuff with arcane, fel , necromantic power ( it's NOT shadow tho, but could be paired with it) , air and even light !  
---
a few examples : light could be a scarlet crusade raid . karazhan crypts could be the necromantic thing etc ... and we could then have necromancer as a new class ? dunno just throwing things here and there  
---
The light could even be a more complex thing . Just look at the paladins/priests : humans conception of light is kinda like modern monotheists religions , while a nelf is all about Elune , and trolls are doing vodoo stuff . those different aspect could be used as well , and other aspects of magic has a very nuance story behind.

There was once a party with paladin healer and shadow priest dps...
---
When i got new Water/Food and can only get 2 per cast then i will charge a little fee if they want 1-2 stacks if i dont know them. When it¬¥s just water/food i can get 20 with one cast i give it for free :)
---
I went to Arathi Highlands last night and smashed on some horde. some were my level or close but most were 5-10 levels below me.
---
There was this one shaman I killed and when he respawned and healed he came right after me again. I got him down to like 5 hp and then withdrew and bowed. He blew me a kiss. I respected his gusto, he respected my mercy.
---
I dont think you could have a spy alt back then. Only characters from one faction per server.
---
Scarlet Monastery
---
I assume he got ganked by a high level druid
---
Classic+ would be the obvious way to go even though I loved burning crusade. However, this should be what they release when we're done with true classic. Like, we don't need lvl60 hyjal before Naxxramas.
---
God forbid people play what they want!
---
I legit teared up and made my wife rolled her eyes when she came over to see what I was reading
---
Thank you
---
&gt; and get raid gear before later phases come out, but you do you babe.
---
Because what raid is going to be giving bruta and cht to a hunter?
---
If you're going to be arguing out of "get raid gear" then you should also realize that rogues, warriors and hunters again share the very same items and hunters will be in the back of the line there and as such rends serve more as a temp upgrade for rogues/warriors than they do for hunters.
---
All you need to know is that there is no aggro reset and spawning whelps is a 50 DKP minus.
---
How do you get the class colors to show on the chat box? I can‚Äôt find it in the settings.
---
Check the prices for Wicked Claw and Large Fang, you will be surprized
---
They cancel the auction before it goes through
---
Smolderweb Horde represent.   I'm  Rancidpork: awful undead rogue.
---
I dont know what's worse.  I dont say ding at every inconsequential level.  Im social, I help people with quests or information when they ask in gchat.  People ding all day and get flooded with congrats.  The only ding I ever said was level 40 and it was crickets in gchat.  Going to be honest, if it weren't for the new years day party everyone else got every level it wouldn't have felt so bad.
---
Harrison is already waiting for us on the other side "*Hurry up kid!*"
---
This drives me nuts. You guys dont want classic. You want a new expansion. Thats literally what youre asking for. We already have classic+ which is modern QoL changes to classic.
---
You guys are hoping the game devs who havent made a popular expansion in years take a swing at improving something that we dont trust them to change in any form.  
---
They should release TBC and then wrath and then reset it. Thats it. No new content. You want new content? Go play BFA.
---
It would be the same people who designed recent retail wow who designed classic+.
---
Would they not make the same errors of balance or simplification?
---
Yeah :D
---
yeah fuck dailies
---
And how is threat in Phase 2 handled? Is it ignored?
---
For a priest or warlock, all you have to do is dot the named mob and run the fuck away until the adds reset. The dot damage will keep the named mob from resetting.
---
I've never even played WoW but reading this was beautiful. Godspeed OP
---
I don‚Äôt expect this to happen, just an Idea, it would be still cheaper than designing whole new expansions, but I don‚Äôt think blizzard would take any risk at this point.
---
You mean 15 years later and melee still hasn't learned that hunters in fact do need items?
---
Its allowed and that is the funny part. Its just confusing if you are in a scripting world, and think that autorun is a script automation tool.
---
Yeah haven't quite got around to that and the 350g that we owe to the quest guys. OOF lmao paladins "Free mount"
---
i can hear how they break they're keyboards... that escort mission is pure hell, they were almost done...
---
Where it'll really shine is against anything that likes to chain stuns. So, basically, fuck rogues.
---
Dont let them fool you, feral is the best OT and second MT, best flag carry and a good healer, not very gear reliant and fun to level
---
I dont want more leveling though? I want dessert. If you take 2 hours to eat dinner, it's normal for people to get bored and call for dessert
---
LOL We were just goofing around while waiting for the caravan to move so we could grab a quest.
---
been being outbit quite a bit on that.   when I have down time I wait till the time is short and watch it like a hawk
---
A theoretical Classic update with the new content path diverging from the retail.
---
I‚Äôd rather be sailing.
---
I would bet there are commands that can kill stuff. The shirt that a player got killed everyone in a huge radius which doesn't really allow single target slaying in a city.
---
Only one? You sir have been blessed with seeing just one of thousands. Thats how good they are.
---
as a undead mage i throw up 120 water on trade so
---
No dual spec, and unless you have a lot of gold it isn't really viable to keep respeccing very often as the price quickly gets quite high.
---
Why not giving healing a go a few dungeons? If you hate it then maybe consider rerolling if you intend to clear all raids the way you want to, and if you like it then consider swapping later on when the content gets a bit harder.
---
If you want to hang on to mana a bit better, using a lower rank spell can help.
---
Ex. Instead of using rank 5 Fireball, rank 4 will use less mana and deal less damage.
---
Haven't played a mage yet so I'd probably recommending downranking other spells instead of your main cast like maybe Frostnova and polymorph.
---
Ow! Ok ok I will work!
---
Bartender4 is the best for this.
---
Isn't redridge closer to BRM than Thelsamar?
---
You can for sure get rank 12 slowly without nolifing when the first zerg is done ranking
---
Just go get ravager from SM:Armory like everyone else :).
---
Sorry I actually don't know if there is a quest, and just a heads up, getting ravager is annoying. But it is good!
---
That's why you go BM. Your pets destroy everything!
---
r/wallstreetbets is leaking again
---
That is so far removed from reality I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.
---
Then again, DotA 2 brings out the worst in people.
---
Got mine 1 week and 1 day after Launch, when I was level 33. Had luck, in those days the essences were really cheap on the AH, took me little more than 6g to buy all of them
---
It would probably also stop gold sellers auto inviting to chats
---
I always wanted a WoW 2 or i guess even classic+. I love classic becuase I don't feel the need to be level 60 to enjoy content and have fun. I don't want early levels to become irrelevant.
---
People did this and ninja looted back in it's original release as well but i guess it was ok then because muh generation
---
Lol. I‚Äôm literally saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs an easier to obtain, BETTER RIGHT NOW item for you‚Äù and your take away is ‚Äúmelee want everything and want hunters to have nothing!‚Äù? Uninstall, there‚Äôs nothing that can be done for you.
---
Man, you‚Äôve really brought the autist out in this guy huh? 
---
FWIW I enjoyed the post. The back in forth between you two while sensical (in the sense that it doesn‚Äôt make sense that this dude is calling you out for bragging) is at least entertaining.
---
It‚Äôs not on purpose if they miss taking it out apparently 
---
Or maybe it is and presumed calculated risk but someone profits from it apparently
---
Continuing the metaphor: You haven't been playing the game equal to a 2 hour dinner, though. 
---
It's been just over a month! Let's attempt a bit of patience. I'm sorry you don't enjoy levelling even though that was a large part of the original experience.
---
I hope I don't run into this guild. Kicking over petty stuff.

Don't worry about it too much.  Min/Maxxing while leveling is a trap.  I'm a hare behind you level wise but am looking to score a corpsemaker in RFK as that will be a huge upgrade to the taskmaster I currently still have.
---
I have a hard time believing the difference between a successful SM Cath run and a wipefest will be because you took the sword over the axe.
---
In fairness, carbs have killed more Americans than swords in the last 100 years.
---
Decent players should already know what Hemo is, or at least notice the debuff during the run. 
---
I definitely don't invite people who behave like jerks, regardless of how much damage they do - so I agree with you there. What I don't agree with is blanket statements claiming that DPS meters are "the same type of cancer" (and I absolutely resent the use of the word cancer in this context) as gearscore or achievements - it can be a very useful tool, and as a healer or DPS, I keep an eye on it just as I keep an eye on threat meters. 
---
In the end, I think everyone should play the way they deem most fun, which is exactly what I told the OP.
---
The only thing entitled here is your huntard mentality
---
My bad, I meant to write grey instead of green actually.
---
That‚Äôs my imps name also!
---
Same thing with stonetalon FP. The gryphon flies RIGHT ABOVE where I need to go, all the way to auberdine and then back.
---
I'd drop 2 points in elemental precision and the frost channeling for the 5/5 fb. However, the bigger problem with this build is that it's basically just a 17/0/34 pvp spec. You cannot aoe with this build because it has frostbite, and you cannot really do that well in pve because it lacks both winter's chill and arcane power. It wouldn't be very versatile at all.
---
Dragon Fang. its basically dead.
---
Haha. Yeah, I am having a blast. It was so fun learning all these new things everyday. And I just got a first random world drop. This made my day: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6cgsv/is\_this\_item\_really\_that\_bad\_for\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6cgsv/is_this_item_really_that_bad_for_hunter/)

Horizontal at Nax level or the rest of the raiding gear?

You are an angsty mofo, Jfc.

yeah thats a yikes from me
---
Should people need on BoPs just for the gold? Some of them vendor quite well.
---
Out of Rogue and Ele Shaman who has
---
1) Bigger burst potential
---
2) More 1vX / WPvP potential
---
I feel they are incredibly close in that regard and I LOVE both classes. Pain to decide :/
---
Pretty sure that's a SpongeBob reference
---
No alliance memes to see here, we keep those locked in a vault in stormwind
---
Thank you!! :)
---
Conversely, why do you think you are entitled to the locked chest that only the rogue can open and spent days of time grinding out his class specific profession a.k.a. lock picking for? 
---
By that same logic when there's a mining node in a dungeon, the miner who gets the node should share the profits of the ore with the entire party even if they don't have that profession.
---
Or the Skinner should share the profits of the hides with the non-skinners.. 
---
Lock picking is just another profession and locked chests are a node that only players with that profession can obtain. Why do you feel like you are owed a portion of that professions profits?
---
The actual Thex is on Herod
---
Obviously it is a bread knife
---
I'm on one of the original "big ten" servers that were up before launch day and I'm thinking about moving. Not only is the faction ratio too funky (even though i'm H), i'm just getting too fed up with the, for lack of better phrasing, tryhard culture.  
---
By that I mean the constant spam for ZF GY Mage-only aoe cleave runs, Jed UBRS farm runs, server having plenty of people who did and are still doing the instance reset exploit, etc.  
---
I have a free transfer to either heartseeker or earthfury and i wonder if its the same 'culture' there, just with less people.
---
Playing with Spanish-speaking people is as bad as playing with English-speaking people so it‚Äôs not surprising. LoL has a Brazilian server and no Brazilian I know plays in any other server
---
The damage in SM is pitiful outside of myrmidons. You don't really start to feel the heavy damage on tanks till ST, and even then it's not that bad. But BRD you'll start to feel it.
---
Fair nuff, only thing I'd say is about all hunters, and that's that I feel like very few if any will throw a serpent sting on a mob for another player while running by.
---
The Horde family can be proud of you, young tauren.
---
Can't argue with stupid people or trolls, but I still try.. Why would someone come to play classic and then complain about QoL? That's the point, do you understand?    
---
You are just hard stuck on thoughts, that classic needs improvement, because you think it needs it. And this is the breaking point. Some people love classic the way it is, some demand changes (but can't even agree on what changes specifically, everyone demands different QoL stuff).   
---
It's not designed for everyone so if you demands changes, get back to retail where you have them and let us play the game we wanted.    
---
Sure, keep thinking I'm pathetic for defending the way the game was designed and meant to be. But you are a hero for trying to implement changes that lead retail to the state it's in today. Sure :)
---
Dw guys my voidwalker can tank
---
They're supposed to open again today.
---
Where is your shield?
---
So sick of this circle jerk.
---
Hey I am so happy to get this bow. It was a huge upgrade, and the attack speed is INSANE. I am killing this MUCH faster. At level 2, I just soloed level 54 elite... so... that should mean something!
---
What the Guy below said: most people dont get WW as soon as they ding 30. The farming for that Q sure gets easier with a better weapon as well.
---
im not saying the situation is fake, thought that was obvious lol. i said the blizzard emails are easily faked and can't be proven true from this picture.
---
More likely to get TBC at the moment
---
Sorry but your fields produce the best fish. #organic
---
TBC technically had *one* faction imbalance that wasn‚Äôt a racial:
---
Seal of Vengeance vs Seal of Blood.
---
SoB literally solved Ret‚Äôs mana issues due to Paladins having being healed = mana gained so BElf Ret was WAY more efficient in raids due to it.
---
Also SoV flat out sucked ass. CHANCE to do a DoT. Blood was every swing. It was like a middle of Righteousness and Command though if you weren‚Äôt getting healed it could legit kill you.
---
what is SK?
---
y-yamete volchan!
---
Only the first two sell, and you stop getting points for crafting them at like 50 or whatever, after that quest/dungeon wands are easy to get, bfd one for instance. The big checks from enchanting come from crusader and instance drops like MC, and honestly even if you ask 50g free for crusader you'll be making so few of them and getting it is so hard/expensive that idk, it's just not worth it.
---
No.
---
The jump in WC was way more unforgiving, and you had to run back quite a long distance. 
---
They made the ledge gap almost impossible to fail in Cata
---
Wow another mage.... comeback when you done the same farm on another class Zzzz
---
What a beautiful night elf. Keep her!
---
And I have that item and I use that item, but what happens when p3 hits? Then all of a sudden it's not the best item anymore, do you expect me to not prepare for when that happens?
---
I did not find any such quest. No luck in RFK either, it was like the axe didn't exist on the drop table. Ravager from SM is good, that didn't drop for me either, but I got Illusory staff as a healer. Mighty big upgrade even for Enhancement. Mograine's Might from Cath is a bit fast for Enh, but it sure beats your Crescent staff by a mile.
---
Yeah with the talent and rapid fire, I just noticed my attack speed boosts up so much. Having a blast. Love this bow.
---
This just reaffirms the fact that Ally players are little scumbags!
---
I already tried but it's hard to be considered when there are 30k viewers and I wanna just try the addons not build the same interface.
---
Anyway, despite your toxicity, thanks for the suggestion.
---
I have Kiba on Herod
---
 collect ten bear ass quests aren't something to complete no matter what, that's asking for frustration. they're there to provide incentive to grind for a bit. 
---
usually they award the xp that you'd get from killing 10 to 20 mobs. so... kill ten more mobs and move on.
---
A good hunter is a great pleasure to play with. Play well and good players will be able to tell the difference. Don't expect a pat on the back for not being an idiot though.  
---
If you want compliments and glory be a damn good tank or a damn good healer. In fact any role can get compliments if played well. I get many doing dungeons as a rogue for all the interrupts, gouges, stuns and juicy dps when needed.  
---
Hell I remember 2 specific scenarios in SM armory where tank died at 15% and I kite and evasion tanked the boss to finish him off. Or the time at SM Cath where the healer was OOM and I literally mageweave bandaged the tank between 2 auto attacks of the boss and we got the kill with tank on 1% HP. You create your own glory and it can happen playing any class.
---
Hard disagree. TBC was better as far as expansions go.
---
Dodge.
---
OH SHIT OVERPOWER
---
I'm the one who ganks. And I feel that druids are best at it. Simple fact that you cannot get polymorphed is a win condition for so many attempts. Even if you are 10 levels higher, you can still get PM as any other class and the low level mage might be able to just run away... Opportunity missed
---
 lazy so what can you do  
---
Said the guy on reddit during work/school hours. What exactly do you do beside playing video games and complaining about them on the internet?
---
Classic wow not being to your liking != blizzard lazy. They actually made quite a tremendous amount of work making the game as we know it in the current engine.
---
what you do is spam trade chat while AH crawling inorder to turn a better passiv profit.
---
i would say the better profit of enchanting is the selling of enchanting materials. so going out into the world and farming materials is good money. this is why when they added the disenchant option in WotLK a lot of enchanters were upset since it majorly fucked up the material market due to automatically disenchanting stuff.
---
a good example is your guilde only needs one from a dungeon and the rest of the people dosen't need anything they know you are an enchanter so they let you have all the gear for disenchanting and at the end of the run helping your friend you will have made good money.
---
Just got it yesterday. While farming the tusks i saw an alliance warrior ( i am an orc ) who I was fighting with at the Yeti Cave a few days before, for whatever reason i remembered his name and since the trolls were farmed heavily, i ganked him sometimes in my downtime. Now i was mostly alone, while he was grouped up, so I lost most of the time, but i was determined to annoy him at the very least.
---
After done with the tusks i got the charms for 7 gold from the AH, found a nice level 60 Warrior in Trade-Chat to help me and went to the troll. Now quess who was there. Exactly. That Warrior from the Yeti Cave who i fought all the time at STV, but i didn¬¥t interfered first, i let him spawn his elemental and even helped him kill it, at the end of the day, we were all warriors right ? But then that moron decided to spam L O S E R in /y to taunt me.
---
So I told the warrior who helped me about this guy and before he could get his axe, my helper charged at the guy and killed him instantly, i spammed laugh, got my axe while he corpse-walked from graveyard and now i hit like a damn truck. I love it. I lost most of my battles against him ( i suck at PvP anyways ) but having the last laugh is so much better.
---
Enhancement Shamans were broke back in the day.  Windfury would proc itself off the windfury strikes at one point.  Wasn't uncommon to be chillin in un'goro, then get 1 shot from full by a shaman with an arc reaper or another 2 hander.
---
Just saw a post on here for a addon called spy. It does exactly that and more....assuming your talking about beef with opposite faction for world pvp
---
Big Bull Kek.  Give me a W
---
I love it!   I would 10/10 buy this as a poster or picture to hang over my computer
---
As someone who has a warrior in retail but never played one early on that is genuinely shocking to me. But it does make me want to play my warrior more because I'll actually be able to kill things within an hour.
---
Who need a social life?)
---
You can actually do this in BfA aswell during the assault world quests, horde NPC's will be fighting Alliance NPC's and both factions have to kill NPC's (or players if you are on PvP) there.
---
Too bad NPC's die so fast that it's hard to even get a cast off usually.
---
Ha? You\`re the ones stuck with the NE huntards bro. 1 hour playing alliance and you lose all faith in humanity :)
---
As a warrior: I‚Äôm looking forward to 1shot the pets :)
---
ST/BRD; possibly a run or two of mara princess before you completely outlevel it if you don't have the ring yet. Worth picking up even as prot, to start on a DPS set.
---
You'll be in BRD till at least 56; then I'd do LBRS till 58, at which point you can start doing strat/scholo.
---
Make sure you never tank for that guild. And let them know why if they ask
---
Well actually I cant find a census what divides Class in to race, just race and class in to faction. So I cant, but then again I just asked someone to source that for me.
---
If you are playing a fire mage, you are sadly crippling your self besides on Wpvp.
---
Yeah, good point. I just wanted to better understand itemization between weapons and how to choose effectively
---
almost, it was intended to go from Ironforge to somewhere in Kalimdor.
---
Yah its listed as a preraid bis offhand for warlock &gt;:)
---
I literally just looked those both up. PlayerNotes I found, but not guildchat. Playernotes doesn't have the exact functionality I am looking for.
---
During after hours barrens chat went into full retard mode. Possibly gotten better since. I still loathr flying through it.
---
I met a character named Helenkeller, they were yelling at some other character so I ran up and yelled ‚Äúwhat did you say to me?!‚Äù Then ran off. But about a minute later I whispered them ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never see me coming‚Äù. Not gonna lie, I laughed my ass off to myself, and I hope they got at least a smirk out of it.
---
We will finish the job next time Horde filth
---
I think a lot of it is how "infamous" it was for so long, so people now kind of embrace that as "I CAN BE AS DUMB OR GROSS AS I WANT BECAUSE BARRENS CHAT LULZ"
---
Lol....
---
With sword and pistol by my side
---
Apparently we need to work harder on our recruitment lol. How do we compete against **25%** **stun resist** with orcs though. Back in 2005, nobody knew like they know now. Now everyone wants the *best* race, and not necessarily what they want to play.
---
Need more alliance :(
---
That feeling when troll warrior is the best race/class combo for tanking for horde in Vanilla #secretelitists
---
the thing for me is if you get the corpsemaker it dosen't really feel like you need to rush getting the axe. just get to 32 doing the tusks and AH the rest then somtime around 33 you get the axe.
---
So hold on...judging by the title you want someone to turn this image into a program that already exists? How does that work.
---
Fortnite requires an insane grind to be considered really good and it has more kids playing it than any other game.
---
Minecraft before it had a long grind as well. I don't think children have any issue with grinding.
---
Looks great!
---
its not about that. i die proudly 1 on 1 by someone who has almost the same level. but 3 lvl 60 killing one lvl 50 is just sad.
---
Being honest, I think that may still be the best way to go. Perhaps a collaborative Google Sheet?
---
Ignore the hipster gatekeeping. "You ain't playing real Classic unless you write down everybody's professions on a notepad at your desk".
---
Oh okay sorry! :D
---
Super underrated, I miss him and Doug
---
Oh good to know, I guess he was lieing. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah that too. Still a really funny story. Would have been funnier if he was a twink and pulled off the gank though. lol
---
I don't understand
---
Hey there, so me and my whole group of friends/coworkers moved over to Sulfuras from Whitemane. There is a total of 12 of us and a lot of us did not have time for the ridiculous queues on Whitemane. 
---
The only downfall I have noticed for us is that it is a East Coast server, so it get dark a lot faster than the West Coast, which is where we live. I highly doubt the server is going to die because there is still a queue time during peak hours. However, it‚Äôs only 20-35 min compared to 4-5 hours.
---
I'm Herod-Alliance and it isn't that bad.  Only dealt with a couple of really huge pricks, but I remember their names.
---
Cuz most people aren't hardcore who care about every thing that may or may not impact their performance
---

---
I'm happy you equipped despite the "yes its bad" comments. Robe of Insight was also bad for my mage when dropped and equipped. It's not the minmaxing why I equipped tho. And happy to see you also feel the badassness while using it :) Those nayers have no idea how faster you kill stuff now, only see the max gold you could make if you put it on AH or wait later stages of.. ah gawd, no, just no. Equip, kill stuff, enjoy your luck! Cheers mate!
---
I don't think you can have both here on the same server. While the sentiment is great, you'd just end up with fragmented server populations, guilds that only run vanilla or only run BC raids. Keeping gear/inventories separate also sounds like a nightmare not just for devs, but to manage and keep swapping between this would be hell for the players. The easier solution is having BC servers and classic servers, and allowing one time free character copies.
---
&gt; do you really have no honor 
---
they picked alliance, so no.
---
Dunno what RP-PVP server your referring to but several places in Zalandar Tribe are all out warzones. RP-PVP ain't no place for people with thin skin.
---
&gt; If equally skilled the mage should still come out on top.
---
Therein lies the problem. With a much wider array of spells, casting times, ranks, and cooldowns to manage, it is MUCH more difficult to be an equally skilled mage and thus they are less common. I'd have about a 50/50 chance of winning against a really good one. One of the keys is to simply refuse be kited. Don't chase the mage, don't play the mage's game. Surprise/ambush the mage, kill it fast, and move on.
---
You could do that, but then you would be even more wrong.
---
Sucks to suck
---
Oh really? Cool thank you I am going to try that tonight.
---
If that's the case then everyone thinking i'm "an enormous fuckwit" now should not think it now either. Because 6 months from now you shouldn't have time to farm it.
---
I'm still managing to get my sleep at night, but all my free time has been sunk into the game lol - I missed this game so much.
---
Is there any way to farm nightfall? I would love to be the nightfall pally lol
---
Did you play back then? This sort of shit didn't happen. You had ninja looters and trainers sure. But they knew they were doing things wrong and we're often punished. 
---
People these days actually feel entitled to this shit and come out unscathed. It's kind of fucked really.
---
I got mine during vanilla. Certainly not server first but still proud. My retail priest still has it. Just like my retail hunter still has Lokh Dalar. My biggest class accomplishments.
---
For the most part.  But I feel that with how easy the content is, you'll find more off spec people than before.
---
YOMAMBA
---
It can happen, but, there's no evidence that it happened as OP said. Plus, it's just his side of the story, there may be a lot more that he's not saying. I think that it's very healthy to question stories like this, that come with zero evidence, zero background, etc. Believing it just because it makes good drama is a terrible way of getting duped.
---
Yea but when the other guy said use Guild Chat and player notes they were functions of WoW, no addons required. Baked into the base game
---
You took a jest a bit to seriously
---
Yes, we always organize at least two druid races per year, Alliance only has one annually.
---
xpppp
---
It's not really needed, but I'd imagine that players who are doing endgame content and have their epic mounts already probably have a good bit of gold to spend. Why not spend a few gold to pad the dps meters for a night? I don't really question why people buy them lol
---
Know Guy who sells like this... He is loaded
---
I always see arguments against it but this is always what ends up happening so agreed fuck those nerds
---
Perfectly warlock thing.
---
You have to lure them in with some temptation of power (gaining a quest mob kill), then kill them right as they're about to get the kill. More glory to Slaanesh.
---
Now do it as a dwarf
---
I look forward to the pvp. ENCORE is big. So is FINAL BOSS. I expect a few massive clashes on the battlefield between our guilds
---
at 36 sweeping strike stance dance to bersker whirlwind cleave and watch as all of the numbers fly around and maybe somthing dies.
---
Wow you are really one pissy little nerd considering your this heated over an in game mount
---
well played
---
Fun fact, Demo shout actually fears the adds in that fight!
---
it's easier to find one of the two/three spots of a raid as a druid than finding one of the 10/11 spots of a raid as a mage.
---
There is a SHITLOAD of mages, that will all be against each other in the loot table. Meanwhile, there isn't a lot of druids.
---
Druids can tank every dungeon as well as every raid. F\*\*\*, some guilds back then (when everyone was bad) cleared every raid in a FULL DRUID raids.
---
You will be fine.
---
Also, worrying about raids when you are still leveling is stupid. You don't even know if you'll be still playing.
---
"I'll tell ya what de Horde is. De Horde dat me an' Thrall built. It be a family. When de whole world try ta put us down, de family come an' pick us back up."
---
That's it bois, horde be a family. Be there for your family.
---
Dat FN &gt; CoC  &gt; CS &gt; FN &gt; CoC combo in a group fight.
---
Lf a rogue discord too
---
I had a few weird experiences like that during vanilla, but I found that people like that tended to leave the game after a while when they have noone wanting to play with them.
---
If you find yourself wondering "how can people think like that" at something in guild chat it's a sign it's time to go üòâ
---
There's always a guild out there filled with people whose madnesses are compatible with yours.
---
Those people deserve to burn
---
Who waits on rested xp...
---
I do this. I‚Äôm a human Paladin. If I don‚Äôt resurrect those who have fallen, am I *really* Uther?!
---
Well hunters are quite far from being top dps t5 onwards... so ƒ± have no idea why you assume they would be op. 
---
Also at pvp beastmaster is the worst specc.
---
I was thinking, wow being a social game. Every conversation is a potential source for a adventure. 
---
While you found a simple request so annoying you even wrote about it on the internet. Maybe playing by yourself would suit your personality better.
---
I can't talk about 60 but you don't need to worry about getting rejected as a mage while leveling. I see many people prefer a mage in dungeon groups.
---
And if you want to play mage, play mage. The important thing is, that you have fun. In the end thats the whole point of a game.
---
Another vision from the future here: They could be making necessary adjustments for an enjoyable TBC experience. Content we know works, trust, and enjoy. 
---
Lets focus on enjoying classic and not "what can we add to classic after naxx that isnt burning crusade?"
---
Wasn't loot trading going to be a thing, then Blizz decided to only implement it in raids?
---
My apologies, I misunderstood you there. 
---
Still if you play for those 2 years and enjoy the game but quit after that for whatever rwasone I don't see what is wrong with that. It has always been that way that we don't know what will happen 2 years down the road. 
---
I personally try to focus more on the here and now because making decisions based on speculation about what may or may not be just is not enjoyable. I am also curious of course, but still plenty to do in the current classic game.
---
My entire guild was prepped to do this until the *one* friend who refuses to ever play Alliance decided he was gonna play after all.
---
I still have an Alliance alt. Don‚Äôt tell the guy who has played a paladin since TBC that he‚Äôs SOL.
---
That‚Äôll be erroneous. No way it‚Äôs that pop balance.
---
I mean, it's not like the humans don't make a point of trying to exterminate the forsaken as ruthlessly as they can. I'm not sure that Sylvanas makes much of a distinction between the Scarlet Crusade and the rest of the human faction.
---
Share macro please, we always have a ding partys in my guild at levelups
---
Getting heated at your inability to see the difference between opinions and facts
---
I've never really understood rested xp, what's the point in getting rested xp?
---
One of the best mage counters is ranged weapons. If they snare you, nova you, blink away, etc and you're stuck in place or slowed. Bust out that super fast bow and keep messing with his cast times until you can either Vanish or get in range to burst them down.
---
I get issues from time to time.  Some basic questions.  Are you on 5Ghz or 2.4Ghz wifi?  Have you tried switching?  Is anything updating on your computer?  Windows likes to update itself on my computer and that messes up my latency.
---
Same reason why for example tailors shouldn't charge for bags if you bring the mats. It's all about the community and helping each other. Tips are always appreciated, and if you are able to, you should always tip (even if it's just a little bit). But charging people for something that doesn't cost you anything (even gives you skill ups as reward)? When I wanna meet people with that attitude, I'll go outside in that shitty real life world. But hopefully azeroth won't have many more of your kind.
---
In a paladin thread bad mouthing our awesome shiny horse?
---
This ain't it bruh
---
Wow, the Russian servers are mental.
---
wha....... are you... mentally disabled?....
---
1 tank + 2 dps is not a group either, does it really matter? What's with the notion of tanks or healers being "special"? It's not vanilla where there was a real shortage of those roles, you have plenty of people willing to play either role these days.
---
Yeah reserving stuff in 5 mans is shady but I don't see how the role choice matters here.
---
Anyone can gank a player who is lower level or in a disadvantagous position. PVP on a PVP server is fine and all but personally I disagree with specifically waiting for someone to be in PVE combat.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre on the spectrum ?
---
Meanwhile in this guild, some other poor sod: "Do you know why I did that? You didn't tell me good afternoon when I logged on"
---
gEnErIc aLLiAnCe pLaYeRs
---
There is alot of talk about classic+ but what do you do about making the content relevent without increase gear item levels. I remember clearly being in full t3 and already one shotting alot of people. Mages would drop like flies. So how do you make the content relevent without breaking the game even more. Only way I can see is with a level increase which would kill the rest of classic content.
---
You play Human don‚Äôt you...
---
...you mean it isn't?
---
paladin raid healing as I remember it:
---
- flash of light to keep them topped up
---
- holy light for a big heal
---
- maybe activating divine favor to force a crit from time to time
---
- saving holy shock for emergencies (if you have the talent)
---
- judging seal of light if the raid group allows it
---
- also having many different downranked heals ready for casting
---
besides that:
---
- paladins also give great blessings (buffs) wisdom, kings, might, ... pretty straightforward
---
- you have to pick the right auras for the right occasion, however raid leaders will decide for you :P
---
- occasionally placing a bubble on a priest/mage/... 
---
- you can also prevent wipes, either through a bubble, lay on hands or sacrifice
---
It seems like a lot, but it is quite easy.
---
How is this a crazy theory and not a trivial observation?
---
Not to be an arsehole here, but it's litrally called WARcraft, not DUALcraft. Yer, it sucks when you get killed by a group of people, but the danger in the world is what adds to the immersion. If there was no danger/pvp there would be less challenge.
---
That is a crazy theory. It's almost like they're both based on the same game
---
Just because you can use them doesn't mean they're what's best for you. Stat sticks shouldn't be a priority over a class that uses it as an actual weapon.
---
It was supposed to be much much more than it was
---
&gt; I'm literally ganking any Alliance player I see. Mostly waiting for them to pull something so they are dead for sure when I'm done. 
---
What a big strong Tauren you are...
---
Your point is.....
---
I'm 42 **years old**, *kid*. I've been scripting and macroing Prot Wars for 15 years. Even Arms warriors 7 levels higher, with Weaponsmith-Only blades, will get [embarrassed by Prot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d46cqv/mounted_highlevel_tried_to_gank_me_prot_vs_arms/) 
---
You are an Arms meta guy that dabbled in Prot once and said "fuck this" and never knew how to actually play it.
---
keep making them and bank them. Wait for the time to be right and sell
---
All hail Thex

Are the AH mods the same reason why items aren‚Äôt stacked but posted individually? Was wondering about that while buying medium hides one by one from the same vendor üòã
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre mentally retarded?
---
Coward
---
I think their whole Point in killing you is to piss you off.
---
And they have achieved their Goal.
---
As you said they don't get anything from it except the satisfaction of killing some Horde scum :p That is what they are after
---
Lol what a bunch of man children in that guild
---
I'd recommend staying out of Uldaman until ~43. The last boss is 47 and spams adds. He's a *massive* jump in difficulty from the rest of the dungeon.
---
Crippling poison and mind-numbing poison. Open with Garrote. Have your Blind and Vanish ready.
---
Or, open with Cheap Shot, transition into Kidney Shot, and be sure you have the gear and weapons to kill them before the stuns wear off.
---
&gt; **Dear Warriors:** if you want to tank dungeons lvl 45+, spec as a tank.
---
gear as a tank.
---
SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT
---
Cleaves didn't exist in vanilla cause the elites in low level dungeons weren't nerfed until later patches. 
---
Ask someone like monkeynews who also played back then.
---
You just blizzard elementals in Badlands for a few hours. Good way to farm gold for the mount.
---
&gt; Old days was if you modified your client at all you would likely be banned, 
---
Yeah bullshit to this.
---
In the old days a lot of multiplayer was handled client side which made multiplayer hacking incredibly easy. Diablo, for example, kept your character client side. Someone made a character editor, now your multiplayer character has all the best armor, weapons and max level. Jedi Knight, as another example, was easily modifiable so that your multiplayer Force powers are all available to you. People even modified the attack animations in a way that the MP servers recognized it and could one shot people with their lightsaber in an unblockable attack.
---
Multiplayer hacking and cheating was *easier* in the old days and no one gave a shit. Not harder and banned.
---
Support won‚Äôt help with these matters anymore.
---
This is amazing I feel this at heart
---
&gt; That is a business essentially making value out of something already sold. A feat in itself, to say the least.
---
Right but that speaks to the product and it's quality, not the business savvy of the individuals who finally caved to literally a million customers who'd been begging for 10 years and started raking in the free real estate. They could've had all us who quit back on the hook, making them money, years ago but they just refused.
---
the 5% more hp isn't really useful. In raid, the attacks are so huge that you are either alive or dead, never at the 1/5% hp treshold.
---
But it's really good in pvp.
---
I believe this is the one most people are referring to when they mention drain tanking.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in
---
Are you that guy?
---
Didn't think so....
---
Yeah the RFD corpse run is no joke. It's soooo painful to wipe in any dungeon but especially that one.
---
That's how you get put on ignore real fast
---
Ah right that makes sense, thanks for explaining üëç Awesome picture btw!
---
How else would you know how you are called?
---
Sounds like they did you a favor. Now you can you find a decent guild before you hit 60, rather than wasting a bunch of time trying to raid with them and finding out they were like that later.
---
Old news. Blizz forced nostalrius down and week later announced there will be classic wow coming. They used their coding and staff to build classic wow. I think one of nostalrius devs said in an interview that they are negotiating w blizz about the rights to nostalrius servers and coding. Servers obv are blizzards but the rest is indeed from nostalrius.
---
You play on thalnos right? I think I‚Äôve grouped with you before
---
Heresy!
---
Yeah, role playing as a baboon doesn't appeal to me much.
---
Cool dude. What spec did you chuck most of your spells into?
---
Reputations do not decay and there is no penalty to reputation for grouping with another player.
---
Good. Then I will pull with Elemental Mastery Chain Lightning.
---
Haha yeah levelling as Prot is rough, especially if you're also doing some solo stuff. Arms is really good for levelling as you'll be able to get lots of abilities to help with keeping rage between pulls so you're not starting from zero every time, speeding things up massively.
---
Good luck :)
---
Honestly it seems well tuned.  I actually have to stay behind his threat, towards the death of a mob it finally comes to me, and there's value to be had from the demo VW perk besides buffing sacrifice
---
This... This is what it means to be Horde.
---
Absolutely beautiful.
---
What about pvp items?
---
Are those mail with spell dmg?
---
Altho i dont know but it seems that having lots of int is the way to go as elemental
---
Your whole post was telling people to stop discussing their opinions about classic wows future.... what? Lol
---
As a priest, really in any dungeon leading up to LBRS/UBRS, I tell my tank he can 2 hand tank the place.  Not really concerned if people pull agro either, as long as they can tank it.  Tho, I played a priest, with a lock, enhance shaman, and 2 arms warriors... so it was a meat grinder.
---
Yeah. It brought a lot of differnece in my combat and this attack speed man. I just love it. Do not regret using it myself. What's more amazing is I got this drop out of nowhere. I wanted to experiment some new pets myself. So i just got an owl from Felwood. I needed to feed my pet. So I was farming yhe wolves around to get some meats. And bam. Hurricane. It is purple. My eyes went from =.= to 0.0
---
Any fun instance based farms **rogues** are doing that doesn't revolve around pickpocketing? I did a bunch of BRD pickpocket runs so far, and soloed the bar boss until I got myself shanker (which got replaced already =D), but pickpocket runs are mindnumbingly boring to do repeatedly, with no chance for big ticket items to spice things up either. I got most pre-raid bis and the Gutgore Ripper from MC, so my damage should be ok.
---
Not looking for something that competes with the mage aoe farms or anything like that obviously, but something where I could stealth past mobs, kill a boss or 2, maybe loot a chest and then peace out. Very little knowledge about this as most of the recommendations just tend to point you towards pickpocketing BRD. :D
---
The real kicker is we're all autistic in someway here.
---
Have you tried just whispering them and asking to group? When I'm aoe farming and people are there killing the mobs for a quest I just invite them to the party and let them get the kills. The sooner they finish and leave the sooner I'm able to aoe grind more efficiently since my pulls aren't getting screwed.
---
Well what do you think it means and what I meant to say?
---
I use the guide on wowhead for my enchanting purposes and an auctionhouse addon. The addon tells you what the items DE for. Instead of DEing everything i only DE the items that give me the highest chance (normally 75%) for the mats i‚Äôm looking for. This helped me know what i should be vendering rather than DE. I dont sell my enchanting mats - it‚Äôs too annoying imo. Everyone tries to sell in the AH but few people actually but from ah. I dont find selling enchanting mats to be super sucessful.
---
Hi there, I found this list with a quick search, seems like a good reference.
---
[https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-dungeon-levels/](https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-dungeon-levels/) 
---
I can tell you from experience that if you aim for the exact middle of the dungeon's level range you will likely have a good time.
---
*Cries in alliance*
---
Impressive!
---
It's not even that hard on a pve server.   If you know what you're doing and you're careful it's easy tbh just a bit slow
---
I literally say in the OP that people are asking for classic+ instead of TBC, which is the natural progression of classic. My apologies if that was not abundantly clear.
---
Time to go outside !
---
I never said some Brazilians aren‚Äôt trash, I‚Äôm just disputing the fact that most Brazilians are trash.
---
Keep in mind the inherent bias when determining if someone is a certain nationality when playing a game with English as an official language: you will only know if they talk in their own language or use their regional slangs. You will only identify the troll Brazilians as those disregard the rules and will speak in Portuguese or with very broken English/slangs. All the good-mannered Brazilians will fly entirely under your (and of everyone‚Äôs else) radar, as they won‚Äôt speak Portuguese and most likely will avoid revealing the fact that they are Brazilian due to the prejudice against BRs.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalrius
---
Yes. A big private server which was shut down. The owners and developers of this private server were subsequently invited to Blizzard to talk about why Vanilla WoW might be interesting for Blizzard to run themselves.
---
Yellow transcendence is sick!!!
---
Dailies are literal cancel but why do people hate flying? I've seen that sentiment a surprising amount.
---
Grinding dungeons also gives good gold per hour. It's also not rare for people to ding 60 with nearly 500g in their bags just from leveling quests. 
---
Btw those legs are super expensive on your server.
---
Found the rep on the right!
---
There are no pve realms in bfa.
---
Some servers are grossly unbalanced.
---
I'm on pagle, its 2.4:1 ally to horde
---
Lmao.  Was that guild officer a girl who happened to be the object of your GM's affection?  God I can't stand these fat fuckin keyboard tough guys.
---
DEJA VU!
---
Man ally on Stalagg is miserable :/
---
I never played Nostalrius, so can't comment on that part.
---
Nah Yojamba - the oceanic server.
---
There's at least one other undead warrior with this armour, a mohawk and no jaw in this comment section though so there are literally dozens of us
---
Feral DPS isn't viable unless you farm MCP in Gnome. Getting a raid spot without is going to be very tough.
---
Absolutely true
---
Petty bullshit, not to mention the power tripping. Im sure those guys arent egotistical assholes or anything /s. Especially as a solid Tank you could find a dozen+ guilds more than willing to have you. Good luck in the future!
---
Why would anyone leave skullflame?
---
Server is healthy af. No queue and high pop.

No it doesn't, however Shadow weaving talent from SP does increase your Wand if it deals Shadow damages.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
For laughs, please enchant it with Beastslaying.
---
It's as much griefing as a level 60 killing a level 30, and has the same solution.
---
wut
---
But then druid is unique from many casters in that even as a "balance" druid you are capable of splitting into a melle DPS role. I see what you mean about it not really being "balance druid gameplay" but I don't think you can ever escape that druid always has that hybridity in mind. 
---
That being said it will always be more efficient to play a feral spec in solo pve content as that's the way the numbers stack. But even in feral builds you need to pop out and use some caster abilities. So really the same should be true for caster builds to. Just my thoughts on that matter anyway :)
---
As a leveling priest, this is what I think about *all* the time.
---
Ever since I saw priests with it in vanilla I always wanted one. But never played a priest back then. 
---
Definitely one of the most iconic weapons in the game.
---
For the Horde.
---
Kek.
---
This doesn't look like a layering issue, as it isn't "fading". It just goes PLOP.

One of the largest level ranges in the game, one of the largest quest zones in the game, three races get spat out into it, and the fourth usually makes its way over after depleating Silverpine. It's big. It's empty. It's grindy.
---
What else can someone do?
---
That's not an exponential curve...
---
A lot of people have reported this, there are articles about it, and it's just weird that it broke silently + other related stuff like enslaving high level elites also 'broke' at the same time.
---
Hopefully it is just a bug though.
---
The reward from Thrall's questline alone may be worth it depending on your weapon.  I'd probably do it.  It doesn't take long and as long as you have all of the quests it'll still be a pretty decent xp venture.
---

Thank you! This is very helpful. I have a couple questions:
---
I have seen a lot of builds that get 3 gouge, why do you consider it not worth it?
---
What is your recommended leveling spec? Should I avoid sub and respec later (if so, when should I respec), or should I slowly spec into this build as I level (if so in, what order)?
---
Oh see I never heard about this. That explains a lot. Thank you for the information!

Wrath had terrible class balance. Plate classes were supreme.
---
TBC also had terrible balance. Druid/Warrior, Paladin/Warrior, Druid/Warlock in 2s, RMP in 3s. 
---
Player interaction in Wrath consisted of "whats your ilevel?".
---
Only thing that I feel is missing in Classic compared to BC and Wrath is arena. I really enjoyed arena in those two expansions.

You can still flag for world pvp in a pve server. You're just never autoflagged. Also, more than 1 account is a thing.

I've got that, I was hoping there might be an easy way for me to 'eyeball' it rather than having to run test runs (especially if it's a matter of keeping or selling a BOE drop)

I am a certified lore nerd and avid video game player. I am also a professional. Plenty of people don't understand the hobby and that's fine, I do not ask understanding from strangers.

Maybe bring up how you feel about about it OP.

Edit: Though I do get most of my in depth discussion from the internet/in game, nice to actually say it out loud to people you care about.

I got a Flurry Axe, but no one wants to say a number. Every conversation goes like this:
---
&gt;A: WTS Flurry Axe. Make an offer.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;B: How much do you want for the Flurry Axe?    
---
&gt;A: Make an offer and we'll go from there.    
---
&gt;B: How much should I offer?  
---
&gt;A: That's not an offer. Offer what you think it's worth, and I'll accept if I like it.  
---
&gt;B: So you don't want to sell it? How do I know the offer you'll like? Tell me what you want for it.
---
I'm hoping for \~300g, but I'll accept an offer around 150g. I'm in no big hurry to sell.
---
"Bank rested XP"
---
What?
---
I assume you're trying to accrue that bonus XP time you get for staying in town?  What is it, like 1.5X?  Wouldn't that time be better spent playing anyways, since 1X for an hour now, and 1X for an hour later is better than 1.5X for an hour later?
---
Be happy they kicked you. They seem like a bunch of maniacs tbh. My god maybe you were afk or some stuff. People who expect from you to response in 2sec are just annoying. You deserve better
---
Therese for sure is a rep decay. Doing turning in grey quests will give you less rep than turning in level appropriate quests. This is why its recommended to travel to another starting area at lvl 1 if you want to get their mount.
---
You do you I guess...
---
every time i'm invited nowdays, the first question is: is it chill run or some crazy ass aoe spell cleave farm bullshit?
---
At the end of the day it's a lowbie item that gets replaced. No one should care THAT much about it.
---
I'd only accept a Classic+ if they did a little bit of class tweaking. Make some underperforming specs better etc. TBC brought a lot of needed changes to a lot of the classes. There is only so long people would want to be shoehorned into one role on their preffered class.
---
No Berserker Rage? What a noob. Mithril well earned.
---
Well it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt working as intended in the world either... ie. being able to farm all your BB chest badges in one swing. 
---
So you can see that there there would be some confusion when resetting some things in the world is fine but not others?
---
What the fuck are you even talking about? You have no clue what people actually want for classic+, do you? Maybe read the treads you are against sometimes.
---
Well, I guess it is just normal to be against something one doesn't understand.
---
There's nothing going on in Silithus. If you're going anywhere it should be EPL. That said I think you should do a few BRD runs, it's in your level range, there are a ton of dungeon quests there, and you can pick up some gear that will last you a bit at 60.
---
You can also get your MC attunement done.
---
exactly\^\^
---
Classic+ already exists, it's called go back to retail and make your pipe dream requests there. Classic exists for one reason and one reason only, to combat the overwhelming insane popularity of PRIVATE servers.
---
Why anyone would even begin to believe... i men think about ti for a whole second, why would blizz do all this, as in provide the infrastructure, practically admit retail is trash, then do crazy ass pipe dream request bs and send them all straight  back to private servers.
---
I try to do these at unpopular times like 4am before my shift starts.
---
YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED! I gather groups when I want to. (c) some leveling warrior tank.
---
That could end up being a bloody decision.
---
There's a new transfer window open until the 23rd. I was leaning into Earthfury tbh but they both seem to be about the same.  
---
Is anyone on your faction raiding yet?
---
Yes, but in my case, I used it (Staff of Jordan back in the day).  Best is to have a realistic price you wouldn't go lower than for the item, and post in trade PST with offer for it and see if you get anyone interested.  asking 500G atm this early on probably won't happen since most people out there are poor plebs atm.  When the people with a lot of funds start lvling alts or twinks, that'll change.
---
Not only that, but training to conjure water and food takes seconds doesn‚Äôt require actually skilling up. A rogue has to go through the process to level up their skill to even reach the level to open certain chests. They HAVE to ply their wares in trade or go out and grind in potentially dangerous areas (depending on how up to date they keep their skill). It‚Äôs very much a trade profession imo, whereas food/water and summons and party buffs are not.

Also, you should really watch a guide and have a written one open, WoWhead has some great classic dungeon guides, before stepping foot inside the larger instances like Mara, BRD, LBRS, UBRS, Strat, and Scholo.  Its really easy to miss something or get lost in the higher level dungeons.

Try bagnon

This, int sta should be mage priority. Any int and spir. I wait to awe if priest needs before I roll.

Try bagnon?

You think you do, but you don't...

I feel far more comfortable in Holy, so that's how I level. I also happen to have a pocket warrior, so that helps lol

what should be your bis list for hunter then?

That is definitely false. This has been tested extensively. The racial is plain additive. +25% extra you resist every third stun.

Same, I moved to another state and my friends back home see my new hobby as "weird" and "childish". It sucks because my husband has many close friends to have those nuanced discussions with. It's okay, we don't have hobbies to impress others. It's for ourselves. Keep gaming!
---
Really any caster class. Ogres, quillboar, dalaran mages. As a Shaman I can really mess them up while taking next to no damage and keeping Mana up by doing lightning shield, and a few stabby stabbys with my dagger.

Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't a thing. It's a reason why anecdotal evidence is terrible.

---
Yes.
---
This sub can be quite the dumpster fire.
---
he did, but I healed through it. It was the third time I used fear in this "fight"
---
I personally am of the opinion that it is a feature that some classes can wear multiple armor types. If Blizzard intended for classes to stick to their own they would have restricted it.
---
Tho, the roll on that one was still weird, the stats simply aren't that great for a druid.
---
Why would you want to be a member of that organization?
---
For all those warriors who want to tank but also solo level here is my recommendation. I have been using the fury spec (enrage blood craze 5% crit improved demo shout 5% parry) there is hardly any downtime. Battle shout &gt; demo shout &gt; sunder &gt; overpower/heroic strike. You barely take damage, consistent hits, an interrupt with shield bash and you can kill enemies with your 50% hp. Just a quick tip I've veen using as solo leveling.
---
this is beautiful.
---
Dude, you definitely don't want to be in a guild like that anyway. They did you a favor.
---
suspiciously specific denial
---
Are horde players more serious than alliance players? Or is that just a meme? I am a casual player and wondering if its ok to be horde and not passionate about it
---
Well, in which univerce accepting gifts is exploiting?
---
Still laugh that it was better than heirloom gear in Wrath until about level 38 or so.
---
I actually ran past a warrior with the sword yesterday. I cried on their shoulder.
---
It may be signal related. I have wireless headphones and found if I get up and close my door the sounds either get muffled or goes away completely!
---
If you can get your epic mount at 60 just go for it. You spend almost as much gold on the quest, and with the time you save you could easily earn the difference. Plus, it's an item, not a spell, which makes it better in nearly every circumstance except saving bag space.
---
Ah thanks! Really good to know. And what about Druid?
---
Disagree escape artist beats all for pvp..
---
I don't get people thinking about gaming is a bad thing or a waste of time. You can literally sit for like 4-6h per day on your couch and watch tv/ netflix after work and nobody cares, but if you play some games they act like the end of the world.
---
If you can afford it yes.
---
Yup, that's what I've been doing, posting in Trade for blacksmiths and people looking for blacksmiths to join the channel. I'm gonna have to spam it for a while to get it to catch on, most likely.
---
Too bad it get useless once you get ravager
---
My conclusion is that it's confirmation bias? I only have two people on my shitlist for ninjalooting. It definitely has not been "the norm" in my experience and unless
---
WOLTK had a stagnating WoW population before the drop from Cata. I'm not sure that it's a "winning" expansion in that regard.
---
This is some high quality content.
---
Its a shitty move anyway. Totally fair to add him to shitlist and avoid that player in the future, where do you draw the line personally? 
---
I would probably not think more about it, but I would definetely avoid bringing that player anywhere in the future.
---
You should check out jeff's stream on twitch. He has a pretty relaxed atmosphere and will be doing a fair bit of wpvp soon.
---
What server are you on?  I rolled on Benediction and it seems every zone is just 100% horde controlled.  I see hardly any alliance anywhere and the moment I see an enemy I have 5 of them jumping me.
---
HoJ, Sword spec, and Thrash Blade seems like it would be a lot of damage.

It's really easy for people to agree on a vague concept like "Classic+" up until you start getting into the details of what it's supposed to actually *be*. Imagine the day Blizzard announces their own vision for what Classic+ should be, with an actual list of changes, new content, balancing etc... I can guarantee you that people will *instantly* stop agreeing with each other and start arguing heatedly instead.
---
Ewww that‚Äôs gross

I‚Äôm on Grobbulus and I see a lot of the same spam.

---
I keep looking back at this reply and trying to make sense of it. I just can't.
---
The raids and class balancing are my only real big reasons to want BC. Both sides have all classes, space goats are cool, and my main class druid was now able to become a proper tank/healer/dps. I can agree with a lot of the other stuff tho, like dailies and what not.
---
And you still need darnassus exalted to use the winterspring saber
---
What is the drop rate any way?
---
Cause they are :)
---
To get more people to make noise.  I already have tickets open and posts on their bug forum.
---
I'm first dps Bru. Playing since BFA, know what I'm doing, gtfo noob

Saved you the hassle of dealing with a shitty situation down the line. Anyone who forces you to say congrats is messed up in the head
---
They're good hunter weapons. What's your point?
---
Grats Legion! We‚Äôre on Rattlegore alliance too. Planning to start MC in 2 weeks!
---
That's great for you man. Do you think the general playerbase participated in those events? Do you think if you ask the average TBC player what they remember from TBC PvP, it'd be Halaa?
---
No, it was arenas and battlegrounds. Do not live in a delusion.
---
So you admit he's 99% right and you're just being a jackass? Mkay.
---
The harassment wouldn‚Äôt be your fault, it would be theirs. Posting the guild here might save other people from having an experience like you. They have you on ignore anyway so what‚Äôs the problem? Ignore them back and expose them for the greater good :-). You have the ability to save others!!!
---
Games like WoW aren't popular anymore because none exist (except for Classic).
---
The game changed so as to be unrecognisable, so many of us left. The competition were never able to replicate what made vanilla WoW appealing. The only game that came close for me personally was Pirates of the Burning Sea.
---
I see your point but I do like the discussion as a way to learn what I should do in that situation
---
There is hope!... just kidding I farmed it (no joke) 18 hours straight and saw it drop 2 times. Both times i lost the roll
---
What drives the prices down are people who think listing their item for half the going rate will make it sell any faster.
---
Then you get other people who know even less who dog pile on that price and before you know it you're at vendor.
---
I love playing a Holy Paladin. I hate levelling as one.  Raid healing, Group healing BG healing. although I need more work on the latter is great fun. There is a lot of satisfaction to be had from knowing you kept everyone up in a difficult encounter.
---
Healed as heavy shadow in vanilla without issue, and would outheal disc/holy builds due to having a high spirit build.  Of course I was missing some nice perks they had, but it's not impossible.  You have heal spells, and you just need to be concerned with 5 second rule, and overheal.  I roll heals and only let them complete when the tank actually needed the heal and would take 100% of the healing.  situational though, because sometimes you want them topped off for bigger hits from bosses, but you'll usually know when those harder fights are coming up.  2 points is all you really need in holy to be an effective healer.
---
It's not really worth it doing the quests to get rep.  You're better off just leveling and then farming gold/runecloth to turn in, since you'll need to anyway.
---
just dont look at it.
---
Exactly.  Some people try to fit some sort of numerical argument into their choices.  "oh this is optimal"
---
Just say you like how it looks mates.  No one will judge you for it.  People need to chill.
---
As a rogue I would not need on blackcrow. Should I?
---
I don't know. I always like saying gz when I'm in a random group especially if it's hitting max since it's a special moment.
---
The sub count flat lines starting at the very beginning of WotLK. That's not due to content drought.
---
The sub count starts dropping *as soon as cata releases.* That's not due to cata's development cycle.
---

---
The whole point of classic+ is to not add content like flying mounts. That will only come with TBC which is what you want
---
The bank is part of your character. Code-wise, it's simply an extension of your bags. The bank NPCs only open your bank, your items aren't actually tied to the server.
---
Some people take the "Classic experience" to a different level. I had something similar happen to me the other day. I was in the middle of killing a mob in STV and some random guy walks up to me a says "help". He's not fighting anything, and he's full HP. Literally 0.4 atom seconds later he says "wow, you're pretty fucking selfish" and walks away. I respond "?" and he immediately puts me on ignore. 
---
My bad...?
---
I already have a Priest, Druid, Warlock, Rogue, and Mage but can't decide which to main. Which is likely to be the most competitive in wpvp and BGs without any raid gear?
---
Not that Spirit is actually BiS while leveling but that's none of my business
---
Who cares, man? At that level it will get replaced anyway. EVERYTHING you do from level 1-50 will have zero impact on anything you should really care about, which is endgame. Loosen up.
---
If I‚Äôm in SFK and Shadowfang or Assassin‚Äôs Blade drops, I‚Äôma NEED them whichever character I‚Äôm playing cos I‚Äôll get about 100g for each.
---
A group that knows what they're doing will probably finish a full clear in 2.5-3 hours.
---
Once people get their quests done, most people choose to do runs that cover the bosses they need to kill, which are much shorter and people actually chain run.
---
I might be able to help you out, I‚Äôll look into uploading something and then message ya
---
Weird that WOTLK is a 'guaranteed failure' but Classic+ is somehow a net positive risk. I see classic+ as a guaranteed failure because we know the quality to expect from new content development out of blizzard.  Whereas WOTLK is many peoples favorite expansion.
---
 I disagree whole heartedly, but at least your opinion has valid points against future expansions.
---
He asked if he could need it, you answer he cannot because some rogues need it. Who is to say this is the case when he needs it?
---
translation  
---
yes, but **No**
---
Ret isn't great for raiding. And the other real issue is... It's really fucking boring
---
Do not gave up, I did 21 armory before ravage drops, on the other, the scarlet pant is still not dropping.
---
Am I still on time? :(
---
Been playing since release, been thinking about what to play since release. By now, I‚Äôve probably sunk so much time into different classes, I could‚Äôve been well over level 50.
---
Please, somebody. Help me. I don‚Äôt know how, but I‚Äôm super desperate at this point. I just want to play... :c WHY CAN‚ÄôT I MAKE UP MY MIND?!
---
Whenever I run into groups like that I just let the dps die. Mana pots are ohshit buttons. If you're having to use them regularly the group is a problem.
---
Smolderweb is a legit server.  
---
Im sure it will get hot once we are all 60, but I've shared mobs with Horde and had a few dance parties.  
---
Reppin the Alliance.  
---
(I literally swooped in to a kill a mob for an Orc before I read this)
---
he is but i think most streamers are aware that its great while they are getting paid but the game could fall out of favour at any point at which point you start losing followers and money and unless you are able to keep your followers and move onto another game you need to find a new way to make money

Oh man, shaman was my jam from WoTLK to BfA. I'd play it in a heartbeat if my whole group of friends wasn't going alliance :(
---
Bought one for 35g at lvl 45 on my rogue. They hover around 45g-50g on my server rn
---
Oh shit that's right i forgot haha :)
---
Somehow got a waterfall of downvotes for simply pointing out a bug lol.
---
Fuck you for making this
---
how is this nsfw? to get more attention?
---
You look stupid
---
Does anyone know how to disable the "Not enough rage/energy/mana" audio?
---
It is starting to drive me nuts.
---
Such is your duty
---
I was able to level to 40 without doing a single quest originating in STV. It is a proud moment when you can give the finger to STV and never look back.
---
&gt;No, you dont have to go for all of them. Its pretty easy to say "the cycle is these two or three expansions before reset"
---
Why these? And why a reset? What if I don't want to play BC but want to continue playing my character with new stuff to explore I don't know already?
---
&gt;And classic+ is about content, not QoL changes. You know that.
---
So we can have an LFG/LFR tool? Allright then!
---
Or two people, one being the undead and the Qubes being a multiboxer.
---
Especially since the undead started the comment chain we're responding to and said "we."
---
Well grob is in the same batch of servers as mine and is basically the ED of classic, so that's what I expect.
---
Upvote for a beggar, kind sir?
---
&gt; Look at the popularity of TBC pservers
---
Actually these were probably the least popular pservers of the three first iterations of WoW.
---
I do, yeah. I remember the same patch that introduced the unique T1 models was the same patch they updated the epic mount models. I spent an hour just walking around Ironforge checking people and their mounts out.
---
Ppl who come to classic but want all the features from retail. Lmao.
---
You‚Äôre China!
---
damage is important when you are the lowest on the meter because you are the only dps not consuming and eventually get benched because of it though. no reason to not use two elixirs a night for a 1.5-2hr MC really
---
Open up trade mid mining baby. Now you can do it to your own faction lmao
---
I've seen more black stallions than any other horse, it's pretty widespread knowledge.
---
your fine...I get this as a shaman healer. I roll on int/stam gear even if it is cloth, and sometimes get shouted at, if there is a mage or lock in the party.  But if its an upgrade, then roll need. No-one should be bothered losing rolls on gear which isnt BiS!
---
How can you guys belive that Blizzard would make good content and not fuck it up as usual?
---
Welcome to the jungle!
---
Hit 60 in 7 days as a mage, took over 8 hours for multiple levels in the 40s and 50s to get tailor and enchanter maxed out. Also to help friends catch up. Didn't aoe grind that much in all because I love to quest, but if I went to do it again I could probably do it in 6 days I'm guessing.
---
Flying is necessary in outland because zones were developed with flying in mind.
---
You cant fly in azeroth until cata.
---
Honestly I was mocking his greedy attitude by mirroring it, ^^ I know it's stupid and to far, if people want to do it free let them, that's price of competition right now.
---
Yeah, I took the free transfer off Kirtonos and the experience has been a lot better.
---
I have these same gloves in my bank and I‚Äôm a rogue. waiting for the market to get better, then gonna sell the fuck out of these. I already outleveled them into some competitive greens, anyway. looking at this makes me glad I‚Äôm patient
---
&gt;thought I had found a guild were I could connect with others through Dungeons, PvP, and Raiding but can't because I don't know any other guilds to join.  
---
*Thankfully*, you were mistaken.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be having these conversations. If they ask ‚Äúhow much‚Äù simply don‚Äôt reply. People that are serious about buying will whisper an offer, often lowballing but will probably settle somewhere between your ideal and their low.
---
You can still single target with an AoE spec.  I would just go AoE, tbh.  Even if you don't do it, "that much," you'll still be getting tons of xp every time you do it.
---
Theres a lot of opinionated people about druids.  they're the best healers for healing the overall raid due to having a really good HoT, and a heal which has a HoT after it.  We always had 4 in our raid, and with good gear could Off Tank, or DPS whenever required.  Not sure why someone would be hating on Druids, they're a good build for versatility.
---
I was on a pve server and there was still a lot of world PvP, all u had to do was attack a popular area like goldshire and people would come to fight
---
Whats wrong with uldun? The gate to uldum is in classic. People dont want cata uldum if thats what you think. It was obviously meant to be a zone or raid down the line.
---
Make it 4D chess?
---
This is my favorite quest in the game...not because it's fun to do...because it's not, god is it a lot of running all over the damn world but because it's so well done! there are a million references...they basically beat you over the head with them. Very cool!
---
Imagine unironically thinking a racial with a cast time is good
---
What a life
---
I set it to "g" and never looked back.
---
Yup thats what you signed for when u joined a pvp server. Wouldnt call it griefing or 'rewardless', obviously they trigger people and that horde-alliance hatred is what they're after.
---
Doing the torch room with a level 52 was traumatic, He would pull mobs when the rest wouldnt even if he sat ontop the tank.
---
Its a miracle we got through that in only 2 attempts.
---
We even managed to snag a BIS for our healer.
---
Look at atlas loot (or wowhead, or what ever), for the bosses you want to tank. The level requirement for the items it drops, should be the level of the tank.
---
That is just my 2 cents. :)
---
Actually, Baguette is a kind of bread, and bread in french is "pain"... so, she has *pain* as an offhand :)  
---
Handy to be bilingual :)
---
bro you need to get in. The game is amazing
---
As a priest main, I feel you.  But for me, as Alliance, its warriors in VC rolling on the Lavishly Jeweled Ring.
---
It ain't bad m8.
---
Ok, so then your experiences &gt; mine then? Since you're also claiming you're anecdotal evidence as the truth. 
---
I think if you're attempting to state that this shit has always been around and happened just as frequently as it does in games like classic wow today you're going to find there's a lot more folks that will, anedotically(?), Disagree with you based on 20+ years of mmo experience.
---
But hey, you do you.
---
I would love to hear the justification for this claim.
---
Said every mage ever when there's a priest on both sides.
---
One of our to-be-tank guildies has grinded crimson whelps for 6 levels now. He refuses to hate himself via questing as a warrior.
---
[Easier to see him in this.](https://i.imgur.com/Y4UUBjK.png)
---
3 months old - named Speck.
---
My leveling buddy plays a prot warrior, I play a holy priest. It rarely takes longer than 30 seconds to fill our group. 
---
The only downside is that it gets boring running dungeons over and over. Especially the shorter ones in SM.
---
Oh, you're right.
---
It's not looked down on as much as it used to be. Gaming is pretty mainstream now, it's just unfortunate that you're in an environment where nobody seems to have much interest. I work in software development so it's easy to find people who do talk about it openly.
---
did you try running the macro you mentioned in comments with the window open without having to close and re do it, just spamming macro and it didnt work?
---
I can't say for sure, but there are plenty of semi-hardcore raiding guilds with respectable history recruiting on Heartseeker discord.  It's possible Earthfury may have it better.
---
60 warrior would 1 shot you. Fun story but fake.
---
Is the screenshot function on your PC broken son?
---
Didnt do any mage quest at lvl, didnt feel like im missing out...considering other classes quest like ww warior.
---
&gt;Why these? And why a reset? What if I don't want to play BC but want to continue playing my character with new stuff to explore I don't know already?
---
Because thats when sub count declined and as said before, when LFG tool was added that decimated the community.
---
&gt;So we can have an LFG/LFR tool? Allright then! Blizzard, you heard it, this guy who doesn't want others to post their opinion and wishes demands a LFG for classic. Get to work!
---
What a moronic, disingenous attempt at a strawman argument.
---
They are 100% able to punish it if they wanted. Not saying they should (I am indifferent on multiboxing at the moment), but it's not like they can't stop it just because it's paid for.
---
who comes up with these random terms for these things
---
Paragraphs are incredibly helpful.
---
Run the census addon and check the graph after it runs. The peak population on any given server, are between 30-40.
---
A company the size of blizzard doesn't have a 'primary' and 'secondary' product. They have *products*. If WoW Classic draws subscribers, it generates revenue. If by investing in some development, that revenue can be increased, they'll do it. All about those benjamins.
---
you can'd kill the 40 elite alone, but you can manage the rest without too much hassle. I've leveled 3 warriors on pservers over the last 4 years and never gotten the axe later than lvl 31.
---
Yep, I enjoyed the housing in EQ2 as well.
---
The only reason I'm happy to be on a pvp server this time
---
you cant just "replace the dps in minutes". i always start groups with a tank and healer, but it takes forever to even find 3 dps. like 30 minutes of posting in the lfg channel. and then once you actually have a full group, its gonna take another hour for everybody to get to the dungeon. you have one guy in feralas, but he hearths back to darnassus and has to fly all the way down to tanaris. another guy is in eastern plaguelands and flies all the way to booty bay to take the boat to ratchet and fly again. the third guy doesnt even have the flight path and has to run from ashenvale complaining about getting ganked by horde through the barrens without a mount. by the time you are back in the dungeon ready to go, its been like 2 hours
---
its so stupid because i always position my character right outside the dungeon before i start forming or looking for a group. i wish other people would do the same
---
I feel for you here, I panicked when I created my Paladin in Vanilla, was doing my Boiology homework at the time and ended up naming my character Vascular. Wasn‚Äôt until late TBC that I could pay for a name change.
---
I feel you man... I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that :(
---
Can we make each other some sort of promise or something? That we both pick a class and try to stick to it? 
---
Which classes are your favourite at this point? I think mine are hunter, rogue and warlock. A druid seems fun too, but I just can‚Äôt seem to get past the leveling phase
---
Im crying please stop
---
Get max level and wait for battlegrounds
---
Not sure how playing wow 60 hours a week and dropping out of college is considered "good old days"....but hey to each their own.
---
Oh, I see. I just misinterpreted your first comment as "it would cost like 600 runecloth", but I assume you meant gold?
---
I thought people that played this game were older, but then I forget a lot of them are fucking losers.
---
You've got plenty of time, don't rush and enjoy it.
---
Yea I'm bad at knowing where to put them. It's why I almost never post.
---
Generally if you have not hit rating, you probably need to stick to your 2h. But if you are getting some HR then better 1hs will probably be better than a bad 2h.
---
Totally get it, haha! 
---
PURPLZZ!
---
Just placeholders... there's probably armor out there in Azeroth that shares some of this art-work or has a different model color, but it'd be hard to track down and a lot of it would be uncommon world drops (BoE greens) that might show up on the AH now and then.
---
It's over 9000!!!!
---
I agree but a "hybrid" dps spec should be closer than only doing 30% the damage of a pure dps spec. I'd probably be content with the 65% range
---
I just assumed that the shop UI doesn't update live.
---
This is correct I tried killing Cyclonian at 34 where my white hits did something like 40 damage followed with miss parry parry. Anyone claims to solo must have done it on private servers where you could kite him down.
---
Agreed.  What is SK?
---
Damn someone is going full J. Allan Brack
---
yea but ur probably right, i know things like the garrison wasnt good for the game, the concept seemed nice tho...
---
Thanks for the reply guys. 
---
New but having a blast.
---
7 quests in 10 hours dude...I'm not even averaging 1 an hour. I'd say that's out of hand
---
Mob behavior is so erractic in Classic.  It has to be a product of some later expansion because they position themselves and overcorrect all the time.  I've become more frustrating with the mobs moving around on me than what most DPS are doing to mess up the run.  This was not how it was in Vanilla, at all.  Mobs didn't correct their positioning, so even as an old hat, I'm having to play around with that part of the game.
---
How are you going to get healed when your priest is a little piggy? :D
---
It's not
---
Turn error speech off
---
Name and shame, its not a person, its a guild. Let us hear it.
---
&gt;If you played with them you'd understand, they're basically a blight on anything they touch since the vast VAST majority are complete shit stains that suck ass at the games they play, will be complete obnoxious assholes to everyone and everything they come into contact with
---
&gt;Their usual English vocabulary consists of pretty much nothing but racist insults, swear words, and "I report you".
---
&gt;and all of their stories across a vast ocean of online games is all but universally identical about how BR players act. You want to pretend they aren't trash that's fine,
---
It's me who resorts 
---
&gt;to pants on head idiotic hyperbole
---
Time-wise, yes.
---
But Rested XP also means you don't have to kill as many mobs to achieve the same progress.  If you're having a difficult time grinding/questing, then banking XP like this helps to mitigate the problem.
---
It works best if you're working on an alt as well, so that you can always be banking on one toon while leveling on another.  You'll get both characters to 60 much faster than a player who levels characters one at a time.
---
What did you spend 100 gold on at lvl 30? And how did you get 100gold at lvl 30?
---
Its basically just bartender combined with lorti ui (for darker ui). Nameplates look like neatPlates. I dont play shaman so I got no clue what the totem addon could be but you can probably find it easily on willitclassic.com
---
Lmaooo
---
With shadow disc ill still be able to heal dungeons?
---
It‚Äôs in the sounds options, I believe.  Something like combat warnings maybe?
---
Less AP, less crit, less defenses?
---
I‚Äôm working on my Alchemy, I‚Äôm at lvl 160ish what‚Äôs tour advice to lvl it out?
---
Gave up on ravenger &amp; picked up mograines might instead. Not nearly as much competition on the mace, &amp; it does more DPS. Lol
---
It's not a bug, empty corpses are still lootable
---
What do you want out of classic+?
---
Add group finder like tbc
---
I was referring to your question in relation to your downvotes. 
---
It is petty but it is also a popular topic to argue. I feel like there‚Äôs an overwhelming number of people who believe it‚Äôs ‚ÄúDM‚Äù for Deadmines (because it is). But at the same time, those that call it VC are either just ignorant and/or it has been so ingrained in their upbringing that they keep calling it VC. 
---
It all boils down to it was a server thing. Some servers called it VC, others DM.
---
Na, you just sell out as hard as possible to make as much money as possible while the gravy train is rolling, then if the game ever falls out of favor and the money tap turns off, you're already set for life and can just keep playing without worrying about streaming it.
---
Guys like soda and asmon, while I think they're both complete wastes of oxygen who promote the shittiest internet culture followers, have definitely made plenty enough money that if they've invested their money even remotely well, the could stop streaming today and still be comfortably set for life.
---
And then the mage will face tank half the dungeon because they cant wait 5 seconds to start spamming arcane explosion and you'll start wondering why they even bothered looking for a tank in the first place.
---
Where can I find this kind of Information? Do u have a link?
---
Hey man, if you searched on there you'd see plenty of people have reported it, including myself, but no response from Blizzard.
---
damn your ui sucks
---
A lot of people don't like the NE's, but man I love the cat mounts.  This coming from a Female NE hunter because they have the best bow animation.  Can't wait to get my kitty.

Heh, this guy's toast

I'm not a girl. I just use their emojis ü§∏
---
Burning steppes has been my go to since the beginning
---
Works both ways. I've been giefed by alliance and their ganking squads. The horde rallied smashed them for a good 45 mins
---
Because we need the spam, it gives us this classic feeling... just like looing at LFG-Chat in the client :)
---
Ya see those methods are what I use right, but problem is folks attacking immediately. I have the same issue the warrior in OP does lol.
---
You can try using the templates that are built in for starters, it has a number of built in that are incredibly useful.
---
I can build out the weak auras and provide export codes, just let me know what you are after. 
---
It's usually a matter of finding the right triggers, and displaying what you want.
---
A mage in the clan i'm in put it this way;
---
In retail, i polymorph a mob and laugh, haha look i turned him into sheep and never use it again.
---
In classic, it's a critical essential tool in my toolkit, which can mean the difference between life and death.
---
I do recall inspecting this on raiding 60s in IF, but I was still a baby Paladin at the time and not yet raiding... by early 2005 Tier 1 had its art.
---
Yes, your first two sentences really make your post constructive. Here, allow me to show you actual constructive criticism.
---
"Mods, if a post does not meet the minimum requirements, but has gained a large following with meaningful discourse, just message the author and have them update the post instead of just deleting it". See how easy that was? Didn't have to scream Nazi or anything, imagine that.
---
Compared to the growth of Vanilla and TBC, it's really not. Expansions also get the residual benefits of previous ones, much like how changing presidents works. The initial part of TBC's growth is likely still from Vanilla, just as the initial part of WotLK is likely still TBC peaking.
---
The minor bump at the halfway point of WoTLK coincides with cata's announcement, which is probably the driving factor there.
---
TBC has the second highest growth and ends in the peak sub count of all WoW's history. I wasn't all that thrilled with it, but from this data it's clearly the best by this objective standard. Perhaps there are other qualities that I'm not considering, but none have been suggested.
---
It makes the world smaller, since you just autofly in particular direction superfast.
---
iyeet
---
I've never heard of esdf. Please explain to me the benefits
---
Be happy it‚Äôs now.   Honestly if this was right before a raid boss or chance to get the item you wanted it be much more a problem.
---
I think his confusion is that you said "twink", where you probably meant "alt"...
---
YES PLEASE
---
This shit looks like 9gag meets classic wow
---
For me, the game really got good during BC. Only played vanilla for a few months before it came out and was really happy with all the new stuff in BC.
---
Gnome racial is good, dwarf racial is top tier. Problem is the vast majority of alliance players roll human, then whine about horde having better racials.
---
Given your level, SM:Cath is probably the easiest to farm.
---
If you want experience at the same time, Uldaman has great loot.
---
Holy shit. Its a picture of OP‚Äôs cat
---
Personally i rather take the risk of them ruining the game than TBC which IMO is already ruining the game
---
Fuck off dude. Fake or not I still enjoyed it. Stop being such a Debbie downer
---
That placement would only make clicking easier. As someone who has never been a clicker, I have also never had a desire to have a UI like this so...
---
I guess someone stole it from someone because I'm on NoggenFogger
---
Holy shit,  you're right. That's what I get for redditing without caffeine. Fixt.
---
I mean isn‚Äôt that just an alt? I think of a twink as no experience and stopping at the top of the pvp bracket like 19 29 etc.
---
This whole post is focused around you, and not the other people in the group.  How many cloth users were there in the group?  You have both leather and cloth in your loot table. You have twice the opportunity at loot you may want, depending on your choices.  That cloth is all they got.  Yes, you can roll on cloth, but you should defer to cloth classes first.
---
It's really convenient when you forgot who you are in guild chat again so you just look at the center of the screen.
---
I actually think it's reasonable to say that PvE tanks will get enough incidental stamina while getting their mitigation stats once they hit level 60 that they don't need to prioritize stamina at all.
---
Like, if it was possible end game to get gear with 0 stamina on it, that probably wouldn't be a concern, but I think that at all stages of raiding, there's a minimum number of HP you need, once you hit that additional stamina becomes almost negligible, and that you can't realistically gear for tanking without hitting that minimum.
---
The Stockades were originally supposed to be uninstanced, an area of elites just hanging out for everyone.
---
yea I wouldn't want to join that guy's guild.
---
You mean Corpsemaker for RFK, right?
---
There might be horde players on your server doing the exact same thing to ally players. You can‚Äôt possibly know how everyone behaves while they are playing. I find this kind of post pointless and you should roll on a pve server if you think that everyone should behave according to your moral standard even though the game itself doesn‚Äôt impose any specific rules when in comes to open-world pvp
---
trade your extras on general chat or post and buy them on the BB Auction House.  Best place to get them.
---
Jokes on you. On Faerlina this is an Asmongold viewer/Alliance member.
---
TL;DR; Can Druids be effective endgame tanks in classic? UBRS/Strat/Maybe MC. Is warrior solo leveling really that bad? Are Tanks or Healers the highest skill cap with a group that doesn't know what they're doing?
---
I re-rolled on a new server to play with my friends. I rolled a Hunter because I figured it would be the fastest way to catch up, and also a good way to level casually. We've got a guild of about 13 people who know each other IRL. Here's the issue... We're all freaking Hunters! We've got like 7 active members around the same level and it's mostly Hunters and rogues with one warlock and one shaman. I'm thinking of re-rolling because I think it's gonna be really hard for us to find instances, let alone end game content. 
---
I'm stuck between Warrior, Druid, or Priest. I'm leaning tank because my friends are not very good at Wow. I'm thinking a good tank would be able to keep them alive, and lead instances better than a good healer.
---
Druid: Pros: The ultimate PUG player, can heal or tank as needed, pretty fast solo leveling. Cons: not great at any endgame role. Question: Can I tank as a druid at 60?
---
Warrior: Pros: The best tank, really awesome once geared. Cons: Slowwww leveling process, this casual guild will probably never get past MC. Question: Is leveling a warrior really that bad? Am I gonna die if I pull a 2nd mob?
---
Priest: Pros: Pure healer, pretty fast leveling solo, Cons: Not a tank
---
Questions: None really, leveled to 60 pretty fast 10 years ago
---
&gt; because it‚Äôs just being thrown around
---
More like directly stated by developers like Kevin Jordan via their analytics.
---
Well it's not the first time I've seen it, so I guess we're at an impasse.
---
Spam BRD Arena runs, 80k exp/ hour, try to get at least 2 images in your team to keep runs to 15 minutes and rotate novas.
---
At the beginning of a dungeon I message my healer to ping me if they would like bigger pulls, otherwise it's a group-by-group dungeon.
---
Any dps that charges in ahead of myself are doomed to die. If you can't hold off from swinging your dick around for a literal second then I'm not wasting my time pulling aggro.
---
From a tank perspective, Dps Warriors are my biggest problem at the moment. Starting to class them as a Potato
---
Haha yes different letter, same concept.
---
You don't really neeed one. Just gotta use your brain as OP says and not pick the first listing.
---
I know I right I keep trying to think. Even if he missed out words still can't make it out.
---
Mine is on R because GW2 spoiled me with it, so I sacrifice the r key for auto run if a game allows it. I only played it briefly for a few years but damn if R isn't comfy
---
Thanks for the tip! Probably going to go with Enchanting for the extra buffs.
---
I like red guy.
---
Sub counts didn‚Äôt go up in TBC and WotLK because of TBC and WotLK. It was growing through that time because it‚Äôs WoW and a lot of people hadn‚Äôt even played for the first time yet.  
---
TBC and WotLK are obviously talked about fondly when most players who played WoW didn‚Äôt even play for the first time until after Vanilla.
---

It's comments like this from people who have never actually played mythic plus or did shrine of the storm or tol dagor when it was current.
---
Classic dungeons are not hard, they're just slow paced as you cannot zerg them down.  The mechanics are simple so it's not hard in the sense that you need to be skilled and coordinated... Merely cautious.
---
This was a common conversation a few years ago in online gaming. It's part of the idea of games as a service. You're not purchasing a product that you have ownership of in the end. Your ability to log into the service isn't ownership, and you are able to be denied that ability to access the service at the service provider's discretion.
---
Buy your epic mount. Lock and pally epic mounts cost mana which can be a matter of life and death if you're on a pop server. Plus you'll make the investment back by phase3

Would it be more time and gold efficient to simply do gathering on your alt, and tip another Leatherworker to make the items for you?

True, if you ever see someone call another kid, there's a 99% chance they're just barely above a preteen

Im still gonna roll for that sweet sweet swords, stop bothering anything you say wont stop me from doing it
---
Like I said previously 99% of these kids aren't grinding to be a top player either, I think grinding does count increasing your skill. Kids aren't playing restricted and practicing certain aspects of their game, at least not for long periods. They are playing to... play.
---
The people creating the popular minecraft servers aren't kids either.
---
Kids do not play grindy games, hence why there are no kids on classic nor OSRS despite OSRS literally originally being a game targetted at kids. Most kids aren't playing these games with grinds in mind.
---
TB is always packed on my server.
---
Wanted to have a discussion about Druid hybrid PVP/PVE. My main idea is to be an offtank for raids and heal when my tanking spot isn't needed, but also be fairly capable at 1v1's and organized pvp groups. For this I think I am basically required to do a NS/HotW spec. 
---
My main indecision point is the usefulness of putting 4 into heart of the wild in order to put one point in nature's grasp. In the end I would be sacrificing 4% stam and int for amazing CC against rogues and a RNG save against slow swinging melee. Is a 35% chance to CC worth the 4% drop in some primary stats?
---
I guess the side question is whether not having the 3% crit buff from feral is going to cause guilds to think twice about taking me.
---
You‚Äôre so awesome

This isn't RuneScape.  They're called guilds, not clans.  And yes, polymorph has great uses on retail mythic plus dungeons.

Can we please stop with the 'can we please stop with the can we please stop posts' posts?' Posts?

Damn, wish i had known that earlier, i've been vendoring or placing on the AH what i've made so far. Would make better sense to disenchant to level them professions together.
---
The meme you ripped off is cringeworthy / concerning. You took that and made it something awesome.
---
Honestly these experiences are necessary to appreciate how awesome smooth runs are.

buy a fishing pole

Yeah, that would be my guess too. I just did not know.

Someone give this man gold.

I didn't even notice the cat until you mentioned it xD

This comment just made my day!
---
It depends on what you want. If you want progression, it's best to gear the guild. If you want gear, it's best you leave and find somewhere you can rake it in. Either way, it's like two weeks into MC and we probably have several months of it left.

Your name sounds swedish so i'l assume you are aswell.

Server question. Just rolled ally on Stalagg. Buddy is on there, but rarely plays. It's my alt so I'm not too worried, but still. Someone that's been on there for awhile, how bad is it really pop wise? I heard that "low" in classic is still higher than og servers on vanialla, though I don't know how true that is. I'm only level 8, the but LookingForGroup channel is really, really dead compared to my primary server that moves a mile a minute.
---
Only Tauren Rogue? You think those are just cows in Elwynn Forest?
---
You can also disenchant using a level 5 alt, and there are no BOP tailoring items besides the 3 epic robes so there is no real reason to tie the two together.
---
Absolute mad lad.
---
There is a bit of a circlejerk when it comes to pvp with racials, shadowmeld is insanely powerful on hunters and escape artist is super powerful on several classes. Alliance racials are worse usually, but not by that much for pvp. Pve alliance has a much larger population, because paladins are fantastic in raids. Shamans are okay healers, do middle of the pack dmg, and have some okay buff totems, but pallies are amazing healers and blessings are super strong in classic.
---
When you get to 40 yea it begins to get easy, before that it's the hardest caster class imo.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I had friends that were Into console gaming until my early 20s. Wife doesn‚Äôt like my gaming habit. I play from like 8:30-11:30 unless something comes up or she wants to do anything. 
---
It‚Äôs rough not being able to talk about your accomplishments to anyone!
---
I used to love talking junk with my guildies. I‚Äôm in the same guild I was in vanilla-wotlk and now they‚Äôre all on the extreme side of being progressive to we‚Äôre I‚Äôm nervous and have to weigh every word not to offend anyone.
---
It's about hit/type of mobs/their level/your weapon skill not Revenge skill level if you miss it man.
---
I‚Äôve really been considering rolling a mage. Self sufficient in the form of conjuring F/W and quick to make gold. Only thing I‚Äôm afraid of is that you‚Äôll get blown up by pretty much anything. But perhaps the ‚Äòeasier‚Äô playstyle could be what I need.
---
Weapon chain, Fiery, or +5 damage.
---
Weapon chain and +5 damage should be kind of cheap. Fiery is big money.
---
you can usually make more money if you disenchant BoP blues during dungeon runs. Some classes like hunter or lock can solo Maraudon &amp; Co and the shards often sale for a fortune
---
\&gt;  I‚Äôve read many guides telling me that only Ret spec is viable during the levelling process
---
If you are looking to absolutely min/max the leveling process, sure. 
---
You can absolutely level prot or holy. In fact, I'm leveling a Prot pally right now and am 34.
---
As a ret pally, consider yourself DPS+Support, throwing out heals and bubbles, buffs, and doing damage control on mobs that flee or aggro healers. Bring plenty of water and be prepared.
---
Prot pallies work fine in most any 5 man dungeon once you get consecrate and stick 3 points in to improved righteous fury. Sure, you may need to BoS the top DPS, but that's fine.
---
Holy pallies are great healers, and you can get away with ret healing for lower level dungeons.
---
There is phasing in classic?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the WW is still better other than melee cleave farming dungeons, but who knows, I don‚Äôt have any evidence, just possible comments and gossip here and there.
---
Thanks for the response
---
Thieve's Tools can usually be purchased at a vendor near the Rogue trainer in any major city.
---
RemindMe! 7 hours
---
I aleays buff everyone while waiting for my group at dungeons ive been killed at SM because buffing triggered my pvp flag
---
They got server first Onyxia on Skeram
---
I banked the item and still use the transmog skin whenever I play retail, which is not often, but I'm glad I banked it :)
---
Yeah I already got my nemesis.
---
Yes having 1 point NG would be a life saver for sure, so go for it.
---
As for not having the 3% crit buff, it's a minor perk of having a feral tbh. It mostly helps the tanks generate threat, but having an instant cast giant heal you can pull out, and more flexibility with being able to heal, trumps a 3% crit aura.
---
Different difficulty.
---
Vanilla dungeons require more spatial awareness (extra packs/patrols can be a disaster), a longer time commitment, are more likely to benefit from CC, and you need to worry about the tank/DPS/healer aggro dance.
---
Retail dungeons have far more complex mechanics on both routine mobs and bosses and require far more twitch skill and careful attention to class and group optimization, especially as you start climbing up in Mythic + difficulty.
---
There's a design ethos change too...the Vanilla dungeons were like careful, hand-crafted D&amp;D adventures, made to be experienced over several sessions in some cases, that doled out story chunks and colored in game lore. They were intended to be moved through slowly and methodically, with careful pulling and attention to respawns...the deeper you got the higher the stakes.
---
Modern dungeons are more or less corridor sprints where you're often racing a timer, and "careful/methodical" goes out the window in favor of pinpoint execution...the more you push the pace, the better the rewards. They have more in common mechanically with looter shooters and ARPGs than the old EQ style dungeon grinds.
---
Good luck splitting all that loot
---
You dont need to rebuy, but if you go from one spec to another you still need to buy new ranks for a spell you never had
---
Its a great mechanic that i always hoped other games would steal.
---
But instead, they added attendance rewards and daily missions to force you to login every day...
---
You should have counted on them kick you for not congratulating.  All your fault.
---
Frostbite will kill your aoe. For aoe you need to keep a tight pack and when one or two freeze in place it splits the pack and fucks you
---
Yep 0 irl people, at least one *kind of* understands.
---
The rest don't, yet love to watch brain dead tv shows with their spare time.
---
Grob Mob!
---
Honestly, after rolling on an RP server I've never gone back. Even if you don't RP, the server atmosphere feels so much more like a community.
---
There was a guy in general chat paying 1g to any healer that would help him, and he was lvl 39
---
You did not make a mistake in my eyes. You can easily find comparable 2h weapons. 2h axe, 2x mace in deadmines. 2h axe in SFK, etc. Meanwhile, those mail pants **should** last you longer than the 2h staff you would've picked.
---
I'm partial to casters as I feel they have a higher skill-cap. I think Warlocks are the scariest to deal with in a BG. But that's coming from a mage.
---
The least you could is to name the guild and server so people know to avoid them
---
Ah thank you for the offer, but given an orc speaking to a troll, the troll would just hear it normally
---
Just a lil over 10 days played. I did dungeons fro. 12 to 60 as a warrior. Always got those pocket heals yo.
---
Lotta shit design in this game.  It's a wonderful game but idiots need to stop acting like it's 100% perfect.
---
I love all the "source?" comments. Announcements by people who don't get the joke.
---
Eastern kingdoms is missing revantusk village as well.
---
I'm a lock and have fun plenty of dungeons without a mail tank, or with a non-prot tank. Tbh, they're not entirely necessary save for high level dungeons. Lower down, all damage done is distributed across players because everyone is holding their own aggro and the healer will be oom, but the team will survive.
---
&gt; you can absolutely solo this quest at 30.
---
&gt; you can'd kill the 40 elite alone
---
so what you're saying is you can't do it solo?
---
To 39 I did 5/5 spirit tap then went disc. Respec shadow at 40 and after shadowform back into disc
---
Because I haven't seen a single Undead warrior yet. Maybe you have seen loads, I don't know, but my comment was purely about my personal experience as I wasn't speaking on behalf of everyone playing WoW Classic.
---
Yes and no. The benefit of combat swords is that it has a lot of throughput and sustainability. SS costs 40 energy, so you're generating combo points a bit faster than the 60 energy backstab, allowing more eviscerates, which especially since it actually scales with AP makes it pretty good. That, combined with a nice slow MH sword and sword spec will have your white damage pretty high. However, dagger builds scale better with high crit. Once you have high crit, usually around AQ40/Naxx gear, a seal fate build becomes strong since you should have well over 30% buffed crit.
---
That said, a good dagger rogue is better than a bad sword rogue. And you're the only class who will be rolling on stuff like perdition's blade so you don't have to compete with warriors. If you like the dagger playstyle better, it's not a make or break kind of thing. The difference at the very most on a pure DPS fight is like 5-10%. Plus, you'll be able to destroy people in pvp.
---
&gt;Yeah but we're not talking a 50+ dungeon with a BOE drop.
---
There are twink drops that are worth hundreds of gold.
---
&gt;Further this completely nullifies the whole purpose of the NEED vs GREED mechanics... So why tf do I not get priority of the item when it drops in the wilderness? That's literally how the game was designed.
---
Those are game mechanics, this is a social mechanic. You don't get priority because players don't think that's a fair way to divide loot. Make groups with people who agree with you, or tell people ahead of time how you feel the loot should be divided in this case.
---
Social mechanics are a big part of Classic, but they're not iron clad by game code. Talk to people before hand, make it clear needing on a BoE is unfair and that it should be greed or you're ninja-ing. If they disagree you can find a new group, or convince members of the party to kick those players.
---
What‚Äôs the best way to get bags early. I‚Äôm almost level 10 and I haven‚Äôt looted any AND I can‚Äôt find anyone willing to craft me some
---
I have an addon that will click accept when I press space, but the option to override enchants seems to be a protected function and has to be mouse clicked.  I have not tried with this exact macro, but I would assume my Dialoguekey addon is just executing this command when I press space.
---
Which ones?
---
All good! I have a drink or two more days than not.
---
If I could just have TBC class balancing in Vanilla, I think I would be pretty happy. If it did go into TBC, I dont think it would need to go past that, but once you open the gate like that, how do you stop it there.
---
Steelarrow Crossbow was green quality!
---
Because they see how much more people like the 15 year old game instead of the shit they have out now?  Hopefully this classic phenomenon shows them what people like, they like playing an MMO and being immersed in the world. 
---
If they were to make those same mistakes they'd have to be so fckin stupid. But I guess this is Blizzard were talking about, so I guess it is a possibility they'd do something that dumb with classic+
---
Can we please stop with the can we please stop posts
---
Exactly. The more stun resist you have, the more effective your stun resist is.
---
At 0% stun resist, 25% additional means you'll be stunned 25% less.
---
At base 5%, 25% additional means you'll be stunned:
---
 (0.95 - 0.70)/0.95  = 0.25/0.95 = 26% less
---
At 20% stun resist, 25% additional means you'll be stunned:
---
(0.80 - 0.55)/0.8 = 0.25/0.8 =  31.25% less
---
TLDR: Flat % increases to a flat % resistance are more % effective as your resistance increases. Which sounds really confusing.
---
IIRC, there was a 'practice' web games made to practice this encounter back in Vanilla/BC days.
---
Thanks! I think SM farming put me ahead. I got in a couple melee cleave groups which were giving me a level every 1-1.5 hours from 30-41 as a priest.
---
... it‚Äôs literally full for most of the day lol
---
Swords are faster for leveling p1. You get  thrash blade which is enough even for MC. The 30s you get sword of omen. 
---
If you want leveling fastest combat swords will get ya there
---
If you dont like combat swords then you can either sub spec with hemo or go seal fate. Both are a different playstyles! Both are mega fun!
---
I got 40 on pure sub spec and then changed to seal fate from there...  
---
Make sure though you understand that combat swords are while boring, at this point better than sub and SF. 
---
Though PvP is another world!! 
---
With sub you will be getting crazy utility making you're playstyle 1hko orient 
---
With SF. It's a different game, 1 crit can steamroll you into crazy chains, and backstabbing is awesome vs other players.
---
They've disabled it in classic? I thought that didn't happen till a later expansion
---
Honestly, I feel like it's not nice to see. It's literally pay to win for PvP.
---
You‚Äôre entirely right, but this was days ago now and the same level 2 bots are still there still camping the vendor, and it‚Äôs also the company that will action the accounts the bots are on, but have a history of letting the accounts those bots are finding go free cause ‚Äúmight be a set up‚Äù. 
---
At least that‚Äôs how I remember most of their past actions. 
---
I do see their point, but it‚Äôs also sucky when it‚Äôs bluntly obvious one account is sending the other loads of gold and/or rare items with no return.
---
&gt;I wasn't asking about your gear. I asked if you were a raid leader. That includes things like actually organizing the raids, determinding who will accompany you, having some external platforms for organisation, dissolving drama, stuff like that.  
---
Yes.  That is why i started off my sentence with the word "absolutely".  We had a website with DKP tracking, raid signups, raid scheduling and a forum.  I didnt make the site itself but i helped the other officers schedule raids, fix DKP issues, manage sign ups and classes etc.  The standard things all guild officers had to do back then.  You seem to not understand that someone could actually enjoy that aspect of the game.  I did and a lot of people do which is why i think 40 mans should be kept and more 40 man raids added.    
---
&gt;I mean, who organized that stuff in your raid?  
---
Myself with the other guild officers, just like in an other guild ever.    
---
&gt;People in GW2 are still salty that they missed quite a lot of content.   
---
I am not worried about this.
---
True! They still go together nicely though

Mine is Pizdic ...

Oh yeah, Ive dealt with this before. Sometimes it works in your favor, sometimes it doesnt. Ive been kicked from instances that werent going well seemingly *because* I was a hunter and someone yelled loud enough. And if its a premade that you latch on to and they dont like hunters, forget about it.
---
My only point with that is that sometimes its easier to dismiss and roll through, depending on the circumstance. Theres just as many people who appreciate the extra body and DPS that comes with it, though.
---
Has anyone tried the elemental mage PvP build from wowhead? They say it plays faster and it's good if you like blowing people up. Sounds good to me. But I wanna know the results people have had.
---
My brother does this shit and he's made a ton of money. He sells tons of green gear this way. Just cold-whispering people in stormwind or ironforge.
---
I'm not sure how it works in classic but if the stun resist stacks multiplicatively you would cap out at about 40% stun resist.
---
Well... Except for that skull alliance mage that kept ganking me while I tryd questing in Hillsbrad farms the other day...
---
This is Otterly ridiculous.
---
Auction house might be your best bet, linen bags are probably 3-4s each.
---
No honor in the horde:/
---
This list is pretty nice: [Click](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1tkrr/all_dungeons_by_minmax_mob_level_for_best_exp/).  
---
It shows min level for different roles and max level for xp.
---
For 30-40 you will feel like a god
---
nice
---
As a GM I'll just say, among all of the dumb shit reasons to kick someone that I've ever seen, this is right up there at the top of the list.
---
can confirm this dude is on another planet, DPS is easy to find, healer/tank harder. been like that since vanilla, private, and classic

Alliance here and I always jump in to help unless I‚Äôm a horde dominated zone and just started questing. Also I only have slight shame in killing horde that are low health. Last night I watched a mage and rogue struggle with a group of mobs. They finished them off but we‚Äôre both at 10% or less HP. It was a very satisfying multi shot double kill.
---
Irl?
---
Great story.  For the horde!
---
Too much time. LOL!
---
And the other question is PVE or PVP - http://classicrealminfo.com/
---
Don't worry, I got you - https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24962-MikScrollingBattleTextClassicquickfix.html
---
I‚Äôve met 2 Night Elf Males id play with again. 
---
Idk what it is about this character that just draws in the worst players ever. Bonus points for hunter or the shockingly awful Demon Hunters.
---
It got to the point where I would just flat out avoid them running Mythics in retail. If you joined my group and you were a NE Male I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not taking that chance. 
---
I met a good one in a time-walking dungeon that was a DH Tank. Me and my friend spoke on discord about how we couldn‚Äôt believe we‚Äôd found not only a good DH, but a good NE Male. 
---
The second I met in classic recently, I was worried at first, when he was placing traps outside the contested Zul Farrak instance and /loling at players he caught. The sound of the NE Male hunter laughing sent chills down my spine, but it was late at night and DPS options were limited. He wasn‚Äôt actually too bad. 
---
Maybe after all these years I‚Äôve just been consistently unlucky? To be honest I‚Äôd only really started to make the correlation over the last couple of years.  And I‚Äôve only decided to stop playing with them within the last few months.
---
Yea, healing touch is extremely clutch. I am morseo looking for survivability. I was running DM last night with two other people (level 22 and 23) and we were getting destroyed by the Pirate Defias. 
---
I was trying to kill Van Cleeve (SP?) for the quest reward. I stupidly ran DM 4-5 times with a group beforehand and didn't have the quest.
---
Gonna try and tank as a bear and use swipe for maximum damage, but will need a healer for sure to get through this thing.
---
Have you even played gnome? Escape artist has a one second cast time which in all pvp situations doesnt get interrupted by skill more luck
---
If you don‚Äôt like my hobbies I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way is how I have grown to feel towards people that show this. I took an entire week off bragged about it to co workers some felt it was a waste but for me it was a chance to make lifelong memories.
---
They aggro through walls, their temple is made of paper.
---
Probably a Zul'gurub try from their New architect.
---
Tldr at bottom;
---
Okay this is what I suffer from. I'm just going give a breakdown of where I started..
---
After a month of going back and forth I decided to go warlock at the start of classic. Got him to level 38, but then I got the itch to play melee
---
Rolled a warrior. Got him to 24. Decided endgame warrior isn't something I want.
---
Rolled a rogue, got to level 9 (not a huge loss but still a waste of time)
---
Where I'm at today... level 25 druid going strong. The druid was my first character I vanilla to hit 60, I knew nothing back then about wow or mmorpgs in general. However, with my experience now I know this is a great choice for me. I can switch between different playstyles all while keeping the same character. Just respec and change some gear. I enjoy every aspect of the game, so by choosing a druid, I'll always be able to do whatever I have the itch for. 
---
I ended up DELETING my warrior and warlock, and I feel great about my decision. Unfortunately I'm back at work now, so I don't have a lot of time to play, so leveling alts is a terrible decision in my opinion. I want to focus on one character and nothing else.
---
Tldr; my advice is to try and figure out what you want to do endgame. A hybrid class offering different roles might be exactly what you are looking for. Either way narrow it down, make your decision and don't look back, just set your goal to 60. I think every class can be boring at time with leveling push through it. Constantly rerolling is exhausting and frustrating.
---
Good luck with your decision
---
Witchcraft, I say! Witchcraft!

---
Lol i grinded here till 41, did fine with sweeping strikes killing two mobs at the same time. 
---
Got cocky and tried it on the dragonkin, got rekt.
---
Good riddance. Glad you found a better guild.
---
Because everyone knew it was south park and the joke was naming similar shows.
---
What add-on do you have that tells you the vendor/auction/disenchant cost? Is it accurate? Does the auction price represent average price or minimum buyout?
---
I'm using auctioneer at the moment but the tooltip has way too much useless info that can't be turned off. All I want to know is the average disenchant value and the min buyout so I can know whether to vendor, auction, or disenchant something. Your add-on seems to do just that, without the gargantuan tooltip.
---
Nah what?
---
Warrior can break our of and be immune to fear for 10 seconds at a time, every 30 seconds.
---
I hid the name because of the "no witch hunt" rule here. Not sure why I hid mine though lol. It's Wickipedia
---
Well you asked about general difficulty and used an example of leveling, so I was just responding to the difficulty of overall 1.3.
---
Obviously things like the flight path could be fixed easily, but that is just an example of one of the changes they made.
---
Why is that?
---
\#roguethings
---
No. You‚Äôre not.
---
Or at least, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it.
---
Thanks I'll have to give this a try!
---
THUNDER
---
Are you filtering skills to "Unavailable" in the trainer window?
---
20 hours a day in mara isn‚Äôt so bad for the people that spent 120 hours aoe grindig dungeons.
---
I even shut my podcast off and turned on game sounds. All I needed was a VR headset and I would have had full immersion.
---
Low levels staff on warrior can be real legit even with int or spirit on.
---
Using consumables in PvP is a long time accepted thing for vanilla
---
Maybe don't make a character with a random word as their and you won't have that problem
---
Woosh
---
grind for the nelf kitty like a real gamer
---
Auction house or get tailoring and craft yourself. With just the cloth you collected leveling you'll have way more than you need for bags
---
Also on Stalagg. I was definitely not going to transfer due to queue times. But I'm seriously considering it due to faction imbalance. It's unfourtunate because I'd say there are a number of alliance with the same mind-set; which will only snowball the imbalance into an even worse scenario.
---
If you haven't already, go to the AH and buy the highest rank of enchanting wand you can get for your level. Prices are so flooded on my server that I'm getting them for a couple silver over the vendor price.
---
Combat for me is PW:Shield Self, Mind Blast enemy, SW:Pain the enemy as soon as mindblast casts and then just tap 1 to wand until they're dead. 
---
Like you said, definitely not doing the same 10 mob AOE pulls that a mage can manage but against any single mob up to a level or three higher than you you'll end combat with near-full HP and full mana from regen while wanding.
---
I never had 100 gold, I edited the photo that's the amount i need for a mount/training.
---
yea people really believe ally and horde act different lmao
---
It's actually a really strong weapon so he could use it for the raw damage. We had a feral druid do that since nobody else needed it. I've seen some warriors with it too
---
Thunderclap you have to be in Battle stance. It costs a shit ton of rage too. If it's a pack of 4 or more, and I'm not asking for any cc, then I'll charge in, wait 1 sec to get the rage needed, then Tclap, then to def stance. I think it was in BC they made Tclap usable in def stance. It made a huge difference and it was a good damage reduction ability since it slows enemy weapon swing time.
---
Undead rogues are the biggest twats I've ever met in my life - both in game and in real life.
---
No you shouldn't, all your luck is gone now.
---
I view it differently. In video games you are *in* the movie/TV show, and you actively participate/guide the story and your experience. TV shows and movies are just flat experiences.
---
only thing he is missing is a Fedora
---
Damn Alliance has some great looking characters. I love my undead mage but hate the way he looks, super scrawny and everything. Honestly might reroll and ditch my lvl 40 undead mage just because of the racial looks lol. I dont feel "as proud" of my guy as I should :(
---
It's fun and entertaining while you're on autopilot
---
I got mine at 40, bit late but still was an upgrade since Herod has been stingy.
---
Nail on head. I just roll my eyes when I see multiboxers. Always struck me as rather pathetic.
---
Wow I wish I would‚Äôve thought of this before!
---
I have a personal kos stancedance on EU mograine him and his pal warlock... I haven't seen him again yet but I'll corpse camp him in my shadow form if I do.
---
I've had over 5 whispers at least from people telling me I'm on some list now for camping them
---
I will kill any undead rogue I see without fail. Level 20-60 it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you‚Äôre an undead rogue I‚Äôm putting you down. Scummiest, most opportunistic bastards I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
What exactly was wrong with my response? Genuinely curious
---
I'm all for being sexually open, have all the partners you want so long as it's consensual, but boy do some people sound attention starved. I know exactly the type you're talking about.
---
I personally have seen it work on private servers while leveling an orc.
---
From private server experience of my friends, it never gets super pricy apparently. Pets are just really annoying to manage in Classic.
---
It's not going to be worth 1000g most likely, even if more casual players around this time means people will have tolerance for pet mechanics.
---
Imo everyone overvalues the humans weapons skills
---
I also main a mage, 35 currently. I just start drinking the second combat ends, and try to get at least 30-40% before attacking the next set of mobs, or however much I expect I'd need to help finish the fight. Then just repeat for the rest of the dungeon.
---
I'm so glad mages can conjure drinks, it has without question saved me a decent amount of coin.
---
&gt; all the conveniences
---
Other than flying, what conveniences did TBC add? Curious as I started in TBC so I don't know at all and flying is the only thing I ever really see complaints about.
---
You must have missed the part where I said I just assume it's a troll. You also missed the part where that personality does actually exist. The autistic weeb is quite cancerous. I just hadn't seen it since high school
---
feral doesn't use the damage from the weapons, it's more for stats.  Hence why the mace is gnomer is a ferals bis at 60.
---
Better dead than red.
---
You know at some point a dude was wicked upset at the game and his wife came over and pulled his headset off to nag and he only saw undead rogue.
---
Who's Red?
---
Red's dead baby,
---
Red's dead.
---
I wish I could move copper at that price
---
That's something I love about being a warlock, you can't always win, but you can almost always ensure mutual destruction if they aren't several levels above you.
---
Just roll the one you have the most fun with. Both are relevant.
---
You‚Äôre severely undercounting the asshat population around here.
---
I love how this guy is like "I can beat your character with my 5 characters!"
---
You actually want a slow ranged wep as a hunter, slower the better
---
Well Gratz you dodged a bullet
---
This is why you use an addon to compare vendor value to average disenchanting value. You can vend and use the money to buy mats instead. 
---
It's basically always better to do this with weapons.
---
farm ulda for the 2h(s) from boss or gatorbite in maura
---
I would say Classic+ would be like Brexit, narrowly popular until people have to engage on the details, then no single form of Classic+ would be widely popular
---
It was probably a boe
---
They already said that BGs are going to be cross realm on release. Queues are not going to be an issue for anyone.
---
How exactly does + healing work? I have a mace that adds "up to 15" to healing spells, but don't notice a difference when using a heal that does 250 to 300 healing. Is it just a roll from 1-15 that is added to a roll result of the heal?
---
OP didn't credit someone that took a world of warcraft asset and turned it into a sprite? OMG no way! What is this travesty!
---
11 days played. I solo grinded, only 2 dungeon runs. No guide used.
---
Dont be too upset. Anyone whose self esteem is so low that they demand validation from internet strangers probably has some no shit IRL issues that have nothing to do with you. Its not you, its him or her.
---
Cool. Thanks. I was about to ask what discord Kirtonos was on.
---
Oh. My. God. Thank. You.  
---
I had no idea that was an option outside of addons, and I‚Äôm terrified of addons after my account was hacked many years ago. ‚ÄúNot enough rage!‚Äù Is a dialogue I hear throughout the day in my head and it‚Äôs making me feel insane.
---
That is absolutely amazing! Thank you so much that's just massively helped me out!
---
Just use an arms or fury build to level.
---
Sometimes you can just smell the retail on people.
---
If you're considering end game PvE resto are more support where as a geared holy is amazing. In PvP druid will have slightly more movility however holy is a plate class so may take more dmg.
---
Rogues will always be favored against you untill/unless you've dedicated yourself to get kitted in the endgame. In an equally skilled setting cat does not beat rogue, bear does not beat warrior, boomkin certainly doesn't beat anything, it's how you mix them. If you survive the long levelling process and get geared for the infamous HOTW spec and learn to use it against other classes, you'll be a god only beaten by few. Even when the odds are against you, you'll have the utility to chose your own fights.
---
Asmongold even though it is hilarious he called us horde mud hut dwellers supposedly, I feel obligated to rage camp him if I ever get the opportunity, For teh Horde!!!1
---
For me it was which one I liked the look of better. Going to be staring at it days at a time, might as well enjoy the aesthetic.
---
Wow, you must be a terrible person to be around.
---
Flip a coin, or go by appearance.
---
Or Ply the mage for drinks. I love giving out sippy cups in a dungeon. Makes me feel like that spell is more useful than just for me.
---
I've seen 57 in chat
---
You should be reading it as "LF1M : Tank then g2g". They're advertising they filled the 3 DPS and 1 healer spot as well.
---
4 mages 1 priest.
---
They are god tier in pve.
---
Warriors
---
Is it odd that I have never played WoW, or the new old release?
---
I've only tried 2 MMO games, Asheron's call and D&amp;D beta (when it was in testing).
---
Other than that I never felt like there was anything to enjoy playing online, with one exception, that being team fortress, which I wasted like 6 years doing in my spare time. I learned all kinds of tricks, like using a medic grenade to fling myself through a hole in the map (a flaw in the map physics). So much fun back then.
---
It absolutely is an issue if you are in the middle of something else and you are getting interrupted with a meaningless pm that isn't even relevant to you from an absolute stranger.
---
60
---
I sold them on AH but only essences sold at all and even then it was a toss up between essences ah price and the effort that went into them and just selling the weapons to a vendor
---
Hey,
---
I'm a bit bummed about this Mage meta. It's the class I easily find the most fun to play, (not as an aoe grind) but due to the negative stigma around the class at the moment I've been trying out other classes.
---
I just don't enjoy them as much though, but I'm also concerned I'm going to struggle to find groups if I go back to my mage or be forced to be aoe if I want to group up. I was wondering if any mages who are levelled up could tell me of their experience so far?
---
lol wat.  Escape Artist is ass in most situation, basically only relevant vs Frost Nova, ONE spell in the game, and then only if you're playing melee... and even in that specific situation I'd say that the orc, tauren and troll racials are better, given the cast time on EA.
---
Hardiness beats everything hands down, WotF is god tier in small scale PvP, and War Stomp is grossly underrated. Escape Artist doesn't hold a candle to those, Stoneform is the only relevant Alliance racial and it's still not in the big boy league.
---
The whole point of bringing warrior tanks over other tanks, is that they can use shield block to EASILY push crits/crushing blows off the table, if you're not going to invest in that then just roll a friggen druid, atleast then you bring some kind of utility.
---
Do not EVER invest in things that proc when you get crit, its antithetical to being a tank.
---
Tusks, Ears, Shrunken Heads..
---
Imagine bidding 1c on the item and getting juicy profit. I'd bid on all them loots.
---
That's possible, when they will allow paid transfers, afaik the only forbidden is from PVE to PVP.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler?
---
Fuck 'em
---
Did it yesterday. Tusks, Necklaces and Shrunken Heads from a specific level 37 mob on the coast.
---
I'd have to agree and say druid. Dont get me wrong holy paladins are gods in pvp but imo ret kinda useless in competitive pvp.  No reliable gap closer or slow.
---
Based on what you said druid sounds good.
---
Wow, you actually got a plane with working WiFi??!! Mine is always unavailable and when I ask a flight attendat they say they will 'reset' the system... never works xD
---
I didn‚Äôt click, was the video bullshit?
---
I feel like an orc bias ... ^(/s)
---
Wasn't ret pretty much shit in vanilla and actually decent in TBC?
---
Sounds like PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
Don't you?
---
Yes you have to unshift first before going into a different form. You can make macros to do this for you seamlessly,since shifting out of forms does not incur the global cooldown. An easy shift/powershift macro for cat form looks like this
---
```#showtooltip Cat Form
---
/dismount
---
/cancelform [form:2/4]
---
/cast [form:3] Cat Form; [form:1] Bear Form
---
/cast [noform:3] Cat Form```
---
The only two dudes streaming this event had a following of maybe 5-10 people each if even that.  
---
Not every person streaming is a mass streamer.
---
According to this, active Horde outnumbers active Alliance
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/benediction
---
Yup
---
I know that, but thanks for the heads up.
---
Above lv 30, there are 9k Horde and 6.6k Alliance active characters with the average being 5.5k Horde and 3.4k Alliance on peak times (1 week ago)  
---
Def felt way more than this at Alliance side, can't know about horde, but the ratio is 2:1 Horde on every damn map
---
Listen there little horde.
---
First of all, no i got less than no honor. I will ensure youll die slowly and to a mob.
---
Second, the less of a chance you have the better.
---
Third, the more you cant progress the better.
---
Its a 70/30 H/A server and i will kill everyone especially lowlvls to get them rerolling/change servers.
---
Lol I love how it says updated version too, I can give advice without even making a video
---
Just take skinning.
---
Classic is 3 and it goes up to 10.
---
Layering is a change so you've already, GG.
---
The last fight this is pretty much what I did and I ended it with over 70% of my health and never saw the guy again. So I should use a macro that cancels the form im in and puts me into either cat, bear, or travel?
---
Oh yeah, maybe so. Not sure about SM boes but SFK is full of them.
---
$10 says OP has a generic female name.
---
Tell me how exactly you guarantee crippling poison procs? Lol. It's almost always on the offhand and is not 100% application. With no proc of crippling against a mage you can't do much else dude. 
---
Granted, he should have a dagger swap ambush macro.
---
They added the color coding in TBC.
---
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0_(undocumented_changes)
---
If u mean for levelling like i understand ya go Arms, until 60 u can tank perfectly with it, especially with the talents that conserve rage when you switch stance !
---
I mean going off of personal opinion, i would say they are...
---
So buy these items and repost them and make profit?
---
Do you play a cloth-only calss?
---
Okay, but why is redridge functionally ass cancer?
---
I got two toons to raiding in vanilla on horde so I figured the barrens was pretty bad just because you spent so long there. But redridge is basically the barrens but half the size and designed by an asshole.
---
Choose which one you like to play more. You have leveled them enough to know mostly what each class feels like. As for end game PvE and PvP, remember that respeccing gets very expensive so switching back and forth doesn't make much sense.
---
"Free PvP trinket" that only works on the weakest forms of CC.  It's good, but you're overrating it by a lot.
---
I plan on maining a shadow priest end game. But from what others tell me it's best to roll disc/holy until the 50 lvls. Are they correct? You seem to be the only one saying there isn't much difference
---
There is a sweet leveling rotation guide on the warrior discord.  Basically saying use rend up to level 20 to start off fights, then start using SA as long as the mob is over a % of health.  Then you never train or use rend after rank 4 rend.  
---
I guess the only thing I don't understand is why overpower ranks are not being trained if they cause bonus damage it seems useful to train them and cleave.  Especially if our weapon average damage is so low at low levels, that the bonus damage is a large percentage of the weapon's damage.  
---
It has been enjoyable saving rage and spamming hamstring Hms for dodge procing over power.
---
I just discovered dance wanding as well lol, I just wish my guy was a little less scrawny is all. I feel like a peasant seeing every other race look awesome in their gear! I guess mage's arent really supposed to look like a 'absolute unit' so I will try to embrace the undead groove as you mentioned lol. Maybe i'll roll a troll hunter or Tauren warrior later to fulfill my dream to look like OP :P
---
Herod was pretty rough but it looks like over the last week or so a lot of horde has transferred off. Was 65:35 when I checked week 2 and now it‚Äôs closer to 56:44 as of a few days ago if I remember correctly. Feels like there are a lot fewer horde around as well.
---
boo bear? :D
---
Go Druid because you can‚Äôt be a Horde Paladin. ;P
---
Then those servers are going to get full also..never ending circle
---
None of you mentioning
---
Resist.
---
Back-half smash, front-half splash.... That cats back is broken. LOL
---
Reddit has absolutely ruined the word wholesome.
---
I think it's a combination of that and just the snowball effect. People started having this "alliance always loses!" mentality back then which made Horde more appealing to many, making Alliance even less appealing as a result, hence snowballing.
---
Weird I have the same one maxed out and after 15min de experience is trash.
---
Hey thats a good idea. I think Ill swap S for W though. My hand rests easier this way.
---
I didn't have sound, but it looked like "pickpocket and sell stuff" and then zoomed in on a stack of 5 rogue diaries selling for over 2 gold.
---
Lol this is the description of hell, you aren‚Äôt the ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù you are being fucking anally raped and the second you enter a contested zone. How is this fun?
---
ppl talking about this like it's the law lol. It's only Blizzard rules. They allow it, end of story.
---
It's not hard at all. You don't need any consumables besides mana pots. Two priests in my guild already have it and soloed the entirety of it.
---
I was in the chess club, age of empires club and science club at school.
---
Still see 5-6 people from back the regularly who all still play games in their free time even though we‚Äôre pushing 30 now.
---
As for people at work that‚Äôs a whole different story.
---
Buy 4x6 slot bags from the AH at the beginning of your journey. The additional loot you can carry home will pay for the few silvers you used to get the bags. Every item you have to destroy/leave unlooted is money lost.
---
All primary and secondary starting areas, have quests for 4-8 slot bags. If you are alliance, you can also pick up a 10 slot bag from Duskwood quests as early as level 20 for free.
---
Once you get a bit of gold, I recommend switching to 4x10 slot bags for the remainder of your journey  (ideally 2 from AH and 2 from quests). Those will carry you through to the beginning of the endgame.
---
Undead is the most worthless race
---
That requires having enough gold to buy all the ones undercutting you and doesn't stop it from happening again. Then you're left with more items at higher cost each that still don't move
---
"Hey dude hows ur wife doing ? :)"

I'm around the same amount of time as you as 55.  Lots of afk, lots of stalling to help friends, and a few too many irl commitments.
---
Yeah I understand when pretentious Redditors try to act holier than thou because they linked something. 
---
There is no requirement to share an artwork inspiration. He didn't steal anything. This is his own creation. You are just a fool
---
Where are you seeing those stats?  I'm not giving you shit I genuinely want to know because all i've found online are blizz forum posts asking for stats and some google spreadsheet that has no source on population stats.
---
Can I easily (as in no switching of talents) tank while leveling as a Feral DPS? I‚Äôd like to mainspec Feral PVP while still being able to tank 5 mans.
---
Is feral casual friendly? I only have a couple hours a day to play
---
Well, I can kinda only repeat myself. It's definitely not an united front. But if you'd draw a circle around most / all of the ideas, they would still be fairly close together compared to TBC without changes.
---
Feeling kinda cute, might Tank for you later idk
---
People say this, but occasional keyboard turning lets me be extra lazy, so I don't think I could ever change it
---
Did the same on my priest , then got raped by the elementals
---
Is it also 1% crit less if you check your crit on your ability page? When you hover over your default attack ability in your spell book it shows you your crit chance. Maybe it's just a display bug with the addon you use.
---
$10 says your addon is fucked
---
Vanilla rules were no pve to pvp and no low pop to high pop, but that was ages ago and we'll have to wait for when/if they introduce paid transfers to classic.
---
There is no Darnassian rep gained from killing mobs.  So there is no "rep decay penalty" or rather a boosting a lower level player penalty.  
---
It is true that if you have a quest and turn it in when you have out leveled the quest by more than 5 levels you will lose 20% of the rep of the quest, but still receive 100% exp as long as the quest is still green.  In later levels, the quest may be 8 levels lower than you (you are 48 and quest is marked as level 40) and still remain green for xp but you lose 60% of the rep on turn in.
---
which ones?
---
["The game knows no rules of 'honor' or of 'cheapness.' The game only knows winning and losing."](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win)
---
Intended for competitive games, but applies to WPvP just the same as far as I'm concerned.
---
&gt; unspoken honor system in place regarding WPVP
---
Honor?! It's not about winning or losing fairly. Its about sending a message! This is **OUR** territory! If you want to quest here, you will do so in **FEAR**! You will learn to cower when seeing the opposite faction! 
---
How **DARE** you run on **OUR** road! I don't care if this is a neutral contested zone. Running on that road cost a toll! You're life!!!
---
How **DARE** you kill **OUR** mobs we want to kill! You will pay for that!
---
I was referring to the use of triad . Which I've only ever heard in reference to Chinese mafia not a trio of physiological terms
---
Do you have a shield bash macro or do you just use your defence stance macro then spell bash
---
I‚Äôm on benediction and thank god the server is nearly 50-50.
---
Well, for now.
---
It's happened to me enough when I see an ally fighting a mob I'll throw sw:p on them and watch them freak out. Sometimes I'll end their misery. If they are a healer and I see them getting low fighting a mob I silence them so they cant heal. Good times. Alli tend to jump me 3v1, and horde rarely helped out. Now they people are finishing the leveling we are starting to pvp a lot more.
---
Stacking spell power over other stats
---
I agree completely with you dude!
---
Great story
---
Where does one pick up the zeppelin to America? Asking for a Stepperunner
---
What have you pre-ordered? üëÄ
---
Yes, and yes.
---
IMO it was also the start of it's downfall, it killed heroics (way too easy) and linear raid progression. Personally I liked having to work my way through the raids and the first ones not becoming obsolete. It also introduced LFG.
---
Should have figured this would be stupid since it was recorded from a phone recording a game.
---
Agreed, thats not pvp, its just griefing at that point.
---
Please tell me which part of it is wrong.
---
Barb Blade is: 60 AP, 1% Crit, 25 Agi
---
Dal'Rends is: 50 AP, 1% Crit and 30 Agi, + some pretty negligible defences.
---
Please explain to me how rends is not better.
---
Any Horde I find on Herod in the &lt;Retail Dev Team&gt; guild is KOS in my eyes.
---
4 mages 1 priest easily.
---
The beadwork is his creation, the art is not. And yes, it is common courtesy (a foreign concept to most children these days, I realise) to link the original creator of something.
---
It's not.  It's in response to "the problem is that switching layers is too easy."
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=286941&amp;region=us
---
Don't go prot to level. Even at 60 I see some warriors tanking in fury, you don't really need it outside of raids.
---
sad..
---
Priest or Pally for healing?  
---
I haven't come back yet but I figured I would give healing a shot has there will be millions of mages running around. My end goal would be to raid at a semi hardcore level. 
---
Also how difficult is it to level as a healer outside of dungeon grinds? When I played vanilla I was a hunter/mage for the duration.
---
Accurate.
---
I‚Äôm not telling you that! We have enough people being killed by carbs already!
---
Got it
---
I think they are playing a mana using class based off the fact that he took water.
---
Without sounding too snarky the "best" spot is the one that has the least amount of competition when you are farming.
---
Sometimes Winterspring is pretty good, other times it's loaded with people.
---
Sometimes Slithius is empty because I feel it's often overlooked, but then sometimes it's packed.
---
Overall I tend to stay away from Un'goro. While I like it's easy to loop the competition seems to most constant regardless of time.
---
Just try and remember most people tend to look for the easiest farming route. So that may leave some spots not as heavily farmed. So while the route may involve more killing or running around you can end up more profitable due to the lack of competition.
---
I'm fine with PVP and even if i'm jump while half dead fighting a mob or its a 1 VS 5 on me it just what happens in world PVP but if you tea bag me i make a note with my add on and they are KoS for the rest of the time i play.
---
6 days 16 hours as a warlock

The accumulated filth of all their¬†AOE farming and cleave runs¬†will foam up about their waists and¬†all the Frost Mages and Warlocks will look up and shout "Need a tank!"... and I'll look down and whisper "No."¬†
---
Name Plates Classic
---
yes, you have to rebuy all all of spells learned as talents whenever you respec.  i've respecced multiple times so far and it has held true every time. tbc changed it so that you only have to learn talent spell ranks once.
---
Not accurate at all.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-pvp-classic-wow
---
It's from here. But it seems like it takes advantage of slows and shatter + pyroblast to deal massive damage so most likely.
---
People don't know how to play casters. It's counter intuitive on the surface but waiting for tank to get aggro makes your DPS higher since you don't spend time running from mobs, being interrupted, and using Mana for things like blink to escape.
---
I believe the mechanism tries to sort everyone in a guild to the same layer. If so you should have more success asking outsiders for a layer hop. 
---
What server are you on?
---
can you explain why? my current plan was to stay fury from 1-60 and stay there.
---
One might even say, its the... Bomb?
---
That WW quest worries me, but I could prolly get my hunter and priest friend to help. Nice to know that the class does "evolve" some.
---
sums up the horde pretty nicely. and we'll still win and save thr alliance boy king from Onyxia!
---
What a fucking dickwad. Thought I'd seen it all. Jesus... This beats my random road rage any day.
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem with diluting the player base, it‚Äôs already essentially been done by just releasing classic, not to mention the fact that the player base was already diluted by server regions and servers, sure that was solved by making them cross server based, but that seemed to have caused more issues than it had solved IMO, it ruined WoW for me.
---
shit addon, check in skillbook and post.
---
I never said that
---
I mean.. theres literally an Honor system coming next phase that only awards points for defeating **relevant** level enemies.
---
Wrong, mage never got to full mana.
---
Thank you and /u/Fixthemix so much. :)
---
Doesnt work on classic. Started my mage today and noticed that you cant do shit when wanding. Not even potion.
---

ikr, the only time CC ever comes out is if we screw up and pull extra.
---
Got it on my second kill of Angerforge rolling against 2 other people.
---
Well, I think anyone on r/r/classicwow knows it's a Blizzard character.
---
I don't want classic plus. It's not what I signed up for.
---
This is sex. Just plain old, great sex.   
---
\[Edit: And look at the amount of beautiful easter eggs in quest log. These quest designers were awesome!\]
---
&gt;The thing is that I don't thing a lot of people do. 
---
Ok.  I mean i absolutely disagree here.  We had well over 20 end-game guilds on Spirestone running at least MC and starting on BWL.  
---
And i'll say again, the difficulty of 40-man raids, their complicated nature, the fact they were a pain in the ass is precisely what made them so exclusive and hard to do and complete successfully.  It's also what made them iconic and why so many people have a nostalgia for it.  That challenge was their allure.
---
&gt;because there must be a reason why there haven't been way more 40 player raids in vanilla.  
---
huh?  They created a 40 man (naxx) just before they launched TBC.   
---
Are you saying there must be a reason why they didnt create more 40 man raids AFTER vanilla?   
---
Of course there is a reason, appealing to casuals and spending more time on the sort of content you are advocating for, easier casual content.   
---
That's fine, thats what retail WoW is for.  We are discussing classic though, classic should maintain the level of non-casual appeal that made it so appealing in the first place, aka pain in the ass 40 man raids.
---
&gt;Like I said, my server had SEVEN at the end. SEVEN.    
---
Ok?  I don't believe for a second that 7 is an accurate number of guilds that were running MC on your sever but even if it is, so your server was on the low side vs the rest.  That just goes to show how hard these raids were at the time.  Also which server was this?
---
&gt;And yes, I don't like it, but this isn't what I am discussing here.  
---
Except it is.  You are advocating for not creating 40 man content because you do not personally see the value in it and therefore can't grasp why others could see the value in it and then concluding that it must just not be popular enough for more to be created when we have hundreds of guilds scrambling to get to MC as we speak!  I will say for the 3rd time, no one is saying that the 25 man and under raids you are advocating for shouldn't be included as well.  All i am saying that 40 man raids should also be included for those of us who want a more elite, unique, difficult, complicated and exclusive experience.  
---
&gt;In the case of GW2 it was actual story content. People who start now are missing a huge and actually kinda important part of the story and can only watch a short and pretty basic flashback. Right after they are thrown into the story with characters they've never seen before.   
---
I don't care about guild wars though.  There are ways to make events that don't NEED to be experienced to grasp the story and perhaps GW2 fucked this up.  Thats not relevant.  Experiencing the opening of Ahn Qiraj wasnt integral to getting the story.  It was just simply an experience.  Something similar could be done again.
---
I did the same thing with my girlfriend, and there were periods in our teens and 20's when her weapon would be way old, and i would have to do 70% of the damage AND keep her alive.... it was pretty brutal
---
repeatable.
---
So likely worth cussing through some levels to 30? I don't dislike my shaman at all, but I know the game is about life at 60 moreso than leveling.
---
Just rolled a dwarf hunter and was wondering about professions.
---
Was thinking either Mining/Engineering or Skinning/Leatherworking.
---
Endgame plans are PVE and may dabble a little in BGs and world PVP
---
Because advanced stats add-ons are garbage. Mine won't show the additional spell crit% from Holy Specialization.
---
Basically, the item is not removing crit%, your add-on is simply fucking up.
---
I tried reloading, relogging, updating the addon and taking all my gear off. It happens with my necklace Mark of Fordring, that also gives 1% crit chance, and Magni's Will. Is it possible that the +hit issue Blizzard told us about in the last bluepost also applies to +crit?
---
Yes they do. However, I believe the retail version of WoW has more "unique" questing features. Whereas classic things are more grindy. My opinion.
---
I think I read/watched something that said RR was basically an unfinished zone that they stuck some quests into. Could be remembering that wrong though.
---
No, he's flying to STM, and the flight path from Theramore is literally flying him over the head of the STM flight master to take him to Darkshore and then back to STM. It's the most nonsensical flight pathing in the game.
---
Weird shit like this is why I love this game.
---
opening the nets or killing the mobs?
---
Dude thank you so much for this! This I why I rerolled a Druid! I can‚Äôt wait to be off work to go and mess with this stuff. This community is great. Thanks again!
---
[Here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files/2774484) or [here](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/releases).

Fair enough.

Wand is on the GCD

[krackbaby](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/oaPcDncoLfgjK/giphy.gif) right now
---
Alone, no. With a buddy? Fuck yeah. 10 higher is nothing when he's getting wrecked 2v1.
---
I have all the mats to summon Cyclonian on my 30 warrior for tonight, I haven't been this excited for an item in years!
---
Is it possible to make a macro for that? 
---
So it‚Äôs wand/melee/wand etc.
---
You can use the arrow keys for that.
---
I don't understand why a druid who learned bear form, then died and became undead, couldn't use his knowledge anymore. I am prepared for your downvotes.
---
Yikes, a level 29 item is BIS at 60? There‚Äôs really no other weapon in the game that has more than +16 str bonus? (mace or staff)
---
Can we not use Down syndrome with a negative connotation to describe ‚Äúdumb people‚Äù?
---
In Vanilla, caster weapons have the same base damage as similar ilvl melee weapons. It wasn't until I think green dragons that sacrificing weapon DPS for caster stats became "a thing" (or maybe even later? I haven't actually looked, just trying to go off memory). So there are a lot of caster weapons found while leveling that are also really good melee weapons if you can get over the embarrassment of wielding an int staff as a warrior.
---
I disagree. Every quest masven does for 100 rep is like turning in 27 runecloth.  Depending on runecloth prices on the server that is 1-2g reward.
---
Nah man, that's a tauren warlock
---
IDK, I just saw it announced on the Skeram server that it was them who did it first, and my friend had screens of the head in Org.
---
A guild named ONSLAUGHT.
---
Yes and dude it's never too late to start classic.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt understand why players get so crazy about tanking in leveling dungeons.
---
The best groups I‚Äôve been in have had dps going balls to the wall, and the tank doing their best to keep threat off the healer.
---
If I end up tanking a mob I‚Äôve got tools to survive, if I die it‚Äôs my fault but if tanks expect dps to only single target and wait 3-5 seconds at the beginning of every pull then please just kick me from your group, because it‚Äôs going to be very tedious.
---
Hold threat the best you can but don‚Äôt take personal offense every time a dps pulls threat.
---
from what i understand it just offers a lot more dmg and sweeping strike makes warrior aoe really really good
---
Pretty sure this is later abuse and not allowed.
---
&gt; It also shows me that you're afraid to fight me with full health/mana.
---
It doesn't show that at all.  Why would I choose an engagement that's 50/50 when I could wait a minute and choose one that's 90/10 in my favor?  At the end of the day, you're the one with a ghost run and I'm not, I couldn't give less of a damn what you think about me.  I won and you lost, and if you're gonna get mad about it then I won twice.
---
What is the earliest level you can get the quest?
---
Oh man, i really understand you!
---
I see myself in this situation too. I always loved games, it's like a part of me, i don't imagine my life without playing something.
---
Of course the adult life made me play a lot less, but i try to play WoW or other games whenever i can.
---
And god, how i miss have endless talks with my friends about games. 
---
Nowadays when i talk the same friends who played with me in the teenager days make fun of me for playing wow till now. It makes me sad and give me wrong thoughts that i maybe not doing the right thing.
---
But F&amp;%\* them! I won't change beacause of their poor mindset.
---
WOW FOR LIFE! HORDE TILL DEATH!
---
why would blizzard do that ? they already have content created , what's the point of creating it anew ? also, most people would debate you on "it doesn't get better then classic" especially how broken and lackluster classic actualyl is outside of leveling
---
Tactitian from arms is pretty good (or whatever the name was; you keep 25 rage when changing stances), but apart from that it doesn't really matter imho.
---
Lol hit a nerve I guess.
---
This is fucking glorious
---
The TRUE ‚ÄúLeap of Faith‚Äù in 1k Needles lol.
---
Haha you just won with that comment!
---
Report his punk ass
---
I mained horde for the better part of 14 years, in classic i swapped to alliamce but made a guild named Lok Tar Ogar, we play on heartseeker and care not if you are skull level or grey. Red = dead.
---
For real, people doing \who and inviting you to tank. Good feels for days
---
I read it. They're both stupid.
---
If you're getting camped, just log out and play an alt. If you keep getting camped for more than an hour you're part of the problem.
---
Thanks, this was exactly what I was looking for. :)
---
Healed through a skull level warrior? o_o
---
You should be able to see your actual chance to crit if you mouse over you auto-attack spell in your spellbook. 
---
I think ur mods goofed, see if it replicates in the spellbook. That will tell you if your mods the problem or its something on blizzards end.
---
But incredibly true
---
I mean yeah. The reason i play on PvP servers is because it feels more real. PvE servers make no sense to me. Just like FPS games without friendly fire make no sense to me. And just like in real life there's gonna be good people and bad people. Its part of it and is what majes the world feel real. At least to me
---
RATTLEGORE Horde!
---
I dont either. Used to have 5 or so longtime online buddies, as recent as Legion, but one guy died and the others have stopped gaming. Mostly real life work changes, combined with the BFA dumpster fire. They were all OG vanilla Naxx level raiders as well, so classic does not appeal to them because they've done it all.
---
I spend my time watching movies and TV shows. Hoping whatever raid guild on Pagle I fall into has some people I connect with to talk gaming.
---
I would have thought a 2012 MacBook would be able to run wow with no issues.
---
in this first week grobb had "Moo"
---
i miss him
---
But that key is important!  It should be mortal strike or your second heal or something.  T I could understand but R?
---
You understand all good fantasy writers are roleplaying right? People that hate on RP while playing a **R**ole **P**laying **G**ame lack so much self awareness. Truly the cringiest.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to get death coil
---
Incendius is high pop and leans slightly horde.
---
I'm loving leveling my warrior. I dont know what all the hate is about, seems like a pretty standard process.
---
That‚Äôs not a great tanking ring, you‚Äôd be better off selling it and getting the Naglering from Golem Lord in BRD and the Drakeclaw band (of bear or of monkey) from ST.
---
Would you be able to notice the change in crit chance in your spell book by highlighting attack?
---
TL;DR:
---
&gt;Can Druids be effective endgame tanks in classic? UBRS/Strat/Maybe MC
---
Yes, Druids can be effective endgame tanks, your only worries will be convincing raid leaders that they are.
---
&gt;Is warrior solo leveling really that bad?
---
Yes, it's not impossible, but without great gear you will have the hardest time leveling solo out of all the other classes. If you tank you will always and immediately have a group for dungeons, however. And yes, you might die if you pull more than what you can handle, but an experience solo-warrior player will know how to run away while keeping aggro (and avoid evade) on his original target.
---
&gt;Are Tanks or Healers the highest skill cap with a group that doesn't know what they're doing?
---
I wouldn't call it "skill" to save a group that doesn't know what they're doing. If your DPS can't wait untill the tank has aggro, the tank will not have aggro and the DPS will die. But the healer can only help that untill he's out of mana, and a tank can only TRY to out-aggro them again.
---
Anyway, Tanks are the most common "guides" of a party.
---
TBC was awesome and WotLK early part (like Ulduar) was great. Expansions over new, but keep some classic servers alive as well.
---
Welcome btw
---
I'm not familiar with that addon. I don't see why it would be an issue since the macros are still clickable icons.
---
Yeaaah :)
---
Second this. Those are also the types of people saying stuff like "omg Barrens chat needs to be moderated"
---
Thanks for the help. And I know that this was more or less an exception to what the majority of what WPVP will be like. But it helped more than I could have imagined. We played every fight a little different and used different tools before I found the set that worked. It was really cool.
---
The plot thickens.
---
Change the game to classic at the bottom of the launcher. You‚Äôre downloading retail instead.
---
Is there a live tracker within the addon? Or what do you mean by checking during peak hours?
---
I don't have it installed yet, just started looking into getting addons today.
---
I did UBRS 32 times back in vanilla for that goddamn off-hand. 
---
Even won the roll once, but loot master handed it to the rogue (I was fury warrior) because he misread my roll. 
---
Like, 10 years later and I'm still upset over it.
---
Once you hit 20 druids are a breeze but I loved one on a private server and honestly got bored of it at lvl 47ish.
---
I don‚Äôt like healing so resto was out. Balance is trash so that leaves feral. Feral cat is very fun but I feel if this is your preferred play style you might as well just reroll a rogue, which I did and enjoyed more.
---
Bear tank is initially fun too but after awhile it‚Äôs old and your hands hurt from the endless swipe spam. To me Druid‚Äôs are super fun if you utilize the whole toolkit but if you just roll feral they get repetitive fast. They DO wreck face in pvp when played right though.
---
Nice. on my server right now all of them are like 30g
---
Serious question: as a result, besides first aide, which professions are best to match with tank?
---
Tank warrior and dungeon spam payed for my mount, repairs and all my abilities. I make sure to loot as much as I can.
---
Ifk about upright orcs but models that dont change the anatomie yeah
---
I'm a rogue and happy to unlock for free even having kept up my lockpicking by grinding out footlockers. These are the kinds of people complaining and being greedy I don't want around.
---
I love that people randomly buff me when running by or mages just give out free food and water. I don't mind unlocking stuff for people. That's how it was in vanilla and hopefully continues to be the culture of classic
---
He also thought the zeppelin would fly right into org
---
If you're worried about getting into groups, I think you'll generally find this meta affects the undesirable classes more.
---
I've had plenty of groups reply back mages only or mages join my group that bounce immediately because "oh sorry I was looking for an AOE group"
---
As a rogue, I've found it pretty hard to get into groups because everyone wants ravager warriors mages and shamans so I don't even bother looking anymore and just form my own groups.
---
I still have no problem bringing mages. Freeze Nova, Blizzard, Frostbolt, I love that shit. 
---
I can sympathize with the bad rep though. You're never gonna get as much credit for hitting 60, even if you didn't AOE farm.
---
None of the macros are a true fix it still happens. Back in 2005 you could jump fake death trap. Now you basically have to stand still and press it and not move for a second for it to maybe work like 70/30 of the time
---
makes sense, tbh
---
LFG. 
---
I hit 60 before my group of friends, so I‚Äôm beginning the gearing up process solo as a rogue at 60.
---
I‚Äôve quickly learned that rogues are incredibly abundant, and not super desirable in dungeons, This makes finding groups difficult, so I try and start my own groups, only to learn that tanks take absolutely forever to find, and in some cases expect to be compensated or have loot reserved for them just for showing up.
---
I‚Äôve started the hunt for a solid guild in hopes of finding some people running 60 dungeons.
---
Hmm r/beetlejuicing?
---
Staves are some of the best melee weapons for warriors and shamans in the 15-29 level range. Axes and swords take over in the 30-45 bracket before a couple of staves become relevant again before it's back to axes and swords for the rest of time.
---
There was an inn in dustwallow...
---
Yup, basically if you rolled Horde on most pvp servers, you might as well be on a pve server, it‚Äôs easy mode
---
It says classic but the download is still 60gb :( I'll restart my computer and see, at least I know it's possible, thanks :)
---
Above the install button should be a drop down box you can click, choose World of Warcraft Classic and then press install. Welcome and good luck in your adventures!
---
No, never. I ran Uldaman probably 15 times in the past few days trying to get two drops. I lost these high spirit low int drops to mages and warlocks every time (only really salty about the mages taking them, as they had better gear already). Despite this, I still stuck through each dungeon run, even the ones where we were wiping way more than we should have. Then again, I have this mentality of sticking with it until the end, no matter what, which has lead to some serious frustration and wasted nights, but I'd expect the same from those in my group. I'd pretty much blacklist someone who decided to leave after not getting a drop, it's absurd and immature.
---
I did it when my queue was over 30 mins long. Just gotta log out and wait like 5 mins after to make sure you get back in queue and not put directly into the game.
---
Warlocks, too. I'd fund my massive re-spec addiction with eyes of shadow, lol.
---
If you refer to my OP. I'm not saying it's not a "dick move" to do these things, in-fact clarifying further - I'm absolutely saying it is.
---
My problem is more with people posting about some figurative code of honor system being in-place barring you from doing so, which is completely delusional.
---
It‚Äôs all the way in the back of the building. If you hop on that little ledge then the guards don‚Äôt aggro on you. It‚Äôs pretty damn annoying because he was 7 levels higher and kept attacking me. Didn‚Äôt kill me since I‚Äôm a priest, but it forced me to keep running out of the building to LoS.
---
He didn't watch it.
---
Sailing in the same boat, here. I tell people about my gaming. Some get me and some wonder why I waste my time sitting in front tv/monitor and not go out. But I ignore them. Also sometime I tell them about how kids these days are making millions playing competitive (games like Dota2, LOL, SFV, etc) so that they dont try to lecture me about how gaming is a waste of time :D
---
Be your self, tell your kids about your hobby. I have met many players in WoW who play along with their kids
---
Me telling the girl constantly back in the day. CONTROL UR FUCKEN PET!!
---
I replied to the comment above.
---
The droprate is definitely lower than 20%
---
Classic is on the post rogue nerf patch. Rogue loses to most classes 1v1 assuming equal gear and skill.
---
The one they said they are monitoring layering from the start? The obv know about Jokerd and everything else.
---
Switching layers to buy the recipe, kill mobs or get nodes is not an exploit as those resources existed, there arent layers created by switching. 
---
Unlike the layer exploit that **created** resources that didnt exist before.
---
I decided to roll a Tauren Druid, the battle rez is the reason why I decided to level as feral, then repec at the end game.
---
You are correct, I have it on my druid. I was hoping to upgrade it at some point before lvl 60, as I feel I could do higher base damage.
---
I understand you. But as a tank I can't tell you enough how frustrating it is. Especially if you then run away from me, iceblock. And 3 out of the 5 mobs run to our healer. Then i feel guilty since I couldn't hold aggro
---
It just does shite damage is the thing, considering the rage it costs
---
Dont forget to layer exploit...seems to be the new fad, barely anyone got banned for it lol.
---
No this was your lotto, you're done now
---
Who put the axe in the kitchen?!?
---
Sorry, "HoTs" means Healing over time, the heal counterpart of "Dots".
---
Yeah don't underestimate elite mob in classic, moreover if there is pack of mob. And a DPS is as usefull as a healer because the fastest something die, the less dmg it can do. 
---
Doing dungeon with small group can be a really fun challenge tho, but not this early because you don't have your full kit. You shoud try doing each branch of Scarlet monastery (when you will hit the same level as the trash mob) with a small group of friend, it's realy challenging and fun
---
Druid is a very active leveler. You will be shifting forms, hotting youself, using abilites, pulling with your ranged spells.
---
Tilde master race.
---
Hmm based on how many cloth items I've lost to druids I would not have expected those prioritizations.
---
You could form a solid religion out of this deep level of persecution complex.
---
lol "barely need a tank" and complaining about mages AoEing when they are the only aoe in the group is also a bad thing. Please reroll healer and do some PuGs and tell me this again. 
---
On top of that what you seem to be talking about isn't even about the sheep slowing it down, but being annoyed at the tank being slow at marking. "/tm 5" is moon. "/tm 8" is skull. now marks can be one in a second you def dont need the tank to be the one doing them. If you don't like the slowness, throw up some marks yourself. 
---
If you really think mages AoEing most of the time when they are the only AoE in the group is making the run easier, please go back to retail. The game may not be the same as it was 15 years ago, but I have never been in a group where this didn't slow us WAY down and cause almost wipes. Topping the dps charts doesn't make the run smoother when you're pulling aggro off the tank.
---
I think people forget Blizzard's recent track-record. The whole reason people wanted Classic is because they're not happy with the current state of WoW, nor has it been for many years. Think of how grossly they underestimated the want for the game, they only launched 4 PVP NA servers and now there's 20. That's a factor of 5 (not to mention all of the other servers launched). There's none that are low lopulation.
---
Diablo is in shambles, Starcraft isn't doing so great (mostly due to the disinterest in the RTS genre), Overwatch feels stale even if it's the best of the bunch.
---
As much as Classic+ sounds appealing, I don't have faith in Blizzard's ability to produce quality content that's original, as it seems they didn't even have that much faith in WoW classic being popular.
---
Not what I'm saying. And a more accurate version of your hyperbole would be soloing ghaz'rilla because the rest of the group would still be locked behind the gate for not having the mallet. its not even a parallel comparison really.
---
I'm not saying players should be greedy and only look out for themselves like you think I am, I'm just saying I don't feel entitled to what ever is in that chest. key word: entitled. entitlement. If the rogue wants to share/rolls then that's cool. 
---
And if I came into your group as a rogue knowing before hand that you felt entitled to what may as well be my trade skill in this scenario, I would absolutely decline and make a note not to group with you. This does not mean I want everything to myself just because I think the rogue should have the *choice* to keep the chest without being made a villain.
---
90% of players don't pay attention to that. It's really because the brutal savages faction attracts more pvpers than the civilized faction. There's always exceptions but that seems to be the trend
---
I've seen enough 40 warriors with mounts and 60 with epic mounts I call BS on the money part. Warriors seem to be stupid rich at times
---
It's a play on words with bear, and?
---
Do you mean, while leveling? You can spec disc and heal in dungeons, yeah. Those talents don't mean a lot in Classic. They're mostly just percentages here and there with the occasional bigger talent. As long as you respec to holy at 60 you're fine (or around lvl 55).
---
I personally learn all skills, and I'll farm gold at 40 if I don't have enough.
---
You're literally referencing the post I linked where they call it exploiting
---
Oh I thought it was made with enchanting, my bad.
---
Oh! I saw a YouTuber talking about yesterday, but I wasn't aware it was widely reported already. Any consesus if it's caused by the pet or the spell batching? (Still need to test this with my pet dismissed)
---
Economy is the victim here - so is in extension every honest player. They most definitely should get banned - at some point you have to take responsibility for your own actions, there is no claiming ignorance here. People were 100% aware of the fact that they are exploiting.
---
Well, all the numbers are wrong.  Plus im pretty sure that updates through the years have changed how some mechanics have worked, now things 'feel', etc.
---
Its not going to be as easy as copy/paste.  Many (likely most) systems have been reworked extensively since BC and would have to be 're-made' just like they had to do for Classic.
---
IDK man if you watched Athene for a few minutes it was pretty obvious he's playing a character. I've only ever watched a few minutes of Asmon and he just seems like a total goober. I'm not saying you're wrong, but Athene was a lot more entertaining.
---
TBC is next. Thats what the post is saying.
---
Hehe yeah not surprising. Is there anywhere i can learn more about your setup, specifics etc. Are you blogging about the experience somewhere by chance?
---
In EU it always felt other way around. But that‚Äôs because russians always roll in premades and alliance lol.
---
I started in Wrath, but weren‚Äôt most of the classic BGs alliance favoured? Most of my knowledge comes from youtube videos from that hiru guy.
---
Oof, that's a rough name to roll with.
---
what site do you check that from?
---
When and how can shamans place multiple totems? I‚Äôm Lvl 14 currently resto
---
Expected Ironfoe
---
ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!!
---
Still have to log in every time I open the game tho, would be nice if you could  remember password or stay logged in
---
To answer your question, you can go into that area as alliance. On a pvp server, probably going to be contentious though. It is near a horde area and it's a good gold grind spot for them. There may be one or two traps you'd agro the guards, but I'm not sure. I was 60 when I went there for the fishing pole. I never agro'd a guard anyway.
---
But at somepoint they need to expand or the inevitable will happen.
---
I've actually not completed a few dungeons because of this.
---
Yes once was due to 2 of us being too low level. The last boss rekt us over and over. Dungeon reset.
---
But I've also had dungeon groups fall apart because of a wipe or because people arent pulling their weight.
---
Spending over an hour on a dungeon and not completing it is a real thing that happens. I enjoy the added risk.
---
Final boss of Molten Core created with HAMA beads? MC Hama confirmed; YOU CANNOT TOUCH THIS x
---
At 34, you can always solo rfc (if you're horde?) for the low greens
---
Awwww! That's really sweet and wholesome!
---
I've been using both of these builds, and you are absolutely wrong. 100% crit ambush from remorseless means that at level 40 my opener does 600-700 damage, followed by a couple SS swings and evisc. Then on to the next. It's so insanely fast compared to combat swords that it's not even funny. And in dungeons, I frequently have to let the tank build threat on a boss for quite a bit because I can open with such absurdly high numbers that people question me.
---
How long does it take to farm multiple of those?
---
I am not sure if this is sarcasm but what he is describing is not layering. This is something that we can do even when layering is removed. It is often referred to as "fishing for Jed ID." You get your UBRS grp together and if Jed is not in your dungeon ID, people drop and zone back in to see if he is in their instance ID for UBRS. Whichever member gets Jed reinvites the raid members and you clear that ID instead of the others.
---
Each account has a limit of 5 instance resets in one hour so sometimes fishers get locked out.
---
The bannable offense would be clearing through Drak in UBRS, dropping from the dungeon grp, having a 3rd party invite you before the 1 min boot time, and having a fresh drak to kill in front of you. That was the exploit that needed fixing but ID fishing is permissible.
---
I agree that it is rewarding. It‚Äôs always nice getting a big weapon upgrade and seeing those nice big white numbers. Good luck in your leveling.
---
They need to be hanging out inside the instance.
---
every reddit loser is horde what a surprise. Glad
---
I'm not sure I have the lifestyle anymore to play classic FFXI. That shit was hardcore.
---
I just you the defense macro and shield bash. I tried setting up a macro for it but it didnt work that well and didnt find myself needing it all that often.
---
Its pretty useful in AV for example.
---
Also 60 mob and 60 other faction player have the exact same solution.
---
And at any rate, this is a change to make the world safer which is what a lot of people dont like about retail.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Thank you for your service.  THANK you for your SERVICE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
---
After using it you're immune for 15 seconds. So I'm assuming you've used it already and it's not an option.
---
If he needs Thunderfury‚Äôs proc to keep threat he‚Äôs a bad tank. If he needs it for competitive damage he‚Äôs a bad dps. 
---
Put it on a Combat sword rogue. I‚Äôd rather a fight last 30s less and the tank actually need to be good than letting a tank faceroll because Thunderfury.
---
There are a lot more heavily scripted weird quests like pick up these 10 piles of shit by feeding this mob some bad food or take over this vechile and kill some mobs and place a bomb.
---
Grand exchange too
---
Red = dead.
---
I have it. There's nothing there. Guess I'll go to the horde/contested zones...
---
Need help trying to pick an alt. Currently leveling a hunter, at 42 right now. Once I hit 60 I'll definitely have a lot to do, but much of dungeons and raiding requires bulk time, and when I only have 30min to an hr, I'd like to level an alt (I'll probably rotate through 2, so they're always rested). I'm trying to choose between mage, warrior, rogue, and druid.
---
Warrior looks fun cause big hits and smash.
---
I'd love to play a stealth class, and am leaning rogue cause it's a much better at stunlock and kill than druid. That said druid let's me heal and tank too, and if the main reason here is pvp, then druid seems to excel in BGs, ie: has more utility, than rogue. But rogue still looks fun.
---
Mage is lower on the totem pole, but looks like it's all around good at pvp both BGs and wPvP.
---
Ps: not saying rogue is bad in BGs, just that druid has more to offer than rogue in most BGs
---
Was it even there in Wrath?  I started playing right at the end of 3.1 i think and i dont remember it being there.
---
Granted, i didnt spend a ton of time in SW.  Always went to IF for the AH and stuff.
---
Congrats. Just picked mine up last night at lvl 35
---
Ich spiel auch dort und hab ganz andere erfahrungen gemacht, voralldingen kurz nach Release
---
Scroll down for EU realms.
---
You want a server with good faction balance.
---
I recommend playing on PVP servers as it opens another facet of the game - World PVP anywhere any time. Some players may not like that though and prefer to not be killed when they don't want to be.
---
Bruh this game runs on a Walmart laptop. Hard no.
---
Sigh.
---
Stalagg will soon be 90% horde.
---
35 runs +/-  we only do  JED + DAl runs at night with some friends
---
  number of mainhands  0 
---
number of offhands 7
---
So em... Are you on the asian server or oceanic?
---
Beautifully written I was engaged from the start
---
Whattt? Some of my best memories are full BRD runs
---
just due to how tanking works in classic i would still hand the bow as a stat stick to a warrior tank as overall DPS buff due not being as threat limited by certain people is better than the DPS the hunter will see however after tanks then hunters would get it over a rogue or dps warrior if rhok'delar didn't exist or was a rarer drop.
---
Do you lose either eye if you fail or do you just need to keep retrying?
---
Nugrunner
---
Passive adrenaline rush, that's why.
---
Damn that's a lot of mobs...
---
I feel bad for whoever lives with those people
---
That has obviously worked out for them in the past. They made very well-planned-out changes. They had meetings. They had more meetings. They involved numerous teams. They talked with shareholders. And the changes that have made the game what it is today, still went through. That's measuring dozens of times, and making the cut. Was the cut wrong, or was it how they wanted to steer the game?
---
Okay; so, how does one call back the pet? Mine is always on defensive and I send it to the skull target with ctrl-1 then it usually runs back.
---
Yup lol
---
You can be interrupted whiled casting your horse which will holy lock you b/c it's a holy spell.  It also requires mana to cast.
---
Hey genuine question about feathermoon fishing. Are there any special requirements for fishing there or any coastal spots really? I've been fishing up empty bags everytime I try coastal fishing. Just hit 300 this morning, so I don't feel like skill is issue.
---
enchanting makes runed rods, but you need a regular rod from a blacksmith first
---
So feral druids will actually farm and keep a bunch in there bags because its in 3 uses.
---
Jade oozes in hinterlands lv 48
---
They often drop pouches with 10s
---
Besides normal greys
---
And there are some horde boxes but with shitty loot
---
The cave  nearby also has these but also ghost mushroom herbs which should be valuable.
---
So say we all.
---
Had a guildie open a ticket about this.. haven‚Äôt heard anything back yet
---
I think it's overblown.  I aced it the first try too.  It's hard if you don't know how to play a priest.
---
I also have zero gamer friends. I play games instead of watching TV, yet people can sit there and binge Netflix but playing games is "childish"...
---
It wouldn‚Äôt get better regardless, #nochanges remember? What it is now is what its staying.
---
It would simply be made available on console, as it is.
---
I picked up tailoring and enchanting but find myself struggling to accumulate money, so I'm trying to drop enchanting for a gathering profession. My understanding was that a profession trainer can allow you to "forget" and replace the profession for the new one. Went to the mining trainer, but this wasn't an option. 
---
How do I forget enchanting?
---
I have a suspicion your friend is making the mistake with food I did early on; I thought food added a flat amount to pets happiness and just fed him as fast as possible. It actually adds a condition that adds continual happiness (sort of like a heal over time) for like twenty seconds, and if you feed it again in that time it just replaces the condition instead of stacking. 
---
Practical upshot is it only takes one food per happiness step usually, but if you don't know the system you could be burning entire stacks of food to raise happiness.
---
Lol nah.
---
They have TBC and WotLK content. 
---
Why spend tons of money making things people don't have any nostalgia for? Literally will never happen. 
---
Stop asking for classic+. Its not gunna happen.
---
Nah, cause when classic+ comes. Which it will. You'll have the devs choosing one and letting the rest die. They won't have Dev teams for 4 wows. It's better the just make sure what we get is what we want.
---
This. Stuff dies so fast with concentrated fire that there is never an issue. The tank never has aggro but with priest shields and swapping to shield and mace on my Enhance shaman rarely ever die. Does help having threat totem and an interrupt on a decent cool down.
---
If you have trouble in dungeons I would advise to line of site every pull you can and to make sure you are hitting the same target as your tank. Make sure you are also in melee range of everyone else. Follow these 3 rules and 80% of dungeon problems are gone as nothing gets ninja pulled and you don't end up killing yourself by attacking mobs that have no tank threat on them.
---
Gotta make sure the initiates show the proper fealty to royalty.
---
Wand overrides gcd with its recast. 
---
If you have a wand that has a 1.5s recast then your gcd goes up from 1s to 1.5s. Or if you have a 2s wand then the gcd goes from 1s to 2s.
---
I want classic pre BGs.
---
Blizzard should hire you to make an anime of this. This is super cool. Well done.
---
Why would I ever pick a fight I'm less likely to win?
---
Your ideas are absolutely nonsense. You should stick to PVE servers
---
If you're oom, at 10% life, about to narrowly finish an aoe pull, I'm 100% going to fireblast you and dance on your body before you can release spirit
---
It's not about honor
---
yeah true... i certainly dont but damnnn  that game was good
---
Back then you had to buy the game too.
---
Only because the people who make it a problem feed off it. Again its not my fault that people feed off of shit but it still doesn't make me the problem. The root is the people feeding off of logic. Misdirection wont help the situation. Nothing will change until this childish mindset does.
---
And WotLK hopefully. I'd quit for TBC, but come back for WotLK any day.
---
what is the exploit they're referencing if not farming multiple things that you would not normally have access to? A player is not supposed to be able to access 6 copies in less than a minute of a pattern that has a 6 hour restock cooldown. That's exploiting layers to bypass that cooldown. If that's not the exploit exploitability they're referencing, what is?
---
I don't think Blizzard could realistically do anything to force users to use a certain type of set-up (beyond making it impossible to do so somehow while running the game maybe, such as console games that don't support certain setups). It'd be more of a discretionary thing I imagine where they would choose to add logging into multiple accounts at the same time to be an unacceptable activity similar to how devs/publishers typically don't like multiple people sharing the same account.
---
Whatever floats your boat, obviously, but one could construct a strawman to say that you'd want to strafe and select specific targets at the same time...
---
It's a thing that gets a rise from people because a lot also play FPS, and their mind just works that way. Same thing with people that played flight simulators (and actual pilots) and having y axis inverted.
---
Oh my god
---
Same but another 3 hours later. Have a great work day everyone :)
---
Rolling Horde because you think you're a badass and you want to PvP.
---
**Reality:**  Waiting in battleground queues.
---
Rolling Alliance because you actually want to PvP and you don't care about being an edgelord.
---
**Reality:** Instant battleground queues, and you actually get to PvP.
---
You can't do dungeons as a multiboxer?
---
The spell mounts have all of the drawbacks you might experience with normal spellcasting:
---
If you're out of mana, you can't mount.
---
If you have a debuff that slows casting such as curse of tongues, it takes longer to mount.
---
You can be silenced or locked out of a spell school while casting it which prevents you from mounting again.
---
Your mount can be dispelled.
---
This guy's post history is just angry, vitriolic stuff. I think you're right on point.
---
Yeah, I come across flagged horde in the barrens all the time. Don‚Äôt see the confusion.
---
Took me 25 runs to see it and 40 to get it myself. It took all my friends more than 20 as well. One guy is up to 60. The drop rate is less than 5%.
---
I feel like these are really common. Every melee dps at 60 should have this item.
---
Agreeed. Theyre literally the only individuals I attack no mattet the circumstances. If they havent done smth bad yet,  theyll deserve it later
---
In chat ‚ÄúIt is on passive‚Äù
---
Inner monologue ‚Äúwtf is passive?‚Äù
---
Seriously, if this is the third wipe for the same player pet pulling, why is he still in your raid?
---
Of course this is going to happen. I expected to open this thread to find meme was that joining horde on a horde-dominated server was dumb. I guess if you only care about short term ganking it's fine but if you are planning on playing for more than a couple months...
---
x40 though. Kinda steep.
---
bruh are you really that slow? or just too hard headed to say 'Yes Sir, I may have been wrong'??
---
I have one of these screenshots as well. I have been chilling with the OH for  about 20-30 runs now waiting on the MH but last night we got the Band of Rumination and OH as rend drops FIVE runs in a row. I was so salty. It got to the point where the next OH would rot. We didn't see a MH in the whole night but did get another Carapace. Still waiting to even see that Felstriker though.
---
Is it possible to have someone invite your bank alt to the party then leave; so then you can log on your alt to reset between runs?
---
Doesn‚Äôt beat the mage who needed on the melee hit ring off princess in Mara last night because he ‚Äúthought it worked for mages‚Äù. Where I as a tank and the warrior dps were just like wtf??
---
&gt; For Protection I skipped over Anticipation since 10 defense I can probably mitigate with BiS gear
---
Are you already in BIS gear?  Otherwise you will be a lot easier to heal with 10 extra defense instead of 4 points of unbridled wrath.  I've even considered losing 1% crit in the standard deep prot build to get 2 seconds reduction of taunt CD.  Check skarmtank's talent video and explanations.  TLDW  There is only really 3 points you have to move between sunder, revenge, or heroic strike.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmlcHhlDLVw  
---
May wanna just skip to 5 mins in for more direct prot stuff
---
Same but another work later. Have a nice hour day :)
---
Oh yes, you are a powerful being that can mind read all Novas from Mages and be ready for that instant cast on short cooldown every single time you gank.
---
My lord. I saw the pic. That is fucking so god damn gross.
---
I refuse to believe this.  I also skipped that quest, cause I remember it sucking balls.
---
You don't need em.
---
Im not sure this is accurate. 
---
As I recall it was very possible for players 20-30 levels lower to be able to take out a 60 so long as they're working together.
---
You can buy strange dust from enchanting vendor in Stormwind I believe.
---
That's just how classic is. Killing more than 1 mob is hard. 
---
Btw your weapon damage does not matter, weapons are only stat sticks(+agi/str etc.) for druids.
---
For taking down more than 1 mob try root one and then dps the other down.
---
For killing mobs I would not recommend stealthing unless they are neutral, the damage increase from stealth is not enough to warrant the time it takes to move. Open with rake and then claw them down and rip like you said. Soon you will get ferocious bite which is an instant damage finisher and things will be easier for you.
---
First off, fuck other peoples view on your hobbies, they don't matter in the end. If you like to do something do it, unless that something is murdering people or animals.  Second off I think you have probably described a hefty population of WoW players, except you have a wife and most of them probably do not. Youre not doing anything wrong, someone who puts someone else down for liking something is doing something wrong. Life isn't for caring about what other people think its for making you and people you love as happy as possible in the short amount of time you have. Idk about you but WoW makes me pretty fucking happy, most of the time.

Aren't these the same characters that just posted "Don't talk to me or my son ever again"

It never claims it solves it, in fact it specifically states that it optimises using Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm

And if we really want to be pedantic, travelling salesman problem is technically NP-Hard

Np haha, glad my sketchy experience could help someone at least

Mages can't cc the ghosts in RFD's last encounter. Just saying.

Ok you are not reading what I wrote, at all. Thats it for me.

&gt;PVPing on a PVP server  
---
&gt;Total dick move
---
When did I say PvPing a PvP server was a dick move? I said that if you attack me at 10% health and OOM and dance on my corpse, you're a dick.
---
&gt;You could be volunteering at a soup kitchen right now. Instead you're arguing on the internet. Dick move, bro
---
LOL, what are you talking about? You‚Äôre literally arguing on the internet too.
---
Well done!
---
Drood boy chicken wing
---
Why do I hear the Pillar Man theme?
---
It's on reddit so it has to be true1111!
---
Wait LOL what? Not congratulating someone on hitting 60 like they accomplished a noble peace prize. The gm had the audacity to message you to explain what you did. Sounds like you're playing with people who really need an ego boost. If you're on Whitemane/horde hit me up I have a guild for you.
---
I had that at 17
---
Make these macros then bind them to your mouse wheel.
---
Up is attack and down is call back and just leave your pet on passive so when it's target dies it will come back to you it will  become second nature to control your pet that way.
---
**Pet attack**
---
!petattack

/cast Charge
---
/cast Dash

/cast Dive

**Pet Passive**

!petpassive
---
Similar to how Paladins feel after getting Verigan's Fist.
---
While they lack a taunt it's probably not all that useful in a cleave group.  Run in consecrate and maybe just start tossing heals, even if just on yourself, snap aggro and blam.  If mages stay outside the 30% threat zone you're all set.
---
Cleave groups are fine like that, consider a pally mage spam as probably being fairly ideal for that.  Though I wasn't all that excited about doing that on my server in Vanilla, since I missed the initial push to 60, and groups were also not considered as worthwhile by the people needed to make this work (read: people solo ground to 60, especially as dps) for whatever reason this go around I'm seeing far more dungeon interested players, as well as less resistance to grouping in the world.  
---
There are always people ready to do each zone's elite quests, and helpful people willing to assist if they see a situation.  I hope it continues.. perhaps people are starved for it after LFG/LFR stole the social aspect.  I'm sure we will see a decline eventually, but it's fantastic until then.
---
They said playing... not playing wow... :P
---
&gt;only a warlock can turn you into a shark
---
Given enough mages and enough tweaks to polymorph, this might eventually prove false! ;)
---
As a warlock, I'm divided.  On the one hand, I'm glad *someone* is getting a use out of UB.  On the other, I usually only toss it on people so they feel the brief excitement of "I got a buff!" followed by the letdown of "but there's no water anywhere remotely nearby..."
---
If you know how to check for wand upgrades its ez
---
Even without its still not bad
---
Its warriors and rogues that are bad
---
Is BRD level 55 to full clear? can I start running first half or so at 52/53? My buddy and I are warrior tank and pally healer
---
"*classic* yeetyeetyeet with the political commentary."
---
So many people, yourself included, are spreading misinformation in this thread, stating that you shouldn't or can't play arms in dungeons, when it is in fact the best spec you can be. 
---
I personally try to follow the principle of "Don't give out advice or comment on things I'm clueless about". You and many others clearly don't.
---
Get it only if you can't skin mobs anymore.
---
I've always been against a wow port for console. Even if they did make it with K&amp;M support they would HAVE to make it with controller support for everyone else, which just would not work. Plus a laptop that costs less than a console would probably run it the same.
---
No, don't. You won't have this kind of luck again.
---
People say druids don't Excel at anything, but they're at least as good of a tank as a warrior, before raids. And even in raids, they're definitely viable.
---
It's much more varied in retail. But this is a game with literally thousands and thousands of quests, they won't all be as in-depth and interesting as runescape quests. 
---
There are some really cool questlines in retail wow though (and classic).
---
Wow runs on a potato so
---
If you did not post that, I would of thought you're one of *those guys*.
---
Your condescending tone doesn't really help your argument. Your argument relies on a warrior and a mage shaking hands at 30 yards apart and starting a duel (Guess how often that happens). Unless you pre-emptively detect magic on warriors who are running at you, you probably won't know he has a FAP on, you might try to frost nova him, and he'll probably be in melee before you realize you need to polymorph. Even if you are polymorphing, guess what? The potion this thread is literally about dispels that, that's what this post is about. Like I said, it's not impossible for a mage to outplay a warrior with this tool, that's always a factor, but your argument consistently relies on "Well i'm already super far away what's he gonna do, he didn't charge me at the beginning of combat" how do you know that? what do you do if he did charge you? you've got a hamstring on you and no way of peeling him. Are you still gonna win that fight? Your argument is very based in "I'm too good to get caught by this noob shit," when every person gets caught offguard at some point. The fundamental game of chicken for a warrior and a mage is the warrior trying to get a charge off on the mage so he can force a blink. Stop trying to patronize me about fundamentals as a way of defending your point.

Majorly different situations from using it in the open world (where it is meant to exist) to refresh mobs, and in dungeons (where is not meant to exist) to instantly respawn bosses and circumvent instance caps.
---
Average reaction time of a person is about 250ms. I havent seen official batching windows, but it doesnt seem like interrupting EA is too likely (possible but not probable) which means a 500ms cast time shouldnt be that much of a detriment. Stun resist is still RNG too.
---
You might want to say what you're trying to buy. Otherwise, this post doesn't really mean anything.
---
I doubt this only happens after harassing someone. I think it is more about having the last word with the other person not beeing able to respond.
---
I didn‚Äôt thought I would it that much... it‚Äôs insane!
---
It was a joke, dude...
---
I wonder when you will realize that people like different things.
---
Yeah I really wish Blizz would add that. They updated the interface option to include other things that weren't in vanilla like target icons, doesn't seem like this would be a big detraction from the vanilla experience at all.
---
I‚Äôm a mage and saw warriors rolling with that in rfc and I was like wtfffff but they told me the same I‚Äôm seeing here - it has mad dps! I‚Äôll be damned
---
The main reason I want BC is for better spec balance.
---
Choose your realm based on how you want to play (PvP, PvE, RP) and time-zone. 
---
I'd check to see if there's a queue in the evening, otherwise it should be fine.
---
Yesterday I was questing in Swamp of Sorrows in the same area as a gnome mage. At one point I turned around and noticed the mage had pulled an extra mob and was almost dead. I sent my pet in to help and killed the mob for him. Later I pulled a few too many mobs and was able to kill them all but I only had about 20hp left. The mage came over and sheeped me to let me heal back to full health before smacking me to break the sheep. I thanked him and we both went on our way.
---
Even though I rolled on a PvP server, I love when I get the chance to experience some cross faction cooperation.
---
And on the alliance side, it's RUIN.
---
Wowpop.appspot.com
---
That‚Äôs true, can definitely still feel the imbalance in areas like that, there are more level 60 horde than alliance at this point for sure. But in leveling zones the play experience is significantly better from my experience. Going through STV/Ashenvale the first time close to release I was being camped 24/7 and it felt like the zones were 5:1, my second time through feels nearly even, maybe 55:45, definitely spend much less time spent dead.
---
I agree that Orcs probably have the absolute best PvP racial of all, but dwarves and especially gnomes have crazy good racials as well.

Genau :D

Uh... some people have stuff going on, maybe like a girlfriend asking to help do something real quick, check on their animals/feed them, or something else. Accept that there‚Äôs other human beings playing this game and that it‚Äôs just a game or you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.
---
The bummer about Stalagg is the early polls and info showed it as really balanced before launch (i think there was even a forum post claiming it to be the Alliance pvp server to counter herod?), which is what convinced me to swap my reserved names to it.            
---
                    
---
Within the early zerg the balance seemed fine with plenty of brawls to go around but now that I've started leveling alts I can see the contested zone are almost all horde.
---
The only way to avoid the raid xp bug would have been to not create any raid groups at all. That is pretty unavoidable.
---
Especially considering even with the fix, people were running with 10 people because it was still faster. That means these people weren't going out of their way to abuse the bug, just doing what they would have done anyways.

Found the number fetishists

Seconded.  Works great, using wine / lutris on Fedora 30.

This ‚Äúfixes‚Äù the TTL thing referenced in this thread:
---
1) add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf
---
net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=128
---
2) make it persistent and take effect:
---
sysctl -p
---
Honestly (referring to your second edit) - if this story is true then they deserve to be harassed and other people on your server deserve to know that this is the kind of bullshit that this GM and his officers are going to pushing onto their guild for all of vanilla. 
---
If I saw a GM and officer behaving that way - meaning that they think this is acceptable, I'd just leave, instantly. As the main tank who is pre bis geared and helping everyone else in my guild get geared up, I'm quite sure that the majority would leave with me.
---
Hey. I can do all of those things, thank you very much. Playing WoW and watching sports is a match made in heaven and is one step down from chocolate and peanut butter.
---
Paladin tanks are great for 5 mans, but they do lack a taunt.

dumb question but is this a Macro? Or can I just type this into chat and it will work? lol.

I think you get an upgrade in AQ40, but it's been a while, so my memory could be off

Gratz!

Do you use a quiver?

If you're looking ot buy the cheapest Macbook you can get, I'd recommend something else. Can likely pick-up a Macbook Pro 2013-2014 off eBay starting around $300, and it'll also still support macOS upgrades.
---
As for support, it's tricky to get information on what GPU is being used in those laptops. It has to support Metal. It looks like those two laptops use NVIDIA graphics.
---
You're completely moving the goalposts here. Blizzard has measured many times, and still made the same cuts. They know what choices they made, and that's how they decided to steer the game originally. People are still playing, so maybe it was not wrong?
---
For the record, I've played and enjoyed retail--but classic and retail are different games, and I don't think they should be the same. I would be disappointed if they resurrected classic just to make the game into retail all over again.
---
So to be clear: Retail is its own game. I see no reason why classic should become retail. If you do think that classic should become retail, you may want to examine why you are playing classic.
---
Stupid question but was does +15 herb actually is used for? Are there any herbs you can only pick with 315? I honestly can‚Äòt remember.
---
RP-PvP servers tend to have less of them.
---
Wallpaper Engine is the shit.
---
Why would you bring this to Reddit first over your guild or it‚Äôs officers?
---
It‚Äôs a one sided story so without some ridiculous SS proof there‚Äôs no way anyone here can help.
---
If you see an issue take it to your officers it LC first, before trying to shame loot council to reddit.
---
Blizzard is amazing for good tanks who use it to kite around huge groups of mobs so they dont fuck the healer over unless you have a few mages who can rotate CoC really well.
---
I think if 2k people upvote a post it's probably fine to leave it up. But what do I know
---
My goal is to have an alt who FUCKS MAGES. My entire character will be built around killing frost mages (my main is a warrior so you can understand why I want to do this) but ALSO I want an open world/solo dungeon farmer. I'm thinking either Warlock Or Hunter or Druid. I will be grinding all the way to 60 on mobs for specific loot and going out of my way to camp every mage I see. The goal is to make 1k gold by level 60 and have a fun time doing it. Any tips/suggestions? haha.
---
It seems like you don't actually know what we are talking about.
---
If only we had the pre-BC patch. At the start of BC my bear was a god. Armor was capped out and I did crazy dps while tanking through kara
---
Completely agree with all this. This is why I hope we don't get BC again.
---
Yes I understand this, but I am not level 60 yet, so I do not raid, so I have no use for the "use effect" of the MCP yet. I won't be wasting my 3 charges on my current one for doing level 30 quests.
---
I really like my mage, but I also really wanna try warrior, because it was my first character years ago. Also I really want to try healer role (prob as a shaman). But I have almost no time :D *(To be honest I'd like to try every class and profession, but it feels impossible :) )*
---
How can I manage this? Lvl up warrior and shaman only to some low lvl as twinks? 19/29/39  
---
What lvl is the best for this classes as twinks?
---
Not really, only a very small minority would hate the changes in BC.
---
The vast majority of people would like the qol features, flying, class balance, arenas, etc.
---
Are you on a RP server?
---
There's a saying about assuming... how did it go again?
---
So 2h would be more accurate but hit less, and dualwielding would hit for more damage but i'd miss more, correct?
---
What are you on about? I had 7 ping in the BR LoL server when I lived in Brazil and my connection was stable as fuck, I live in New England now and I get like 35 ping and Verizon fucking sucks. If you really believe that to be true I challenge you to find a single bad-mannered Brazilian player in Classic in a non-BR realm after the Brazilian realms open. I will gift you a month of subscription if you do so and provide proof.
---
Prat is awesome!
---
I'm just not a huge fan of introducing anything outside of the game is already on PC.

I like waiting for horde to pull beasts in STV then fearing them, resulting in a pull they can't handle.

If you think loot council sucks than try DKP. Where a handful of douchebags hoard their points, get the hardest obtainables, then pick up gear scraps everyone has gotten for next to nothing. That's why DKP is pretty much "dead"
---
Just fix your loot council. Preferably include regular guild members on a rotating basis or have members submit everything they want and post a loot schedule.
---
Got it from Angerforge second kill, had to roll against 2 other people. Like I said used all my luck for the rest of classic haha
---
Just give everyone invite rights n just have officers remove bad eggs.   If it's lvlking it's usually casual with few rules.  :)
---
Getting an extra 2 DPS from a strength weapon may not be worth giving up all the spirit which is nutty for leveling.
---
I feel dumb cuz I just paid for artisan skinning at lvl 27.  I was hoping to skin leather to sell In my 30s but maybe I didn't need to do it.  Down to like 14 gold now
---
Leveling a rogue alt to kill some time.
---
Where do I see my combo points? Do I just mentally keep track? And how do I generate them?
---
Every time I try googling I just get talent tree suggestions.
---
Alright I‚Äôll just level it naturally and focus on leveling, maybe fill my bank up with some ore/bars and wait for the phases, appreciate it!
---
This with a sword build?
---
No, MCP is simply bis at all times
---
Upvoted because your name is epic.
---
Spirit is great for all casters while leveling...
---
Healer here, i love mages with premature explosion.

Cant wait for warsong pvp while listening to billy talent- red flag

Your casual attitude disgusts me

33 hunter Sovryn checking in! Horde pvp has been too much fun so far

Did this trek last night, I have a flight time addon and this flight took about 13 and a half minutes lol
---
&gt; My main's UI in retail looked similar to OP's
---
disgusting?
---
But you can melee at 5 yards, so that's just a 3 yard span you need to traverse to swap between melee and shooting, easily doable with the 3 second melee/shot timers you would have.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
This is war and you my friend are a Warrior, literally. Lok'tar Ogar!

Westfall is Alliance territory. Working as intended.

WoW is a game you can just join and play as well. Leveling is as much a part of the game as being 60. Acting like you're not experiencing the game until 60 is ridiculous. 
---
What is it about Fortnite that you believe isn't a grind? Playing round after round of Fortnite is a grind you're playing for hours with the hope of doing well and improving your skill. Stating that the way they choose to play the game somehow changes it from being a grind is just an odd stance to take. They're spending hours playing the game with the hope to improve. That is my definition of grind and from what I've heard from others that seems to be the general accepted definition. There are definitely kids who practice stuff in creative mode on Fortnite a lot and look up guides to improve themselves frequently. Look at a few tips and tricks videos for Fortnite and look at the views for those videos. It is factually incorrect to state that kids aren't watching those videos. All top players have spent a good amount of time in creative mode practicing and even if they didn't and just played the game for hours how is that not a grind if they're looking to improve?
---
Not really sure why I need to change your mind. We're having a conversation. A conversation isn't something where one side wins and the other loses. That's a juvenile way to approach them.
---
WoW and OSRS are the most famous examples of your definition of grind absolutely. Kids may be less forgiving of your type of grind than they used to be.
---
There was a huge backlash when Pokemon took out the National Pokedex so clearly that shift to remove some aspects of grinding isn't being well received in that community which doesn't help your point. Shouldn't they embrace an easier game if it is as you say?
---
I'm seeing a shift in the type of grind kids enjoy, not an indication that they all of a sudden dislike grinds entirely. Again it's a matter of perspective but you've yet to give a compelling argument as to why Fortnite isn't a grind to get good.
---
Yeah and also thinks dwarves really should have bonus blacksmith
---
Everyone needs attune.
---
Trash respawns.
---
Don't take anyone under 58.
---
You need mages to curse cure on first boss
---
Its very hard to find a proper tank right now though. Everytime someone wants to tank they are the same arms warri that cant hold aggro.
---
That rogue‚Äôs daggers are going to be super useful.
---
&gt; I think the problem is yeah, it's possible to heal through it off spec, but when the tank+healer are both off spec, tanks take way too much damage and my mana gets drained so quickly from the big heals I have to constantly throw out.
---
Good point. It's typical that the group blames the healer first when anyone dies, but with the "two-handed tankz lol" meta being promoted by high profile streamers it's just as much a problem that most "tanks" are not spec'ed into defensive talents, wearing all DPS gear, and don't even carry a 1H+Shield to swap to. And then they bitch about healers not being 30+ points deep in healing spec. You maybe can push past 50 if either the tank or the healer are properly geared and talented, but at some point meme specs just don't cut it for anyone any more.
---
uhh in retail there are actually tanks because its easy to hold threat
---
I think it was a BoE blue...not BoP
---
7-8 hours in game for a bag full of Crowd Pummelers, or spend the same amount of time for 1 chance at Ironfoe with its 1% drop rate.
---
At level 40 I still recommend wiping up the remaining green/yellow quests in the ilvl 30-40 zones (hillsbrad, desolace, shimmering flats, northern stv, etc). You'll be at a level to knock them out fast, get exp, and get a few extra levels to start in Tanaris and have an easier time without hitting a wall with orange/red quests filling up your logs. It's what I started doing this playthrough and it's been the smoothest leveling experience I've ever had.
---
That said, if you have a leveling buddy then it will be a lot easier in matter what. So if that person's always going to be with you then Tanaris should be fine.
---
These are all great points.
---
I‚Äôd say the one positive offered by the faster weapon speed would be the increased uptime on your improved Aspect of the Hawk, proc.
---
But it hardly makes up for the losses.
---
I resort to Questie because I'm tired of missing half of quests, because quest-giver is in basement or second floor. &gt;_&gt;  
---
I don't have time to check everywhere after I turn in every quest.
---
What? No.
---
Yeah it seems like the majority don‚Äôt have the gold by 40! Any suggestions where to quest? I‚Äôm a lvl 40 warrior, so I can have some trouble with mobs if they‚Äôre 1-2 lvl higher than me
---
You can use it more than once. I believe it has 3 charges.
---
Depending on your class, MC/Ony gear is going to squash anything you get out of 5-mans unfortunately.
---
Ranking is during phase 2, and even getting into MC/Ony is pretty pugable, and would be worthwhile to try and get your feet into before phase 3 pops when BG's / BWL rolls around. 
---
If you're a melee class, the unfortunately reality is you're going to need to raid to be really effective in pvp.
---

*glances at Retribution, Prot Paladin, Survival, Balance, Feral, several others* Er, yeah, just the one. How dastardly.
---
All imma say is if you're a warrior NOT grinding dungeons, you don't get to complain. 
---
There's a trillion people (and their mothers) looking for tanks for exp farming grps. if you think it's boring or don't wanna do it -- that's fine everyone's entitled to play how they want to -- however don't be complaining cuz all I see all day is LF1 tank ZF aoe grind or Cath aoe grind...
---
Literally like 60-90k exp / hour and you, as a warrior, wanna quest... **Ya it's gonna suck**
---
Everything people are farming that isn't critical to leveling or convenience isn't for immediate gold return. They're expecting demand to increase as people get more gold in the coming months.
---
It‚Äôs off one of the easiest bosses to get to.  You can spam General/arena runs 5x an hour.  Ironfoe is rare - in P1 right now HOJ is not rare.
---
Ok if you haven't done these things they can help but mileage may Vary 
---
* Open any file explorer (Doesn't matter the location)
---
* Find "This PC", right click and hit properties
---
* Go to advanced Tab&gt; Performance Settings

* Hit the Bubble for Choose Best Performance

This will remove all the fancy pants transitions when you move, max or minimize a window.. essentially it's all aesthetic and you don't need that.

If your hard drive is indexed you can go to it's properties and deselect the "Allow indexing for faster .... "

---
A question for those folks that are developers.  When something mission critical like this fails, do heads roll?  Is it normally a single person responsible, or is the blame distributed among the team members?
---
In other industries, you screw up this bad, you're fired.  I'm just curious how this works in development.
---
Not sure if you're serious. 
---
Horses are,  in fact,  insanely strong swimmers. A Centaur would only be stronger.
---
If you aren't grinding with early aughts metal playlist then why even bother playing classic at all?
---
I would take every option to improve my graphics tbh. If it only affects my perspective then it's even better because no one else would be "annoyed" by it. Win-win, isn't it?
---
Yeah, trust me, he felt pretty badass being that guy too.
---
Whether you seal-twist or weapon-swap, you have your button to push for extra DPS in Classic.
---
Classic+ is not a good idea.  
---
We asked for vanilla, we were angry when they forced the shutdown of private servers, so, here we are with a Vanilla clone, more or less.  
---
No "+" nor expansions, probably.
---
Thanks! :)
---
This is such a bad take.
---
/drool
---
It's really unclear what you're trying to say here. You might want to edit it to clarify your thoughts somewhat.
---
It'd also help to take out some of the raging-14-year-old tone.
---
Same, except living in my parents basement after moving out of my apartment and waiting to close on my house.  Literally playing in the same spot I used to. It‚Äôs surreal to say the least lol.
---
Why do I see this after I already rerolled
---
Then why put it on AH now?
---
Yes. They watch streamers play and then build their tank the same way, then  they dont know how to navigate the dungeon let alone the nuances of tanking.
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to post this! I guess the hunter equivalent is Arcane Shot. With a slower bow, my Arcane Shot will do more damage, if I'm reading this correctly.
---
I was lucky, I heard about the exploiting right as my sub expired.  I've seen too many exploits and mistakes go unpunished or not rectified, so as for me, I'll be waiting until a new server is opened before I decide to get back into the game.  And if they don't open new servers, it's been a fun ride.  No way am I leveling to 60 on a server with a busted economy.
---
Wow porn.
---
I don't believe you landed a charge and hamstring on a level 60. Assuming he was 60 as you said epic armored mount.
---
Melee cleave is awful, yes
---
They can pretend to care as much as I'm pretending to care. True friendship.
---
Only if they are whacking mobs in caster form.
---
well, some of us rolled there without too much thinking and never foresee the popularity being that big, I aint rerolling my 56 char. Will level to 60 and see what it will be later on, but already started an alt elsewhere.
---
Fair enough, misread on my part
---
Can turn them on in scrolling combat text in interface options. Neatplates will show them on the health bar above enemy. Also they should be visible on the enemy portrait.
---
Also, for anyone who played retail, they have over a decade of having LOTS of pets. I personally had one back in the day but now couldn‚Äôt really care less
---
Not really KoS but Cumlor is the patron Saint of world chat on Fairbanks.
---
Ah so you don‚Äòt fail gathering herbs during leveling. Now I get it. Thanks
---
The difference is one is a group of 5 guys playing the game as intended, while the other is one dude using third party software to have an advantage over everyone else. If the 5 really tight shaman friends all multi-box, then the one guy multi boxing won't be able to keep up either. It's just whoever has the best system and most money wins.
---
would be interesting but I doubt 1 person can manage all the mechanic....maybe.
---
What the actual fuck is that UI? A controller?! ü§Æ
---
Honestly I've been finding myself overestimating most classes this go around.
---
Winning 1v1 against shadow priests, paladins not being able to run all the way to safe spots or bubble/hearthing, mages sheeping me but then dying to a mob they aggroed with their initial snare, etc.  Players are mostly out of their element and still learning, to an extent I didn't expect.
---
Sure.  But "fear" has nothing to do with it.  It's pragmatism, plain and simple.
---
throwing knives just go into ranged slot and dont take up actual bag space.
---
no point getting a bow/gun unless it gives stats like str/agi/hit/crit/ap
---
I've been on a low pop (Anathema) since day 1, which is now medium more often than not, and it's been great.
---
Still enough people out in the world to find groups for quests, without areas being overwhelmed and having to fight for mobs. Contested areas are populated enough for wpvp to pop up often. Finding groups for dungeons hasn't been an issue aside from very off-peak hours (like middle of the night, or mid-morning while everyone is at school or work). And best of all, haven't had a single queue. 
---
As others have said, the "low-med pop" right now is basically what vanilla servers were. If you've already got friends to play with, you're golden. Even if you don't, there's still plenty of guilds advertising in trade that you can join.
---
For anyone worried about the low pops dying off down the road...these servers are getting another round of free transfers today (tomorrow for the EU), with 14 high/full realms getting the option to go to Earthshaker. And once layering is removed, pops across the board will spike as everyone is forced into the world together.
---
So you find yourself usually going for full combo points? Do you use bear form at all?
---
Are you going out of your way to ask them if they're children? How do you know they're all adults?
---
If you want a real goldmine you need to farm thee ooze pet, its 20x the pet the whelping ever was.
---
:^O
---
As a priest healing dungeons, I love having a mage in groups.  Always give me free water, saving me money and polymorphing mobs to make the run safer.  Have to compete for gear sometimes but I don't mind at all, considering the runs go smoother with them  in group in my experience.
---
It‚Äôs easy to hold threat in classic to, if you actually attempt to tank. But everyone is in a rush so let‚Äôs 2h every dungeon and lose Aggro the second someone else attacks or heals.
---
Yeah it will often prioritise the better core players
---
Tho its not really a bad thing cuz they do carry the raid. Some others are just fillers that barely even bring consumables. Btw good officers should be able to easily tell why someone else didnt get the item.
---
I dont remember lc guilds giving more than 2 items to the same dude and even then it was prolly for the main tank or best healer.
---
It also matter for people to get along to pass items sometimes
---
what do you mean starfire on cd?
---
I don't cling to that notion at all, nor did I ever say they were a recruitment organization. This is something you pieced together by me using the word "right wing radicalization" in terms of describing the greater internet culture. What a lame, bad faith interpretation.
---
I've watched multiple of the higher ups in enclave spout common race and iq talking points in world chat. Idk if they just spam guild invites or what as it's a pretty big guild, but considering the greater climate online they're trying to create and their roots on /vg/, it's not a far reach to say it's run by white/race realist types.
---
 These types of communities are fairly common online, especially in places associated with 4chan subculture. You can tell me this isn't true but I've spent enough time around various boards over the past decade to have witnessed the degradation and weaponization of board culture.
---
It's very telling of your ideology that you're so forgiving torwards ethnonationalist thought while writing off pretty basic criticism as thought policing.
---
you have files and shortcuts on your desktop ? .... that's gross
---
I'm only level 34, but I recently started healing in dungeons (enhancement talents) and I'm usually 3rd on dps chart just from Auto attacking with windfury.  It's a lot of fun to contribute more than just healing.
---
I'm sure that will change later, but for now it's great.
---
Call back pet maccro. Click on it.
---
you sound toxic as fuck, and that you want pats on the back for being a cockbag.
---
I won't tank a cleave group. Yes it's quick xp but I get zero satisfaction out of it. I didn't come back to vanilla to blow through content as quickly as possible in the dullest possible way.

People just transfer and bring their gold and loot so that wont help.

Don't think there's a boe blue staff with Int on loot table. I could be wrong
---
Feet of lynx is also worth a fuckton of gold. Good luck selling it now for more than 50.
---
Its all about timing. Right now majority of people are low level, poor and busy getting their stuff sorted. They have no need for pets, nor do they have spare money for it. They would rather spend 300g getting pre-raid BIS epic than some shitty whelp.
---
6-7 months from now people will have money, and less stuff to spend said money on. This is where twink items will start to sell. This is when "cool" items will start to sell. This is when whelps will start to sell - because people will want them without spending time farming them.
---
Do also keep in mind that right now almost entire population is going through the low level zones, meaning a LOT of items get farmed now that will be much more rare later on.
---
If i were smart, id buy the cheap whelplings and save them, and sell them in half a year's time.

graveyard is pretty good exp if you've got a fast group but there is also some  excellent loot down there especially if you get some of the rares.
---
Are you implying that you wear leather or mail with garbage spell damage stats then?
---
Cloth is the way to go u less you want your lightning to deal less damage than a Renew tick...
---
What mod is that
---
Gotta love Improved Gouge
---
Questgiver is a liar!
---
A bit if exp and nothing else is NOT worth like 2 hours of farming those things
---
Huh, weird.  Im kind of surprised i dont remember it at all.  I think i at least had to run that way for the PvP vendors.
---
Is it possible that the fact that you have two kids could be the reason your wife is less than ecstatic with your hobby choices? Like, do you just shut her out and expect her to do all the parenting while you play? If so, then its not hating the hobby, its wanting support and their partner there with them.
---
Brave words for a man in double pyroblast range
---
Yeah it's BoE, that's why people usually all greed roll in UBRS pugs. Very expensive recipe.
---
Useless is a bit unfair. Improved stealth and a separate cooldown is something at least.
---
I did as well, and was laughed at by many groups, and made the druid healer in the group drop as they couldn't accept that a warrior would use it when I won it, replacing my SFK staff that replaced my Crescent Staff...
---
It is, they essentially just want to /follow a rdps tab out and tab back in every commercial break to spot heal the tank
---
Walk up the road towards azshara, he doesn't spawn there but walks that road up and down.
---
Not an addon, but you can use some guides:

A WoW player? Playing sports?
---
Just assume leveling up through the heavy leather recipes is free.  Crafting something and selling it usually nets more than AH prices for leather, since skinning is always taken on double gathering levelers.

&gt;burning crusade
---
I agree with your sentiment, but I'm not so sure about your timeline...
---
As someone who leveled all three of those classes to 60 in vanilla I can give you a somewhat educated opinion. If you hate melee leveling, you will absolutely hate leveling a paladin. They are by far the most boring class to level. It's not as painful as being a warrior because you can heal yourself, but it's just so boring because you don't have a lot of things to do. You seal up, auto attack for a bit, then judge and reseal. Eventually you get hammer of wrath to use when they get low, but that's it. You will fall asleep while leveling. Mages and hunters are much more engaging. Mages can AoE farm. Hunters have pets that can tank for them, or they can simply kite mobs to death if they hit too hard. As far as raiding goes, mages are going to be the best damage dealers all the way up through Naxx. Hunters start off well, but fall off after BWL because of how their gear scales with their abilities. That being said, hunters still bring some utility in terms of tranq shot, traps, and the aforementioned ability to kite an enemy forever if need be. As an added bonus, hunters get access to one of the best class quests in the game at 60. Paladins at 60 are almost always forced into a healing role because that's what they're best at (and they're insanely strong tank healers). They can dps or tank, but in endgame raid situations they're extremely suboptimal compared to warriors in both of those roles.

Now what you are going to want to do is create a night elf female. Now you wanna take that character to Stormwind. Now you jump up on the fountain in the trade district, you see. You're gonna wanna strip down at this point.
---
Now dance.
---
Should make about 10000g in a few hours
---
Exactly. Why do priests act like they‚Äôre the only ones who need spirit
---
The only thing more cringe then the video is that YouTube profile pic
---
Theres not a lot to win in Wpvp tho. Follow is disable in BG so, send a few warrior in, intimidating shout and watch chaos being born.
---
WoWhead shows that most young players are choosing horde, most older players are choosing Ally.
---
Deep prot will always be better, but in 5 man's it's just not needed, imo. With 31/5/15 Other than debuff problem it can even rank raids just fine, and has been done successfully.
---
Why transfer off Skeram? Good population lol.
---
Yea if a warrior already has Thrash Blade can he just zone in and have the ring master looted into his bags from the Scepter spot?
---
thinking of starting the game for the first time next week to actually commit, I played once a long time ago as a dranei Paladin for a month but am looking this time to maybe go as a priest and Ive read conflicting things about best race spec in horde, troll or forsaken. Any thoughts or tips? I‚Äôm leaning troll as of now.
---
Np I had to google this myself.
---
5 mans in classic are a bit slow and boring.  Also not much gear .
---
She tells you it's in the center of Tarren Mill, doesn't she? Or did I just assume and get lucky?
---
If you get a healing addon like HealBot, you can see an estimate of the incoming healing on the bars.
---
Read this, highly recommended:  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)
---
Combat daggers is actually higher DPS than sword spec in many cases unless you're a human, specifically.
---
&gt; And no druid is not PUG king, you can‚Äôt respec, so you have one spec and that‚Äôs all, and feral druid suck at healing, plzn don‚Äôt group as healer of you‚Äôre not one
---
Druids just need a set of healing gear.  You can heal in feral until the low  50s/high 40s perfectly fine unless you're just bad at playing healer.
---
I don't seem to have the quest Raising Spirits in Hammerfall... I was able to accept Fouls Magic from Tor'gan/Gor'mul but Raising Spirits isn't there to accept. Was I suppose to do a prior quest for it to become eligible?
---
Yeah, they pushed dailies, flying mounts, easy dungeons, LFR... you should stop with your fantasy land mate, you're never going to have a Classic version of WoW.
---
Can you understand how stupid your comment is in /r/classicwow ?
---
&gt;An aware tank
---
I wish this were the norm
---
Is there a guide?
---
Oh he thicc thicc
---
I don't see the problem. Make a group, explain the rules of your group, and kick people who break them. Someone ninjas, kick them out immediately.
---
You're doing a fantastic job on these - I hope that you consider doing one featuring Tirion Fordring and the opening quest that features the player taking a /sit as they listen to his past. Great job!
---
If I remember correctly, failing just halts the event and the npc resets immediately. But if it fails because someone intervened, the npc will despawn for a number of hours. You don‚Äôt lose the eyes, though.
---
These posts are always all or nothing.  Keep classic going add classic+ content, cool beans.  Introduce separate servers for TBC for the millions of people that like TBC the same way people liked classic enough to beg for it.  
---
Its just weird to me there always seems to be an ‚Äúus or them‚Äù mentality when discussing these things.  Wasn‚Äôt everyone pretty bummed at retail players doing essentially the same thing?
---
Thanks! Are you using GatherMate with together the ClassicData? Can't seem to get the nodes to show up on the map
---
Ok I hadn't imported the data, its on the map now.
---
It's not clutter if you turn everything off. It's very customizable, you know that right? So turn everything off except your own healing numbers and it's super clean and minimalist. I even changed the size/location, etc. of them so I like how it looks and it blends in with the other Blizzard stuff and doesn't look out of place.
---
As for the numbers themselves, it shows you how much healing you do to other people so you still see all the numbers, just not above people's heads - it shows up wherever you decide to put that box. But it does show you who you healed and for how much, and you can configure crit heals to show up differently as well so they stand out. Works pretty well because it shows the exact same information you're asking for, just in a different location.
---
No I never once said the facts of the other guy are wrong. I said fat it‚Äôs his opinion this mount isn‚Äôt as good as the other mounts and that it‚Äôs not worth the time. Read a thread before you comment
---
Imagine being such a self-centered, emotionally insecure, pathetic loser that you actually get butthurt when someone accidentally doesn't congratulate you for hitting the maximum level with your digital character in a 15-year-old computer game.
---
I‚Äôm a warrior so I only use ranged for some pulls...
---
You cant compare what its selling for in retail with classic as reasoning for thinking it will sell for a lot here, it's kind of redundant.
---
Duskwood chat and STV chat has been equally impressive.
---
Run dungeons with casters only. Enjoy them bickering over staves and shit while you get to keep that sweet sweet Hand of Justice
---
You can have a lot of redundancies when you're playing careful.
---
Is there a decent benefit in having Herbalism 300 at lvl 45?
---
I see you've achieved your final form then.
---
Yes, procs on melee hit not weapon hit. If you're going to try powershifting cat DPS you want this.
---
Well your obliviousness is a good second reason.
---
But the first reason, since I have to point it out, is glaringly obvious. Look at the lower part of your screen capture. If you don't see it, then there's no hope.
---
Lol.  Can‚Äôt send gold cross faction unfortunately. Playing on horde mode xD
---
Given that WF hits can proc Ravager I'm gonna say yes.
---
If they hadn't messed Tauren Female models up, maybe. The classic versions are much better. They have a softer gentler face, their necks and heads are almost more equine. They look more at peace. The newer models made Tauren really derpy and agressive "bodybuilder". The only thing I tend to like more about the updated models is the hands. Original tauren female have some freaky claw hands.
---
Hey :) It's me yea, glad you liked my mage guide.
---
They use it as a tool to further their power. What I love about a certain type of Warcraft warlocks is they don't just borrow from some patron that'll screw them over in the end as some narrative about the wrongs of the "Dark Path", but rather people who claim power to themselves through their own intellect, sheer will, tenacity and ambition.
---
The are fucking evil of course with the souls of ~~innocents~~ adversaries as the fuel of some of their magic.
---
I ran up on a mage with a fresh mass kill and started to skin... then I quickly realized I forgot to ask while he was drinking. I asked, he said he skinned. 
---
I quickly kited over two fresh kills to replace the ones I skinned in error and apologized
---
be a bro, you never know when it may pay off in dividends
---
Sounds like either someone is also leveling or trying to control the market
---
You can keep trying, but if I recall correctly, there is a cooldown on how often you could attempt it (maybe once per day? I could be wrong).
---
you'll struggle to level it that high by then but you can make some good money off them
---
It is factually worse, it's not his opinion.
---
That mage is an asshole. Kick and get new DPS.
---

Found the mods alt account.
---
''I agree with your point but not the way you made  it, so I shall do nothing'' translates to ''I want to sit here on my high horse so I'll pretend like I have principles and that I agree, but really I just wanna snark on somebody''.
---
It also bugs out if you abandon the quest.
---
I had it plus Rig Wars but abandoned it to do an escort quest.
---
When I went back it was no longer available.
---
Honestly? I'm not even interested in finding out what happens in BfA or later... I can just play Classic forever.
---
Never aggro'd a guard at level 35 either.
---
Because those addons dont give EXACT location of NPC's that walk around
---
Also, wtf is wrong with your group?
---
Slamming deviate delights in a dungeon? Do they like throwing away their gold for no reason at all?
---
I wonder if a addon could display the dungeon maps
---
Well at least your guild isn‚Äôt full blown racist
---
He was making an analogy. I‚Äôm not sure it really sends the message well, but I get their point. When choosing to roll on a PvP server, you should expect this to happen in contested areas, and especially if you‚Äôre in the other factions zone. Someone participating in what has been facilitated by the game designers is not being a dick. This is where the guys analogy comes in. You‚Äôre saying someone is a dick for the specific way they engage in PvP, and that guy is saying that‚Äôs the same as calling someone a dick for an act of omission. Like I said, don‚Äôt think it fits as well, but you can‚Äôt be upset for what someone chooses to do within the limits of the game. If the developers didn‚Äôt want this to happen and also thought it was a ‚Äúdick move‚Äù they would put some type of invincibility within pvp on lower level players, or players with a certain health threshold. But they didn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a part of the game to be killed at 10% health and the opposing faction has every right to dance on your corpse for putting yourself in that position. It‚Äôs a PvP server. You‚Äôre not a bad person for playing the game. Just like you‚Äôre not a bad person for NOT volunteering at a soup kitchen.
---
Is this Razorgore?
---
WotLK was the deathblow, it just took until Cata to bleed out. See: community backlash against difficult dungeons at the start of Cata. That happened because WotLK casualized the game.
---
We also need to avoid flying, I think TBC should be reworked heavily to not need it if we must do TBC.
---
Lol mine is the same way! Except her trade off is sports and cars, she cares much more for them. If I talk sports I can see her eyes glaze over
---
this does NOT work (edit: in Classic):
---
your mate will only get as much %exp from that mob as he did %dmg to it -&gt; you burst it so he is only getting very low % of possible exp from that mob
---
No addon necessary! Just "show friendly health bars" - default key for this is SHIFT+V.
---
Yeah hes since edited it and you're right
---
This is coming from a person who only started playing WoW when Classic released.
---
But when I read up which class was best for priest from what I saw for PvE troll is best and for PvP undead is best.
---
Interesting. I've mained a rogue since TBC and every guide I've read (from Icy-Veins to Shadowpanther) mentions SND as the priority in a leveling rotation. 
---
Always figured that the faster swings added up to more damage than you'd get from one finisher. But I do love big numbers, so I'll try the Cheap Shot -&gt; SS to 5 -&gt; Evisc/Kidney and see if that reduces my downtime at all.
---
the differences are pretty minimal, play what you think is cooler and you'll enjoy the game a lot more
---
Similar story but younger: I was a nerd in hs, playing the typical Halo Minecraft Gow, but I also loved baseball (pretty good at) and basketball(not so good at). Not a lot of guys talked about gaming outside of madden and COD so I never talked about my favorite games. Fell into the same mold when I went to college. Joined a fraternity, partied my ass off, dominate intramural and did the typical frat guy shit for my first 2 years and then got serious about my major (civil engineering) and left the frat before my senior year. I still gamed hard in my free time throughout, which led to many short relationships and a reputation in the sororites as a nicer guy that was secretly weird. My senior year I lived with some engineers I knew and we talked about gaming all the time and it was pretty awesome, besides senior year classes. I got really good at PUBG and then Fortnite and could always talk about it. I would learn about games they played too and we would just bond over gaming (and beer). I graduate with a job already lined up and all my friends went their seperate ways. So for the past 1.5 years, I've been a construction engineer working with old army guys, construction lifers and the like with no one talk about gaming with irl. When Fortnite starting coming suicide and my gaming group started thinninf, I switched to Wow to stay connected with a couple guys just so I had someone to talk to about gaming and hang with. Now they've stopped gaming since they are in their late 20s and don't have the time anymore and Ive slowly gone back to solo gaming. Post graduation depression is a real thing but I feel worse since the last semesters were the happiest I'd ever been. Sry 4 da rant
---
He patrols up and down that road, and he can be killed by Ally as well though that is rare.
---
Thanks.  using this now.  It's not transparent though.  the empty bag slots.  but i guess that's fine.
---
yup i was like that pre-college... like exactly like that... bue the problem was the people that i was hangin with...
---
&gt; I don't trust you voting for anything good at all.
---
Zero points on this post, I'd say we're doin' pretty good so far lol.
---
It‚Äôs silly to assume cosmetic changes (new racial models) would be guaranteed to lead to mechanical change (LFG implementation).
---
People play Classic for the experiences, the gameplay and social interactions. How that‚Äôs visually presented doesn‚Äôt matter quite that much.
---
will this run it  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07STVCZG8/ref=psdc\_429886031\_t2\_B075FCF511](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07STVCZG8/ref=psdc_429886031_t2_B075FCF511)
---
Definitely this. Couple of friends on biggles got away with it. I asked for proof they linked all their epic loot and showed me their massive bank account. O well, life goes on, blizzard fucked up tho.
---
Or maybe the fact that there is thousands more people on your server than 15 years ago, so as a byproduct there will be more assholes.
---
We don't really know if it will change. It's just speculation at this point.
---
Yeah I got in a group last night for BRD and there were 2 friends in there that after we killed a boss asked me to leave to get their friend in.
---
The coffee at my job is terrible. Patrick needs to learn how to make a decent damn pot!!
---
they tend to go more for detection than manual verification. they would have to put so many resources into manual verification that with this player base, it's just not worth the time and effort so it hasn't been their method for quite some time. you are also correct on ban waves, it hits the bot developers way harder when it's a giant wave because they can't simply patch it out and make the buyers happy or warn buyers that it's been detected so they can prevent getting banned.
---
Neato comment there champ ol' sport
---
Why are you tanking in arms/fury?? You can't blame other people when you're tanking wrong.
---
What is torch running?
---
Blizzard usually bans botters in waves rather than one at a time.
---
If they are botting and get banned, it‚Äôll likely be as part of a mass banning of people using that bot.
---
Also, Garrosh Hellscream did nothing wrong.
---
Because if they Wana ninja loot they will still do it. Who cares if you kick them once they already have the item.
---
I doubt the majority would want flying - its most often pointed to in discussions about where retail went wrong.
---
\&gt; This is just how I type.
---
You are doing it wrong my friend. Please type your next assignment / report at work like this and let me know how it went. Willing to bet quite a sum that they will not read it but just throw it away...
---
You should google "classic hunter raid dps rotation" to realize that even in raids, melee weaving can increase dps for hunters. You just move between ranges while your autofire is on CD.
---
I think you misunderstood what he‚Äôs saying.
---
Who started the fight? When ever I play PvP servers who ever started the fight is wrong to me and ill go out of my way to make them lose.
---
I Love this! 
---
The other day I walked past a similar situation where there was this moshpit of lvl 40+ hordes around a lowbie dwarf duking it out with their lowbie guldmate. Guldmate lost, moshpit opened for the dwarf. 
---
Ammo costs add up, but your playstyle affects that also. If you use a dps pet and melee mobs your costs are cheaper, while if you use a tank pet and kill from range they are way higher. I personally play marks and use a tank pet, so I'm gonna spend more on ammo, as i find that the fastest way to kill and level. A survival build where you mostly melee and just use your ranged to pull and debuff is cheaper on the wallet.
---
Because you can't roll a Kul'tiran in Classic.
---
Umm, lots of horde have killed ony, You can watch Skarm's Fury guild do it on his stream from his most recent video, its somewhere in the middle of the 8 hours. 
---
Basically, every group has a tremor totem, and for a split second everybody runs around like a chicken with its head cut off and then its back to murdering it.
---
Beutiful screen cap
---
Literally not angry, literally just telling you that you‚Äôre trying to interject about classic and bfa being different when the conversation was about whether or not we should be already planning for what classic is moving forward.
---
Sorry you‚Äôre too committed to being wrong to consider that you jumped into something you didn‚Äôt understand lol.
---
I am trying to be better and live by this rule but everytime I try to 1v1 someone I get jumped by another. It's definitely not side specific. I get gang banged by horde groups all the time. But see alliance doing it as well. It's just people &amp; world pvp
---
This is the kind of obsessive personality that classic appeals to!  Someone with lots and lots of free time to waste being perfectly happy doing a repetitive task.
---
Westfall has more alliance, like 75:25
---
Meanwhile I cant find people to kill the elites that drop it
---
Anyone else on judgement alliance wanna do it?
---
I'll grats someone for dinging 40 (because mount), and 60. That's it.
---
The ding spam drives me insane. Especially when it's something absolutely inconsequential like level 10-11.
---
Tons of people are just absolutely starving for attention.
---
###REMOVE
---
###HORDE
---
Or a 3 min mage. But that's a warrior there good sir, and by the looks a poorly geared one - why would he charge for the ore otherwise.
---
it's childish to expect your SO not to antagonize you for your hobbies?
---
üòÇ
---
Awesome, I appreciate it.
---
Our first clear was with 10x 60s and rest 57+ with a couple 55s.
---
The only guys we focused getting gear on was tanks. You can use the onyxia buff and mindcontrol in LBRS for fire resist to help. Make sure as many people as possible bring greater fire resist or normal fire resist pots. Helps the healers a ton.
---
Did you do the quest Hammerfall from Gor‚Äômul. Seems like it‚Äôs a prereq
---
There is an interface option to show multiple extra bars, in keybinds it will tell you ths name of those bars.
---
I have 3 priests. I played 2 priests in vanilla. Leveling a priest is nothing like playing a priest at Max level. 
---
Leveling a priest just isn't for me. Playing one is awesome.
---
I'm on Earthfury and it's growing every day. Groups are becoming easier and easier to come by, and they just opened up ~12 servers that can transfer there, so it's going to be populated in no time.
---
Thank you! Downloaded it right away!
---
The hinterlands trinket it only horde. If not horde, HoJ is BiS for hunters. Personally (as a hunter), I think a hunter is still a complete asshole for rolling on it over melee unless there is an understanding going into the instance. But that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the only trinkets in the game that actually does anything for hunters.
---
It's less about having a dedicated laundry room and more about how nice of a room that is for being "just" a laundry room.
---
Just because the game doesn't limit it doesn‚Äôt make it not a dick move. The game doesn't limit my ability to camp someone for hours on end until they give up and log off, but it's a dick move to do. I get it 100% I play on a PvP server, I expect to get ganked from time to time. If someone ganks me at 10% and OOM, shit happens‚Ä¶but if you‚Äôre going to dance on my corpse after the fact you‚Äôre 100% being a dick.
---
Why are this deep into this thread? Would you like to see my penis?
---
This sounds pretty logical, but he joined the group as a dps, so he should only need on dps items. However if he'd talk to the groub beforehand it might have been OK.
---
This is totally fine for leveling.  I'd use it for sure. 
---
You should be BM spec anyway and using serpent sting and immolation trap to grind efficiently.  Most of your damage coming from autos is just fine.
---
You're not wrong. It kinda sucked the wind out of my sails. I had originally gotten the Dark Whelpling while doing a quest and some people in my guild were acting all excited and telling me things like, "You basically just got your epic mount!"
---
There weren't any on the AH at the time so I almost believed them and held onto it in my bank. Now there is ~5-6 on my server for 15-20g a pop. Lol
---
Human Warr on Kromcrush and I had the weirdest RP encounter of my life that legit made me "WTF" at my computer. Two humans come swimming out of the Red Ridge lake and start arguing. One is calling the other son and the other is refereeing to the other as dad. They run off arguing about a ring one of them find and I almost stopped questing to follow them...almost.
---
This though, this would have made me stop.
---
&gt; These numbers will be displayed on ElvUI nameplates and Target UnitFrames (as long as you ask it to do so in the options). 
---
How do you ask it to do so in the options?
---
I'd like to see some sort of growth and change towards the end of the last phase, and I think there's a lot of people who are with me there. Hopefully they announce something at blizzcon.
---
Using game mechanics isn't abuse, you absolute moron. Blizzard KNEW this would happen and they were clearly OK with it because they realized it'd be near impossible to gather resources in any normal amount of time in phase 1 due to the amount of players. So layering serves this purpose until phase 2 when it will be removed. You're so fucking dense it's actually hilarious. But do keep playing the way you're playing, more resources for the rest of us people who aren't idiots :)
---
&gt; I have no intention of further talking to you
---
Good, it's very hard for me to converse with brainless monkeys like you, so thanks for the favor.
---
It takes a little getting used to at first but overall its great https://www.twitch.tv/videos/481641258
---
So you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be collectors or role players on my role playing server that would take interest in this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be selling it for retail value for obvious reasons, but to say it‚Äôs just not going to be valuable on classic ever just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
---
(its an axe)
---
I have a couple friends that do all roles so it depends on who's on. Most of the times dungeons have been easy to get. 
---
Hardest is finding a tank when I don't have someone on, but I've had good luck asking people in the level range if they're interested. 
---
I usually start my own groups instead of posting to join one so idk how that side of it usually goes.
---
Lol this subreddit is such a circlejerk
---
Are you new to online video games?
---
Most census apps are showing Warriors as the most common class, followed by Mage.
---
It makes sense once you start seeing how many of them are LFGing solely as DPS.
---
&gt;Stand 8 yards away, shoot.
---
&gt;Move in 3 yards, smack.
---
&gt;Move back 3 yards, shoot.
---
Pretty easy, really..
---
Also doable when you are tanking one mob and pet is tanking another.
---
You guys are already fucked then because retail's updated water has been in since the start. Guess it's time to pack it in, since apparently having anything at all from retail means that everything else is going to be added too.
---
Na there's tons of it on AH, it can't be sold to vendors though
---
well, tbf you can form your own group and reserve ironfoe (or any other item) , master loot solves 100% of these problems
---
Its the late expansion players who are killing dungeons for me. Taking Aggro from a tank in retail is almost impossible, but in classic, aggro management is a very real thing. PSA: Please allow your warrior at least two sunders per npc k thx bye
---
Didn't farm up the Eye of Shadow yourself?! Tsk tsk...
---
Anyways, grats from a fellow S.Priest.
---
It is indeed misleading to suggest that hay is for cows.
---
Yeah I got that, but that is in no way controversial or likely to be changed lol
---
If your really don't like those people. just go through and bid 1c less than vendor sell price for every one of those items.
---
They move off the bottom of the list.
---
It will cost them a fortune to relist it, it, and wether or not they relist it you get your money back.

Thanks for the heads up, good to know.  I'll PM you my battletag when I decide to resub/reroll if you don't mind, will be looking for a new guild and such.
---
Close. Feral druid.
---
Are you high? Retail has personal loot on end of dungeon chests.
---
You lost me after the Hand of Justice. The rogue would've dropped group after pulling a huge pack with sprint, then vanishing.
---
Shadow priests fucking melt, and we had a warlock same level. I was just the stun and shield stick.
---
Yea that's what I've been doing, I like the feeling of adding in a little dps too. But maybe once every instance, I forget I'm healing and there's a close wipe. 
---
It's my fault so that's why I'm thinking of switching roles where I can DPS a little more yet heal if need be and provide other support.
---
I'm a mage with a two-handed staff and a wand.
---
Whenever i target a creature and begin flinging spells i constantly get "Enemy is too far away" popping up. i think its because it trying to melee attack with my staff. how can i stop this?
---
What do you think 99% of streamers are doing
---
Doesn't show up till your first point is generated.. Prob why you missed it when looking
---
The changes that lead to retail are by no means "tiny changes". There were huge class overhauls, gameplay loops introduced, and tools subverting community interaction that got retail to where it is now. Graphics updates weren't a part of that.
---
lol even in vanilla those things didn't go for 1000g
---
I have been questing more than grouping (only do instance for major upgrade or quests).  I have had the same experience.  Most warriors are DPS only and groups want to go fast.  Just not my style, I don't want to be slow, but pulling tons and bouncing through the instance is not much fun.
---
It‚Äôs actually not that bad as far as ability selection goes, you can bind triggers to switch bars and do things nearly as well.
---
Targeting and movement is where you are going to run into ‚Äústraight inferior‚Äù territory and it probably won‚Äôt matter for most classic fights that aren‚Äôt PvP... I knew a guy that progressed all the way to Ebonroc keyboard turning!
---
Even if you wanna be different, why take Holy? Isn‚Äôt all the non-Shadow damage in Disc? Along with Holy Nova for AOE farming?
---
Dwarf master race
---
All of that drinking doesn't sound 4 times faster.
---
Just a heads up 70/30 does not equal 1.5:1 to start. It‚Äôs 2.33:1, Horde:Alliance. So after adding the inactives still very high. For stalagg anyways
---
I've encountered a couple of strange guilds through the years that were similar to this. They favored socialization over everything. You were expected to say hello when you logged in, answer every question, chat non-stop. Failing to say grats to a level or item drop gchat message was taken as a personal slight every single time. People were regularly kicked for being "anti-social".
---
I hung around for the spectacle. Both were absolute shitshows.
---
I agree and I try to do this, one thing to keep in mind though is stupid mages. What I'd like to do in the situation you describe would be to pull the mobs back a bit, then you can freely get behind them, or I can turn them and not pull a pat, but if I pull them back then the ranged don't always adjust and pull aggro easier due to being in melee range. 
---
For anyone not aware, there are different thresholds of threat needed to pull aggro based on the range you're at. If you're in melee you only need 110% of the max threat to pull aggro, but if you're at range you need 130%, so essentially a ranged dps can do more damage and push more threat and not pull if they stay at ranged. 
---
This is something I see many mages not understand. They can easily pull threat on mobs if they are in melee just due to the damage they do. I was in a stockade run last night where the mage kept running in to Frost Nova and cone of cold on aoe then stand there and cast Frost bolt. They're GOING to pull aggro on at least one mob if they haven't let me get threat for a bit. And at the end of the day they'd do just as much or slightly less damage just staying at range and casting Frost bolt on the main Target. Also, since all the mobs in stockades are humans, they run away at low health. So we ended up wiping twice due to mobs running into other rooms which could have easily been stopped if the mage PROPERLY used CoC and Frost Nova when the mobs are low health. 
---
People just aren't aware yet and honestly some players are just bad. It's always been like this. I'm used to retail where I run with specific sets of players who have similar skills and can read these situations themselves without it being clearly spelled out for them.
---
If you want to go warrior, go for it!  Tanking and leading a group can be a little stressful at times, but it certainly is a rewarding experience and you make friends along the way.
---
Priest is an excellent and steady leveler and can have some really fun class fantasy.  If you‚Äôre doing a PvP server, there‚Äôs a lot of shenanigan potential.
---
Warlocks are just a delight to level as when juggling mana, health, and your pet.  You can‚Äôt go wrong with the leveling speed either.  And if you go tailoring/skinning, you can support a LOT of your own gear! (Same with priest)
---
So all are great options and I‚Äôd toss a coming between your top two contenders after comparing the gameplay of the classes in what you plan to do in game.  Also, never rule out class fantasy for how you want to feel in the game!
---
I have a new item on my to do list now.  Continuous full run, with write up.  Thanks  :/
---
&gt;every 40 warrior in the game
---
Interesting, I am usually looking for healer more than a tank. As I can tank with my rogue just fine in current levels, or druid/shaman can do so as well
---
No doubt. High level alliance were running through hillsbrad killing all of us yesterday and I thought it was hilarious. Good for them. World pvp is awesome. After a while of them ganking a bunch of level 60 horde showed up and everyone had some fun. 
---
In vanilla I corpse camped people until they logged. They tried to do the same to me. World pvp is the most fun thing in the game for me.
---
Yeah fuck these guys
---
Retail has better raids, and I'd love to see that difficulty come to classic. I am honestly hoping they take retail and fix it with what they learn from classic.
---
I am currently inbetween careers, so I have a lot of free time
---
\*Laughs in priest\*
---
I've had the opposite problem.  I have a ton of quests in that place for all sorts of different parts, but I only ever seem to find groups that just want to spam the arena event over and over again.
---
but doing the quest asap lets you buy the quest items and sell dreadsteed runs for gold
---
good source of income plus you limit your own competition because the locks you run through the quest will not buy the items themselves, keeping them relatively scarce
---
Haha thanks brother! I got it
---
Are you me, mister?
---
Ive had lots of trouble LFG for SM in the past week. I spend 40min+ LFG and get maybe two or three invites in that time, which the groups fail to fill and we close.
---
Im a pretty new player but is 45min normal to LFG for a dungeon? I play on a busy server which already has a one hour queue quite frequently. 
---
Im really burnt out from questing but something feels so off and frustrating to stand there spamming LFG for so long, not find a group, and call it a night to play something else..
---
(lvl 31 mage)
---
/1 ‚ÄúDid you know that when Chuck Norris does push ups he‚Äôs actually pushing the earth down?‚Äù
---
Lying?
---
I got an epic drop from a mob outside of gadgetztan.  How should I go about selling it. It's a searing bow or somthing like that
---
Gotcha, thank you
---
It has everything to do with groups.
---
"Groups will find rogues valuable, for not only do they deal massive damage, but they can open locked doors or chests, and disarm hidden traps as well."

---
What's the best way to farm gold as a priest at 60? It just dawned on me that I'm going to have to farm epic mount, flasks, etc. I was planning on going tailoring/enchanting if that helps at all.
---
Alright I'm gonna say it. I understand that the wallpapers are super cool but the guy that made both of those specifically mentioned that he was commissioned for the last one and didn't get paid so he just gave it to us. Please if you would like an animated wallpaper made out of this then commission that dude. He has been super cool to give his work for free to the community twice now and that guy deserves money for his art.
---
There is not a tree that exists where every talent is super valuable all the time. Typically some are universal, some pve focused, some pvp. You won't be useless but you will hinder your total potential.
---
You are a menace.
---
:)
---
That's fine.  Focus on leveling, then get your professions out of the way.
---
mages can go almost completely frost with a few points in arcane and totally ignore the fire tree  in most builds.
---

I'll share a story of cooperation that happened in stv. I was working on those damn shadowmaw panthers and needed one more. Down the road I see this orc warrior at 40% hp fighting a panther I need. The orc was so generous to die from a single shadow bolt-searing pain combo to give me my last tag : )
---
This is offensive Blizzard wtf
---
I didn't mean to assume, lol, but that's usually the main reason for 'wife aggro' for sure.  Source - am a wife.
---
But everyone needs to be able to blow off steam, maybe try explaining that its a way you can de-stress so you don't take that stress out on her and the kids? 
---
Also, I can't imagine grad school and two kids, jfc. That's stress to the max on both of you.
---
How else will we hear their complaints about other complaints?
---
I would say that‚Äôs what caused it originally. Now though, it‚Äôs just tradition. I would go so far as to say (atleast on my server) it‚Äôs worse now than originally, because of the ‚Äúbarrens chat‚Äù meme
---
On one hand, I hate it when people attack me when my health is low and I pulled multiple mobs. If you do this, then you are likely horde filth. But on the other hand, nothing feels better then sacrificing your voidwalker at 5% health and then killing that fucking rogue.
---
So I think there is some sort of unspoken honor to the whole thing. But that's what makes it fun...and upsetting...but also fun. And upsetting.  It makes you hate the enemy faction more than you thought possible. That's why we formed a raid group last night and took over Splintertree. To get back at you worms who rolled horde!
---
So if you don't like the fact that some people are "ganking" you, and breaking the unspoken rules of honor and engagement. Then roll horde because  they are the only people who do it you damn cowards! 
---
Or ya know, roll on a normal server.
---
Could we not press others about the language they use?
---
The pm keeps you from doing whatever it is that you need to get done? What if the message was said in general. It would show up just the same but not in purple. Is it the color purple that is preventing you from getting done what you need? I don't see the issue. Almost like people are looking for a reason to bitch.
---
But the chest is at the end of the dungeon. The dungeon is already finished.
---
I got invited to a guild with 865 members and 65 people online. 
---
The guild chat revolved around sucking the dicks of the two highest level players and the only level 60 in the guild that was a ‚Äústreamer‚Äù.
---
Yeah I left.
---
Stop basing your data on pserver databases.
---
People actively wait on rested?
---
Oh dear, this is awkward üòÜ
---
Thanks! I put it in the bank directly after I almost mindlessly vendored it hahaha.
---
Thanks! I've just accpted the sudden up look was just a part of my life.
---
&gt; objectively superior tbc
---
bruh moment
---
more like 300 or more in a small area... and yes
---
Shadowprey village in desolace if you are horde, or booty bay in STV.
---
I had no idea Ironfoe let you do that, wow!
---
I would rather have new sets that introduce new play styles through set bonuses while at the same time not being more powerful than Naxx tier to avoid power creeping, just new play styles to help classes like ret paladins. Just an idea.
---
I did the exact same jump with a guildie!
---
..... we didn't make it to the water though....
---
This was a perfect answare, holy damn! Thank yoj so much!
---
Was on a little bit before my buddies got on last night. Decided to go into SM Lib with a PuG. Left the group halfway through because I was tired of stressing out, running around arms flailing to recapture aggro from a mage and warlock who would AoE as soon as I arrived with Charge, and just talked shit whenever I suggested they stop.
---
Warlock said I have downs and repeatedly insulted me while having me on ignore.
---
Gotta love that classic community!!
---
Keep in mind most hunters level as beast mastery so they won't get aimed shot until level 51. You can still get a multishot in between 1.6 sec autos, it just actually requires timing.
---
Also, multishot isn't very Mana efficient at low gear levels so many grinding situations are just better off using hunters mark, serpent sting, and then auto shotting to death.
---
The arrow usage sucks, but the attack speed doesn't make that much of a different negatively until you're in your early 50s at which point this bow barely even beats the Mara quest reward that's easy to get.
---
Lmao, are you paying any attention to what I‚Äôve said? Asking for a summon isn‚Äôt wrong, expecting one is. As someone who rolled a healer, I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm pretty far off from feeling entitled because I enjoy playing a supporting role. I work with my fellow adventurers, not act like a dick, like you are. 
---
Jesus you are dense, buddy.
---
My 34 arms warrior tanks and holds Agro just fine with a sword and board...  unless you have a suicidal warlock hellfiring because the mage is kicking his butt in dps...  there is no saving that guy...
---
I'd like to know this as well.
---
Faerlina.
---
I have been sick recently, so I go through periods of exhaustion followed by very awakefulness.
---
Anyone who argues that it dilutes the playerbase is a moron.
---
People who want to play TBC will eventually move on to private servers if Blizzard don't make their own servers for it. Just like the people who bitterly hate modern WoW didn't stick around and moved to private servers for their preferred expansion. 
---
You can't dilute a playerbase if they're separate target audiences.
---
One day I'll accept one of the spam invites, just to see what sort of a clusterfuck the guild is from the inside.
---
It's worth 3 gold to a vendor this bop item whatever class needs it can just run the dungeon again
---
.
---
Consignment. Mail it to me and I'll give you 75 percent of the profit when I sell it.
---
Because priests use spirit far more than anyone else.  They don't just get in combat regen from it with talents they also get spelldamage from it deep in holy.
---
And healers as a whole can dance around the FSR so spirit means even more to them.
---
I get that people kinda like spirit while leveling but it's silly to think you value it as much as priests do.
---
I'd say your best bet between these 3 is the on of the bottom of this post, but you'd of course have to be running everything on the bare minimum
---
Good call, it's also a rather subtle change compared to buff icons/etc showing up.
---
if you are tanking i would be happy to dps. is hubby healing?
---
30-36 is a weird level range in Classic/Vanilla for quests. It always seemed just a *bit* sparse, especially when not taking advantage of rested XP.
---
Common advice is Arathi, Hillsbrad, Shimmering Flats, and northern STV. Since you're 30, you can also go after any of the high-20 zones that you haven't done yet before going to the zones I mentioned.
---
I like to hit up Shimmering Flats first, usually around 30-32. A lot of those quests feed into STV.
---
I always ignore these. I will never tank a group like this. It‚Äôs a pug. So we roll and pray to RNGesis.
---
I even got whispered to tank such a group. No thanks.
---
Awkward? I'd hope I was recording so I can post it to Reddit for that sweet sweet karma! No shame
---
So I don't need Cower on auto cast, but I should keep it learned and keybound and keep an eye on my threat meter so I can tell if I need to use it manually then, right? Basically treat it like Feign Death/Disengage for my pet?
---
Sucks to suck. At least they can live with it in pixels, I guess.
---
See if any of the people you work with are gamers too, maybe make friends with them.
---
I was in a similar boat several years ago, I had some friends that game, but we were never into the same games at the same time.  And usually no WOW.  
---
I lucked out at my current job because it's a fairly large company and we use Slack for messaging.  The company has a 'Gaming' Slack channel and people talking about games.  Woah!
---
So now I have a bunch of people I work with IRL and also now play wow because we talked about who's playing over Slack.  
---
But, I feel ya, OP
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. What I did was downloaded the vendor price add on and anything under25-30s I disenchant anything over gets vendored. Gotta get that mount, son! Then lvl up enchanting before uldaman where the expert hides
---
Made it there! Let me PM you :)
---
True, except ya know the social aspect of the game where you have to interact with another person to get something enchanted
---
Good luck!
---
Those awful wyvern feet
---
Imagine having to use a combination of keys when scroll wheel click is all you need.
---
Blizzard anti cheat is on point.  I got banned in 2004 for using wow glider. Learned my lesson.
---
But thats only because mages are devs favourite child in classic. /s
---
But really, everything can't be homogenized around DPS. Utility matters, and players should be forced to play smarter.
---
Wait until hit end game and find out that tanks are not that needed. Maybe a couple per guild.
---
Lol finally got this post live after having to wait 72 hours and then needed to add a flair. Anyway thanks again Nymzee
---
As a shaman, I do pretty good at watching my aggro up until WF procs twice in a row. I just let the group know I have off heals, reincarn, and if I die it‚Äôs my fault and not to worry about me. However, I‚Äôm pretty good about stopping auto-attacks if I do pull aggro, or I will stop and heal for a bit.
---
It sounds more like the players who you have grouped with rather than the actual strategy caused your issues.
---
You just have to be competent to pull off these strategies. Healing is then fairly straightforward providing you are drinking in any downtime and making your group aware if you actually need a mana break.
---
Right now, probably 10 days something.
---
The only thing I can think of is that your fireball is in range but not your frost bolt. Do you get thr raise your staff above your head animation?
---
What UI addon are you using?
---
Which is not very much now.
---
Nice! This is the type of content I wish we had more of here. I have no interest in enchanting rn. But if I do down the line, it‚Äôs nice to know!
---
Can we also talk about how offensive that camera phone photo is...?
---
&gt;they level in pairs of two
---
They're definitely bots, encountered the same on DD
---
&gt; Plus, doesn't it also increase the mana regen in combat? That could save my life ! (not sure it does though)
---
Only with talents.  Priests get it in the disc tree I believe mages get it in the arcane tree?
---
I mean if you come up on someone in stealth you can usually get away with going claw rake rip bear form at lower levels but I wouldn't recommend staying in cat much longer than that unless they're just not hitting you because they're fighting the mob still or something.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cancelform [noform:3]
---
/cast Cat Form
---
This is my shfiting macro the noform number needs changed based on what forms you have unlocked.  basically look at your shifting icons on the bottom left of your screen and the first is 1 second is 2 etc.  so for me cat form is 3 and thats what you want there (bear will be 1)
---
This macro will only use the cancelform command if you're NOT in cat form. the reason you want this is because if you're trying to shift into cat form and you mash the button too fast you'll instantly shift out of cat form.  Set up macros for all your forms the same way just changing the form number and name for each
---
Haha seriously. Congrats on top dps chart that no one probably looks at besides the other mages and rogues.
---
And you can feed your self pride when going to bed at night :)
---
Main reason why I reroll an alt after lvling my mage.
---
Because the addon this kid was using, that sent the PM, sends an invite right after sending the PM. That is how the addon works, it's how it has always worked. It most likely TRIED to send the invite, as it always does, but COULD NOT send it, because the OP here was already in a guild. OP tried to explain that it incorrectly showed him as not in a guild, when he has been in one for several weeks. Notice that the guy sending says "instead of suggesting someone who casually uses an **\*\*addon\*\*** should fix it"
---
If this was someone who was literally just PMing people and talking to them, obviously I'd have no issue. But it isn't. It's an automated guild invite with a whisper, that's impersonal and spam like. That is why it is basically the wow equiv of a robocall.
---
Do this and you only ever do it once and not Everytime.
---
    /script SetCVar(‚ÄúrawMouseEnable‚Äù, 1);
---
Savage, haha.
---
Maybe they just got it out of luck? There are more people on the servers than back in 2004. So the odds of seeing more ‚Äúrare‚Äù things on the AH is much higher
---
Yeah I don't know if I would ever have that dedication to farm 30 of those lol, but at least at level 60 Druid you can solo farm it super easy so I guess not too bad
---
Guess it's really no different than farming any other mats you need to raid
---
They take way more dmg than a traditional group and in the 40-50 range and I have noticed casters put out more dmg than warriors with 2h windfury anyway. You can't conceivably pull super big packs with 4 warriors like you can with a mage aoe group, because nobody has any cc or dmg mitigation abilities, and the actual aoe dmg is not as much. You destroy 3 mob packs though.
---
45 is a little early for maraudon considering the princess is level 51. You're basically getting carried if you get this bow at 45.
---
I camped him pretty relentlessly while leveling in the Badlands. It got to the point where my pal was like "Oh hey it's Enjoythewalk" and we'd lock onto him like fucking terminators.
---
Dude's poop lol
---
I suppose I see what you're saying. It is pretty silly to worry myself over this, and honestly if I at least enjoy myself till then, then it'll still have been worth it.
---
I am certainly enjoying myself right now, I suppose I really shouldn't be worrying about something so far off (and hey, who knows, perhaps I'll even change my mind by then).
---
lol - like a certain streamer ignored loot rolls to drop an epic on his useless ret pally buddy?
---
I take the blame for not hiding my Ui but after a good 3 min battle of 12 level 30s vs a level 60 Obscuritas was down, obligatory picture with the raid boss.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
&gt;great looking characters
---
*Looks at OP. WtF?*
---
I don't think a hard rule of "no x" is usually a good idea, just pushes your kids to do things anyway. I think allowing them to do what they want but guiding them on how manage their time healthily will set them up better in the future. 
---
Do as you see fit, but maybe you'll give thought to what I've observed.
---
Imagine not understanding that classic is brand new and most of the data on drops is contaminated by private servers
---
Should be 300 as well.  I tanked a bit until the lack of healers doing high end dungeons forced me to switch to resto.  Since I leveled as a feral druid, my weapon skills are abysmal, but I get my hits in where I can.
---
 Zandalari Tribe EU.
---
&gt; Imagine not knowing how probability rolls work.
---
You can dish it out but can't take it haha.
---
How does it make no difference in PVE when you've got a one man group of 5 characters running through a zone one shotting everything and killing mobs 500% faster than any other solo player in the zone could? I gotta stand around and wait on spawns, don't I? I'm spending time looking for groups to do more difficult quests and dungeons, meanwhile this guy can solo anything in the game because he's using tools that are not offered by Blizzard. 
---
And he doesn't have to worry about being ganked while questing, because he's got 4 body guards that he controls following him at all times. If 4 players want to dedicate their nights to following around a guild member and protecting him at all times, then by all means, play how you wanna play. But how many times do you think that happens outside of multiboxers? 
---
If you don't think that mulitboxing is a huge advantage that is not even desirable by most of the playerbase, nevertheless affordable, then you're lying to yourself. And i assure you, I am not envious. I enjoy WoW classic the same way the other 99.9% of WoW players do, leveling one character at a time, playing the game the way it was meant to be played. When I want to group with others, I'll group with friends or guildies rather than paying for another subscription and playing with myself. Something tells me that playing with yourself is something you're quite accustomed to, though.
---
&gt;You need mages to curse cure on first boss
---
Don't forget druids can remove curse also.
---
Playing as a level 31 Paladin, I'm wondering how I should divide my talents up. I know alot of websites suggest dumping everything into ret, but I rushed into holy for consecrate so I can tank dungeons easier. Would it be better to just respec to ret for leveling?
---
You have a job? So casual.
---
Haha I was with some mates on discord and forgot that discord chat was recorded too. My friend survived the stroke you'll be pleased/displeased to hear
---
TBC
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Auctionator
---
It isn't the art for Liadrin, it's her whole character. She is a total badass. Both a renowned priestess and warrior , she was one of the first Horde pallies.
---
it depends very heavily on the situation.
---
ambushes name is suprisingly accurate. its a high burst ability that is only really good as an opener if your actually ambushing someone.
---
as i recall, rogues have premeditation at the end of sub (the skill that adds 2 combo points to the target in stealth). so if the mage is fighting, or for some reason doesnt have there barrier up. you can prem then ambush+evi (depending on spec ofc) and that could very well kill em.
---
but if the mage knows your coming, they might put up mana shield + ice barrier.
---
rank 3 ice barrier blocks 818 dmg and rank 5 mana shield blocks 570 melee dmg. combined thats 1388 dmg they can avoid instantly.
---
so if they know your coming they can just keep moving. making it harder for you to ambush. and if you sap, they can pre W so they move forward as soon as the sap breaks and they'll instantly out run you. more so if theyre on mount.
---
the stun, forces cooldowns. and if you have imp Sprint you can negate the root effect leaving them heavily vulnerable. forcing either ice block or cold snap so they can nova again.
---
its all about pressure, mage v rogue is a cooldown race.
---
but thats like a duel situation when both sides know its going to happen. if your in a larger scale fight you just need a 1 shot combo, something you can do quickly that will kill a squishy 10/10 times.
---
my rogue friend is spec'd deep into sub for this reason, he damn near 1 shots every non plate player we meet.
---
you would wait for the people to be distracted by your friends/faction, then you run up on a squishy and wam bam theyre dead.
---
&gt; Face melts off
---
Damn shadow priests...
---
Rolling with this as my main, Dw Hunter lvl 20 so far and great fun (only one death so far, from stupidity). Get a cat or wind serpent if Horde. Gonna keep levelling to 60 but squirreling away money to fund my alts levelling (War and Pally can be gear dependent). Chose skinning/leatherworking, made some decent armor for basically free and made some silver selling stuff as well.
---
Give shaman a shot. You'll be able to heal in fights pretty well. But you'll also be able to add utility that other classes can't. If priests are pure healer, then shaman are somewhere between healer and dps.
---
Dual Wield tanking is for single target threat gen in raids only, when you have good gear and good healers. It isnt for dungeons. Unless your a MT in a hardcore guild that knows what hes doing, forget it.
---
Of course some new player that doesnt even understand why or when to dual wield should not be attempting it.
---
You shouldn't be dual wielding at all without 6 hit at 305 weap skill or 9 hit at 300.
---
Bloodthirst scales off AP. Flurry scales off crit. You need alot of both to make DW worth it.
---
&gt;Any insight on popularity gained from reddit is basically pointless.
---
Asks for numbers, disregards them instantly
---
Sure I do, I just did. Like I said, I don‚Äôt care if you choose to believe me or not. It happened I was in the convo you weren‚Äôt. If you want to claim you know more you can. Proof is in there it‚Äôs up to you to read like you should have before you commented

I think Blizzard is gathering data then in 1 wave will do it.
---
Saw a warlock in almost full felheart
---
Gotta find a good guild man. I tank for my guild as a leveling arms warriors, and we've got a few other people who tank, and we're always in demand, but god dammit it's a responsibility to the clothies to be good at tanking so that's what we do.
---
My biggest gripe is is the stupid mightfish recipe ONLY gives +10 stam, compared to the much easier tender wolf steak which gives +12 stam AND +12 spirit.
---
Like, come on, at least give more stam if you are only going to give one stat.
---
That's not true though, at least not in all cases. I personally really wanted to play (and am!) Classic, but I do not like private servers. There's too much risk. Will Blizzard send a CD? Will the server admins capriciously ban people without and sort of process? Can the owners afford to keep the server running?
---
There are just too many risks and questions with private servers, and I think the volume of people currently playing Classic vs. the number of people who played on private servers is at least partially a result of that fear.
---
Maybe I'm just getting on at the right times, but even when I've joined in a queue for 4,000 or so people it seems to zip right along these days. As someone else mentioned though, we don't really know how many layers there are, so with that in mind I see why they'd still want to encourage transfers.
---
I posted this yesterday but I‚Äôve been barely able to play as I was on a full sever. Blizzard gave me one choice to transfer to a lower pop realm.
---
I took the transfer and now regret the decision because it feels like a private server. No one is there. The cities are empty. I want to pay to transfer back but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs implemented. 
---
I‚Äôm level 40 and feel like I‚Äôm missing out on social aspects of the game. How screwed am I?
---
Lulz
---
TBC. They are mostly there for hots on the tank, buff, battle rez, and an extra innervate on a priest, not to go toe to toe with priests in raw healing.
---
It‚Äôs the best way to get a group for some classes
---
Lol, imagine thinking baseball is a sport....
---
https://youtu.be/yXkT54U6ZmI?t=179
---
I bought 2 butcher's blades, 4g and 3.5g no doubt when phase 3 rolls around and people start twinking they'll sell for much more.
---
Imagine trying to justify rolling on items that you aren‚Äôt even going to use for months.
---
That‚Äôs not what the meters say at all.
---
So slick
---
It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it?
---
Melee have been complaining about this for ages. Groups always prefer ranged DPS because they can just park wherever it's safe.
---
Not a gimmick. But not a strategy meant for the average player , especially in pre raid gear.
---
Getting killed in any PvP game is just part of it. The difference is killing someone and being done with it is totally different than killing someone and teabaging or /emoting at them. One is part of the game and the other is just a little extra to be a dick. If you can‚Äôt see there‚Äôs a difference between the two then we‚Äôre at an impasse. And while I don‚Äôt yell at my monitor if someone teabags or /emotes I still consider it a dick thing to do, but in no way do I get worked up over it.
---
Jyst sayin' - outlasting your opponent should be considered a valid option over trying to burst people down as fast as possible
---
Jeez, it's like I'm back in early 2005.
---
you may be playing the wrong game
---
You can retry but the NPC despawns for like 2 hours if you fail.
---
For every priest on the server.
---
Now, I imagine that right now people would try to layer it, but in vanilla if there were several priests trying to do the quest you could really upset them by repeatedly failing.
---
I'm avoiding STV for this reason. If you haven't gone to Hillsbrad yet I suggest leveling there for a bit
---
it was only ment to drop from angerforge, but it was bugged and could sometimes drop from emp, Like it does on classic right now (it drops from both bosses)
---
Have to farm Mithril in Hinterlands or Tanaris.
---
Guy with a throwaway reddit account.... I bet you post on wow forums on a lvl 1 alt too
---
&gt;Just let them drink and get on with the next pull, then either the mage just drinks and joins the fight later or stops drinking to fight - 
---
What choice do I have? None of them are willing to do it any other way. It's not that they CAN'T, it's that they WON'T.
---
&gt;if the mage is using blizzard all the time AND asking you for mana breaks every pull, they want their cake and to eat it and you should ignore them or replace them,
---
Replace them how? Over 50% of the dps classes are mages. All of them got to this level by AoE spamming and they're just not fucking willing to play any other way.
---
&gt;It seems like most of you are honestly just playing with bad mages. 
---
Of course I am. 
---
&gt;I AoE all the time, and rarely pull aggro, and if i do I will just run towards the tank and frost nova. Problem solved, I get to have fun AoE'ing, we kill stuff faster and all is well.
---
Sure you do. I just don't get to have my fun of ensuring a smooth dungeon run with little chaos and little risk. Your fun is just more important than mine or the healer's. 
---
Furthermore, you're down for a drink every pull, and you know it.
---
&gt;If a mage pulls aggro and lacks the ability to use the 3 or 4 skills he has to easily deal with the situation, he is just bad - it doesn't matter what class he is, he would still lack the fundamental basic knowledge of the game to end up messing something up. 
---
And we all have to suffer for his badness.
---
&gt;Mages are getting a serious hard time on this sub and in all honesty, a lot of it just seems like jealousy
---
I'm not jealous of easy play. I'm annoyed with willful poor play. And when we run into an extra pull, we'd have survived if we'd focused and already had 2 enemies down. Instead, we've got all 4 mobs in the first pull at 33% and all over the place.
---
Arms warriors can absolutely tank, they just need to be in defensive stance with a shield. I always carry a sword/board with me, in addition to my 2H, in case I'm needed to tank at a moments notice. Macros for stance dancing, macros for targeting = happy DPS and healers.
---
fantastic, thank you!
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gob
---
I was using that map too.  I just assume all high level zones require 330 fishing and 400+ for no getaways.
---
You'r retarded, IF THE WHOLE POINT OF POST COMES FROM THE VERY FIRST SENTENCE, IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT WHAT POINT IS THERE TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE FUCKING POST YOU MONGO.
---
Well some players DID juice up in the 90's...
---
No. It's a new server.
---
But even then it doesnt matter because I have plan on transferring at some point maybe.
---
&gt; it was only ment to drop from angerforge, but it was bugged and could sometimes drop from emp, Like it does on classic right now (it drops from both bosses)
---
I‚Äôd also like to know the answer to this... how‚Äôd you get your elemental water from fishing? (Elemental or Essence of?)
---
Uhm sorry dude, but you're kind of being a jerk. If you have a spot open and it's a named mob, just let people join. Invite them asap so they can get credit for the kill and move on. It costs you nothing and it's just making the community better.
---
Your attitude belongs in single player games.
---
Bartender4. Dominos. Leatrix plus. There are several. You just have to actually put in the time to look for them.
---
Would you rather be Jack Sparrow or Will Turner?
---
&gt;***Will Turner***: You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
---
&gt;***Jack Sparrow***: That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it?
---
I don't bank XP on my warrior I just run dungeons and quest a bit. Hit 49 today and plan on pretty much just doing dungeons to 60. Some quests in between. Totally dig the poem and art though.
---
You wont have time to farm them when you need them.
---
Lol what a shit guild, they have done you a favor by kicking you so you can find somewhere better.
---
challenge payo to a 100g duel, kuzu as well
---
let's see what you got
---
Too bad you‚Äôre horde. We could have been friends!
---
Edit: lol autocorrect from horde to horse
---
Flying in azeroth, yes.
---
But flying in tbc was totally fine.
---
It's the social media problem in general. Everyone gets to hear about all of the good parts, but they leave out some of the necessary details. 
---
You see a few posts of a user that "totally dw tanked all dungeons from 1-60". They neglected to mention: 
---
* it was a pserver 
---
* they were always 5+ levels above the minimum (think VC/DM @ lvl 24 vs 17)
---
* they had the BiS gear at every level
---
* they had a pocket healer with BiS gear at every level
---
* they've done the dungeon so many times that they know every pat, respawn timer, and encounter glitch
---
No doubt - some people can dw tank in Classic, but the vast majority need at least one of the boosts above to make it work.
---
Same man! I'm like one week ahead of the drawings.
---
I think I agree with you. They'd have to kill off everyone's characters, and basically start a new timeline. But if they took out flying, heirlooms, added the talent system back it might be ok. They've talked about a level squish. I will say seeing less then 500 on a meter feels much better than 24k
---
Lots more people rolled healers this time.
---
Thats not even the right boss that drops it. It drops from General Angerforge. It should be dropping from Emp but this is blizzard were talking about here.
---
I've already done almost all the quests levels 30-33 available to me in arathi, hillsbrad and shimmering flats. Didn't think about taking advantage of rested xp though maybe it's time I work on an alt. Come back and hit up STV I guess
---
probably a good idea if you are strictly doing an AOE run to grab an extra healer and maybe a dps or 2
---
I've installed OmniCC through the Twitch app and when I log in, it says its out of date. Not sure whats wrong with it but others dont seem to have this issue.
---
The brain burns a lot of calories, and it takes a lot of brain to cast spells.
---
You could try opening a ticket with Blizzard just to say you didn't realize how dead the server would be.  I don't know if they would honor it but it might be worth a shot.
---
Imagine thinking BRD is hard
---
Can confirm.
---
Hearing this gives me less anxiety about saving up for my own mount. I forget that it's only an option.
---
This makes me feel ill
---
A-you can do this, a-you can do that, a-you can do this, a-you can do that.
---
Click on the Mob with left click, not right click. Push your wand key when it's wanding time
---
But how am I supposed to get AP and crit when the healers couldn't keep me alive in full defense gear?
---
My first play theough, im level 32 woth i believe gold. 
---
Felt like i should have more but this gives me hope
---
Is this from shazzrah? I think i saw those ppl
---
Bloomoo. It was a dwarf doing it.
---
Perplexity, traxe, lmgd, etc.
---
It's me. I'm your old buddy.   I've noticed it in myself. I remember being "the best" tank in our guild and was invited to every group &amp; dungeon back in the BC/WoLK days. It was a nerdy source of pride. Then I stopped playing.  
---
Classic comes along. I remake my favorite warrior. Hit my first dungeon and realize that I fucking suck.  I completely forgot to switch stances to prot. My rotations were whack. I can't remember my macos. My guild is flying to 60.  They all seem to know every dungeon, every elite, the best specs, which gear is optimal, etc...  
---
It's hard to tell if I was actually good back then or we all just sucked together.
---
How‚Äôs looting work with the controller? I‚Äôve considered a setup like this for grinding purposes
---
...and?
---
Is it worth it to go Prot at 32 as a Paladin? I've heard it can AoE grind pretty well. I'm just thinking for WPvP and single mob kill speed, Ret would be better until 60.
---
I've noticed I've been left alone more by horde while fishing than anything else (herbs, mobs, etc) haha.  I guess they feel like fishing is punishment enough üòÇ
---
Solution - don't LFM in LFG. Use general so you get nearby players.
---
So I farmed a Pattern: Robes of Arcana because I thought it might be a good way to make some money on the side. I haven't seen the pattern itself on the AH and i'm debating between whether its worth trying to sell the pattern vs selling the robes. I figured the demand would be pretty decent since pretty much every warlock wants to do the quest they are used in, but its hard to tell. Any locks/tailors have any insight?
---
Oh yeah ret did have a lot of bugs
---
Lol same, I was thinking death wish?
---
But PvP is the fun part.
---
Shadow + wand spec. It‚Äôs never worth speccing as holy/disc leveling. 
---
You‚Äôll be able to he‚Äôs dungeons just fine, and it will really only start to make a big difference when you get too 50+.
---
Gonna be honest, this looks exactly like one would have expected.
---
If you have all day to play, in my experience it's best to quest in the morning and run dungeons at night when the most people are on.
---
You think you meme, but you don't.
---
I used to keep my mouth shut about games and stuff.  But the past couple years I'll mention some kind of reference about a game.  You'd be surprised how many people pick up on it.  At my last job I actually found out my buddy was hardcore into WoW back in the day!
---
I did the quest as holy in vanilla, it was hard as holy as I didn't gave enough spirit (mana regen)
---
Easier if you had some buffs but if u fail there all gone and have to wait two hours.
---
Due to hots over-riding each other. ~~So pointless to have more than 1 resto druid in your raid~~. While not pointless, the druids would be competing against each other and not very mana efficient at all.
---
Everyone is different. I had a few back then and part of my nostalgia trip is to recollect them plus the ones I never got.
---
Typical /r/classicwow redditor:
---
\- Complains that Asmongold is every-f'n-where
---
\- Constantly makes thread about the guy
---
Yes. Weapon totems apply passive short-term enhancements to your weapon, but Windfury Weapon is also a short-term weapon enhancement. The totem buffs won't override the shaman-applied buffs.
---
(Blacksmith sharpening/weightstones are also short-term enhancements and don't stack, I believe, with totems etc. I think rogue poisons also fall into the same category)
---
Yes, I have been using Frayed Bracers for the past 25 levels.
---
Lmao this is such a straw man and almost sounds like a r/gamersriseup post. I get that you‚Äôre probably exaggerating to make a point, but there are very few people who ‚Äúact like it‚Äôs the end of the world‚Äù.
---
People make fun of the neckbeard gamer stereotype. Pretty much everyone these days plays video games in some sense (mobile, Facebook, etc)
---
It's very close to my leveling experience, I'm even surprised when I see someone that is not a mage or a warrior passing by. And to the eyes of others I must be a ultra rare sight as a druid.
---
How many people since 1919 have been killed by swords? I‚Äôd wager more people have been killed by carbs in the last 20 than by swords in the last hundred.
---
Eh, I‚Äôm more inclined to believe they‚Äôd rather not risk wiping. Whether that‚Äôs due to not wanting to waste time, they don‚Äôt like that sort of stress, or they don‚Äôt want to be perceived as bad,
---
Not everyone is a lazy POS wanting to be carried.
---
I know this one!  you gain rested XP by staying in inn's and capitals (your lvl icon will turn to ZZZ's).  Once you start back fighting, you get double XP for killing mobs (and from what I hear it is ONLY for killing mobs.  Quests do not count) up to the rested XP limit (you can see how much you have by looking at the XP bar.  There will be a line to show how much rested XP you have left.
---
The other day I was saw an enchanted runecloth bag (16 pouch one) in a starting area and the recipe was 1g 50s, I was on a brand new character with less than 1s.
---
Teen self? Psh I was like 26 when this game released.
---
Revenge also proc from dodge and parry. So a roughly 15% chance for an arms warrior to proc
---
Mages that know what they're doing shouldn't ever get hit after taking aggro.
---
You‚Äôre taking this way too deep, I just think that people who engage in combat to do nothing more than to inconvenience someone (especially that there‚Äôs no honor system) and then hide behind the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs PvP‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a sign form the devs that it‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶a dick. Especially if they throw the extra /emote on top. It‚Äôs fine to be a dick it‚Äôs part of being on a PvP server, just don‚Äôt pretend that you‚Äôre not.
---
Yup had same problem, even worse couldnt use my hearthstone did everything on google etc. In the end nothing really helped besides maybe reinstall, so u can say it passed on its own.
---
World PvP is inherently unfair a lot of the time... me and my friends get ganked by higher level players sometimes, but between me and my mage friend we also kill ?? Players sometimes so I guess it balances out.
---
You gain rested experience for being inside and/ or out inside a city of inn. Rested exp gives you double exp for your mob kills. You can accumulate 3x exp bars of exp per day (1 bar every 8 hours) up to a maximum of 1.50 levels ahead of your current exp position.
---
Speaking of staves on warriors, I got a lot of shit for rolling need on https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chief%27s_Enforcer as a warrior, with everyone in the group saying the hunter needed it more. Am I crazy or was my group just trolling me?
---
Does he still see the wave message if he ignores
---
He got mad at a lock for putting dots on him üòÇ
---
It eventually led to having stupid undercut wars on the AH where you were forced to use an Auction add-on to keepup with posting and reposting.
---
Also, people would used to wait hours or days waiting for you to log in because they heard that you had so-and-so enchant. And you can choose people that you refuse to do Enchants for, because they were an ass or cheap fuck about something in the past.
---
Still, being to lowkey make my gold selling my Enchants on a mule without people sending me whispers was a refreshing change.
---
Was on CD :/
---
I have this same issue to a certain extent, people just can't see gaming as a hobby for whatever reason. My wife has no problem if I play the piano for 4 hours straight but does have a problem with me taking an hour to quest with my brother... gaming has been the only hobby in my life that has kept my interest and I don't know why people can't just accept that  it's something I love to do.
---
I had to just stop caring what people think and lay my foot down, if they still have a problem with it then they can fuck off (not my wife of course, I love her to death, she just doesn't "get it")
---
You gain 1 bar every 8 hours you're in an inn or major city (including when logged out), or 1/4 of a bar every 8 hours you're *not* in an inn or major city. Your portrait will gently pulse yellow any time you're acquiring rested XP. 
---
Getting it doesn't level you up on its own, you have to cash it in by killing monsters. As long as you have some rested XP accumulated, monsters will give double XP until you've cashed in all accumulated rested XP. 
---
I believe rested XP maxes out after 10 days.
---
Its not as hard as the mage tower bosses in legion thats for sure.
---
Classic WoW was designed for 2004 internet standards, so 200ms+ ping was not uncommon at the time. 
---
In fact, they had to add a section to the not-a-bug list letting people know that combat "feeling different" was due to lower latency from better network connections in 2019.
---
You should be totally fine. Spellbatching, Buffering, and other methods are in place to ensure the game is playable on most connections.
---
What you should be doing for threat is trying to hit cap efficiently. 6% for 305+ weap skill, 9% for 300. Edgemasters/aged core leather gloves for non human/orc. Bloodmail boots, Voones Vicegrips, Brigam Girdle, Blackcrow, Executioner Helm, Blackstone Ring are good options.
---
hahaha!
---
unfortunately no sorry
---
I wish Blizzard would have made one of the 3 oceanic pvp realms rp-pvp but sadly I don't think they are confident in maintaining enough players for more than one server long term.
---
'go back to retail' is a thing that many of the people i was talking about say when their vision of how classic is supposed to be is threatened. sorry to say, vanilla and classic aren't the same, and leveling dungeons in classic are basically the same thing as leveling dungeons in retail. the only difference is, you have to drink more often. 
---
mages are never 'the only aoe in the group', every class has aoe. mages are just generally better at it. 
---
marking targets isn't required at all, and every dungeon i've been apart of has been cleave/aoe everything down.. because its easy and that's the fastest way to do it.
---
pulling aggro off the tank is not a big deal at all, nothing is threatening in any dungeon below 50. having an actual tank is not only not required for leveling dungeons, it actually makes them go slower most of the time. instead of 4 dps cleaving everything down, you have 3 dps cleaving everything down and 1 guy running around trying to hold threat while doing no damage. this is also the reason why cc slows everything down, because if you're ccing then you aren't cleaving and aoeing, and that means you're going slow.
---
sorry to say, but 'topping the dps charts' does in fact make the run smoother. if retail has taught us anything, it's that more damage fixes all the problems. 
---
stop being stuck in 2006, and telling everyone who knows how to make dungeons faster to 'go back to retail'
---
They weren't eligible to roll on it. This can happen if they were VERY far away when the mob died, it's a unique item they already have, it's loot from Moira when they haven't finished the quest to rescue her, etc.
---
*Laughs in Warlock*
---
Woof. I'm enjoying the nochanges life and all, but all these '04 era design issues are starting to put a damper on things.
---
I mean I've played horde since 2006 and alliance since 2004 and, horde are kind of honestly dbags. I've truly never seen more than a couple times where alliance ganked someone 5 v 1 out of nowhere when they were fighting mobs.
---
This is literally all Horde does on any server I've ever played including my Horde server where all my mains are.
---
It's always a rogue or shaman or warlock too, they think they're good, and it's hilarious how bad they are.
---
How does this happen? If I‚Äôve been dating a girl for 6 months we are spending the night together 5 nights a week and visiting each others families. Literally can‚Äôt do that with two people at once.
---
That‚Äôs the huge counterintuitive part. Your threat as Fury is going to SUCK in mitigation gear. You don‚Äôt wear defense gear and go fury.
---
The TLDR of it is, the MAJORITY of threat done by a prot spec warrior is static or is not as heavily influenced by offensive stats. For example:
---
Revenge benefits VERY little from AP and Crit since the damage component is ass but the ‚Äúhigh threat‚Äù component is good.
---
Shield slam doesn‚Äôt benefit from AP.
---
Sunset doesn‚Äôt benefit from AP or Crit.
---
All of those skills at least benefit from hit which is a high priority no matter what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Defensive gear and prot can do fine (as long as you pursue hit cap).  Good enough for even above average guilds.
---
Fury‚Äôs threat all comes from damage and requires tons of AP and Crit to scale well, as well as high player skill cap on when to throw a shield on to prevent crits with shield block.
---
I understand the shit out of the mechanics of the two specs and warriors in general, but I‚Äôm going to be rolling around as Prot if I‚Äôm tanking in P1. Fury will become a LITTLE more widely viable in AQ40 gear.
---
Dungeons it won't be a problem - ping under 500ms is plenty (though as you get higher the game will feel a little less responsive).
---
For PvP, lower ping means faster reaction time for interrupts etc, but 160ms is probably about average for anyone that doesn't live literally next to the data center.
---
Just don‚Äôt join the‚Äù MELEE CLEAVE/MAGE AOE FAST RUNS ONLY‚Äù groups, you‚Äôll have a much better experience.
---
Where is the SnD bind?
---
Yup. Being able to translate heals directly to a warlocks MP is huge for damage.
---
It'll matter for PVP, not so much for PVE (not until the more difficult raids anyway).
---
Fuckin sick nasty burn!!!
---
"You aren't an elite top .5% wow leveler??? Then you're whole guild is dogshit!!! LUL" -how your comment sounds in my head
---
I‚Äôm curious as well, I quit after TBC so I‚Äôm not really sure how much of a shit show retail is.
---
Did you ever play vanilla back in the day, or only xpacs?
---
I totally love RP and so I would absolutely RP back, like so:
---
\*projectile vomits uncontrollably all over Averagejoe\* Oh my, excuse me.
---
If true? If my son does have a reddit account? Or if plackEF is not him?
---
Oh god there's times when I see 4 or 5 groups all going to the same dungeon LF tank for hours, there is definitely a tank shortage here.
---
"just jump off the boards" fuck. you.
---
There are invisibility potions you can buy/alchemists can make.  Invisibility is broken on ability use and is countered by a warlock spell.
---
Not really worth constantly resetting a quest to get, considering the potion is cheap.  Could make for a fun ganking tool on a budget though I guess.
---
Yes, there are a few  Auctioneer I think it is called. It runs off historic data you obtain by running scans of the auction house that you need to carry out yourself. So the data is a bit general and cannot be too relied upon - more like a guide.
---
Auctioneer / Auctionator should allow you to run a 'Full Scan' of the auction house which quickly browses through all the current auctions and records the data.
---
It then adds to the tooltip how much the lowest auction is along with some other data.
---
I would highly recommend Auctionator just because the Buy/Sell menu is much better than the default AH menu (For example, buying in Auctionator sorts by 'per item price' rather than 'per stack price' which is just... infinitely more useful (I don't need 1 item stacks that are 10x the cost showing up first))
---
Haha that's funny. I started with Lock, got him 37, then wanted to play a melee dps too, rolled warrior got them 24, but realized I wanted something I could solo pvp with and kill casters, now I'm a level 22 rogue :)
---
Hopefully this is the one
---
Yea I didn't realize that there was a timer on how long it takes someone to get remvoned from an instance. I was pretty sure last time I kicked someone that they were removed instantly, but I was wrong.
---
So.. The great thing about shaman is that you're not gimped if you only have a couple pieces of one type. So if you went ele/resto but you're in all str/stam/agi gear you can play it like enh with a 1h/shield, searing totem and maybe use rank 1 shocks to fish for those clearcasting chain lightnings. As you get more Int gear your rotation moves more towards a caster rotation like the one I mentioned above. I'd see if you can snag a couple Int pieces on the cheap and get to it. We're hybrids and therefore flexible. Not nailed down to anything.
---
If you find an efficient route, you can get somewhere between 6-8 per hour or at least that's what I've found.
---
Umm you literally just described hunters. And if a paldin is using any gear that isnt mail/plate hes dumb
---
What class do you play
---
Thanks, makes sense.
---
Smaaart. Nice, man. Haven't thought about that. Thanks :)
---
Right now, Paladins are just gods at ST/Tank Healing, which I think is helping their numbers a bit.  Also, that 2% is made up of about 1% Shadow Priest, and 0.33% each for Druid/Paladin/Shaman.
---
It's back, it's got Satyr's, and it's amazing.
---
But it's also flying farther and farther out of my realm of knowledge.  I played Undead in Vanilla and i'm rolling Dwarf in classic, and I do not know this quest.
---
That usually is an infrastructure issue rather than a local issue. Ergo, something at the Blizzard server farm is running amok.
---
This is my fav place to pvp at level 29 as alliance. You still get yellow bar hordes, and fights are decently fair as you have alliance npcs to help while there are often times 5-8 hordes in my server farming them. Best part is when you log off at the town hall, sometimes you'll log in in front of someone for a surprise gank
---
We still need to farm HoJ.
---
I have an amazing guild who helped me farm the other one in a 12 man raid. The community in classic really is the best part :)
---
The whole idea of a timed dungeon felt so wrong. I hated mythics
---
Wouldn't you need to go 11 points into Holy for consecrate to AoE farm? (Not a paladin myself, so I'm just curious)
---
There's several different auction addons that will let you download the current prices for different items on the auction house. You have to physically go to the auction house with your character to populate the database, however, it has no idea what's happening when you aren't there.
---
Using rank 1 multishot is a decent mana savings while giving you that extra shot between autos when you need/want it.
---
You lucky bastard, GZ!
---
Not enough haha
---
"TBC has significantly faster progression"?
---
Did you play TBC?  TBC levels took forever and raiding was probably the most hardcore, slowest progression of all WoW.
---
Also, Karazhan was amazing.
---
Awesome leveling piece for a warrior. You did nothing wrong. Hunter has a tank with him at all times. You need the stun
---
Making gear for myself as a blacksmith?
---
My favourite autocorrect. I for one am a fan of the bloodthirsty Horse empire!
---
Lmao you and me both man. I thought it was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry‚Äù tanking the whole post till someone commented dual wield...
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy BfA.
---
Base WoW sub includes everything up to Legion.
---
It also includes Classic access.
---
As much as I am loving Classic, I hate to admit that Retail‚Äôs 1-60 experience is not totally without merit. 
---
It‚Äôs not a proper MMO like Classic but the leveling curve and character development is not awful. You don‚Äôt have talent points but you do get new abilities every other level and ‚Äútalent‚Äù choices at: 15, 30, 45 and 60. You will make no friends on your journey, you will have very little to no social interactions. Almost every person you group with will be a nameless random face you never see again.
---
However after 60 you can see how poorly implemented class design in Retail is. I leveled an Ele Shaman with one a Zandalari and was very much enjoying the class design, but once I hit 60 I only had 3 spells left to learn between 60 and 120. Two of which were passive modifiers to an ability and to my mastery with only one active spell.
---
I also had 3 talent rows left to unlock, and 50% of the options were also passive.
---
A person could theoretically level from 60 all the way to 120 with only one new spell to unlock, Purge.
---
I won‚Äôt get into the numerous faults with BfA.
---
Extremely small.  30 people tops
---
L1+X
---
honestly has everything to do w/ the archetype
---
people LOVE plate armored big 2h sword archetypes, and therefore warriors are popular, despite being absolute shit until being fully geared
---
i plan on writing down a lot of names as i farm my dungeon blues.
---
Is the durability loss unique to that item? Seems really annoying to deal with.
---
What us it about hunters in classic? So far every grp I've been in hunters pull aggro like crazy and roll and every damn piece of gear they can.
---
Do they just naturally generate more hate? I respecced dagger rogue and even with 1k plus crits and i dont even pull aggro off of a tank.
---
Anything that doesn't have mobs/bosses that are immune to Frost Nova, yes. And even then, it would only slow them down.
---
You can pretty much clear any dungeon with any group set up, as long as everyone knows how to juggle aggro and kite mobs.
---
Someones playing mage wrong, they have a SHIT ton of key binds and macros, and require multiple ranks of skills keybinded.
---
&gt; 've only ever had this back fire when people refuse to drink their water between packs, why wouldn't they want mana? I'm not sure...
---
Because without a mage, water costs money.  If I've got half mana, and you're not pulling a boss, we're good.
---
thanks for the response! interesting, i would have assumed that as time goes on more of these patterns will be available (\~1% drop from only a few mobs), and as they appear more, the price of the pattern and the robes would would be driven down by the increase in availability and decrease of demand because of locks leveling past the quest it is used for (\~35 quest, reward is good into early 40's). New to wow though so idk anything about the economy
---
I can't waiiiiiiiit
---
Source? 
---
And why didn't they stop it? People told them for month that layerhopping would be standard unless an insane delay. Yet they allowed it to happen.
---
Noone ever DW tanked 1-60 on private. It was always a hardcore strat that takes alot of min/maxing and never meant for early MC clears.  This is retail players misunderstanding the private server meta. 
---
The dungeons were actually much more punishing on private. Noone was doing brain dead cleave groups cause you just die.
---
Very unlikely they'll honor it in afraid. I made this mistake in Cata and regretted it. So now I suffer the queues, which aren't too bad these days. I'd reroll onto a high population server personally.
---
No it's not...it's Joetheplumbr. Silly.
---
I am using questies but the frames and color scheme is from elvui
---
You provide no context as to how valid that statement is, what level, and many other important things that would make this informative in any way.
---
Yeah that's really your only option atm. Paid transfers are probably coming at some point, but they're likely a way's off still.
---
There were a lot of places in the world that were left unfinished (on purpose so they could add those zones or instances later). Those places never really got added and Blizzard adopted a different model- the expansions. Probably easier to control which players are allowed into the new content this way.
---
They could add:
---
* island off of Feralas
---
* Instance in Winterspring
---
* Instance in Ashzara
---
* Uldum in the south of Tararis
---
* Gilneas
---
* that weird area in the east of Wetlands
---
* Version of Kharazan in deadwind pass
---
* zone on the east coast of RR
---
* another naga infested instance like BFD
---
* Mount Hyjal
---
It comes more viable late bwl and into aq with the stats tier 2.5 offer. You're just gimping yourself this early when bosses have 14% parry. It also revolves around having full world buffs cause like others have stated, blood thirst scales while shield slam scales super poorly. Our tank is gonna go fury prob in a couple weeks since horde have bigger threat problems. If you're ally I wouldn't even consider it yet.
---
Counter argument, if you‚Äôre slinging arrows at someone faster you have more opportunities to push back casting.
---
Wut it should be like 90:10 just as barrens typically is majorly horde with the odd ally running through not questing there
---
It is used in wpvp, AV and super often as just a fun thing, where everyone knows what will happen and stays there for fun rather than 'griefing'.
---
Warriors have fear break, no one runs Undead war for WoTF.
---
Orc is by far the most popular choice for war.
---
When in my story did I say that I created the entirety of southshore vs tarren mill? I simply stated that I got killed by people. I then ask for help and I go out looking for people to kill. And then more people and more people show up from that point. There was no war going on AT THE TIME until I wanted revenge. But according to you who wasn't there this was going on for 15 years non stop.
---
You can arms tank with a shadow priest healer any dungeon before raids. You dont need to be prot, youre better off holding agro through damage than you are with sunder/taunt/revenge/shouts.
---
3 mages 1 priest and sell dungeon runs
---
You jumped from the water to the top of the rock formation?
---
As a warrior who is a DPS spec that tanks, I can say hell no.
---
Aim for the early parry talent though. It's good in PVP and questing too.
---
Are you on alliance? Not many people bother with doing gy as alliance. You‚Äôll have more luck at 34 getting library groups.
---
I use ElvUI, and there‚Äôs a tab on both the party and raid frames called ‚ÄòBuff Indicators‚Äô that I use to track things like this.
---
Poor derpy boy
---
I mean.. What repercussions? Are you gonna suspend them? Call them names? Not group with them (Basically Blacklist)?
---
There‚Äôs not much you can do but be smart about when and when not to loot it.
---
TradeSkillMaster, or TSM, combines scans from everyone on your server / faction to give you a constant market value (14 day average) as well as the minimum price of the item on the last scan. Theoretically, you don't have to go to the AH to get a good idea of the current prices using TSM
---
I passed on the plate helmet from final boss in RFD for the other warrior who was tanking. They were grouped before me and helped me with a quest. I felt it was the right thing to do, but dam, I sure would have liked that helmet.... 
---
I try to look at it as building good karma for future drops.
---
If I can't trade it to someone why would I roll need if it's better for someone else?
---
This is how...this is how..how..this is hoooowww you start a war.
---
Not just that, but the types of players who have already hit 60 and have been running dungeons, are probably raid guilds, and are likely running dungeons with guild members as often as possible. They're not sitting in LFG spamming chat for hours.
---
Have you got the latest update for the add on?
---
Well, when I was in Desolace, I would just kill everything in 1 part and do some skinning if I can. Just by selling greens, whites and grays ( I usually kept blues just in case they sell well on AH), I got about 6-9 gold per 1,5 hour there. Also depends on your class, how fast you can farm etc. Then in Badlands I killed Scalding Whelps, they drop approx 1,5 silver on each kill and usually a grey item, a flame sac or a wicked claw which sells kinda good on AH. When you skin the whelps you can get worn dragonscale which also is a useful item right now. I've also heard people got Staff of Jordan from these and you can also get the pet Dark Whelpling. It is kinda  good exp also, like 20k per hour in my case ( you can probably get more by questing or dungeon spamming)
---
proven how?
---
definitely hard to say. thanks for the help!
---
Once you‚Äôre 37 get the quest to clear RFD for another good sword
---
ccc
---
I am comfortable healing dungeons as shadow, so I advertise in LFG "Priest Heals/DPS LFG x". Works pretty well, I've been getting in more groups as dps than as heals. I plan to be mainly heals once my guild starts raiding, so it kinda sucks not being priority in dungeons for heal gear. I usually just ask at the beginning if the healer minds if I roll on heal gear. If it isn't cool, then I'll grab dps gear, which is often healing gear, too.
---
Mages can beat them in later phases
---
There are huge guilds like this on retail. When they fill up, they make another guild called &lt;"Guild Name" II&gt;. Theres one that's up to XIII or so running around, and they are mostly mass invite guilds.
---
It's all hopes and dreams at this point.
---
The thing is (for me at least) is the 3s cast, chance to fail and multiple casts on nodes haha.
---
But I think you are right, I should mix some, and maybe get Mining or Herb in, at least, one of them. (But I haven't decided which one to main yet, really enjoying them the same level)
---
I dunno, but at one point there will only be one layer right?
---
I tried ffxiv . I know exactly what you are saying . Though after 3 weeks or something like that in classic I have to say this. After all of this years I forgot that playing a game was to have fun . Sure portals and stuff help. In classic in my playtime I get one lv and in retail three. In classic I get 3 times the fun. I'll keep that.
---
Dicks out for harambe
---
I think you need to look up the word "clutter". It implies a lot of something, whereas what I'm describing is *one* number in *one* location (and I have the scrolling part turned off, so it's literally one, unmoving number). That's the exact opposite of clutter.
---
I know based on feedback in game from tons of people ive played with so far that they definitely agree.
---
you're so fucking greedy dude i hope a warrior ninja loots a bow from you
---
I'm new in the game and I just ran RFC yesterday. We needed 1 hour doing it but I said "hey... I think other dungeons will be longer" Now I know what to expect :C
---
i was obsessed with this show back in the day. it was some of the funniest shit ever
---
Mac lul
---
Yes. It was updated 15 days ago as far as I know.
---
Reread it. No is still the answer.
---
Man I love ZT( EU RPPvP server) but I feel like shit like that never happens there.
---
yeah i know was just trying to figure what to drop to max it.
---
Herod and bigglesworth
---
AWAKEN MY SATYRS
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Is it magic in the lore?
---
I was aware of the drop in maraudon (there's one in ZF too) but I didn't know about the quest reward, thank you!
---
Yeah my whole friend list is classic minus 1 or 2.
---
Omg, never mind it was fine :)
---
I'm on it.  It's not that bad.
---
What do you mean by funding an alt? I agree that backtracking is boring yeah
---
&gt; Barrens is a funnel for all level 10-25 orcs, tauren, and trolls. Almost all of the horde is in that zone.
---
Undead are almost half of the horde lol.
---
I have 30 ping over wifi, not near a data center (but on fiber).
---
Thanks! I'm running a 32" 21:9 at 2560x1080. Makes for lots of room for addons lol
---
Little does OP know that there are horde who don't "moan/cry" about the exact same crap he's not "moaning/crying" about.
---
Well Grimtotem Bandits are essentially Tauren Rogues. They have Rogue Kick/Rogue Disarm and don't use shields or anything.
---
What !? First aid too !? But I have to drop one or I can take the 3 ? THat means, blacksmithing, mining and those 3?
---
Is anyone else tired of the "Imagine ...." format of mocking someone?
---
I like it when they just have a lock/unlock button on the gui lol
---
4 hours sat watching reality TV - absolutely fine.
---
4 hours playing computer game - disgusting immoral slovenly behaviour.
---
You still use MCP as bear for threat generation.  Generally though you can use 1 charge and have a healthy threat lead then swap back to your Warden Staff.  Burn a second charge if you need the threat.
---
Lol they gave out those passes like fucking hot cakes man. They were *everywhere*
---
As someone who plays a mage, I make a point to not piss off my healers. 
---
I will AOE. I will pull threat. Pls heal me and res me when needed. In exchange, the least I can do is make sure you have the mana needed to heal and/or res me.
---
Same on Skeram
---
Leveling weapon skill probably.
---
I made this observation recently and got downvoted for it. lol
---
Give me thy name
---
Goon Squad on Mal'Ganis back in the day had 3-4 guilds. I remember getting in and feeling like I was part of the Squad, then realizing it was the 3rd overflow guild from the main guild. RIP.
---
&gt;I said I needed some water from the mage. 
---
But did you *ask*? That's the difference. You should be courteous and wait for a response before opening trade.
---
That said - your retort was pretty funny, especially considering you finished the dungeon with no issues afterwards.
---
Outplayed
---
Druids that rolled as tanks came into classic expecting to have to work for respect to overcome the negative stereotypes.  We expecting nothing to be handed to us and to have to work for it.  That may also be part of the difference.  That plus we are good solid tanks mechanically.
---
Kinda glad to have missed it tbh. So I'll have to catch up a little at 60,boo hoo. At least there's plenty of people my level without it being overwhelming
---
How many tries did that take?
---
If you're going to trade it to someone, you don't roll need. It's that simple. 
---
You only roll need if you *gasp* need it.
---
Free trail account.
---
Against sub rules :P
---
So happy that on biggles I've yet to encounter any asshole. Maybe I'm lucky I dunno.
---
Why does he have that same look on his face every time someone posts him?
---
what do you mean by late game? I‚Äôm not a rogue main but a rogue in my guild said he stopped questing around 57 and went exclusively dungeons.
---
Its like 10% more damage if you math it out at most and bosses are weaker than private servers. They have 1-2k less armor, all bosses except sulfuron have 0 armor with armor debuffs on them. Trust me, its a non issue. Its far from an asinine amount of damage.These bosses are hitting so weak and are dropping like flies.
---
What about in Moonglade?
---
I used to play a mage and getting the trade window slammed open in your face constantly does get old...
---
But I think he learned that it takes teamwork in classic when you let em die.
---
Only correct answer to WPvP. I don't care what level they are. I'll start a fight with anyone.
---
That bridge is called Thandol Span, you uncultured horde swine!
---
Id suggest not keybinding mocking blow and rend. At 30 you get sweeping strikes, so you just have to build up rage on one mob, then aggro 2 mobs and sweeping strikes + cleave. The two mobs will die faster than the first one. In fact, I suggest stopping using heroic strikes too except as a rage dump. Soon you will get Whirlwind and Mortal Strike which are your two best damage abilities and heroic strike will become useless while solo.   
---
You need sweeping strikes on keybind. It is one of the best warrior abilities, and if you use it well will boost your levelling speed a lot and make you top the charts in dungeon pulls.  
---
For pummel/shield slam, I suggest the same key bind of down mouse wheel. I use up mouse wheel for on use trinkets also. Reason is you want quick interrupt and having down mouse in muscle memory means interrupts become way more natural overtime, we will eventually get pvp trinket too and having up mousewheel for the same reason is super convenient. Camera zoom i put on "scroll up/scroll down" buttons, its not really vital in combat anyway.  
---
Last thing, in the best case scenario, you shouldnt have keybinds to change stances. Instead, you should have stance changing/abilities macros rolled into one. For example, a macro that changes you in berserk stance and intercept. Another that changes you in d stance, equips shield and 1-hand, and shield slam, or taunt. Battle+charge. You get the deal. That way, you dont have to push 2 buttons to use 1 skill.
---
Yeah, his "bad luck" is his massive lack of any situational awareness.
---
5vs1, or small groups they get lucky with can be devastating, however, multiboxing seriously screws up your team in battleground.  You are borderline useless because instead of having 5 bodies to split off and do other things, you have a cluster of bots basically doing the same thing as player A, even if it is a different skill.  This leaves you vulnerable to AOEs yourself as well.   Good teams can avoid the multiboxers, and it leaves a large chuck of your team tethered together and holding the team back.  They may get great kills, but kills don't always win battlegrounds.
---
How many people are on a full realm and how many realms are there? You could probably do a really rough guesstimate just knowing basic numbers.  It might not tell you who left retail for classic, but I think you can make a semi-accurate guess. If you knew how many people were playing retail when classic came out, then a rough estimate of realm pops now comparing classic vs. retail, and I bet you could draw some kind of rough conclusion.
---
Can never be too sure on Reddit. :P
---
What's wrong with his guild?
---
Impossible
---
From the way you frame this statement it sounds like pure BS to me.
---
A DDOS of this scale would result in criminal action. For that to happen there would be some kind of judicial proceedings before any fine was handed out. 
---
Even if they caught the person and judged them to be responsible INSTANTLY (which didn't happen) no judiciary system moves that fast as to hand a fine out so quickly.
---
Stop gossiping.
---
petty af and YTA but I totally approve. you asked, he didn't catch it, provided an asshole response, and he got exactly what he gave.
---
My first character in vanilla was a druid continues to be my main today, I love the class and could never switch. However, when classic came out I knew I couldn't go druid because they are shit. I do kind of have the urge to bear tank and get some crazy armor, but there's just not really any point. I'd rather play a class that at least can use their tier gear
---
Priest healer here. One thing i dont like is when a warlock life taps from 0 mana to full taking all there health with them. Sometimes im stuck healing the warlock more than the tank, and in order to keep the pace going the warlock normally stays at about 50% hp most fights so im not constantly running oom.
---
 But this isnt always the case with warlocks. What I say is. Life tap during combat if you need. Its part of your rotation and allows you to keep the damage rolling. However, after combat dont life tap to full mana. Yeah after that you're ready to go but the healer will need to top you off then regen mana after that so you're stuck waiting regardless. So if youre out of combat I'd eat/drink so your healer can regen mana asap.
---
I'm not completely in your boat. I have a long-term friend that I still talk to on a semi-regular basis, but I moved and I drifted apart from most of my gamer friends. My wife isn't a gamer, nor is she really interested. It's just one of those things I keep to myself. Unfortunately there is still a bit of negative stigma with gaming, maybe because it is still a fairly new form of entertainment? Someone asks what you did over the weekend and you tell them you binge watched movies and they think nothing of it...you reply with you played video games all weekend and some might laugh at you for it. 
---
Gaming should just be viewed by another form of entertainment. You shouldn't feel guilt or shame with what activities you find entertaining, as long as they are not harming others. You might also be surprised at how many casual gamers are out there as well, they just probably don't like to openly talk about it for reasons mentioned above.
---
Total guess with 0 research but I believe it's from the "immersion" where you "relate" with the character and know that when *you* jump off a cliff then it's going to kill you.
---
I think I just died a little inside. I'd murder my "buddy" lmao.
---
Tauren will be even beefier with that 5% hp bonus, so that's a solid choice. Professions won't really matter unless you plan on getting in to PvP. If you are, engineering is important and pairing mining with that isn't a terrible idea.
---
Otherwise whatever you want, really. Skinning is great to make some cash early on while you're leveling. Herbalism is a good choice for Tauren, as well.
---
this person should be quarantined
---
Not sure why you would be downvoted. Take my upvote. You do you my dude. We're all out here to have a good time. ‚ô°
---
If your group doesn't understand why AoE cleave works you shouldn't be trying to run it. You have a good comp for a normal party. You have an abysmal  / not viable comp for AoE cleave.
---
You want 2 mages minimum, I usually ran with 3. With 4 you can skip a tank. I am not sure if a paladin healer can solo it; priests can do it. Pre-shielding allows for bigger pulls.
---
Oooh it‚Äôs a trinket
---
Right now you're not gonna get 70 gold for this. Hell on most servers these are selling for like 10-15 gold. If you really want to make a few hundred gold your gonna need to alt bank it for a few weeks maybe even a month or two and then sell it.
---
Are you aware what greed even means?
---
I believe he walks through desolace feralas and thousand needles. And maybe southern barrens as well if I‚Äôm remembering it right. His lore background is basically a master traveler so yeah he walks a lot
---
Yet practically no one owns it.
---
That happened to us last night in deadmines with the BOP +6int, +2agi ring. Warrior's excuse was "but I don't have a ring." Mage, priest, and hunter all missed out.
---
Whatever site had it posted before is prob long dead already - I'm hoping someone brings it back or makes another for Classic since this is a thing to do again (was removed in Cata right?)
---
You can level to the low hundreds for
---
free/making gold by buying weapons or magic essence for 5s or less, disenchanting, making lesser/greater wand and vendoring.
---
My guilds experimented with different # of healers for the last 2 weeks of raid. Mc definitely doesn‚Äôt need a ton for most fights and having the extra dps just lets you breeze through even with some people slacking.
---
&gt;If you want to gank people that's fine, it's a PVP server.
---
I agree ‚ò∫üëå
---
You're not wrong but a mage, rogue, hunter, druid, shaman... Well basically any class with innate mobility is gonna run away from a priest. That was my point.
---
He vanished to prevent the polymorph to try and close the gap. If the poly lands he just 150% loses that fight. I think the rogue was fighting to win, not fighting to live. He was using everything offensively, albeit desperately (the blind was a good example). He wasn‚Äôt going to save vanish or sprint to escape, he was all in.
---
Well played lad haha
---
Yes and always keeping slice and dice up I don‚Äôt really use eviscerate
---
&gt;I figure i could still aoe with frostbite i just may have pulls here and there i would die or mess up due to  frostbite but it's doable and since aoe farming is mostly solo anyhow shouldn't be a big deal or am i wrong? But its worth that trade off if i want to pvp
---
Wait until you're 50. There is no hope and joy anymore.
---
&gt;Haha you just won with that comment!
---
Haha you just lost with this one!
---
If you have any interest in endgame content and gear, I can tell you right now that these are the type of people that you DO NOT want leading your raid. They would've surely fucked you over, and you dodged a bullet early.
---
Not if you kill them RIGHT as they kill you. I‚Äôve died to DoT‚Äôs or a ranged spell duel several times, just as my enemy dies, so do I. They however, do not RISE ONCE MOORE TO CARRY OUT THE MASTER‚ÄôS WILL!
---
This is dumb. Unknown new content is a literal selling point.
---
This series was the greatest. Re-watched them a few years back. Thanks for the nostalgia bomb
---
Those two gorilla fangs are a great reward for letting your fellow horde die....  Good job.
---
This was a pug.
---
This ain't a duel-for-all, son.
---
My friends are drunk and like to go out, while id enjoy talking about games, it makes me less of a nerd and i can go out and stuff.
---
You can have a "world feeling" even with a ton of teleportation, like in GW2.
---
Yes. I'm one of them, too. But, my point, again, is that until they release new content on Retail, we can't know for sure who's here to stay, who's already thinking about going back and who's going to go back and forth between the two.
---
For example, I've been playing 8 hours on average since launch, I obviously won't do that once I'm done farming my Phase 1 BiS gear, if I'm done before Phase 2 launches, especially considering they haven't released BGs or activated the Honor system, yet.
---
That said, I have no interest in Retail, so if I drop down to 3 or 4 hours of WoW a day (or less), I'll probably spend more time on other games or go out more in RL, but chances are there are quite a few people out there who'll instead spend that time on Retail, is all I'm saying.
---
Then again, I might just roll a new alt, too. Who knows?
---
Can you also post what the ratio of Tank to Healer to DPS was?
---
I keep saying it and I'll keep on saying it: Classic is about the journey, Retail is about the end. The reason I've loved Classic so much is that I can just get lost in the quests and stuff and not really worry about my level. When I ding its always a nice surprise!
---
I almost feel the quality would be superior if they took a picture on their phone
---
yea thats really weird? does it last longer than 15 mins? Seems like kind of a waste..
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
That should tell you everything you need to know.
---
As far as learning abilities, you actually need to go tame another pet with that ability, then use that pet until the hunter "learns" how to teach it to other pets, then you can go back to your main pet and teach them that ability.  Petopia has all the details on what abilities the different types of pets can learn and where to get a pet to actually learn how to teach that ability.
---
The best abilities depend on the situation.  In raids, you'll use a wolf for the AoE howl buff.  In PvP, you want a fast attack speed pet for casting time knockback.  A boar charge is nice as well as a gorilla thunderclap.  Take a look at the website for all the details.
---
Amazing. Perfect example of why I love WoW so much!
---
Why is that relevant to this? 
---
Everybody knows that Mage is easiest to play and the most OP class in the game.
---
World first 60 was a Mage. Dungeon grps looking for mages to do AOE farming. 
---
Pulling 5+ mobs and AOEing them down without them even scratching you, wow so hard.
---
Ah shit. What am I supposed to do with my 22 Prot Pally lol.
---
Is Shade of Eranikus supposed to be able to 'sleep' the main tank? We couldn't kill him last night because we didn't have a second person who could taunt once MT got CCed.

TSM now keeps the database up to date with everyone else's scans on your server's faction like it does on retail. It even provides a market value for the item consisting of the average price over the past 14 days, as well as the current minimum price as of the latest scan done by anyone using the addon on your server's faction
---
28 aha but close. I thought about re-rolling but I hate questing. And would rather just pay honestly
---
He seemed confident so I was hoping to get an answer from him. I took your advice and checked the wikis, but I didn't find any lore information regarding the nature of stealth.
---
I knew someone was gonna think that.  I was too much in shock to notice his health.  Thought the dude was AOE farming just fine til he dropped.
---
No, the Mage did.
---
..."it's for mah healing gear!"
---
Not so sure, only one in the raid realy can, the one who crit first !
---
Wait for more sunders than one or two
---
I don't really find it fun going back and forth to the same location multiple times on 6 min long runs.
---
To each their own I guess.
---
and like 8+ of those spots are for mages lol
---
What is your major going to be in university? You may want to end up saving longer for something better. If you have to run any more advanced software you might end up with a lot of trouble.

I creamed my pants seeing those numbers and watching a health bar get 1 shot.
---
You'll always be a coward in my eyes.
---
Oh I see where you‚Äôre coming from, you think if I have a negative opinion of something then that means I‚Äôm complaining. Makes total sense.
---
&gt; I'm not opposed to the new races. Blood elves and their zones were amazing and they are what I miss most in Classic WoW.
---
In my opinion, Blood Elves and Draenai diluted the identities of the factions. Draenai in particular feel like they don't even fit into Warcraft. They're essentially Protoss-lite.
---
yea I found the option to disable this thing
---
one player using abilities to kill another player is PVP
---
player vs player
---
big ???
---
That makes a lot of sense, well said. Im still only level 43, but haven't done much RL since classic, but youre right once im 60 and BiS galore ill relax a bit, play my FIFA, and make alt it up with friends.
---
lol fuck off
---
That sounds hectic and awesome at the same time. I thought BG was always a part of wow but I only played TBC at the time.
---
Im a lv 28 alliance mage, what dungeons should I be running? 
---
Ps. Never played retail wow before, this is my first time
---
Did they not have limitations on messaging?
---
Agreed, I've never seen a tank get crap because no one cares. Hunter pulls threat? FD. Mage pulls threat? Ice Block or Frost Nova. Rogue? Evasion. Most classes have something. And if not it's not a big deal, the mob will die in 5 seconds anyway. 
---
I don't know what kind of groups people get that warrants all these threads, but I'm certain that in many cases it's because the tank feels the need to have aggro on everything 100% of the time or they'll get shit for it. You don't. No one expects it. And if they do you just got a rare rotten apple and should just ignore them.
---
Ran a dungeon with 2 other druids and we were all dps with a paladin "tank" and priest dps.
---
It's relevant though. If you don't need to leave retail to play classic, transitioning back to retail has no opportunity cost.
---
As such it becomes a lot harder to judge. Retail players who are playing classic can go back at literally any time.
---
Explain to me why 50% of players are playing the "hardest" class again?
---
you know nothing.
---
The totem doesnt make a noticeable difference. And all guides confirm that it shouldnt be used in most situations. Its very mana efficient, but it doesnt heal enough to be useful.
---
Not really... You're pretty much either using rank 1 or max rank for certain spells. For classic, I don't really come close to running out of workable binds with a traditional WASD setup. It's not like healers that gotta have several binds for the same heal. A lot of the macros you could even run in vanilla won't work anymore with the more stringent restrictions on conditionals.
---
well this wasnt ment to be pure aoe just to have the option to do well in solo aoe while being okay in pve and  focused more toward the pvp side.

Add queues after one layer/server is full and offer free server transfers. Nothing that blizzard can do here. Full is full.
---
Cool name though!
---
Late 40s. Probably not late game to some, but I've seen a very clear line in the quests become less useful. If your guildmate says he kept going to 57, perhaps I still need to keep grinding out quests.
---
Holy smokes you are so good at world of warcraft
---
How do i keep missing this shit?! I was just thinking the other day "how come nothing crazy has really happened on Rattlegore yet?"
---
Those guilds are fucking trash as fuck.
---
I was in a guild full of IRL friends (acquaintances...pissants from high school that were loosely in the friend circle and had no business there and no one really liked them then or when WoW came out years later) and I can easily state for a fact I was the best healer in the guild. And who got shit they needed when it dropped in Zul'Aman or Hyjal for example? Or Naxx?
---
A fucking girl healer who was 2nd place healer.  Every time. And she wasn't there every time, either.
---
Don't raid with real life people you know, you won't get shit if you aren';t their BFF. Even with DKP because of trash people.
---
These salt-soaked caverns are teeming with pelagic nightmares. They must be flushed out.
---
Ahh yeah WoD was the alternate universe, TBC is Draenor, and Legion is Argus (I thought Argus and Outlands were the same place). WoD is then Draenor v2. What a mess lol.
---
Everyone looks the same in wow.
---
Wait, why are you mixing horde and alliance compositions?
---
My thoughts as well
---
How do you feel about ‚ÄúBOOMSHAKALAKA!‚Äù?
---
persists for me
---
ironnically, GW2 and his "your level go down to the area's level" which will make wow worse helped GW2 a lot in this area, since even when everyone is level max, you can find them in pretty much every area because they have an actual reason to come back in old areas (daylies can be finished in every area), instead of staying in the last "high-level" areas.
---
Incorrect. You only use a charge on bosses and each pumler has 3 charges.
---
love how the helmet item ikon coresponds with 3d art on your character :-D
---
This makes me so upset. lol
---
Did you reboot your pc before posting here?
---
It's not a myth that warrior scale the best with gear though
---
My experience surprisingly meeting them, and also Gazlowe in Ratchet and Chromie in WPL were special too, since I've played tons as each of them in Heroes of the Storm.
---
there are tons of phallic symbols in wow. I see them everywhere
---
Responding with nothing but "QQ" on a username God_Is_Nonexistant? 14 year old edgelord. Put the two together.
---
Nothing really, cesspool is an older wow term used to describe a guild that is huge and pretty much accepts everyone. They are notorious for having less than favorable members.
---
I see this as a problem. Ever seen that Black Mirror episode where you can literally block/delete people out of real life from talking to you? This is not the correct way to go about doing such things like this. You should be able to talk to other people even if you disagree with them. You should also be able to call people out on their bad behavior. Just blocking people or ignoring them without telling them they are wrong/bullying/or just disagree with them doesn't solve an obvious problem. We're all guilty of using our anonymity on the internet as a way to relieve/let go/act out behaviors we normally wouldn't. But in a social game such as classic/vanilla WoW, correcting or just saying anything would go a long ways.
---
People should just do themselves a favor and roll need on BOE's. You're just asking to get screwed if you don't
---
Because rogues are amazing when it comes to pvp. They do great in pve as combat rogues, but they are moreso a pvp class. Warriors can do well in pvp as well but where warriors have rogues beat in pve, rogues have them beat in pvp. Also it varies. Not everyone can play either class to their full potential.
---
Ele Shaman or Rogue? Solo (w)PvP, 1vX.  
---
Basically I've played both classes reasonably well (in TBC though, not Vanilla) and for the life of me I can't decide which one to go with. So just looking for some inspiration :)
---
i know everyone is usually gushing over bloodfang and judgement, and fair enough they're really cool

You don't need them if you don't like them. Doesn't matter how you play if you have fun and do your job
---
How am I being purposefully stupid?
---
Well I was first killed right next to southshore on the beach with the murlocs. So help was close. And a druid mentioned he got t-bagged by horde and was all in on helping lol
---
I also play on DD, but never saw him. I did however stumble upon a guy called Bebbit who's pretty popular on Barrens Chat and says stuff like "I'm Bebbit", and even has a guild named after him! &lt;Bebbit Bullies&gt;
---
Heh heh heh
---
You could if you had a second account which many people I knew had to keep tabs on the Alliance for world PVP and server first purposes.
---
Yeah took us nearly 4 hours too. There's no way any pug is going to do a full quest clear in 2 hours unless they are all lvl 60 and decked in bis/epics.
---
Shhhhh, I cant read okay!?
---
Had another warrior laugh about me using a staff.  Joke‚Äôs on them, that staff damage was far superior to theirs!
---
Last night last night
---
I don't know about the staff, but I was tanking with a Hypnotic Blade from 33-40 both on my classic warrior and on warrior 1.0 a decade ago. There basically isn't anything close unless you buy a BoE blue or got extremely lucky with the Gnomeregan rapier (5% drop from a non-farmable boss)
---
No, I sure didn't.
---
Deep Fury/Prot hybrid build isn't ideal for tanking leveling (it's doable, you can get by) the threat is bursty and heavily influenced by RNG, so you have some pulls that aggro is easy to hold, the next you threat gen is shit. Plus the additional incoming damage is harder on lower level healers. Once you get to Phase 3+ level gear, Quel'serrar and the 1 hand sword from BWL, thats when the 0/31/20 build really starts to eclipse prot.
---
That seems like a workaround. I'd like to see whether the buff has fallen off - not whether it has applied.
---
Some better advice for that guy:
---
Just don't use an add-on and find players in a social manner. Like do dungeons or quest with people suggesting they join your guild. They're more likely to give a shit about the guild.
---
Bagnon and onebag3
---
&gt; Dal'Rends and Hand of Justice belong to hunters. Roll Need.
---
Are you trying to make him hated on his server?
---
i like it when people dont install addons. spent 60s in bids and won 4g worth of items. small profit short term, adds up long term.
---
Turns out it's actually Questie!
---
I would tell one of your locks to reroll why do you need 3.. but with 3 locks you should be able to tank with summons if they‚Äôre good in most dungeons. 
---
Other then that reroll Druid, you‚Äôll be a jack of all trades, you can tank in bear and do rogue things in cat for solo
---
Only the top tenth of the 1% understand this joke.
---
Killing things faster is ultimately what will get you to 60, mount only gets you from point A to B faster. You're going to spend a lot more time killing than you do riding. Sure for some classes the gear isn't as big of a deal, but for melee/hunters it can be huge.  
---
Alternatively you could level more in dungeons to get good gear and use the money instead for a mount, best of both worlds.
---
brilliant, thank you
---
Sadly Sir Maximillian of Northshire isnt in Classic, because his quest line is probably one of the funniest in the game. That quest line and the one from Stonetalon Mountains where Garrosh executes that one general by dropping him off the elevator landing were the most memorable of the Cataclysm quests I feel like.
---
Fuck paladins forever for having the coolest set of armor.  Sincerely, a rogue.
---
Cats do not abide by the laws of nature, alright? You don‚Äôt know shit about cats.
---
End of dungeon chests as in retail did not exist in vanilla, this chest is a normal chest which just happens to be at the end of the dungeon.
---
I have been fortunate to have a lot of friends who play games. My boyfriend has just as much of an addictive personality when it comes to games as I do. We do play different types of games though, so we rarely play together. I'm sorry your wife thinks it's a flaw. It's not a flaw, so please don't feel shitty about it. People just have different interests and just because they don't align doesn't mean they're a flaw. My boyfriend likes to binge-game big board games like Descent and KDM and I just don't/can't. I have to take breaks. It makes playing with him and his friends rough, but it's okay to not be 100% alike, or even 50% alike.
---
Game on!
---
:&gt;
---
Lol playing alliance.
---
Lol, trying for the upvotes but most people here know better.
---
Nice. Would you recommend arms spec for warrior?
---
You know, I really wish I had that mindset. I know it's the most ideal, but I just seriously cannot shrug off this min/max feeling. It's just impossible for me :(
---
It‚Äôs Europe. And you can get jail time. But it‚Äôs more the other consequences. You might get the eyes of the child care system. They might think that you forfeit your kids. Basically you have the attention of the authorities in a bad way. 
---
There is talk about legalising it. Weed and other not very strong substances. But realistically....we are talking 10-15 years from now. But...that would put me just into the ‚Äúold‚Äù category so maybe that will be the time hehe. And then the kids are way past 18 and authorities can‚Äôt do shit anymore:)
---
This is correct, with macros for things like charge, intercept, etc
---
Play the class you like playing Jesus fucking Christ people if you‚Äôre asking at this point it doesn‚Äôt even matter
---
Just walk and you'll be fine.
---
Yes every time you block and it procs the shield ability you take durability damage to the shield. And you burn through the shields durability very quickly, I basically only use the shield when I‚Äôm FR ranking imps and the 4 elemental pulls after Shaz before  another tank picks up the earth elementals.
---
Nut is slang for ejaculate. To ‚ÄúBust a nut‚Äù or simply the verb ‚Äúto nut‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs insinuating that Alliance sucks cock.
---
Because you like the rogue class and the additional tools it offers more than the warrior class. As someone who wants to PvP and PvE, I chose rogue because I didn't want to get kited around like an idiot fighting casters.
---
If all this game means to you is min/maxing and being the person who can deal the most damage in a group setting in a video game fighting computer monsters, then you picked the wrong class.
---
Right!?  This is, in fact, how it be when you only have three FPs on the whole continent.
---
You don't have mortal strike yet at level 40?
---
Yeah, I got a Hypnotic Blade for tanking. I waited patiently for nobody else to want it.
---
That‚Äôs what some say. But I disagree. You already dilute the playerbase by making Classic+ and Old School Classic as options. 
---
Also, if people would rather be playing BC after 3 years of Vanilla... they probably wouldn‚Äôt be playing much vanilla anyways.  It will fragment to a degree, but so long as there is at least one PVE and PVP server per region, the game will live on just fine.
---
Also you want to bring enough Paladins/Shaman for all the buffs, auras, and totems.
---

As a human warrior, I feel more of a kinship with horde warriors than I do with mages from my own faction.  For the sword!!!

Question: how‚Äôs end game as holy? My character name is literally Healzs but I‚Äôm questioning if I want to actually heal at the end because doing anything outside of dungeons/raids is a bit harder. Lol
---
Same.  Some of those zones even already have content from expansions that could be modified for lower level stuff.
---
&gt; Always have and for no particular reason other than I think he is a wimpy alliance leader.
---
I think there *could* be potential, especially if one of his decisions actually has major consequences. His naive and infallible aspect is *rife* with opportunity to get a kick in the ass by the reality of the situation. What if he was faced with a Stratholm situation like Arthas? What if he lets the denizens turn rather than massacre (Arthas did nothing wrong)? What if that results in an outbreak of something far worse? What if his limp character begins to degrade the Alliance leadership's cohesion because of his inability to make hard decisions?
---
Characters like Anduin are annoying when left as is, I agree. It's not a character we can really empathize with, but boring 1-dimensional characters are, by contrast, very easy to deepen and shape through conflict. Give Anduin a hard decision, make there be consequences, make him fight *and bleed* for his role in the lore, and then you'll have a great character.
---
Lol hate gaming on macs
---
Yeah that‚Äôs kind of how that works. You in a thread right now calling others dicks and assholes for doing something in a video game is what a complaint is lol holy shit you‚Äôre dense. You can have a negative opinion and keep it to yourself and then it‚Äôs just a negative opinion. When you express that negative opinion to others in a forum, that‚Äôs a complaint. You are complaining about being killed at 10% and oom and getting danced on. What else do you call that? A negative observation? No it‚Äôs a complaint about a particular way of interacting. You‚Äôre trying to deter others from doing it by associating that behavior with who they would consider to be dicks or assholes in their lives. You‚Äôre complaining.
---
No, but generally if you ask your group members theyll share quests they have with you.
---
Also I cant remember if it was wowhead, but theres a site that has a list of all dungeons, recommend levels, and most importantly the quests available and how to get them. It's also broken up by faction since horde and alliance generally have different quests
---
I know it's all good and dandy to say Classic+ is a better choice but I've yet to see any idea which is better than just TBC without a few elements.
---
If it's the end of the dungeon there's nothing to kick them from..
---
Just walk and you'll be fine. No need to jump at all.
---
Healing meters are largely useless to begin with, and they certainly don't show individual heals in real-time like OP is looking for.

I also recommend [classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling) 
---
I asked the same question yesterday and a few people vouched for it, I started using it yesterday and it's incredibly efficient.  Got to level 14 in an evening with intermittent breaks.
---
I supposed the main downside to it is you have to use it via a 2nd monitor, and the fact that it's very picky and hard to hop back into once you wander off the path for a few levels.
---
Does Auctioneer work, or just TSM?

Adderall uff that serious stuff, nope we just wanna have fun thx

I‚Äôm alliance on Earthfury and it‚Äôs great! Excellent wPvP, fast to find groups and people are friendly. Good horde/alliance ratio

I get a full hotbar using WASD too. I use 1-5, QER and ZXCV. That's 12 keys, then if I need to I have a second bar with a shift modifier for the same keys.
---
Isn't it like alt + z to hide ui
---
Classic mistake. You invited a hunter.
---
To add to that, if you go in at 53 or 55 with all the initial quests as a group (and go back and forth for the outside instance fire elemental), the dungeon will nearly keep you in the lower level range due to needing the key, as well as get all of the lower level quests done.
---
Finish that half, get your key, have your quests ready to go for to the next set, and you'll be sent into the upper city which ends at higher levels.
---
There's some back and forth on both of those two (the prison escort, etc), but it's a rough guiding path.
---
Is level 10 twinking a thing? I thought 19/29/39 were the only ones. Maybe 49 but at that point you may as well just get to 60.
---
Do you have everything else and if so, what motherboard?
---
Yeah don't do warrior if you don't like stress. Make one mistake and your group dies, you better prepare to get shit on for the rest of the dungeon.
---
Appreciate it! Thanks
---
I only saw it on the AH once, and someone was listing it for over 300g lmao. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that did not sell. robes are listed from about 1g50s-2g with about 10 on the market right now, how does that compare with your server? I'm horde as well, if that matters.
---
A lot of the people raiding right now beat most of the solo Mages or Warlocks though. They had static groups and the grinded dungeons all the way up.
---
When this graph changes it won't be because the guilds changed all that much, it'll be because new guilds / raid groups form with the people that didn't static level.
---
The gummy bear company?
---
Those low level ganks can take you dark places, though. I got killed in Ashenvale by a mage, 4 levels higher, as I was fighting a mob. Filled with righteous rage, I come back - and while the mage was gone, a tauren was there. One level lower, but blood for blood, right? 
---
It's not until after the tauren is dead that I realize she was a druid, and I've broken the unspoken pact. Two more druids then come to hunt me down, resulting in 45 minutes of cat and other cat games across two zones. I'm an outcast from the circle, and all because rage clouded my vision!
---
Every been in a pile of people in a 40 man raid then you go to separate and you're not sure which nearly identical looking character you are and end up running the wrong way because you thought you were someone else?

is there an easier way to find groups for dungeons? Level 28 mage, running them normally not a grind or anything.
---
 I have joined /lfg but it is rarely used.  And I don't have the time to spend 2 hours in Org.
---
Does QS count, thought that is not in the game until a later Phase.
---
Yeah, I WtF on that too until I went back and looked again.
---
Until you get to places like Sunken Temple and BRD you can heal perfectly fine being full shadow.
---
Once you get into the 50s it can get hard to heal without being healing spec.  It‚Äôs by no means impossible if you are running with good players but in pickup groups that rarely happens.
---
Warrior tank is the best, man. I am off tanking right now because my friend is tanking, but when I have the chance, I try my hand at spanking.
---
Def stance is only like 110% or 120%, and battle/zerker are 90%. You are going to get SIGNIFICANTLY more agro by damage than you will by threat generating abilities. You dont have a clue, stop.

---
If you reserve using MCP just for boss fights, you can pretty much just do it once and have 15 charges, which is pretty good for a night of MC.
---
wrong, you just have to create side-grade progression systems. new resistances, new gear could have sockets (which results in the gear itself being upgraded multiple times, and with secondary stats typically, rather than a raw power increase).   
---
New raids dont need to be "post-Naxx" either, they could do pre-MC and parallel raids.
---
Yeah, I'm just glad not everybody translates PvP to: kill on sight everything and everyone of the other faction. At least that's not my interpretation of PvP.

If you read the tooltip for Might you‚Äôll notice that it says ‚Äùmelee attack power‚Äù. Most things give just ‚Äùattack power‚Äù which benefits both melee and ranged attacks. Might, however, only benefits melee attacks :)

That's okay swordsteel rapier sucks for a mainhand.
---
Reading this actually irritated me. This is exactly the reason why I will never invite a hunter to any of my groups. Thankfully I rolled a warrior tank so I lead my own groups and call the shots. No one will suffer the huntards grouped with me.
---
Mine being [Felstriker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12590/felstriker) didn't get it yet. but the grinding is half the fun! ;)!
---
A friend of mine called me an asshole for not knowing his birthday was last week. I don't even remember family member's birthdays let alone friends. Fuck outta here with that shit.
---
Username checks out.
---
What else are you doing with your right hand while playing?
---
Well that's certainly a lot of BS. Sure you can make a valid point about being very CD reliant, but that is the only obvious downside that one can make when talking about rogue PvP.
---
Sub Rogues and Frost Mages are both S+ tier specs. So I totally know how difficult it might be to choose one and stick with it ;)
---
For one, the chance to fail goes away pretty early. It‚Äôs only really an issue on nodes you‚Äôre only just starting to gather, and even then only for 10 levels or so. 
---
For two, would you rather spend a vast majority of your gold on materials from the auction house to support 4 engineers (which I might add is probably the most expensive profession to train regardless) or 3-9 extra seconds of your time per node while questing?
---
Get mining.
---
I know what I said.  ;)
---
You can criticize things your SO likes. It's normal.
---
yeah, the price will increase now that more people have access to gold. It's been increasing over the last few days
---
People need to start understanding that they are not encyclopedia britannica/wikipedia. Knowing things others don't is great...that is as long as you know that information is factual and can be backed up. Otherwise that person(or persons) are no better than the idiots they mock.
---
Someone had a bad day.... Jeez.
---
was talking about the other guy but you're welcome
---
Yeah unless it was some sub 30 minute speed clear, I wouldn't ever use one on trash, just bosses.
---
RFD quest reward is where it's at
---
Had this happen to me. Fatigued in the barrens
---
Nope. Cheap
---
"Probably the most fun I've had so far in this game."
---
Good story!
---
and that was just a weeknight, wait till you play in the weekend. lol /jk partly, driving a point too, in that more happens in a night than happened in over a decade of fisher price clones, even wow (retail) turned into a fisher price clone of itself.
---
The drop from the Chest is common enough where eventually all the Priests will already have it or don't want to bother trying to farm/buy the Eye and try to do the event quest itself.
---
Unless it's still an early MC clear, the item is usually just rolled for between the Prs in the group.
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible:
---
What in fuck‚Äôs name are you spending your gold on?
---
Pretty sure /dnd does this automatically along with a lot of other neat stuff.
---
stfu with the stupid screenshot circle jerk bullshit. ffs
---
Burning Crusade or riot
---
I was meaning just watching a movie at home even. But yes definitely regarding going to the theaters especially. We haven't went to a movie in theaters since the Edge of Tomorrow release. I had to actually google "movie with famous actor and the day keeps restarting" just to find the name because I couldn't remember anything about it.
---
Criticizing does not equal fighting.
---
Or a priest. Priests laugh at your dots.
---
Links video that disproves his point. ‚ÄúUsed to box.‚Äù Get the fuck out of here with that shit.
---
If anything mob spawn rates are cranked up to 11. Shit is respawning mad fast if it's not a named mob
---
Would love to try to off tank myself wether it be druid or pally
---
I think you should consider guilding up and trying out the big raids.  They really are the best part of the game once you hit max level. Onyxia isn't even a big time commitment. Many guilds will split MC over a series of days until everyone's geared enough that it can be quickly farmed.  I haven't found a guild yet but I know there will be guilds out there which aren't too intense and can fit your schedule.  If all else fails, I'm hoping at some point some cross-guid raiding arrangements will arise like the Durotan Raid Consortium that I did a lot of MC runs with back in the day.
---
Git gud. 
---
&lt;3 
---
See you online
---
Will you stop mining if autoblock trades is on?
---
I think WOW Classic release has kinda exposed the fact that the only reason we used to CC and single target back in the day, was because we all just sucked at the game and played on toasters.
---
&gt; any gear that isnt mail/plate
---
Those are your words.  And again, *cloth gear* is BiS in some slots for holy, so you're wrong.
---
Tell me to read when you have no idea what you're saying you fucking goon.
---
\&gt; you'r  
---
yeesh
---
You are killing yourself if you really are only getting that much sleep. Chances of heart attack increase dramatically and overall lifespan decreases too. 
---
I barely have time to play wow too so I feel the frustration, but it isnt worth the decline in health and mental health. 
---
I hope it gets better man.
---
Stop talking to people who make you feel less for enjoying something. You don't need that negativity in your life.
---
I'd like to start out by mentioning that I picked up this game last weekend, but I haven't played WOW in about 9 years. Currently I am a level 17 human priest in PVP, but frankly I feel like I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. Are there good guilds to join or servers I should switch to actually learn what the heck I'm supposed to be doing?
---
Playing Alliance.
---
Baron is also not a good fight for warriors.
---
How tf do you find a saving sharpbeak and ancient egg group in that time
---
Yes! For 12 years of wow I was dps and in every other mmo I was dps. Decided to roll a prot pally and tanking has been so much fun! And when I don't feel like tanking, I can be healer too!
---
Druids are no where close to being garbage in PvE.  You don't know what you're talking about.
---
In my server nobody uses /lfg. They all use /LookingForGroup which is a global channel.
---
We had a warlocks voidwalker go in to take the first sleep ( hunter pet would work also)
---
After that I just went bear until the tank got unslept.  ( I was healing as resto)
---
If its red its dead! No loyalty!
---
All it takes is 1 or 2 downvotes for all the sheep to follow suit.
---
I see what you're saying. I guess he just wanted to be a nice guy.
---
Its been really bad since Cataclysm. They had an entire zone dedicated to Indiana Jones references. Then they turned redridge into a giant Rambo reference... ugh. It's really immersion breaking imo.
---
For spammable wanding:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /castsequence reset=2 !Shoot, null
---
I haven‚Äôt experienced the second thing you stated, but maybe you could just make macros with /stopattack before each spell.
---
I will always include BC and Wrath in my definition of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, so if we could get those and *then* some new content built with the classic mentality, that would be amazing. I know that everyone doesn‚Äôt agree with this, but I feel like Wrath is where WoW really hit it‚Äôs stride, especially in terms of overall quality of life and mechanics. 
---
Cataclysm ended classic as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It would be interesting to see a Classic + presented as an alternate timeline where the cataclysm never happened.
---
Followed by "You must be good at other stuff, too... Meet me for chicken and sex?"
---
The first time turned my stomach ha
---
I did the exact opposite.
---
Okey, anywhere you can fish then. Since you still get skill up no matter if the place require 0skill or 150skill.
---
You can use proxies to approximate the impact; for example you can look at site traffic to .io from aggregation sites in like June vs August and see their traffic dropped by about half.  You can look at items that are staples of trade in the auctionhouse, and see how their prices plummeted from all the people trying to amass gold to buy wow tokens (a lot of highly traded items dropped 40-60% in price from everyone putting them up for sale).
---
Etc.
---
I love this quest chain, got my sword of mastery the other day!
---
This is a macro that I use, it prevents auto-canceling wand when pressed repeatedly.
---
As for a wand canceling macro, this isn't entirely possible because each shot incurs the global cooldown, but I suggest getting the Weapon Swing Timer addon to easily monitor the grace periods inbetween.
---
It doesn't keep you from going afk though :/
---
He's not saying it will release it 6 months
---
Some times it seems like my heals just flat out don‚Äôt heal.  Like I‚Äôll cast a fully max rank healing touch and it doesn‚Äôt increase the healee‚Äôs health.   Happens sporadically and rarely, but drives me insane when it does.  Can‚Äôt reliably reproduce it, so hard to pin down what exactly is happening.
---
That was definitely a bot. You can tell by the shocks and that he never deviated from a straight path
---
BROWN HORSE GANG!
---
That‚Äôs 30 hps if it‚Äôs healing everyone. That‚Äôs like 10% or more of the hps I pull on most trash in ubrs as a holy priest. Seems like a pretty beefy heal for 70 mana if you‚Äôre not worried about giving other casters mana totem.
---
My two rogue buddies and I took over Splintertree for a good hour last night. They were hiding in the inn and I had slowfalled on to the roof of the inn. I would give them the fear of God and they would run in to the Inn thinking it was the only safe place from my spells. Unfortunately for them my two rogue fwiends were hidden inside, it was a slaughter.
---
Eight lives remaining.
---
So it becomes even more important for the people on the unbalanced faction side, to support each other.
---
And more to the point, do you feel more catharsis from posting here about this issue, than posting on your server discord? Or your server Reddit? Or your server public chat?
---
Have you blocked those specific people in chat whose mean-spirited comments prompted your post here?
---
It's unfair to say "just don't care about them", because we're always gonna put some energy into "caring" or "being frustrated" and "letting everybody know".
---
But I found it takes up much less energy to keep those things relegated to your specific server. All unbalanced servers have this problem. Don't spend more energy on it than you have to, because it will detract from your game experience.
---
It's 80 for zerk/battle and 130 for def. So it's 62.5% more threat. Stop being a bad warrior.
---
You want to be a pvp god sportin' rank 14 like that warrior's got? Quit your job, who needs 40 grand when you got a shiny weapon that can two-shot Rag.
---
I like you. You're funny. You're also correct, which is even better.
---
I think the problem with Blizzard and wow which has been the issue for years is that they want to make WoW appeal to "everyone", thats why everything is accessible to everyone and all content has like 4 difficulties or fucking 30 or whatever with mythic +.
---
If they did classic that version of WoW could just appeal to a more hardcore audience and they wouldn't have their hands tied in the same way.
---
I mean that's cool but you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Classic/Vanilla is not, was not, and will never be the best version of WoW. It was less casual, less on rails, for CERTAIN.
---
It was always broken and it was always known that it was broken, in MYRIAD ways.
---
A) The game world literally was not finished, ever, until Cataclysm - and it still wasn't finished, the difference is they went back and literally redesigned the zones to act like they were finished. Hyjal, Gilneas, Quel'thelas, Twilight Highlands, Broken Isles, Ahn'Qiraj, Northrend, Quel'Denas, Zul'Gurub, Zul'Aman, Karazhan and all kinds of stuff was not in the game. I'm not talking about the content, I'm talking about literally just the land areas.
---
B ) SO MANY changes were made from beta to vanilla. Paladins are utter trash in Vanilla and continued to be utter trash until just after Classic 1.13, when TBC came out a couple of months later with 2.0.3.  They removed Crusader and Holy Strike for example and didn't add those back until later. Prot paladins are literally garbage right now. They can't hold aggro, just like they couldn't originally, but they also can't do anything else as prot so it's a useless spec.
---
That's called bad game design.
---
TBC didn't send *anything* "down the drain." If you actually played vanilla and you feel this way, there's something wrong with you, because TBC was definitely the high point of WoW.
---
Other than that, I completely agree. WoW Classic was an opportunity for them to remaster and release new vanilla content, and they have absolutely fucked that up.
---
Dal Rends are swords, though...
---
fast attack speed isnt all that good.  the overall dps is probably helping offset though
---
:3
---
Doesn't it have a bit SCT text notification? I always notice riposte and overpower popping up.
---
Never told you how to play classic. I did imply that you are over thinking it.
---
Are there QoL things like linked professions that would be awesome? Hell yeah! Will we get them? No because there are a lot of whiny asses that wanted to put a 4 cylinder in a Ferrari.
---
It‚Äôs about 3x faster on average, though you could probably hit 4-5x if you never squad wipe and have same group ready so no need to look for more, and people rotate their skills fast also adds up quite a bit.  
---
It‚Äôs actually insane the XP rates you can get in a group of 4 mages who are sync‚Äôd up. But I also hate it cuz everyone rages at every small thing and lots of ego in 1 little group.
---
Anyone got any addon/weakauras that can show me what stance i am in, as a warrior?
---
Or the Icon of the weapon im currently equipping, sometimes I get confused by weaponswapping, and not instantly knowing if i sucessfully swapped etc
---
It also doesn‚Äôt really matter if I kick him since the dungeon is over and he already got the loot.
---
PRINT SCREEN
---
It's not that hard
---
I think you're joining the wrong channel if no one is using it. If you're unsure, go into Chat Settings and manually join that way, rather than typing /join. But the LookingForGroup channel is how I find practically all my dungeon groups, and I can't remember the last time it took me longer than 10-15 minutes to find a group. Admittedly I'm playing a tank, so I can dictate the dungeon pace, but I think this trend holds true for a lot of groups.
---
It's a really nice article, but I don't think it applies to WPvP. Most of the points here apply to zero-sum games only, which applies to instanced PvP but definitely not WPvP. Most of the "unspoken honor rules" are generally not about playing "fairly" or "for fun", they're about cooperation and truces when it benefits both sides.
---
I'm a bit confused. Maybe other people are confused too? I always thought that rested xp was to help you catch up when you haven't played in a while. I didn't think that it was worth it to just sit there gaining 0xp/hour just so you can get double kill xp for a couple kills? That doesn't even add up, you'd be better off just killing shit instead of doing nothing.
---
He was talking about retail
---
Latee
---
Sale on Cap'n Crackers. Does he work in Classic Wow or is he retail only? I  Googled around, nothing I could find was definitive.
---
Paladin healing ans scaling goes down somewhat as the tiers will go on.  The absence of different forms of healing rather than flash and holy light starts to become more apparent with fights with more large area bursts.  They also start to get outclasses more by priests as priests are able to get more spirit.  The low cost of flash is great for spamming, but it is still capped in output by a low coefficient and it's cast time.  Flash heal vs Flash of light if the same cast time, but Flash is about double the healing done.
---
We might fight for victory!
---
Probably because you are powerleveling rather than enjoy the ride.
---
Is there an add on that shows you how long your spells‚Äôs DoT lasts?
---
Example: I want a counter when I cast Serpent Sting on an enemy, something that looks like the setup on retail.
---
The best thing is healing sunken temple, who will get aggro next? Can the warrior wearing level 30 mail survive more than 2 hits? Can the huntard finally work out that the sleep effect is undispellable?
---
Yes that‚Äôs exactly what I meant. Ret is still shit but it‚Äôs not fair to compare them to mages vs Baron. I just wanted to clear up that distinction for anybody else who sees it.
---
It's a pretty big ask to make a 'classic-scaled' TBC version.
---
It's not just copying a bunch of shit that was already figured out, but that would be a radical rebalancing of everything from player and monster abilities to every single piece of gear (TBC began the +STAM inflation curve in a crazy way).
---
I'd love it too, I wanted it the first time we played TBC (this would have been more fun along the same power curve as vanilla) but it's a HUGE task.
---
It'll even out over time I think -- there's really no very easy means of making money through professions unless you plan on sitting in town all day or get a pattern that people aren't taking advantage of yet.  I would just focus on doing it while you level, then decide later on what you want to do for end game.
---
That‚Äôs why I keep saying they should release BC, then Wrath, and *then* give us new content in that framework.
---
No. I use a gun just because my dwarf racial gives me an added gun skill, but I see people using both guns and bows pretty regularly.
---
Fun fact - memories that are important to us and emotional tend to be remembered more vividly. There is actual research to back this up. It is why so many people remember certain things in great detail like where they were on 9/11 or what they were wearing the first time they met their spouse.
---
Accidently started a war at ZF. Stalagg is 30% alliance and most dungeons are camped by gangs if hordes. Me and some friends were grinding and during a rest we got outside ZF and we‚Äôre alone so we killed the first couple horde on their way in or coming out. Then all of a sudden 30-40 horde poured out of the dungeon and destroyed the 5 of us. Was of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I think we emptied zf
---
Hope you get him ragelord
---
Why? It‚Äôs essentially the same as AV. I‚Äôll guarantee it would be popular for 2 weeks then die out.
---
Why not both? Most naysayers said Classic would never happen either. Blizzard aren't just a faceless corporation who only care about profits. They do actually care about creating a great game for people to play, they just lost their way in retail
---
Yeah I'm doing the same thing but I'm having second thoughts. Like will I even be playing the game when phase 3 comes out? Kinda want the money for an epic mount. Maybe I can resell them at a higher amount in the near future
---
Just remember that your hobby is still infinitely better then many (if not most) of theirs. Why feel shame for picking the better option?
---
What qualifies as a proper tank to you? I‚Äôm a 35 warrior who is arms spec but tank whenever I can. My challenge recently is I don‚Äôt have a strong enough 1h wep to hold aggro vs other players my level. Do you just want tanks to be able to sword and board with prot talents or am I doing the ‚Äòright‚Äô thing?
---
A similar thing happened to me after a party of questing orcs kept killing me while I was helping a friend with a quest.
---
On the way back to town, there wasn't a single horde spared. I actually feel kind of bad.
---
If you and your tank have good synergy it can be incredibly fast to 2h tank. From smgy through ZF my shaman healer and I have been very successful. The main benefit is insurmountable threat and becoming a literal dps god. In graveyard with 3-5 man pulls (4 is the sweet spot) I was doing 500 peak dps, 200 sustained.
---
It does still pull aggro if you miss, yes. However, you end up with a surprisingly high gun/bow skill just from doing pulls. My guns is currently at \~180 on my warrior just from shooting once per pull in tightly packed dungeons like Ulda'man.
---
I agree with the summoning to instances and flying 100%, but there were plenty of small QoL changes as small as movement and buggy spells etc. It was just a better overall game with less buggy things happening. Flying IMO was the worse decision they have made in WoW, shrinks the world way to much. Flight points were good enough.
---
Hey man.
---
That's an everlasting artist dilemma. You'll never consider yourself good enough to say to yourself "Yep, I'm good. I'm gonna stay right here."
---
Believe it or not, as an artist you get better by "stealing" . "Stealing" , not "plagiarizing" . You steal bits and pieces from this artist and that artist and this other artist. And when all those influences come together something called "your own style" is born.
---
And influences are everywhere. Our tastes constantly change and evolve and we are constantly influenced by other artist. And so, we keep on changing and evolving our style.
---
You should always be proud of your work. But never be so proud as to say "Yep, I'm good. I'm gonna stay right here."
---
 Uhm, some thing tells me I went a bit over the question with this answer. xD
---
A combination of the drop rate and that area being farmed out by other people attempting the same quest.
---
Add to that the stupid debuff that randomly stuns you for 5 seconds. There is nothing more aggravating that looking around for a spawn, finally seeing one, running to it, only to get stunned and have someone else roll up and tag it.
---
Fuck that quest.
---
&gt;The default is need before greed
---
Says who lol
---
I feel like you need to explain this name.  I get the reference but what do dwarves have to do with it?  Especially as a horde character how is this applicable?
---
Dungeons.
---
Big zones are better for immersion and small zones are better for gameplay. I'm actually glad they've got both.
---
They can?
---
No the point is that ‚Äúrelative ease or difficulty of leveling‚Äù per class is based on solo play
---
It's both.
---
mages always top meters
---
melee always subject to hazards and things that limit dps due to melee range too in raids
---
also cleave dmg on 3-4 mobs is not the same as single target dps
---
Why is it always a gnome warlock?
---
This is the big thing people are going to figure out about MC especially.  If you have about 20 competent people you can do the instance.  The other 20 are there to make it go faster.
---
If this happens I'll usually jump in the mobs, Frost Nova around the tank, then blink back to a safe location and let the tank take aggro again.
---
Still kinda no. Some places require higher skill, but even if you are able to fish there you will most likely get no fish which in turn give no fishing skill. It is best to find skill apropriate zones and use lures to give a better chance of getting the fish.
---
Slow or fast weapons as ret pally?   I like fast for solo and slow for two pallys multiboxed.
---
I love this, explaining to new players with super clear instructions so they CAN'T misunderstand what your trying to say haha.. Reminds me of my buddies teaching me how things were in wotlk/cata
---
**LOUD AND CLEAR GUYS**
---
Don't get invested
---
Noone knows.
---
It's just the Dread Mage Hat that made that had the right amount of armor to make this
---
Not gonna lie, a new joiner and wow noob here. Had fun though, which is important :)
---
Very doubtful that it will just be "classic forever" stuck at patch 1.12 for years with no new content. I don't see that happening one bit, so don't worry and play the game.
---
No one knows.
---
if you're going by memory than it makes sense you'd think that, people in original vanilla didn't understand the value of manual crowd pummeler and still used feral attack power weapons and such.
---
"the concept of a tank is fading for many people and healing therefor got harder. But in SF things became miserable. Everyone expects the cleave. Everyone has aggro. Everyone is made of paper, so it costs huge amounts of mana to heal them"
---
Sounds like there's a lot of stupid people out there.
---
Hint (to them, not you): there's a reason you have a fucking tank role.  It's not academic.  THIS ISN'T RETAIL.
---
&gt; But what are the benefits? 
---
I used to do this a decade ago. The main benefit I saw was maybe stopping someone of the opposite faction from leveling. This would mean less competition down the line as the opposite faction would have smaller numbers. 
---
Now that I've played on both a Horde and Alliance heavy realm as both the majority and minority, I want the competition. Running around with nothing but green is boring. Running around with nothing but red is tiresome.
---
Big L rest in peace

Can't believe I forgot that, my 4th year prof worked specifically on reducing VR motion sickness

With a great, coordinated group you can do it in 45 minutes.
---
Absolutely.
---
Oh, that's hilarious if we're on the same server and both sides are complaining that the other side dominates the population. Shows how balanced the server is.
---
I'm glad my weapon is like 2.9 speed, arrows deplete fast enough as it is. 1.6 would be painful, and gives you less time for repositioning
---
back when classic first came out - i was in grade school still. I played soccer very competitively but when practice and games were not happening i lived in SWG and then WoW. No one IRL knew about that part of me, especially the soccer team.. I felt it would change their look of me, fear of how it would be received....  
---
Today? I just simply dont care if they accept me or not. This is what i enjoy and if they dont accept it then we probably were never going to be good friends anyways.
---
My thought exactly. Only a list with screenshots as proof would do.
---
The Fury pre raid bis is like half leather
---
Depends on how many names Asmon reserved.  If someone grabbed Olympus VII when Asmon made I and II, there's not much Asmon can do about it.  Blizzard won't force a name change due to similarity, especially if Olympus VII was made prior to Olympus V and VI
---
Same, I was surprised how good the margins were on my server as they were still selling for 30s-40s profit, so it was an easy way to skill up.  I think when I made 7 bags in a row without a skill up I decided I better move on to something else (making money or not).  Just an eyesore for me to not be at 300 even though it's not like I can make anything worthwhile from it yet.
---
Yeah I just noticed it! It's the small details that makes this game great
---
Doing quests that required long-distance travel. 
---
As a 7-year-old I managed to make it to the hinterlands mostly mob grinding and getting carried through dungeons by my dad and his friends. Then I died, got stuck in a hillside while in ghost form, and deleted my character.

In general, stay in defensive stance to reduce damage taken. Mostly though, keeping aggro is the most important. So use charge in battle stance to gain rage, use Bloodrage to get additional rage so you can use abilities and keep aggro. Also swap to Berserker stance and whirlwind as it keeps aggro on up to 4 targets, which is great. Dont stay in Berserker Stance for long though. Use Berserker rage too as it will give you a lot of rage. This is assuming that you have Tactical Mastery from the Arms tree.
---
I've tanked with a 2H weapon up to lvl 53 so far with the above tactic and it's been fine.
---
So aggro/threat &gt; defenses, depending on your healer of course.
---
A good initiator I like to do is Battl Stance -&gt; Charge -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Berserker Rage (if its off cd) -&gt; defensive stance and start tab-sundering.
---
(tab sundering is just using a sunder on a target, then using the tab button to target the next mob and sunder on that etc.)
---
If you pull 4+ mobs, use Demo Shout as well.
---
If there are enraging monsters with weapons, Disarm can save you a lot of health.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
I'm proud to play this game since 11 years, because i know it brings me joy and I love the other players who play the game.
---
So I tend to be open about being a gamer, because I don't care about what they think of that, because I know I'm having fun with it.
---
I hope you understand and it is helpful. Not native English speakers. Love wow.
---
The only sadness of my post is that I mentioned that he has no life.  Literally this is all he does.... What a life.
---
Having a personal opinion about an addon = losing my mind LOL
---
People say its BiS but it's more accurate to consider it a consumable. There are better weapons for day to day use, But the active effect makes it insane during a raid fight.
---
Anyone have an idea of which leveling guide addons have the best/fastest routes? I'm not interested in lectures on how people think that's not how classic is meant to be. I have limited time to play and just want to level up quickly. I know Joanas guide is probably the best but i have no interest in reading through steps and checking check boxes either.
---
Considering the last guy to do it ended up in prison, I really don't know why would try to do it to Blizzard again if they're somewhere the law enforcement won't care about it.
---
Yeah I second this. Though it wasn't arround for vanilla so.... #nochanges!
---
I would agree that druid tanks were disliked and there is a stigma. 
---
But I'd recommend people read this before coming to conclusions...

Hey m8. I'm also using Tukui. How do you enable the mana amount in your unitframe? I can only see the bar but haven't found where to enable the numbers in it. Appreciate any help.
---
I have a personal list
---
A couple of Ally camped me - they went on the list to be camped
---
A couple of Ally ganked me while I was in combat - I will return the favor eventually
---
A couple of ?? ally killed me - I just want to be able to gank them when Im 60
---
A horde warrior grouped with me and a few others on an elite quest, the second he was done (we are still in combat) he leaves group - I dont want to be in his group again so hes on the list and ignored. 
---
A horde rogue ninjaed some shoulders - ninja so dont want to group
---
A horde mage refused to group for quest and was pretty greedy with quest mobs - on list so I can run in and fuck up his aoe farm if I see him in the future. HOWL OF TERROR BITCH
---
Thats off the top of my head. Really it dosnt take much to get on my list but its not like im hunting these people. I also dont camp...unless camped.
---
Any warrior that has half clue knows what youre saying is nonsense. Unless you have a group that marks every pack for kill order and cc, gives the tank sufficient time to build agro, and perfectly focuses fire. Then your idea works. 90%+ of sub 60 groups dont work like that and reduce any warrior following your advice to being absolutely useless except for the short period taunt redirects agro to them before quickly being taken again. Youre clueless bud.
---
You definitely aren't going to be able to 5g/30min by cluing people into this.
---
AoE threat is tough and the blame is usually on the dps when it comes to losing aggro, assuming you are doing everything correctly.
---
I just wish the punishment for the crime was not jail time. 
---
Instead, it should be having a professional football/soccer player kick a ball, as hard as humanly possibly, directly into the daddy bags, from 5 feet away. 
---
It should of course, be posted to YouTube so we can all see justice served and act as a warning to anyone else. 
---
Seriously, DDOS would be a thing of the past...
---
2h fury is fun too tbh. I think I like that more than arms when I did my warrior personally. But ive seen better warriors go arms so up to you.
---
That wont change really. The only ones that will beat them are mages that get the ignite dot in Naxx. I really don't even count that because 1 mage is crazy high on the meters after the ignite being fed by other mages.
---
What's worse? Cutting a spec off for one raid or for an entire expansion?
---
Use your brain.
---
There's battlenet in 2005?
---
Jokes aside, I agree. And I suppose it would be irrational to suggest deleting all your bnet friends.
---
I must be the weird one, I prefer Durotar to Trifistal Glades.
---
I‚Äôm undead, I don‚Äôt have a heart, how can it be weak or whatever
---
I have more keybinds than I can use in Classic lol. Shift+every letter on the left half of the keyboard.
---
That‚Äôs cool, I had no idea. Yeah this would be a nice kitty staff then!
---
Mara staff is pretty good too. 45 dps iirc, 3.8 speed, also has Hp5
---
They are already blaming video games for mass shootings, could ya dial it down to about 11..
---
PvP servers are more popular so they need more of them to make the queues manageable
---
Bake em away toys
---
Yep like I thought an angry neckbeard just looking to get offended towards someone they don't like.
---
GG
---
Yes!!
---
Yeah that'd be cool if another 60 didn't just come right after, or another 20 horde. It gets to a point where you want to actually level up.
---
Made my first ever character on my friends dad's account a NELF warrior that I only got to 12. I remade him and hes almost 30! So happy I get to relive and give em a second chance at life! :P
---
He could have easily been a 60, even 5 30s can be a big challenge to a geared 60 depending on the class. As a warlock if I get stunned and have 5 30s beating on me I could easily go down if I don‚Äôt have a voidwalker/healthstone/health pot. And even if I have those things if they have a healer I likely just don‚Äôt have the mana to take them down unless I just global them instantly.
---
True
---
they boomed him
---
You can disable the bells/alerts/popups/chat notifications in the settings for all of those scenarios if you just want an ingame list.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I find that so boring. I know I‚Äôd love that dps chest but I can‚Äôt be assed tbh to farm just arena.
---
I think his point is that some classes are definitely prefered if you want to grind dungeons while leveling. 
---
Mages, Shamans, Priests, Warlocks (as soon as they get hellfire) and Warriors are all classes that have an easy time finding and doing dungeons because of their AoE.
---
Was this on Mograine? I experienced almost exactly a similar thing and I remember the 58 Priest.
---
So the people saying I can't spec into shadow from beginning are wrong? It's just if I do that I need to use the proper build?
---
Don‚Äôt kill big l :(
---
for hemo? never dagger.  You  get a much higher attack power multiplier on swords/fists/maces with hemo than  with daggers.
---
as for pvp, you basically are going to have to get the drop on people  if you want to win.  Its very difficult to pull  off if they get the drop on you
---
This totally sounds like my friend, u/CraigSmithh. Did this happen on Ten Storms?
---
Unless you‚Äôre doing 40 man MCs often enough that you‚Äôll have it in 6 months
---
I'm in tears laughing at this, you just deleted someone from the game üòÇ
---
Squash your crack!
---
Maybe they already had a rogue. I meen not every one is polite in declining you.
---
We did it Reddit.
---
Probably because blizzard knows there's a disproportionate amount of people who prefer pvp servers
---
runecloth bags are cheap (2-3g) cause every uses them to lv tailoring. the recipe is like 50g though
---
Turns out you are actually the obtuse one.
---
It took some figuring out and I died a bit. You want crippling poison on one wep to keep them from running very far when they‚Äôre low.
---
At 45 ish I was doing the armory chests instead. Enjoy :)
---
Could have been any reason, his level, they already had 2 rogues, his name, they became full. Who knows.
---
No it was stonespire :)
---
Support characters are the only the only way to play. I have a priest, warrior, and Druid.
---
As a Paladin healing cleave groups in ZF is fun af. It can be challenging but if they know what they‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs great. Chain pulling instead of over pulling is important and allowing me to drop combat to drink while they do a small pull they don‚Äôt need heals for helps a ton. We were doing zf zombies in about 16 minutes 45-50 3 warrior 1 rogue 1 holy pally
---
They always seem to be on their own and very rarely with 1-2 others.
---
What I am saying is: Generalizing something by saying "Horde has it easier on PVP Servers" does not really work. 
---
I have been struggling to get anything done on my Horde Toon for almost two weeks now as those zones are the only one that I have any quests in.
---
Nah, I'm there'll be no repercussions at all for attacking a billion dollar company's main product. None at all. Maybe a warning.
---
Also he was level 17, which is a little low.
---
There was likely already a rogue or hunter the group, and they didn't want to share loot drops.  
---
Myself as a tank I enjoy a good rogue in my group.
---
Windows+Shift+S, paste into fucking reddit, hit post button. Nah, better pull out my phone, take a picture, upload via app to reddit, ggez
---
Could already have a rogue or hunter going for defias gear and doesn't want competition. It's not a hard and fast rule that rogues aren't wanted in dungeons, don't worry about it too much.
---
Probably another rogue in the group wanting cruel barb etc
---
No this was on thunderfury
---
Are you left handed?
---
Every time you don't get any zhevra hooves, it's because a tauren rogue stole the hooves while you were fighting the mob.
---
Mages have worse scaling than melee and warlocks.
---
Welcome to being an adult.
---
I'm married, work full time and have a one year old. Thing to realize with work/life/game balance, is that game time is going to be limited.
---
I'm never going to be completing a World First, or have the best gear in the top Raiding guild. I'm a casual now, and play games for my own enjoyment. I don't get to spend 8+ hours playing games every Saturday or Sunday anymore.
---
Instead, I get a few hours a night. My kid goes to sleep between 7pm and 8pm. After some cleaning, and next day meal prep, I'm usually online between 8pm and 9pm. Then I'll play till 11pm -12pm.
---
So roughly 2-4 hours a night, if I'm lucky.
---
This is why I‚Äôm re-rolling to bear tank. I don‚Äôt have the time to be competitive with 1000 other mages, and I really was sad to find out I picked seemingly the most common class. My level 28 mage is just going to be an AH alt for now.
---
Vanilla, 14 years ago, and I dont remember it was so long ago.  Whatever was default back then, so probably nothing too involved, maybe perl frames.
---
I would personally continue to gather herbs until 60 then switch to Alch.
---
That's roughly what I thought as well. Thanks!
---
The only people leaving because they're tilted over pvp on a pvp server are immature cry babies. Mentally weak people. They're likely to be toxic anyway. Cut the cancer, the game is better without children and man babies surprised over pvp on pvp servers.
---
I've had some groups say rogue gets the money from the chest, but roll for all the items within, I'm pretty cool with that system, as they still get something out of it.
---
Wait so double swords for hemo then? Also yeah i always past by horde just omw to my next destination thinking they won‚Äôt jump me but they always do. I‚Äôm just gonna kill every horde player i see idc anymore
---
I would love to see Alchemy next
---
It‚Äôs not just horde. I play alliance and I‚Äôll spend time almost daily just killing lowbie horde in the name of making them quit to even out my server pop.
---
I have yet to log off past midnight.

I have savage gladiator chain at level 52 war :)

Once I've placed them on my actionbar button of choice, I just go into keybindings and set shift+1 or whatever button combo you want for that particular actionbar slot

I mean yea if we're going to state the obvious.
---
You also can't fish in sand, rocks, inside buildings, while flying and when you are offline. Hope this helps.
---
Personally, I love rogues in dungeons, I find they have high DPS and can open locked chests for us.
---
However, he might have been too low a level, he might have annoyed someone earlier in the game and was on a blacklist, the group might have wanted ranged dps, or someone might have wanted an item that rogues can roll for and they wanted to reduce competition.
---
There's stupid people playing every class.
---
What? I know that for a fact.
---
Imagine raiding MC without 8 mages
---
you aren't having threat problems, you are having a managing the dps party members problem.
---
I would suggest binding a hotkey to put the skull marker up on a target.  you should be able to keep agro off the healer with just one sunder on every mob, saving taunt for the kill target.
---
Some mechanics knowledge:
---
Sunder adds a large amount of threat, but wont instantly gain you agro if the other person already has too much threat.
---
Taunt doesn't add threat, it merely makes *your* threat equal to the greatest threat on that target.
---
I don't think that's right.
---
Just continue to spam out bags. Even with buying all the mats on the AH, im still making a nice profit of (as you said) 20-30s per bag.
---
This is where we as Warriors draw our true strength... from the hate and rage we build from trying to get to 60
---
You need to get an item off the second lass boss in Molten Core, and an item from either Lord Kazzak (Phase 2), or very strong demons in Winterspring. The second one you can buy, but it's very pricey and doesn't feel quite the same.
---
Pointing out that someone is getting an unfair advantage due to their monthly video game budget isn't even close to whining. I'm just saying that I think the practice is too close to botting to be allowed.
---
You are just salty that your "hobby" is being looked down upon.
---
Do these guides have an addon form?
---
thank you!
---
Not other people's fault though. I got screwed by two hunters yesterday and I have been the one giving them the benefit of the doubt.
---
I'm taking other classes from now on.
---
88 to 88. 52 to 52. 12 to 80 (OP). So, are u the person in game who claims everyone's a ninja too? The guy clearly won the roll.
---
Seriously, thank you again! I need to do some work if I'm looking to progress in raids as a hunter. It seems you know your stuff when it comes to hunters, any chance there is a UI mod that you recommend? Maybe I'll shop around icy-veins after work. Again, thank you son much!
---
Oh man. That periodic stun! Fck, I hate that! üòÇ
---
GET FUCKED NEEEEEEERD!

What's a healer to do besides heal? Tap away! Dead mobs dont do damage!

Can a Warlock name his pets? If so, how?

No man you just don‚Äôt know how words work. You taking the word opinion and putting it after negative doesn‚Äôt suddenly create a new thing. You are expressing [dissatisfaction.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complaint) Your initial comment to the OP is a complaint. Now you‚Äôre just arguing for the sake of needing to be right. It‚Äôs ok to have a disagreement with someone without disagreeing with everything thereafter. You‚Äôre purposely being obtuse and disingenuous at this point. If someone would have walked up to you this morning and said hey I have a negative opinion to express about how you parked your car, they are COMPLAINING about your bad parking job, even if they never said the word.
---
I hate to be that guy but it‚Äôs Battle For Azeroth not Bind on Account, so it‚Äôs BfA not BoA. :D
---
Illegal Danish was the shit back in the day. I still remember the first time I watched it and talking to my friends about it at school the next day.
---
Watching this again just now also triggered the memory of another of my favorite WoW Machinimas back in the day, Percula's "The Craft of War: Blind". I really miss the heart the community had back from Vanilla through BC/Wrath.
---
So, while I get that the game keeps you more involved than the tv show - if you are regularly staying up that late to game plus regularly falling asleep that fast when NOT gaming, I think that qualifies you as ‚Äúsleep deprived‚Äù. Maybe take a break. =)
---
Man is that your graphics or just the picture quality?
---
It is like I said before, if you are committing a felony then you will get caught.

Expect the favor to be returned one day.
---
Yo that drawing is dope!
---
Reminds me of a couple days ago where a raid of alliance players multiple of them 50-60 camping nessingwary for the whole evening and killing every horde in sight
---
&gt; I have hypersomnia. If I just sit and watch TV, I'm falling asleep. If I'm playing games, though, I'm good.
---
TIL I have hypersomnia. I have a problem where I start dozing at work when I'm not doing anything.

The wife of one of my close friends had ended her previous relationship because the guy was too obsessed with WoW. She broke it off when she found out he had been cheating on her with a woman he met from his guild.
---
This friend had never played WoW but our squad got him hooked on classic. His wife was hesitant when she realized what he was playing with us. She let him keep playing on one condition: He not wear headphones, so she can hear our discord conversations....
---
My first time was pretty great. My buddies didn't let me take too big a drag and when it finally hit. I was legit giggling my ass off. However, I grew up around cigarette smokers and learned how to smoke, young, way too young. Every bad first time I have seen or been a part of was folks applying long-term smoker logic to fresh lungs. Always ends badly.
---
I got into trouble in my own, later, when I tried stupid shit like clearing a 6foot bong in one go or just actively trying to get discombobulated.
---
Anyways, just a couple of small drags from a joint and patience enough to wait for the effects to set in.
---
Facts not feels. Fortunately I am on the facts side.
---
As a 17 mage they also said no...they ask lvl 18 +
---
did you really start crying?..
---
Yeah same, there‚Äôs also a significant level jump in the middle of silver pine
---
Ah so now that layering exploit video makes so much more sense.
---
The first eye was the most difficult - I haven't won many gear rolls since the start of classic, and I had to win against 2 other priests. ;) 
---
The second wasn't too difficult, we got two eyes farming with 12 of us in about 30 minutes of farming. We might have been lucky though. The actual quest I failed once without using consumables, just to see how hard it actually was. Once I used some mp5 food, a mana potion, and some oils of immolation, it wasn't too bad. Still stressful though :P
---
Feel you, bro. Warrior here, as well. More than 60 kills for 16 horns. üòÇ
---
Well you‚Äôre also the only one having feelings about this so
---
&gt; ClassicAuraDurations 
---
Ah, thanks very much for tell me me about that =D
---
A warlock running anything except a phased imp in a dungeon?  I bet that tank is happy to lose all that HP &gt;.&gt;.
---
I'm sorry, Arthas. I can't sit here and watch you disenchant this.
---
I mean, i‚Äôm not a multiboxer - if anything i‚Äôm a very big fan of botting which is why I felt obliged to point out you are wrong..
---
And I don‚Äôt expect people to advocate me botting but guess what? the money is worth it.
---
You cannot. I haven't played a warlock in a long time but i believe in vanilla everytime you summoned a demon its name is different. 
---
Lore wise you dont really have a pet you are summoning a random demon from the nether and binding it to do your will.
---
The more versions of the game they have to maintain, the more work they'll have to put into maintaining it. This will inevitably lower the quality of their work. They'd much rather keep it all the same, but that's just the reality of the software industry.
---
There are a lot of opinions on warrior tanking, but I'll share some random bits of information:
---
\- Mark a skull on every pull, it helps keep the DPS focused.
---
\- Your default stance is defensive, but you shouldn't really think of warriors as having stances, really. Macro all your abilities to switch stance automatically and use whatever ability you need. So if you need to disarm a target, you hit disarm. This changes your stance to battle, but you don't have to think about that. After you do, hit your keybind for revenge or shield block and switch back to defensive automatically.
---
\- If memory serves, revenge is your highest single target threat, followed by sunder, followed by heroic strike distantly. For AoE threat I like to start my pull with a charge &gt; thunder clap combo, and spam demo shout or battle shout after that. (Demo shout's threat was reduced, but is still good for keeping adds off the healer).
---
azeroth autopilot is a decent addon, as is questie.
---
autopilot points you in the way you should head, tells you what to do and in what order.. and tracks your waypoints.  It also in a very quick fashion, accepts and turns in quests for you when you interact with the quest target.  That being said, there are some bugs to it.   1) you kind of need to use its waypoints and order, not your own otherwise, it doesn't necessarily recognize you as having done that... so you'll have to skip it ahead manually.  2) the way it turns in quests, sometimes interferes with accepting quests.  so in order to turn one in, you might have to accept a new one first...  overall though, 8/10 would recommend.
---
Also... I enjoy the story but want to level in an efficient, orderly manner with as little downtime as needed(regardless of class).  I also much prefer to level with people and not solo.   If this type of mentality seems to work with you, send me a message, maybe we can set up specific times/dates to level together.
---
I just assumed it was classic, and not every mob drops something every time. Especially happened in the 1-10 zones.
---
the story of broxigar
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7fo2LR9PoY
---
Arcane shot is a high threat ability and hunters like to spam it on cooldown for some reason...
---
I've only heard of this happening if someone is using a looting app. Haven't seen it myself but I haven't used ffa much either. Seems worth submitting a bug report though. Good luck, friend!
---
Made 50g without lying and deceiving a guild and making off with there gbank!
---
No print screen, no keybinds. -1
---
Many thanks! üòÑ
---
Imagine not understanding blatant sarcasm, and then assuming the other person is stupid. What an interesting world you must live in
---
They should force him to play Battle for Azeroth for a few years. That'll teach him.
---
I've started smoking a lot more since playing classic, I'm up to 40 a day now. It's too easy to get thru a pack or two whilst chilling. Any tips to cut back?
---
Nah it‚Äôs not hard.
---
Yeah I only remember that it was in theory farmable but you gotta sell your soul in order to get it since the drop rate is so low
---
The female orgasm is real. I've seen it many times in videos.
---
Dude. Ring definitely hated me on that quest! Started partying with a priest at one point, I had 7 and they had 3. They still beat me to 16 horns ._. as if warrior solo isn't hard enough lol
---
Funny how well he can draw but his handwritings still horrible
---
Yep! That's your best bet good luck! Be sure to make friends as you go along. You might find people to quest with to speed things along.
---
Came here to say this.
---
As a fellow Shaman I am sad to see that the non water breathing classes are finding out about this method.
---
Literally all it takes is 2 other people per layer doing this makes it a waste of time for someone to farm this way.
---
Good catch!!
---
I have the atlas and the dungeon guide and I refer to them both on the regular.
---
IcyVeins and Classic WoWHead both have Macro Sections in their warrior tanking guides.
---
The best advice I can give is don't be intimidated by them.  Some of the most important ones are Mouse Over Taunt macro so you can taunt without having to change targets, making sure you have /startattack on your offensive abilities (that way if you click them when you are rage starved or out of range, etc you will being auto-attacking) and then also ones that put you into the stances that require that ability (assuming you are spec'ed into tactical mastery, which you should be)
---
Also, welcome to the world of tanking, be prepared to be critiqued on how you are doing by people who A) don't know what they are talking about B) Haven't tanked themselves C) are insecure about their own shortcomings.

The coolest things -to experience- was the Uldum spot in Tanaris, the Discs of Norgannon in Uldaman, and anything else involving Bran Bronzebeard and the titans.

It's a joke, and the screenshot wasn't even by the person who won the roll.

D.B. Cooper wasn't caught.
---
Always thought this game would be amusing if there was a hardcore mode like Diablo has.
---
I've said this in a few other places, but BRD is not only fucking bonkers compared to current WoW dungeons, but is also a really good example of the way the game's changed as a whole.
---
BRD: Multiple paths, murky objectives, requires exploration, deaths, experimentation to finish, not to mention hours of work (much worse if its your first time). Be prepared to commit an entire night to your play session.
---
Current instances: A to B to C, done in twenty minutes. Straight line, no exploration, no sense of wonder, nothing surprising aside from figuring out boss mechanics. Meant to be repeated a dozen times in a play session.
---
Which, as I said, represents the entire retail gaming experience.
---
I bought the Dark Iron Ore for my Warlock Quest pretty cheap already.
---
No. No they cannot. If it's on a trinket or other piece of gear, sure, but your weapons in feral are your paws, and those don't have any chance on hit enhancements.
---
Triple 6 be my language!
---
I have to agree with you. Generally the warriors I've had tanking are of two flavors. Old school prot tanks who survive and dungeon goes slower, or the dps warrior who decided to "lol tank cause insta queue". 
---
If I had one who was doing it seriously it may change my opinion. 
---
Ty for discussing rationally. I may have let my emotions run a bit wild in my post.
---
elvui
---
My favorite storylines are those who have a fall from grace. I also love those who rise above what they've become.
---
Arthas is one of my favorite characters. A fallen paladin prince who was seduced by forces from beyond his comprehension. His slow descent into insanity was great to watch from a first-person point of view.
---
I also like Maiev. A Warden whose hunt became so ingrained into her being that her existence loses meaning without it.
---
I used to like Sylvanas. Until WoD.
---
This subreddit is becoming more and more of a boomer subreddit

oof
---
Gotta say.....The WW axe is really sweet.... BUT....it is over-hyped. It is certainly awesome and a must get, but a lot of people claimed it made you "godly" if you get it in your early 30s. At 34 I switched from DW 2 weaps I have had since lvl 20, to the WW Axe and it certainly is an upgrade and crits big sometimes, but I would hardly call it godly.
---
Like I said in the post, I am sure there are things which are harder now. At the time, the encounter was hard. I was not running any addons with the exception of CT Raid assist. Average game play has also gotten better as it progresses in every game that has been out for some time. I think I was successful compared to other priests at the time mostly because I was heavy into the discipline tree and did not shun items with spirit which allowed me enough mana regen in combat to succeed over the course of the protracted fight. Also, we often engaged in large scale world PvP so I was used to being responsible for many many people in a chaotic environment.
---
To much chatty not enough attacky
---
Ah yes, I was more relating it to kidney shot, as it is a combo point based, and yes incapacitate, so damage can break it.
---
Yeah, I remain skeptical.  I have seen a bunch of Bigfoot videos and also never ran into one in real life.....
---
Dungeons is the right answer:) and when/if there aren't more upgrades for you there switch to prot/holy and go heal some raids:)
---
&gt;Myself as a tank I enjoy a good rogue in my group.
---
As long as they don't Cheap Shot the main lol target, that shit pisses me off.

You are underestimating engineering.  It provides much more than a small advantage.  Grenades alone are a ranged 3 sec stun on a 1min cd.  You also have jumper cables, rocket boots, rocket helm, death ray, reflector trinkets, mind control cap...
---
not anytime soon, if ever
---
Its funny. Says "may". Also a Curse of Recklessness will cause them to run back. üòè
---
Haven‚Äôt had this problem by biggest issue neglecting professions to level.
---
Thank you for the response and details! Ill try this out for sure
---
Shadow spec from the beginning is just not as efficient as holy until 40s but the difference is not much. Many people don‚Äôt even agree that shadow is slower. Majority of priests level as shadow from the beginning so you‚Äôre not doing anything unique. I almost always prefer to level in the spec that I want to play at endgame so I‚Äôll recommend shadow for you. 
---
You‚Äôll be able to heal fine up to 50s. Then it‚Äôs still possible, but it depends on the group you‚Äôre running with. I would suggest going in as dps from that point.
---
They gonna send him to Australia?

In my opinion, who the fuck cares. If guys wanna marry guys and women wanna marry women, then why not? It literally does not touch or effect me in any way. People that believe that is immoral need to mind their own business. I would hope that in AMERICA, where Blizzard is located, people would be FREE to do as they please as long as no one is harmed. If someone wants to just have fun slapping each other with frozen fish then let them.
---
As a general rule, hunters absolutely do not need statless weapons as their by far biggest damage comes from their bows/guns, not their rarely used sword.
---
Been spamming brd a lot and have had a couple shadow healers who had no issues.
---
Layer switching being *exploitable* means it can be used for exploits. The post avoids naming any *specific* layer switching behavior as an exploit, leaving it up to interpretation.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. I appreciate it.
---
Welcome to a PvP server
---
Lol it doesn't work like that. For example, Wristguards of Stability is leather, but if a rogue wanted it I'd laugh at him
---
Jesus Christ. The number of people in this thread fixated on the wife/GF hating your gaming hobby is ridiculous.
---
My GF enjoys entertainment that I think is really stupid, she thinks my gaming is childish, but seeing as we are grown ass adults we somehow manage to disagree on those things and still love each other.
---
I see a Parks and Rec meme, I upvote! That simple.
---
I don't think it's cheating I just think it is diluting the game for people who just want to play it "out of the box" so to speak. It is not in the spirit of the game and that doesn't mean anything to boxers because they are number crunching min-maxer extra types and I'm just a guy who wants a role playing game.
---
Does killing yourself from engineering mishaps cause gear durability loss?
---
azerty it's the french one
---
OK, I couldn't decide between 2% per point less damage taken while leveling or a bit more threat and unhindered stealthing to quest objectives or dungeon bosses solo.
---
Word this sounds fun
---
Here's a sword, body pierce with this . . . oh wait wrong song.

DUDE BRAN BRONZEBEARD. When he flys away in his little helicopter i was LOVING that ahaha. I wonder if there is extensive lore about that dude in a book or something...
---
Or wait the helicopter guy was the indiana jones dude I think im wrong.
---
I would love to have seen his reaction having the police show up at his doorstep. 
---
He was all smiley faces on Twitter. Bet he has one big
---
:( now
---
Most bosses in these dungeons have like 1-2 blue drops and that's it, there really aren't enough options at this level. In this specific instance, if anything the belt is suited way more for the druid than the locks, as agility does very little for casters (yes yes wanding).
---
Who do you want healing you, a shammy / druid / paladin wearing some cloth pieces with amazing stats, or the same guy healing you wearing strength / stamina armor...
---
In my experience, most assholes in this game are irredeemable assholes and not worth talking to. Better to troll these kinds of people then never deal with them again.
---
I'm not a fucking saint anyway.
---
I am not a warrior, but I believe your weapon abilities scale off your weapon damage. So the slower the weapon the higher your abilities will hit.
---
As well, there are a number of abilities which I believe will reset your auto, which is great with a slow, hard hitting weapon.
---
&gt;she sees my gaming as an unfortunate aspect of my character
---
This is really unfortunate. I don't think partners have to necessarily share interests, they can do their interests while you do yours, but to see your interest and hobby as a negative is so fucking sad. 
---
&gt;when I tell them I‚Äôm into gaming, and I can see visible dissapointment on their faces
---
This makes me wonder what age group you, and them fall into? This is such an old fashioned idea that I thought had pretty much died out with gaming being so much more mainstream now.
---
I wonder it is they want to hear when they ask about your hobbies. If you said you read, would they be ok with that? And presumably when they are, well what difference does it make if you spend your spare time reading or playing a game, it's just entertainment.
---
Only at this stage of the game.  Epics are easy at level 60
---
Threat generated from battle shout scales based off of how many allies it affects. In 90% of dungeon scenarios you aren't going to be affecting more than 2-3 members of the party, so the threat generated isn't good for the rage it costs to shout.
---
And TClap isn't about the damage, but about the threat generated from it, which is huge.
---
How long did it take to farm? Helping my bro farm for it soon.
---
Okay shitstain.
---
Yeah that bugs me
---
The part I don't get, is why didn't you just bop him on the head and be done with it? XD
---
How is this fun for people? I mean sheeple.
---
Why or what does the higher fear ranks? Still using rank one on my lvl 44 lock, and it works perfectly. No resists, no "dmg breaks", in short - the same as the level i learned it. So what gives? For noe im saving money, and skiping its higher ranks.
---
It's not slight. Part of the reason I quit playing Destiny is because the jumping puzzles through oblivion were just too stressful.
---
To the guy asking how to cut down on cigs while playing who deleted the comment.
---
"Start smoking weed and quit cigs. You wont be able to handle smoking that much cause you'll just be too fried. Its a natural regulator and its better for you. Then transition to cleaner ways of getting high, like vaping or extracts. Eventually just quit altogether. Do some mushrooms maybe once a year to keep the mind healthy and on track. Start eating healthy and working out, THEN quit WoW and never look back. Youll be a changed man and for the better!"
---
We have been using guild druid as a bear tank, and are delighted to find any warriors who are tanks.... but got a warrior into a five man recently, and we were delighted, druid and shemmie could heal our warrior..... Till he acted surprised and he said "not tanking, I'm dps".... so in we went, warrior as "dps". keeping agro on the bear while I shemmiehealed was very difficult, everything went for the warrior and nothing for the bear, but the warrior insisted "nope still not a tank, I'm just dps"..... oookay. It patently did not work, will not try again.
---
You are no doubt an excellent tank, well done for doing it the right way.
---
I have completely put other priorities on hold for the moment... I still keep up with my exercise schedule, and still find time to go out and be social... but generally speaking on my free time I'm WoWing.
---
I figured it would be like this for 1-2 months... and sometimes in life you just gotta let yourself enjoy the little things. I haven't been addicted to a game this hard since... well... vanilla wow. So i'm affording myself a few weeks of serious enjoyment before I need to actually start taking my life seriously again.
---
I just turned 30 too... it's been fun.
---
Literally that reply you linked doesn‚Äôt have an Lol, Rofl, lmao, or any kind other kind of laughing.
---
Literally everyone knew you were being sarcastic. 
---
Literally you have 3 other comments here that are rude and unnecessary. 
---
Literally someone‚Äôs just posting about enjoying the game, and you post replies with some kind of narcissistic elitist vibe ‚Äúyeah this has been happening for years no one cares been there done that.‚Äù 
---
Literally I‚Äôm trashing you cause you got bad vibes.
---
I hope that was literal for you enough.
---
Don't join cleave groups, they'll demoralize you.
---
Oh that‚Äôs not meant to be ire, apologies for a rant! I correctly read you had said ‚Äúcan be‚Äù I just find it irritating how much hate they get and no one wanting to level them when it‚Äôs actually pretty fun and rewarding (or so I feel). I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt complain because getting groups is quite easy due to no one wanting to level them......
---
BRD Torch Farm.
---
I know pallies and druids arent great for raid tanking, generally speaking, but is it east/viable to tank with them in other content? Will people still seek you out? Or are we assuming warrior in these conversations.
---
Yes. The fact that someone is in an urge to complete/do something doesn't automatically turn everyone around them pro players. Even pro players make mistakes.
---
Best gloves you can't quite see lol
---
My wife plays a resto druid and I tank on a warrior. I actually have a macro I made that I use when we start the instance that basically says ‚Äòtanking is not like BFA, I don‚Äôt have spammable AoE and ranged taunts. Let me pull and actually hit it a couple times, or you‚Äôll end up tanking it, and the healer will not heal you, and we‚Äôll laugh at your corpse while you run back.‚Äô
---
I'm guessing OP is a bit older than the average millennial because Ivr had the same experience as you.

Enchants.
---
dual + 15 vs single +25
---
Oh apologies,
---
In my mind the idea of playing level 60 dungeons (which BRD falls into, i'd say) with a 2-hander tanking just doesn't exist, and so a scenario where you'd use a 2-hander is is in leveling dungeons.
---
You're absolutely right that you'd be mauled to pieces in BRD, scholo and what-not strolling in there in full DPS (leather) gear swinging a two-hander.
---
40 raids is 20 weeks or 5 months if you're in a remotely competent guild. Good guilds are doing 2 MCs a week by now.
---
Think of them as World of Warcrafts parallel dimensions
---
The early orc stuff. Learning about them on dreanor is awesome. In love with every part of their warrior culture. For the sources read "rise of the horde" and watch the warbringer cinematics.
---
The problem is, I sort of *really dislike* that mentality. Allow me to make one correction? We share the same home, Azeroth, and our passions are shared, we‚Äôre family. You like the pool table in the basement and I like the pool in the backyard :D It always bothers me when people try to turn it into a classic vs retail thing. But I like what you‚Äôre trying to say!
---
Yes, exactly. BRD full clears was our guild's (all IRL friends/coworkers) favorite pastime before Karazhan took up that mantle in TBC. It'd usually be 2-3 max leveled/geared and 2-3 alts farming gear/xp. Fun as hell, especially with the antics that invariably happen with a group of friends.
---
What makes this ring so good?
---
The stats are obviously ass
---
As an avid formula one fan, I agree with you that it is quite hilarious
---
Not saying they cant off tank. We use one in our raid.
---
The reality is still that the composition looks similar to the above. There is some room for meme specs but any more than 3-5 and they are going to hinder progression.
---
Had one of those on the road in Ashenvale with an orc warrior last night. Filthie, I want a rematch!
---
Think of it like Shrek, sometimes he in castle, sometimes he in swamp. Just depends on who he is with.
---
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get got, and he most certainly got got.
---
I click anything past 5
---
LIKE A GLOVE...
---
been there done that
---
But he's *not* called "No", though
---
I randomly read Maiev story line and my lord the Demon Hunter story in general is bad ass as fuck. Also +1 for Arthas WoTLK is the fucking best.
---
With one button press? Not if there is a GCD on it. But you can use /castsequence to do them sequentially. 
---
If you‚Äôre ok with the pet attacking with the first cast you can do 
---
/castsequence YouSpell, YourOtherSpell
---
/petattack
---
&gt;I think most arms leveling builds maxes all of those
---
But since I don't start at level 40, which of those would you as a warrior while you leveled felt the most impactful or you would rather have maxed before the others?
---
I'm not going to debate quest addon features in regard how much or little it automates and whether or not that ruins WoW.
---
You play how you want, I'll play how I want. As long as we both play the way that gets us sufficient enjoyment from the game without maliciously interfering in each other's enjoyment, who cares?
---
It's complex if you've never done it.  I've looked at a map and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of it, but because of the fact that it's enclosed and seems to meander it can be confusing if you haven't run it once to get a feel for the layout.
---
Shit I‚Äôve vendored so many
---
Can confirm. Every time I've eaten a full Warlock fear they will dot, dot drain life and fear never breaks.
---
Fear something on my level 29 Warlock thats level 21. Insta break!
---
Exactly.   That's why I love Classic so much more.
---
I know kinda hilarious
---
Around how much is Elemental Earth going for on the AH?
---
I know this will vary by server but I'm just looking for a ballpark estimate.
---
Probably TMI, but my testicles draw up....   
---
I actually found it was a great indicator of death from a fall even though I don't know exactly why they only do it when I'm going to die.
---
it's like "i've been falling for too long - brace for impact"
---
&gt;internet culture was kinder and less ‚Äútroll/meme/stream‚Äù back then. 
---
As someone who's being using the internet for 25 years I'd have to say that current internet culture is the least trolly. 
---
People either seem to be 100% anti fun or are retarded 12 year olds that don't realise that trolling is a art.
---
Fair points really.  What I can not understand is that they make leveling obsolete for no real reason. In bfa  for example you can go to max level by doing half the available quests , zones and dungeons. The quests are already there. Make it like the old days, where you needed to explore all zones do the quests and run dungeons. Content is there. The progression design is so bad though.
---
I'm about the same place with lock and rogue. I'm leaning toward lock for ease of dungeon invites. Sounds like mage is going to be even more popular among those three.
---
Hmm?
---
60 lock here. I got free riding training when i learned my 40 warlock mount.
---
I played Cassic about a week ago on a Dell m6800 laptop from 2013 when my gaming rig power supply died. I used minimum settings, but it ran super smooth and looked really good all things considering. No studdering.
---
The laptop you link appears to have an Intel¬Æ¬†UHD Graphics 620 integrated chip. Mine has a NVidia Quatro K4100m. So the two laptops are not a decent direct comparison. 
---
I'm at work now, but if you can find benchmarks online for both you could compare. I'd be shocked a bit if a new integrated chip wouldn't be equal or better than one from 6yrs ago, but you never know I guess.
---
That'll work. The memory is a little low, but it'll be fine. You shouldn't notice too much of a drop.
---
The thing with Windows 10 home, is there are a TON of services/apps you will want to disable and uninstall. Also you may want a laptop cooler/fan to place under it, and you may have to be cautious about proper seating/positioning for longer periods of use.
---
Other than that, you'll be fine.
---
I use an ACER Aspire 7 series that is a modest high-end laptop, but the thing crushes the highest graphics settings for this game. It's kinda overkill, but I like how I can run a second monitor for aids/info while playing, so it basically runs sorta like a desktop, only I can pick it up and take it with me when I go somewhere.
---
&gt;Your healer is running out of water and has asked the warlock to stop life tapping so much. The warlock says he is carrying this group and he will not stop. 
---
2 reasons to just bring a mage instead :)
---
Pretty sure most undeads go there as well, cuz fuck silverpine and that fucking son of aurugal.
---
I mean if you can get in as dps at any level that is preferred. But people will expect you to heal since you‚Äôre a priest. You might be 10-15% worse at healing than a holy priest. Check out the holy talents. Almost none of them are amazingly good. 5% crit, some reduced cast times, spiritual guidance which is only great at max levels when you have tons of spirit, etc.
---
Check out the WeakAuras addon
---
Get an auction scanning mod, they typically will show you the estimated value of the DE materials and you can compare that to the current auction value of the item.
---
Your a Rogue, odds are you were going to start doing that anyhow.
---
Yeah but what class are you
---
Its a banish not a sleep so that's why it's not dispellable.
---
Are you saying dalrends isn't duelwield?
---
Problem: Big servers have more people than can reasonably farm key spawns. If there's a spawn of 10 murlocs and 10 people are trying to farm them, that's only 1 murloc per person, horribly tedious. 
---
Solution: Make five copies of the zone and spread the ten people across them. Each copy, called a "layer", has its own spawn of 10 murlocs, so now there's actually 50 murlocs so each player now gets 5. Much better!
---
What layer you are on is pretty much random, and (I believe) is assigned each time you log in. However, when you join someone's group, you're automatically moved onto their layer (their copy of the map) so that you can quest together. 
---
Layer swapping is an exploit that abuses this: clear all the monsters from an area then, instead of waiting for the monsters to respawn, have someone on another layer invite you to their party, moving you to their layer and, in theory, immediately giving you a fresh, unkilled batch of monsters to kill and loot. It's using intended game mechanics for unintended purposes, and is considered cheating.
---
See this is exactly what I'm saying! If the weapon abilities scale off my weapon's damage, then why does everyone always focus on speed? The abilities read "weapon damage plus x". If I have 2 weapons with the same damage range, why would I ever want to go out of my way to get the slower weapon?
---
Sargeras was always so crazy for me, every time I had heard about him he was some mystical dude the size of a planet who could fuck your whole world up. The Burning Legion in general seems like a dope story line to try and read into they seem crazy as hell.
---
I've done a fair bit of pvp before but nothing high level. So to be honest it hasn't been important because in a casual battleground or open world most players suck thankfully!
---
Oh god.
---
I stand by my question.  
---
Very few people have been able to get the gold for an epic mount to begin with.  Now add on over 10k runecloth.
---
Was actually thinking I'd respec to gather pre raid Bis towards the end anyway so that works out perfectly, thanks!
---
Gcd is 1.5sec by default, unless you're a rogue or cat druid.
---
&gt;Smarter players, however, simply stack the party so there's no loot competition.
---
I agree and I think there's a huge difference between inviting the right mix of players to your party vs. announcing to everyone that an item is reserved.
---
It's the difference between polite in and being rude. It's social skills. Something that is one of the core aspects of an MMO.
---
At least you know to avoid him now. I am a firm believer if you are a idiot and you do dumb things you should be blasted for it so other people know to avoid you. This post could save someone a massive amount of stress from now knowing not to group with this person.
---
Good you didn't, they removed loot trading from normal dungeons and it does only apply to raids.
---
The classic experience
---
Aka never invite hunters
---
It makes you appreciate the group content, instead of feeling like when you click the "Join group" button and queue for a dungeon that you just get stuck with 4 robots who run the dungeon and never speak like retail.
---
If everything gets handed to you, it loses it meaning.  Dungeons are no exception.
---
It looks like you are running either the absolute minimum or below the minimum requirements. Keep in mind, classic is not vanilla. Classic is using a newer client that has higher system requirements than WoW had during the time of vanilla. The requirements are a little lower than retail.
---

You're going to spam melee strikes so you're 1% chance to stun staff procs? This also assumes you're already within melee range, which happens rarely if you're good at your job.
---
Meanwhile the warrior only hits in melee..... so there's that.
---
RemindMe! Tomorrow
---
So what more intellectual thing is it they do? I can get sports being seen as 'cooler' amongst some groups, but if intellectual types, I'd expect a different crowd.
---
I'm maining a druid right now (only level 36). The class is still enjoyable and unique to me. I probably won't do much raiding so I care more about PVP where druids are still great. Even boomkin isn't total ass in PVP.
---
It's definitely a high effort class for tanking and cat dps for not much reward but the fact that at any time you can say "heal, dps, or tank LFG" is really nice. 0/30/21 allows you to do anything in a dungeon even up to 60. Won't be the best but you'll be passable if you know what you're doing.
---
So much more than just bombs though, cloak that allows you to slow fall, rocket boots, mind control helmet, jumper cables to res people as well as the shown death ray.
---
You can also get a pet
---
why
---
Nah, I'd rather share some of those sweet hot pockets your mom brings you.
---
hey, it's sometimes fun to break up the monotony of slaughtering the other faction lol
---
Don‚Äôt buy a new laptop, build a PC like a real human
---
Are you Undead and using Devouring Plague?
---
Unless we're both on the same kill X mobs quest, no.
---
There have been few people on servers discords that claim they have been banned for ore/herb faming, so I am not sure if what you are claiming is 100% true.
---
Well, you can't pick and choose. No, wait, you can. I chose not to play a paladin this time around. 
---
You take the good with the bad, you know?
---
Wtf is this. Even Kim Jong Un can‚Äôt do that. Lol just ask him to go fuck himself.
---
Save the enjoyment.  Level something else on your main server that you can simply use the mage to fund.  Most of the spots are going to be the same, so I don't see much value in this just a big risk of burnout.
---
It‚Äôs called recipes for alchemy not patterns. That guy was just making fun of the semantics.
---
Why? Do you not love reading random, no context spam reddit posts about random people you will never meet ingame??
---
That‚Äôs it?
---
3s 50c
---
Has Blizzard announced any future plans for Classic? I see stuff like bosses being talked about in in-game chat, but have no idea if that comes from Blizzard or not.
---
A profession with cooldowns is probably best. Get an alt up to 250 to make those 2/4 day cooldown items. 
---
People also stick with a lvl 5 enchanteing to d/e any BoEs they want to.  I wouldn‚Äôt suggest leveling an alt as enchanting as many of the valuable enchants are tough to get or locked behind reputation gains. So they‚Äôre best used as disenchanting slaves.
---
I did a few runs last night to see what all the fuss is about, your numbers match what I was getting. It's an all right method I guess but if you can farm valuable beasts or something instead it's about the same gph with the benefit of getting BOEs and xp. If your server is a murder madhouse though this is a pretty stress-free way to do it.
---
Oh, I didn't get it on my 40 paladin ü§®
---
Way til shit gets harder. I already have 1000+ armor on any bear tank and I'm able to do way more in shit scenarios and keep threat and I haven't even specced prot yet
---
I 100% made that jump on purpose when I fished questing up there, so much faster than running back down the ramp.

I won‚Äôt reply when it seems you‚Äôve instantly downvoted because you didn‚Äôt like what I had to say when I‚Äôm getting involved with the conversation.
---
Alex Jones so liberal he says Sandy Hook was a false flag to take your guns.
---
Get out of here and take your strawman with you.
---
Lol no.  The DDoS wasn't their fault.  They only give game time if they release broken code (wotlk pre launch).
---
Cute, I like the Night Elf.
---
"Tango down."
---
Brillant.
---
I've really only played Horde, I can assure you Alliance 2v1 as well.
---
There were some tauren mill/southshore battles but for the most part wpvp in this game wasnt really a thing for ppl.
---
glad I could do that for ya
---
You know, there is the 'V' key? üòÅ
---
What did you set the graphics to? My laptop has pretty similar specs, I set the graphics all the way down to minimum and it looks like trash but gets over 30 FPS; so it was playable.
---
Healing in retail was one of my favourite things to do across both pve and pvp. Kinda scared to try it in classic. Does it vary drastically from retail? I‚Äôve been playing since wrath if that helps for comparison.
---
One of the theoretical top dps rotations for a hunter involves using ranged and melee weaving, but it's a pita to do.
---
It's something silly and cute, weeb or not.
---
Boutta get UK Drilled in the pen
---
It is called recipe for Alchemy. 
---
It is sold in UC by Algernon, but only in limited quantities.  You will have to camp him or check after a server restart.  I had to do the same for the Runecloth Bag pattern from an NPC in Everlook.  Best of luck.
---
Dog
---
Even killing a fisherman?
---
I‚Äôve thrown away so many due to bag space
---
I read your comment and was going to reply ‚Äúhunter huh?‚Äù Then I saw your tag.
---
Just stop.  You are exaggerating the values of single BoP items to straw man a valid argument.   
---
The value of vendoring a single BoP item is much less than wearing it for 5-20 levels.  The value of selling a single BoE blue or purple, especially a BiS twink item, whether by AH or trade chat, is much more than wearing it for 5-20 levels.
---
I routinely mark targets when not lead, but I agree with what you are saying
---
You buy it from the UC vendor.  It was either sold out when you went there or he had a different recipe for sale.
---
You're misunderstanding the problem.
---
With 110 levels to grind through, alts and new players simply do not have the critical mass necessary to organically form dungeon groups together for the same dungeon at any set point in time.
---
There is no ‚Äúappreciating group content‚Äù when that content gets diluted out of the leveling experience entirely.
---
Leveling is a solo game once you start adding too many expansions and raising the level cap further and further.
---
At that point, the only way to make Dungeon groups for particular dungeons is to leverage cross-realm logins. Period.
---
Vanilla you'd get kicked for not equipping BOE's that you needed on.
---
Imagine ending up in prison because you wanted to pretend you were a 1337 H4X0R.
---
As long as you really, really like Gnomeregan.
---
They use 1handers for MC
---
&gt; still complaining as if I said Hunters had priority over the weapon
---
You're arguing a point nobody is talking about.
---
Shamans start using mail when warriors start using plate (level 40). The only real conflict loot would be weapons.
---
Burn your ass.
---
I have really good PC
---
I'm not saying restrict it but if I were going to come up with a way to make it better I'd give massive negatives to people attacking players that are 10 levels or more below them. IE I would make it so the low levels have a fighting chance at the high levels. However the purpose of the post is just to ask the enemy to have some decency. You can judge a man by how he treats his enemies. Anyone can show kindness and mercy to their friends, the real test is showing it to your enemy.

Gave me goosebumps. Awesome story!

Iron was good, but only when smelted into steel, which unfortunately is hard to sell in volume.  Iron in bulk wasn't worth too much.

Mithril+ was (still is) bank.

Ooooh okok, thank you very much ! Have a good one

i just mean that he's wrong.

Alot of engineer things are only useful for the engineer. So whatever your main will be should be the engineer if you want one, or whichever your pvp main will be as at least in my eyes, it is mostly a pvp profession. Herb/alch is a great alt spec since any potions can be sent to your main.

My dearest sister,
---
This may very well be the last letter I write to you, and I pray to the mountain that this reaches you. It has been a month since I last saw you, as you waved goodbye to me as I set out from Dun Morogh, bond for the southern human lands of Westfall.
---
Life has been tough on the rode, the ale that you brewed for me has long since dried, and I have yet to find a draught as sweet and strong as yours. I have battled  countless enemies to protect out neighbours to the south, thrwated the plans of a nefarious gang known as the Brotherhood, and have even slayed the leader of the Scarlet Crusade!
---
Though now, things are looking grim. I found old Nessingwary! You remember him right? That crazy dwarf always talking about hunting and exploring. I found him in Stranglethorn Vale... as well as the dreaded horde.
---
They have surrounded us now, and I can hear their drums of war beating. We have had several skirmishes with them already in the jungles, but they keep coming. 
---
What I do now, I do for King Magni, and our people. Tell mother and father I love them.
---
Love,

Korinth

No, you are talking about DPS, because in the two weapons you've described, one is significantly better because it attacks faster with the same damage, which means more DPS. Sure, your abilities will hit the same, but you'll get more chances to proc Overpower or Deep Wounds, etc, with the faster weapon. Not to mention get in more auto attacks. 
---
You've confused the three variables available. DPS, Attack speed, and damage. Arms warriors want high damage because that's what most of your abilities scale off of. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU WANT THE SLOWEST WEAPON. Anyone claiming as such is ignoring the other variables. While leveling, you want the highest DPS weapon. However, assuming you have two weapons that do 30 DPS, with different attack speeds, then one HAS to have a higher raw damage number. The one with the higher raw damage number is the one you want, and it just so happens to coincide with the slower weapon in this case. 
---
So, to go back to your original post, yes raw damage numbers are what you're interested in, but only if everything else is equal (i.e., item levels/stats offered).
---
Did McConnell ever come back after Asmond ninja looted Onyxia‚Äôs head?
---
Alright thank you !
---
Do you really think this is an appropriate response to being told you are bad at a video game?
---
It wasn't dhks that killed it. It was the addition of the honor system and battlegrounds that killed it. Instead of being something people did for shits and giggles it was now a progression path. BGs made it even worse because it gave both sides a place to get honor fast and constantly.

Okay... please name 1 AoE any of those classes have at level 15.
---
That group make-up is looking pretty fucking rough for an RFC. That's all I was saying. It'd be every leather wearer tanking their own thing. Or a pet tank, which doesn't show up on your party HUD. Making it rough on the healer. That's all I was saying.
---
If the stats are the same mail is better as it has more armor.
---
Healing spells glow green or white, 99% of the time.

Length does not equal difficulty

hes got alotta health so its easiest to kite around the lake away from mobs
---
Is it one of those vendor recipes that only spawns every once in a while and only one person can buy it each time it spawns?
---
Yeah this has to be one of those life decisions that you never stop regretting. Even if he did try to spin this to emphasize his skills in "hacking" and try to make a career out of it in the future like some others have done in cybersecurity I feel like this result just killed his chances. Obviously he was a terrible hacker if he got caught within weeks of doing it.
---
Yeah, all the rest of us were cool and added each other. We actually did a bunch of runs together. It was honestly a great time until this guy decided to wipe us.
---
Just look at the stats. If a leather piece is better wear that.
---
2/3 of the warriors I've come across are Mc-something... Including mine, McTankytown.
---
Doesn't ff provide you with NPCs if you don't have a group so you can do a dungeon?
---
I'm level 18 and constantly hit my mount-up macro even though I don't have one. I don't think I'll have this issue, fortunately.
---
I'm with you. Almost all world PVP has nothing to do with skill. It's almost never a level playing field and I don't get joy from taking advantage of another person's disadvantage by ganking so all I would get is killed by those guys. I've played on PVP servers since Vanilla and I can say there were less reasonably fair fights than years I've played.
---
That guy seems to be a chore to be around.
---
Very insightful point. I think a couple of friends and I have gotten good at communicating the cool things about D&amp;D to those outside the hobby, and we do so by framing them as things people can relate to. A similar approach to MMOs might be a good idea.
---
Wrong, this isn't retail where you can hide amongst the entire players across all servers. There is a level of integrity you need to uphold on community servers.
---
I don't trust Blizzard for making a new WoW game.
---
It was just a simple question. I'm so sorry that life has left you this cynical. God forbid someone to be curious about how they handle these situations. Go take a shower. You're getting greasy.
---
Make it happen. Please
---
Right? Guessing whether he's a fat neckbeard or a skinny kinda dude. I need answers!
---
These kind of posts are frequent.
---
Ahh ok, I get it. I personally prefer to watch animated dubs but subs on live action stuff, but YMMV. 
---
Ultimately with a game though I gotta imagine there's plenty of cultural nuance that gets introduced to say the Germanic version that appeals to them a lot more than american culture.
---
Also the best shaman weapon for a good 7 levels
---
I completely feel your pain OP. After multiple shit show runs in SM I decided to stop pugging entirely. I run with the guild or I don't run at all, just not worth the headache anymore. Mages refuse to decurse, warlocks hellfire to 5% hp, orcs pop bloodfury when they're 50% hp...ill grind by myself in peace instead until the guild calls me.
---
Thanks Tyler
---
The warrior needs it just as much as casters though.
---
Resurgence Rod and The Chief's Enforcer. I much prefer RR over TCE for the higher top-end damage and slower speed.
---
Are you high as fuck? How do you forget the mount?
---
Why do warriors scale better than rogues? I'm guessing Eviscerate is a problem.
---
You can't have classic + without a stagnant classic server. People would just want base classic all over again.
---
gada check these out when I get home
---
As a warlock I'm trying tod figure this out.
---
Let's be honest, you came here for someone to tell you yes.
---
Got invited to a group as a Warrior (lvl 38 at the time) and after I spent five minutes or so heading to SM to meet up with the group (they were all in transit also) they dropped me solely because the party leader said he was told he shouldn't have invited another mail armor wearing class.
---
Very annoying - especially if they don't explicitly say that when they are in LFG either.

I had a bit of a stronk trying to read this.
---
You always get the stat boosts. It's also a great way to pull monsters that you want to pull either one at a time or in small groups.
---
What do you recommend to people that need to do the quest? Look for groups for each of the different parts that have the quests you want?
---
This is wrong...partially.  You are right about tanking in as Arms spec, but you *absolutely* want to be in defensive stance when tanking in Arms spec with a 2h Weapon.
---
You need to be using up every Revenge proc and Sunder on pretty much every GCD that isnt being used to apply and refresh Demo Shout.  This is where most of your threat comes from and like damage, also benefits from Defensive Stance's increased threat modifier.

You want a sword and board in a Shield Bash macro to interrupt, and like you said, in the rare cases mob/boss that deals hard hitting physical damage.

I'm 14 and I already/still don't know anyone who's into games. There's a 12 year old who likes Minecraft and FNAF, and some older kids who like CoD. I have two older brothers who like games, but neither of them will play with me, except for rare occasions when we play Smash Bros or Black Ops split screen, or something like that. They usually just play with their own friends.

basic addon and then as i say i changed the format text for a few of them ill post a few pics for you to show what i changed
---
Consistently stated that it's not an issue is a lot different than not explicitly condemning it. They have provided clarification though that says your intent is important and they don't want people to intentionally respawn boss mobs. Intentionally buying more vendor patterns than you should be able to access normally is the same intent

All that work for a minuscule dps boost?   In a 40 main raid where enrage timers generally arent even an issue, that's such a tiny increase in overall raid dps.

Wow this looks nothing like a laundry room in any house built in this century, unless you are only including houses that are 4000+ Sq ft....

There's no point trying to make data foolproof. Brainless folks will be mislead regardless.

Close, he's the reason the Orcs are on Azeroth. Medivh was the last Guardian of Tiristfal, a title inherited from his mother Aegwynn.
---
He became corrupted by Sargeras while in his mother's womb, his mother and Sargeras had a big magical battle and she 'won', but Sargeras corrupted the unborn Medivh.
---
Growing up Medivh had no issues until he turned around 18, then Sargeras started influencing him and had him contact Gul'Dan to open the Dark Portal. Medivh was killed by his friends, but later resurrected as the 'Prophet' in WC3 that leads various key figures like Thrall through the events of WC3.
---
Honestly you‚Äôre right. They know its a problem in Classic that will eventually surface. Right now, all the zones are packed. But in 14 months? Will you still fill a BRD group in 5 minutes? Nope, itll take 30-45min on a normally packed server. Same with random elite quests. Right now, instant groups for elite quests. In a year? I doubt it. So im very interested in seeing how Classic communities shake out. I also think therell be even more haves and have nots since the game is so figured out, but only if you go looking for it. I wont be surprised if gold is massively inflated.
---
That is why phase 2 will be glorious and everything after that will be kind of meh.
---
This is why is have my game on SSD so loading times are bit quicker. The trick is to kill the gnome right after the loadingscreen
---
Flying in TBC was fine. It was just another step in attunement for most content. You needed flying in order to start exploring Skettis, Netherstorm, and it was mandatory for getting to Tempest Keep and Kazzak. At the time Blizz knew it could cause issues with World PvP, so they added 4(!) zones with PvP based objectives that had really important rewards in order to keep people battling on the ground. They even tied those rewards to PvE, giving everyone an incentive to join the fight. 
---
It became more of a problem in Wrath, which didn't necessarily have those same incentives to keep people fighting on the ground, and while flying was helpful for Storm Peaks it wasn't as necessary as it was in BC.
---
I told my mom:

How is me playing wow while I work in websites any different than her watching soap operas while she crochets..

People friend on gamers and those same people will sit in a bar for four hours and go home and binge 7 episodes of game of thrones.

Not everyone is a social butterfly.

Don't let people judge you man.

Now if you're neglecting responsibilities to find more game time, then yeah, you've got a wife and a family, maintain your house, don't be an addict.
---
If all your affairs are in order, then game.
---
But don't forget to spend time with your family, one day they might not be there.
---
You never know when your last words will be with a family member, so make those moments count.
---
Don't regret not spending time with family when you had the chance.

Arcane Shot generates a normal amount of threat, are you thinking of Distracting Shot?

That guy did you a big favor. Fuck ‚Äòem. Hope you find some new cool friends.

I am same, only lvl 35, but when I finally hit 60 I think I can schedule my time for raiding.  Obviously I won't be in the hardcore/top guild, but it will be fun regardless.  So don't worry about it, just play when you can.
---
Since you're a hunter, it's mandatory that you now chain run SM Armory and roll against warriors on all of Herod's sick melee mail. Put it on just to rub it in, but of course  just vendor it when you back into town and put your agility leather back on.
---
It's saved me multiple times to aoe stun the opposing faction camping instance while I walk in.

I was just chilling in the crossroads at level 16 and some stranger just gave me them. Thanks again to who ever you are!!

I only cut myself and SUCC my enemies. Conjured crackers and bong water is for stoners.

Undead warrior is actually the worst warrior to be. Just sayin :p

My teenage brother got mad at a tank who was being an asshole to him in chat, so he ninja looted savage gladiator chain, turned into a world chat meme/legend and now can‚Äôt play on the server, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll regret that one later on
---
Well, they got a suspect that may be him. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.
---
Shaman highlight reels are warrior floor cuts, change my mind.
---
This sub: horde are always the one camping low levels!!
---
Also this sub: I love killing low level hordes! Me too! Know any good spots?
---
The guy is confusing hacking for ddos.  Some hackers turn whitehat and get great government jobs.  No simple ddoser gets jackshit except a jail sentence because it takes 0 skill and little knowledge.
---
As a healer I dont blame the tank. We can see fairly quickly who the fuck up is. 
---
So if they die, and inky they die, we may or may not have "forgotten" to heal them
---
Weird, I've never had to wait for dps, ever.
---
Spirit tap is over rated.. you can solo level fine without it. Source?..have leveling 3 priests in Class ic beta and Live.
---
Change your password.
---
He's definitely going to have swipe his way out of here.
---
I don't really care about people reserving loot but I definitely actively avoid these groups.  Mainly, I think that it starts a PUG in bad faith and it's easy enough just to stock the group with other classes to prevent having rolling conflicts.  I don't trust that Timmy the Shammy who has Ravager on reserve isnt going to afk for half the instance or take whatever he wants from the boss.  
---
Now, if we're talking about a 60 rogue running princess, that's a little different because they are clearly overleveled for the instance and going to help the run go much faster.
---
I think druids are great in PvP. In Arathi a druid can be part of a stealth cap group as DPS or heals. Druid has a lot of versatility.
---
I guess my opinion would be: if I see somebody advertising a dungeon in a way that I don't like, I wouldn't join their run and I wouldn't engage with them.
---
For me, the game is about having fun...I like keeping it simple. XD
---
What kind of disconnection? If you're instantly thrown into log in menu without warning (lag) i'd suggest to change your password asap.
---
Uhhhhh. Just play the game and enjoy it man. I‚Äôm in a similar boat and I have 2 kids ages 3 and 2. Just hop in for a little enjoy it and get off. If you absolutely can not do that then it truly isn‚Äôt a game worth playing for you.
---
I haven't downloaded it yet. Have you figured out your issue?
---
That's a good response to start off the type of discussion I was looking for. 
---
So what makes the game fun to you. Is it not the development of social connections I mentioned in the original post?
---
Not great. They are ok at defending a node, while they delay and call for help. They don't bring anything to the decisive battles though - you'll be hard pressed to find a spot for a druid in a proper premade group where every spot counts. If you do get a spot you need to be 31pt resto.
---
you ever feel like the eyes are just about to pop right out

I have a Chihuahua-Doxen mix and call him all the worst names

* Dirty Rat Fuck
---
The list goes on...
---
Better to get while the gettin's good.
---
Easy. Just be the best/only shadow priest in your guild. Also helps if the warlocks are on your side; the main reason Shadow is played is for the 15% buff to shadow damage.
---
Shaman are op in pvp, specifically chain lightning is mean. Windfury is nice, too. Go with your heart. Shaman was my first toon to 60 in vanilla, and while you will never get to experience the glory that is windfury proccing off of windfury, you will still be very happy.  Also, don‚Äôt feel bad playing them all! Stick them in an inn when you log off and only play the toons that either have rested experience or that make you the most happy In the moment. Don‚Äôt make it a race to 60 and the game is a lot more fun imo.
---
Growl will almost always go off on CD over Claw though, due to it costing 10 less focus. I haven't had any issues with that.
---
His name is probably Dymitri from Russian or Czech or something, 80lbs, greasy hair and sleezy facial hair.
---
No, it's not worth re-speccing in my opinion. I'd stick with Arms all the way up to mid 50's until you start running some of the end game dungeons. Even if Sweeping Strikes isn't worth it, Mortal Strikes definitely is, which you'll get in the same level range. I'm currently a 43 warrior and I still use Ravager for my Arms spec.
---
&gt;I fell prey to the overusing heroic strike. I switched this time to sunder/autoattack with shouts and it was an absolute world of difference
---
Me too. Thanks for apologies, I was just alarmed by the visceral reaction. I acually enjoy my war but he is not easy for me.
---
&gt; just pushes your kids to do things anyway.
---
Good luck secretly playing MMOs.
---
There are two schools of thought here.  
---
1. Do you want a class that levels quickly, isn't gear dependent and plays well solo because you have so little time?
---
2. Do you want a class a hybrid that can do 2 different rolls pretty well, and be a very in demand class if you want to group at 60?
---
If you follow a questing guide, hunters 1-60 speed is unmatched for casual/semi-casual players, especially now since you're behind the leveling curve and quest mobs are in less demand.  
---
At 60, you can farm gold yourself, do more quests for money yourself, world pvp is very good as a solo, camping rare pet spawns is by yourself etc etc - Hunters can play the game incredibly well as a solo which can be a big benefit if you have limited time. 
---
Finding a group to play with can be difficult as a Hunter.
---
Shamans can heal, so finding groups as a healer is easy enough, there questing speed is bottom tier especially after level 40 - and world pvp is challenging, but fun. Gold farming and solo play is a lot more difficult than a Hunter at 60, but still rewarding.
---
Group play as a *Healing* Shaman is very easy to find - if you want to PvP you'll have groups looking for you, same thing with raiding etc etc - there are specs that are 30/0/21 which can be effective enough healers at 60, but PvP as elemental (which also means solo farm as elemental).
---
So the main decision you have to make is, do you want to play a class that can solo nearly everything and is a lot more independent at 60, or play a very in demand class at 60 that doesn't require a ton of effort to get into raid groups / premade BG groups.
---
I believe so, people posted his name somewhere in the comment.
---
Apparently he's been at it since WoD.
---
Weird. I swear it said it was a high threat ability in addition to distracting shot. TIL.
---
Yeah yeah mages are stupid we know
---
meant\*
---
Sweet summer child thinking this hasn't been the way its been for the entirety of the internet and human kind.
---
Can you explain how the mouseover works? how does it not change targets? How does taunt work? I'm worried ive been using it wrong this whole time. Does it only taunt whos targeted, or everyone around you? Sorry I'm still new to WoW and trying to improve.
---
Also - Getting a WW axe seems tough for me right now. I'm too weak to get the charms by myself and they are really expensive on my server. I'm the 3rd highest level person in my guild right now too so wouldnt have much help killing the lvl 40 boss. I have a Corpsemaker and plan on attempting to get the Ravager eventually. Right now I have been running RFK over and over trying to drop the 1h axe at the end, but to no avail.
---
Buddies raced the other day! Racing to menethil harbor, starting from the top of the trade district they both hit ironforge at the exact same time but the run from the tram to the IF flight master cost him. So it‚Äôs about the same depending on location within SW. pick your poison type of thing
---
What's up with that?
---
A body is better than no body.
---
support
---
No problem with rogue, the only ones I actively avoid are pet classes...
---
Sorry I may have missed something, but what does social justice warrior have to do with this?
---
Are you against doing the dungeon quests? You can stock up on the quests for a particular dungeon ahead of time and do one run to get them all completed. Good xp and should get you a level.
---
yeah u dont need kazzak for the eye, he's just he highest drop chance mobs for it.
---
Sadly, you do have to repurchase them. I was shadow/disc 1-42, switched to holy until 48 and then back to shadow. Had to repurchase all the mind flay ranks. At least the talent skills are much cheaper.
---
So, how do you feel about me leaving a faction member out to dry when they engaged reds that I had been peacefully farming near? No communication with me, just straight in for the attack assuming I would help. Except I didn't and they died. Which I found funny and they, based on the 10-15 minutes of whispers, did not.
---
Limiting supply. But the timers were based around vanilla server size populations. And current servers have significantly more players. On a large scale, quantity per player has remained relatively consistent. At the end of the day, that 6 hour vendor recipe cooldown is most likely on cooldown on multiple layers and you are just wasting your time trying to find a layer where it is up. Possibly wasting more time then just sitting out the 6 hours.
---
Yeah, I imagine your situation feels a lot like mine, as a police officer. 
---
Guess how receptive that crowd generally is.... =/
---
Sounds like a PVE server is more your speed.
---
PVP is for people with thicker skins willing to burn and be burned in turn.
---
Rogue is some of the most fun you will have with burst damage as long as you play daggers and make sure you are constantly getting the best ones possible.  Shaman is also really decent with bust, since you can use a ranged shock for 800-1000+ instantly. Windfury is no joke either. 
---
I played both in vanilla and I enjoyed end game rogue pvp a lot more. you can‚Äôt sneak around stormwind and ironforge as easily with a shaman.
---
Is that, like, what comes after the Super Bowl???
---
oh are they good money?
---
Don't fuck with a company's ability to generate revenue. Especially a multi billion dollar company that has more lawyers than you have sexual partners.
---
Gnomes have a 15% (if I recall correctly) size increase on their model, and that multiplier also applies to mounts. So yeah, while you're not wrong, it's not a bug.
---
Why though? The only inherent benefit mail has is more armor which isn't going to be that beneficial to a hunter in most situations anyway.
---
this argument is so bad. It really is that easy. Go, google it and try it yourself. Or go to 4chan and ask them or whatever. it takes 20 minutes of research to find a botnet and like $20. Then, you go to prison. They have a nearly 100% prison rate for DDOSers have major services, did you know that? Nearly no one who has ever DDOSd a major service has gotten away with it.   
---
It's not that DDOSing is hard to do or expensive, it's that you will literally go to prison if you do it.
---
Until phase 3 when they release battlegrounds no one will have a need for twinks so I‚Äôm plannin around that. However leading up to the update or right after I‚Äôd expect a huge flow of these listings to start popping up from bank alts that were stockpiling these. Once that happens you‚Äôll be better off waiting again imo. Yea they will be selling for way more than now but it‚Äôs more cuz everyone has the gold to spend. Once the supply dwindles it will jack the price way up to what most people were used to seeing on older servers.
---
Or dwarf priests? Fear ward has made all warlocks avoid me religiously. The ones that don‚Äôt learn quickly.
---
Doesn't stuff like that happen in America too? Pretty sure the movie "Catch Me If You Can" is literally about that.
---
Although we let the guy sit in prison for a bit first before rewarding him...
---
I've leveled my hunter to 45 as BM and it's been pretty fun. Would it be fun or interesting to respec to surv or mm for the remaining levels? I don't care if it isn't optimal because it seems like hunter is pretty easy while questing no matter what you do.
---
They were made for smaller gnomes. Gnomes were smaller when first designed, but got a 1.15x scaling modifier added some time before the original launch because they looked too small.
---
The current size is consistent with their vanilla size.
---
Yes, if you want those mamma mia, one shot see ya, aimed shot crits, you need a slow attack speed.
---
More guilds are looking for druids atm than warr and mages from what I see. If you can lvl up fast and get going you might secure yourself a perma spot in a raid.

Can Warcraft handle multiple monitors?

Hey that's my server! way to go!

I'm still a lowly 47 rogue.

But how will you win the race against the girls without cartman's big fat ass?
---
There are a lot of variables to this, but here are the basic numbers:
---
Deeprun Tram takes 60 seconds to make a trip and waits for 12 seconds on each end.
---
Flying is a couple seconds different in each direction, but basically 3:30.
---
Alright so you understand how it's supposed to work at least.
---
Two of these people are trolls, and the last thing they're going to do is be honest, so I'm just going to be an asshole to them.
---
The other guy is just stupid. "I'm doing it cus they're doing" what a childish mindset. Is it even worth explaining to them, that they could form there own groups, exile these toxic people, instead of just spreading the toxicity? They should just go back to retail. 
---
I've laid out why you shouldn't need when it's a greed roll very clearly. 
---
They can't even be bothered to engage with the argument.
---
You're at least honest enough to say you just don't care, so I'm trying to not be an asshole to you. But fuck those other guys.
---
Your wearing it , it was an upgrade you used standard need before greed rolls, your not a ninja . Pallys  wear cloth to heal . Welcome to classic
---
Lmao what an idiot
---
You joke, but they actually gave out free days of game time a lot more often in vanilla than they have since.
---
SO mocks you for playing WoW and all of a sudden it‚Äôs an extremely unhealthy relationship? 
---
Jesus, maybe she‚Äôs supportive of all his other hobbies (does he have any)?  Just an extreme leap to overall relationship health.  Getting mocked isn‚Äôt the end of the earth.  People here are too easily rattled.
---
It's okay, we get plenty of exercise by carrying the group.
---
Layer-Abusing.
---
That's not the point I was making.
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from but just because it‚Äôs not automation doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not cheating. The only reason it‚Äôs not grounds for a ban is because multi boxers spend such large amounts on a monthly subscription. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for blizzard to do this from their stand point. Multi boxing still uses external software to allow a single person to accomplish goals outside the means of a normal player. It allows them to spend the same time as a single. Person to reap many times the rewards in terms of levels and loot. This to me approaches the area of pay to win, or at least pay to get ahead? 
---
Either way it doesn‚Äôt break the game, wow is still awesome, but I think it definitely qualifies as cheating.
---
So I was questing in WPL, and a mage stole my quest mob - so I killed him. I then waited for the mob to respawn as he was corpse running. When I figured he should be pretty close to ressing, I set my trap in my deadzone, put some distance between myself and the corpse, and waited to see if he'd fall for it..

Quests post-40 provide a ton of gold.
---
If you are really in a dire position, you can try to grind on beasts for a bit and sell the leather. Or just wait for your mount, you'll probably have it by mid 40's pretty easy.
---
You give me 100g and I'll duel him all day long lol. Anyways that's still beside the point. You might have reading comprehension issues, but here it is again:
---
I told you your little streamers werent the best, and listed some actually good rogues. Then you got upset and confused thinking I was saying I was a top tier rogue and told me to duel payo for 100g lmao. Then I said he should duel one of the actual good rogues (lmgd, perp, etc etc). You continue to get angrier for some reason telling me I won't duel payo? 
---
Nowhere did I say anything about me being a top tier rogue or better than anyone here lol. This has nothing to do with me dawg, it's about payo and rogue that are actually good. Relax chief.
---
&gt; do you have very little intellect or something?
---
Hey now.
---
Why would a DDoSer be offered a job? Any disgruntled child with a parent's CC can pay dark web companies to DDoS.
---
Not right away. The supply from everyone stockpiling I bet won‚Äôt move it much. Most movement will be from buyers having more gold if anything. One the stockpiles run out then sell them if you hadn‚Äôt yet.
---
Are these the oozelings that can spawn from those oozes out in Hinterlands (or any ooze, I guess?) I remember getting a pet drop a few expansions back in retail, was blown away by the unexpected pet  but thought, damn, what a cool little guy
---
I mean fuck me, I just get paid to help prevent these kinds of attacks. Obviously I don't know anything about this topic so I should just go work at Starbucks.

What flavor would you like your coffee?

Is there any good discenchanting addon right now? The ones I'm using are using outdated tables it seems.

Bingo! It‚Äôs super fun to throw up the FW right in the locks face too.

Or if you‚Äôre a true baller you can try to time it right for the double fear break (need to cast it right as he fears, it breaks that fear and the wars stays for another one)

Because Human Warlocks are rare and chill the Gnome Warlock must be frustrating little nuggets to maintain balance.

i use it for PVE as a druid tank. I use it to AoE pull

That is good and all(trust me I'm playing rogue) but I'm talking about your OWN faction just standing on top of dinosaurs and spamming skin so when you loot they get it.

Hi?
---
My bad apparently my reading sucks I apologize
---
That's for the courts.
---
Courts found OJ innocent. No one really thinks he was.

I streamed Asmon daily until classic. He lost my sub over this. Well said.
---
The obvious answer is clear.
---
Half life 3 is confirmed
---
Yeah... I was in a hurry to type I guess
---
On reserve runs, the sole reason the person is running that dungeon vs. doing literally anything else is because they want *that* item.
---
They are doing everyone else a favor by telling similar classes that if they want that item as well, it would be better to run their own group.  Two 100% chances at getting an item if it drops is better than 50% or worse.
---
Oh yeah, my guild tried to do that, the 60 was fleeing from our raid and right when we were about to catch him after a few minutes run he disappeared right in front of our eyes into another layer.
---
Time to cancel Blizzard.
---
finally, thank you!! that explains a lot, but when did the change happened? i mean i remember them smaller in vanilla, am i crazy or the change happened later?
---
The hunter t2 looks especially comical on a Tauren.
---
No. Expansion till wrath then +, never ever repeating the shit in later exp
---
As long as you're not rolling on gear the clothies need there is no problem.
---
He deserves that run back x2 lol
---
Was it just literally one time?
---
Or was that a result of numerous attempts over a course of a day or two?
---
It sort of seems like jumping the gun a bit that early on in levels for a single example.
---
Where do you get this take? Because I see it paraded around here a lot but have no idea where it‚Äôs coming from.
---
You, the other guy, and literally every other single person that plays the game...
---
1TB hdd is a trap and should be illegal to sell. Go for a 128/250 SSD instead. Load times in wow/windows will be much better
---
Druids are not trash, but a vast majority will be spending their time healing in raids. Feral offtanks have their niche, but you likely won't see much love for Feral or Boomkin DPS in vanilla.

Hahahaha. The guy unquestioningly tolerating the existence of specs unviable for any situation is telling me to use my brain. 
---
Whole. Fucking. Circus.
---
Also you can enchant the same item over and over again. It replaces the enchantment each time with the new one but it still gives you the level up.
---
It will get boring man.
---
very helpful thanks !
---
I've really been enjoying these. Thank you!

thanks !

Yeah not like I know what I am talking about.

---
Ya but who the fuck wants to spend time in Gnomer every week for the rest of their wow career?
---
Sit crit isn't really a thing, and I hope this is some dungeon only taking build cuz this is a trashcan of a raid tank build. You'd be better off just going full fury with a couple points in defense.

We mustn't forget the rogues.

ah I see, I wondered why they were doing it, ty!

Piper perri?

Throw him in jail, let the pissed off inmates have their way with him
---
ESO made a controller layout that works well.  As I stated in another post, I wouldn't want to PVP against someone on KB+M, but for PVE, using a controller would be totally doable.
---
The reason they are necessary is the buffs act as a purge buffer infront of neccessary buffs instead of a shaman purging fort, shield, int. The purge is wasted on water breathing.
---
My glider back in the day was never banned, so they're not 100%. Aww, I miss that little guy
---
Wtf is melee cleave? Sounds retarded and much slower than a normal group.  How is having every melee tank their own mob more efficient? Is it just 4 warriors + a healer?  Maybe a feral druid?
---
This is going to get too much attention. Obviously a troll post. Mods need to close it.
---
Thanks for reminding me to get my eyes checked.
---
Before that there were no raid targets.  Does anyone else remember running MC and having to wait at Garr for 20 mins while everyone figured out their targets?
---
Imo, you are too far away from the mount to bother trying to grind the gold. You would be best off just continuing to quest and getting the mount at 41 or 42. Quests will start giving a lot of gold, so while grinding may be marginally faster, you will have probably gained an extra couple levels during that time, putting you ahead in the long run. That's my opinion, though, if you want the mount asap you can grind it out.
---
Not until wraith sadly! I don't know why blizzard was so hardcore on not allowing hair changes.
---
Has an abysmal droprate though :(
---
Well my grind spot was realistically averaging probably more like 15ish gold an hour tops. Last hour only spiked cause I got a really good boe blue.
---
Its a rep bar.. not an exp bar. Just move or deisable it
---
Bulllllllllshittttttttt. I remember being like 12 and acting like I was falsely banned for Botting lol
---
go reread this and try to pretend you're not the angry one here lol 
---
keep hating tho buddy if that makes you feel better
---
TBC raiding was the best the game has seen.
---
I want it.
---
Is that the one in Ashenvale? Just was there 30 minutes ago. :D
---
What is your plan for fighting 2-3 mobs? I would use shield before pulling, holy fire and shadow pain one mob, shadow pain the other two, use aoe fear (make sure you arent close to other packs of mobs). Then wand your holy fire target until dead, spam shield and renew on yourself, and use that that cooldown that makes things instant cast, use a big heal on yourself with that if you need to.
---
Make sure you have a good wand for your level. I have leveled a priest to 60 in discipline spec before so let me know if i can elaborate
---
I had a similar tale. Just a lvl 34-36 orc shaman on Grobulous in STV. Was killing animals for the Thessingway quest, (or however you spell it). I like to be rather neutral and heal other players and when I see an alliance player in trouble, I'll try to help out. From Stonetalon to Ashenvale, alliance would be over leveled in the zone and easy kill other horde players. I been hot and bothered by it, but now in STV where a party of Alliance just join together and killing other horde players (myself included) is where I boiled over. I went along the river into Duskwood and into the graveyard. I started killing several alliance players, but it didnt help. I knew I was becoming the player I hated and it would only make these players I'm killing want the same. I logged off for the night and when I logged on, I noticed Stitches walking along the road. I saw some alliance trying to stop and kill him. Watching as a large group gathered to stop him. I said fuck it and decided to join in, but from a distance. Casting lightning bolt from afar on Stitches; I had nothing to gain from helping and the alliance players could have turned on me wont Stitches had died and killed me with little mana afterwards. Once the undead was killed I ghost wolfed and left. I changed server shortly after to give myself a new start and to keep honor with Mak'gora. Loktar Ogar.
---
You may be right, im not sure what would be BiS since I haven't played smite on classic, but that 100+ healing power in the weapon is a waste that is probably replacing other nice stats, gonna give a search around loot tables
---
And most of them go to the barrens at some point.
---
Ok cool thanks!
---
I know your reasoning was different, but holy fuck is it nice always being with a 'lock for soulstone and water breathing while leveling up.  Underwater murloc kill quests?  no problem.  Dumpster diving in the bottom of a shipwreck?  'lock has you covered.  Accidentally pull a whole camp of red-level mobs?  Soulstone brings me back up and I pally res you.
---
**THE PROBLEM IS NOT HAVING TO GRIND MOBS BETWEEN QUESTS.**
---
Now then, hopefully we've gotten it through your thick skull that **THE PROBLEM IS NOT HAVING TO GRIND MOBS BETWEEN QUESTS.**
---
**THE PROBLEM COMES FROM THE GUIDE BEING HIGHLY UNOPTIMIZED, IGNORING USEFUL QUESTS, SENDING YOU ON LONG AND FRUITLESS EXPEDITIONS ONLY TO TURN AROUND TO WHERE YOU JUST WERE, HAS YOU HORDE NUMEROUS QUESTS THAT EVENTUALLY CAP YOU, HAVING TO HOLD ONTO QUEST ITEMS FOR MULTIPLE LEVELS FOR NO REASON.**
---
Now continue to promote a paid addon that lacks in many ways. I have a 38 hunter I tried using it on, and made a 2nd attempt on a 21 druid I'm currently playing, the addon is garbage. Download questie, grab quests, make a quick map for yourself and knock that shit out. It's asinine as fuck to have me complete 4 quests, run to Org to tape the Zep to UC to do 5 quests there, and then come back to Barrens to turn in those 5 quests while I was just fucking there.
---
Big EU server they‚Äôre still at 4-5g stack
---
This is my philosophy about it. No point stressing about it, if I raid I raid, if I don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt. Just drift about and do what sounds fun at the time.
---
Yep you can rent botnets with bitcoins now. Doesn't take any skill to do this, other guy is implying he built the botnet himself.
---
&gt; the healing meter would be nice to see for a raid
---
Even in a raid it's of little utility. There are so many variables that it rarely tells you anything about the individual healers. Maybe the melee or ranged healer had more to do than the other because of mechanics, or maybe it's a standard tank-n-spank so the MT healer is the only one with more than a couple renews. Maybe someone had way more dispels or interrupts. Maybe a disc priest had little actual healing because he just kept his groups shielded. Maybe a tank/OT failed to keep aggro and one of the healers had to keep backing off or running away‚Äîor just switch to tank mode if it was a paladin or druid.
---
Have yah looked at Britain lately they are looking more like us with their current situation.
---
someone get this guy a fucking puppers
---
What?  Why?
---
have you ever hit glad? Or done anything worth talking about? I'm guessing not.
---
The big issue with Hunters rolling for weapons is not that "every weapon is a hunter weapon", it is rather that there are actually pretty few items that are itemized for them. What is there outside of random greens "of the Monkey" itemized for Hunters during leveling ? Roughly nothing. Even the Uldaman polearm has strenght on it, alas only its high speed makes it a "hunter weapon". All the rest is unclear, and even today, 15 years after Vanilla's launch, people debate wether Ashkandi should go in priority to Warriors or to Hunters, so this issue continues into max level and raiding content. In the end the problem is just the very random itemization WoW had back then, which was well improved in BC.
---
Also, Sul'Thraze is absolutely terrible anyway, and there are way better weapons for Warriors out there than the two one handed swords, so if somebody makes a fuss about it he's probably exaggerating.
---
With the Gnomish World Enlarger (Engineering) which stacks with Nogglefogger elixir, as a gnome you can literally be a tiny spec on the screen its hilarious.
---
Probably tried to trick the afk system
---
I agree, he's definitely either fat or skinny.
---
That is a good point I am ugly in real life lol. I guess it if was just the hair or the skin, but that combo is a little odd isn't it? It is like an anime character that has been in the sun too long or something.
---
It's so bad as alliance. I just hid in the back of the area surrounded by horde and killed one satyr every five minutes.
---
Skirmishes tend to end up as all out server wars I've found.

I'm waling up an hour early at 4am to get some game time in every morning. Which is nice cause the zones aren't crowded. And I find some time to play each weekend, about 5 hours

I work in IT/Infosec.  Pretty sure the majority of cyber-criminals never get caught.  Mostly they catch the ones that brag about it.
---
No. Not really..
---
The guide said start attack macros don't work in classic - but I guess they do!
---
I would have followed that dude around until he logged out.
---
Don't you think the anime blue hair and the odd purple/red brused skin is an odd combo?
---
Those subreddits most certainly do exist 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_subreddit
---
They just aren‚Äôt popular, just like the subreddit they are asking me to use.  I decline your advice thank you though
---
Prob hentai forums.
---
1 players, one only on one character, the other on 4. Generally people multibox because it's OP as hell and they need all of the help they can get.
---
Seriously, it's like these people don't think about times when I'm leaning back with one hand on my balls and one hand on the keyboard. I need to be able to turn.
---
From Blizzards point of view the bans were very necessary. Its important for them to set the precedent early in Classics life that abusing shit will not be tolerated and you will be punished if you do so, that just because Blizzard fucked up that doesn't give the player free reign to do whatever he wants with their fuck up. Blizzard learned their lesson after the disaster that was the issues BFA had where they let the Alchemy bug abuse go with no bans, then swung the ban hammer hard over the xp bug abuse. If you dont show the community that you are serious about punishing abusers they will see it as Blizzard signing off that its okay to abuse future bugs/features.
---
Is Blizzard to blame for the issues Layering has caused? Yes there is zero doubt in that. But just because Layering has caused massive problems does not mean players have to abuse it, and the "well everyone does it to stay ahead" is such a weak ass argument it hurts to hear.
---
Also as far as we know non of the bans are permanent so the abusers should take their lickings and next time they encounter a bug will think twice before diving head first into it.
---
It's somewhere around 6GB.

DDoSing isn't actually hacking, it's just scripting. DDoSing is like treason, it's not hard, most people just aren't stupid enough to brag about doing it.

I'm married with a kid and I played Vanilla and Everquest back when they first came out.
---
Everquest was unforgiving and didn't hold your hand like a little kid.
---
Apparently, you never had any real hardship so a little in game harrassment is a *huge* deal to you.
---
Grow up.
---
I have the same problem. I‚Äôve drawn once since Classic released. T__T
---
You can, but it's best to get to level 5 first, because otherwise the walk to/from the inn takes more time than it saves.
---
Nah I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôll post it here thanks!
---
Cleave is nonsense for a tank, yes. But so is CC, even in a normal run. Funny when there‚Äôs a guy marking targets in something like wailing caverns.
---
I dont understand how to remove poisons when I'm level 40 with first aid. The powerful antivenom only works on 35 and below and the next level up requires killing level 55 beasts for the venom sacks. Am i missing something or can I just not remove poisons from level 35 until im 60?
---
Sure. Keep me posted since I‚Äôm going for that build too XD. 
---
I do like the 100 hp since in pvp you always pop some heals.
---
I would certainly go with something like the second option if posting in guild chat or somewhere else that I expected to only ask once. It is a little long to clutter up general/lookingforgroup with if I'm going to be posting it every three minutes while I look for a tank.
---
I would use a shorter format for those channels. If I only need one gem, I would be sure to specify that.
---
I often discuss loot after people join the party if they didn't talk about it when they initially responded. Since I'm a shaman it's important to clarify what items I'll be rolling on so that no one is surprised if I roll on cloth robes for a healer set, or if I'm healing but already have the best healing items from this dungeon and want to roll on Enhancement gear, or whatever. This way we can work out disagreements before getting to the dungeon.
---
I typically don't full-on reserve items myself, because I think it would be hard to put together a party if, for example, I reserved the Robes of Arugal in SFK. That would exclude basically all cloth wearers, and make finding a party take much longer.
---
I don't know why I called it shoot. But its basically a macro that allows me to spam Mind Flay without canceling the channel.
---
/cast \[nochanneling:Mind Flay\] Mind Flay
---
I do the same thing leveling my enchanting. Sure i can cast the same enchant 30 times on a single piece of gear, but i need time to gather materials for the next 30 enchants anyways so i give them away to people i run dungeons with or for free. some people tip alot
---
Do it to sell runs for other warlocks. That's what I did in vanilla.

As I said in another thread, I highly doubt they cared about the census, it's much more likely they were after some other addon that maybe was auto spamming invites or something of the sort.

Collateral damage is unfortunately inevitable in a case like this.

I‚Äôm totally down for letting Jesus take the wheel, but...
---
The first few times you do that fight you‚Äôre really going to have 8 warriors with enough T3 for that bonus? Seems unlikely to me. I‚Äôll admit once everyone has T3 warriors will win out on it, but at that point you‚Äôve had Naxx on farm.
---
Thank you! So do you :)
---
Can we throw him in to the molten metal lake in Iron Forge?
---
No point in going shadow before you can get shadowform,  best to go Wand Spec, then Spirit Tap then holy or disc until 40 or 45 respec to shadow and back into wand spec.
---
Greater magic wand is good, at 19 you can get a quest reward wand for BFD for horde and I think there was a simular power wand for alliance around the same level.
---
So I'm a 42 Druid and have been listening to advice about grinding 100g for my mount. Do I need anything other than 100g? Can I choose any lvl 40 mount available to horde? I just know I need 100g and need to be lvl 40. I have no idea where to go to buy or check out the different kind of mount options. Thanks for helping a scrub!
---
thousands of people spamming /who in the background was probably eating into their bandwidth
---
It'll run, just not particularly well. Probably capable of 30-ish fps on low as long as you're not doing anything with a lot of people around.
---
more likely than you think
---
Dont do it. It's just something pathetic people do because they need the advantage.
---
What do you mean this time around, there have been stupid people in every game since the first multiplayers, vanilla wow was no exception
---
It is okay to use if you do not have aimed shot yet.

Agree. Get to level 5 then log out in which ever factions noob zone inn.

Are you really more concerned about some rusty old bus than the natural breasts of the beach front it would ruin!?
---
All you can do is appeal. If you appealed and they denied it, then I'm simply going to have to believe Blizzard on this one. The tools they use to verify botting are pretty sophisticated and don't net false-positives that often, and when there are false-positives they are able to identify this pretty easily. And considering this is the third post I've seen related to this, I can only assume a ban wave has hit and we're starting to see the fallout.
---
Tl;dr: Nobody here can help you, appeals are the only avenue of addressing this, and I suspect nobody will believe you. If you truly believe you are innocent, send in another appeal. That's the best you can do.
---
Whats funny about this is that actually, yes, if you plan to PvP you should re-roll to Engineering.
---
That name got me a giggle.
---
Motw at least. I can be stingy with my thorns.

Serves basically the same purpose but in a different way. Aap is just install and go and its guide is basically built in and maintained by its author. Guidelime is more like a framework for other users to create their own leveling guide for in game use. Here is a list of the guides available for guidelime https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime/wiki/GuideList

telling me to grow up and youre trying to identify porn gifs while youre in a loveless marriage with a child. This would be hilarious if it wasnt so genuinely sad

AHHHH! the suspense is killing me !
---
If I was the leader I'd kick everyone who spammed chat with "grats" every time someone gains a fucking level.
---
Who the hell had an UI this clean 15 year ago?!
---
Cleave groups in general seem to be awful. I joined a few in ZF while leveling and it seems overall slower than just having a normal group. Sure, the mobs die really fast, but after all the time wasted with forming "optimal" groups, having said groups fall apart again and again, and the fact that it's a lot easier to wipe, it just seems like a giant meme. Sure it works really well for top players, but for pugs I bet the xp/hr (and actual enjoyment) is much better just forming normal groups and farming the dungeon.
---
I have the fear bugs, if you fear someone out front of the sm arm portal 9/10 times if they head behind the portal they will get stuck behind a weapon rack and need to hearth. Happened to me 3 times so far, the last time it got me booted from the group because they didn‚Äôt want to wait. Being alliance sucks for sm lol
---
Yep. Sloth and Greed do not work together in WoW like OP wishes.
---
'Finna' itself would more accurately be associated with the black community or urban slang. Black and Southern slang has a lot of overlap, but its still not exactly matching.
---
He's not wrong. This wasn't a script kiddy. This was an exploitive attack. Cute comment chain though.
---
I've actually been very good this year, haven't used macros, or even Auto run to trick the AFK systems. Just good old coming back in a panic every 5 minutes to hit the space bar. I haven't even been using RDP to stay signed in like some people either.
---
As a tank I have to tell you you're wrong. I am a prot warrior and I completely depend on you to heal me. 
---
I have two large defensive cooldowns, one is a 10 minute CD(last stand - 20% max hp for 30s), the other is a 30 minute CD(shield wall 75% dmg reduction for 15s)
---
And shield block which gives 75% chance to block 1 auto attack, on a 6s CD, and costs 20 rage. I have no defense against magic damage,  and the only way I can heal myself is with potions, which are on a 2 minute cd.
---
This is vanilla wow, there is no active mitigation like bfa, and until I'm level 60 and raid geared I am not crit immune (unlike retail where all tanks are crit immune by default)
---
All that being said 3s seems like an exaggeration.  They should live longer that unless they pulled way too much, or are undergeared or not wearing a shield. A shield may provide 10-15% additional damage reduction from armour. Plus block chance.
---
If they're a tank, proper level, and geared for the content you're running and you're still having trouble. You might want to consider using lower ranks of heals for faster cast times. Downranking is a necessity in vanilla wow.
---
Yes I agree. Seems fishy to me. I missed the part where he said he did appeal and the ban stayed so I doubt it was for a remote link hahahah guy was cheesing the game somehow and got banned. I‚Äôve been banned for bullshit reasons in a lot of games and nothing has ever stuck after I‚Äôve appealed it when I‚Äôve honestly been doing nothing wrong. This guy really was doing something wrong if he appealed it and it stuck Hahahaha my first post was a waste
---
Pretty much make friends with someone who can remove poisons unfortunately!
---
Gauntlets of Divinity on the gnome as well. That gnome's got some great hardware.
---
When I could equip it immediately and he couldn't? Not a right but that's more of a courtesy thing. But hey, read into how you want and get angry over it.
---
Stop inventing excuses for why it wasn't him. You have no basis for any of it other than wild speculation.
---
Rested XP maxes out at 1.5 levels, and it takes 10 days of being logged out in an inn/city to accumulate that. You gain 5% of a level for every 8 hours.
---
It's a nice perk, but not really efficient to try and *only* play when you have rested XP, unless you have a very large stable of alts to rotate through. I can gain a hell of a lot more than 1.5 levels in 10 days.
---
I just like the idea of backstab improved sprint against mages, you know there are a ton of mages because of aoe farming
---
I would use whatever isnt off cooldown. However if you wanna be safe, ths shrink ray and battle chicken wont have any negative effects on you since your a caster
---
So it looks as though Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer is not crosslayer. So if someone announces they are turning in the Ony head, ask them for an invite to get on their layer.

Rogues are one of the harder classes to level IMO because they have very little regen it takes awhile to get your full utility kit. It smooths out once you pick up your poisons and your stealth gets upgraded. Best bet is just to focus mobs one at a time and preferrable slightly below your level. And keep lots of food and bandages, you will need lots of breaks.

I got it for 1g on my server, saw it listet for 2-6g

I had some random hunter ask me if I had meat for his pet. I gave him 5 Tangy Clam meat, hope the kitty liked it.

WHATS YOUR GEARSCORE
---
I want lvl 60 kharazan, it was meant for vanilla anyway, so why not go through with it.
---
DJ fel fire on the beats
---
yeah right? 15 minutes/ hour. There are worse things. Like farming soul shards. Ugh
---
Well, that is just rude of them to do so, but no nothing of the sort. No bots, macros, shady addons, nothing. Just normal play, normal dungeon grinding resets, kind in game etc. Will reply to those when I do LFM and apologize if I can't invite them.
---
I would trade a set of phase 6 BiS gear to be in good health any day of the week.  You can have fun without being the most hero on the block.  I love my time in wow as a nameless nobody.  I get to fell like I'm just part of the world.  I have no commitments  - I just do what I want in-game, when I want.
---
I already have one job, and it's IRL and I get paid for it.  I don't need a second job (and competitive WoW is absolutely a second job).
---
This is really cool! Awesome work my dude
---
Lol ooh big boy huh?
---
This is true. I mind controlled a Scarlet Champion the other and and lo and behold, he had something very similar to Crusader Strike!
---
You are aware Britain is in Europe right? You just said European countries are about as similar to each other as Europe is to the US.
---
If you lack Burning Steppes or Searing Gorge flight paths, you can fly to Loch Modan and then ride into Badlands and then into Searing Gorge and pick up the Thorium Point FP, then ride to Blackrock Mountain.  
---
Or you can fly to Lakeshire and ride into Burning Steppes and pick up the FP at Morgan's Vigil, then ride to Blackrock Mountain.

&gt;Is that the one that's written in Spirit? OoooWWOoo talk.

Yeah it's a "Guide to Spirit Speak" or something, and it's just full of "oOooOOooOOOOoooOOoooOOooo"

This is awesome man!

It does when your attacks are based off max weapon dmg
---
Are you me I was in arathi doing water quest cussing not being undead because I literally had to pull every monster to the surface.
---
Holy paladins deal dmg through judging things like Wisdom on the boss for mana regen purposes for the raid.
---
Dude, I love you. You made my day. &lt;3
---
Running Scholo and Strat runs forever, as god intended
---
I wish that were true fam, you wont catch me in /4 saying inv for layer hop. I have enjoyed seeing friendly faces I once saw before after leveling up a bit.
---
You can really tell when a game, story, or art are made by people who grew up playing DnD. There's just that detail-first approach to environment and mechanics that shines through.
---
Certainly.  If your computer has *tremendously more* hardware than is needed to run a game on maximum, lowering your settings is not going to do a damn bit of thing on the overall heat.
---
The issue that you are missing is that laptops, despite what people think, are *not* for gaming.  There is no way you can cram the hardware into a thin laptop and expect not to generate heat when running it.  I don't care what laptop says "perfect for gaming" they are going to run hot without proper cooling, and there just isn't enough room in one for A) a proper cooling unit and B) proper ventilation.
---
A lot of laptops have ventilation on the bottom, which is about as worthless as my boss because the thing is resting on a surface.
---
My laptop literally can run 20 separate entities of WoW at the same time without skipping a beat on max settings.  It has nothing to do with the fucking heat.
---
The only thing you said that was right was that I need a cooling fan underneath which I do.  However, that is a walkaround.  And I asked OP about how hot their laptop got running WoW because I guarantee there is some heat generated to the touch somewhere on that laptop externally.
---
i dont have any flight pats south of the northern part of eastern kingdsoms, except for STY. Tips ?
---
It's because lower damage like DOTS have a much smaller chance than large damage hits.
---
Hey OP, I get ya.
---
No :(
---
His point is you are both making obvious point.
---
What's the cast bar addon?
---
Weave taps into your dps rotation. Don't wait until the fight is over. This helps the healer manage regen, to ensure less time is wasted drinking.
---
While leveling, go dark pact and use imp as a mana battery :-) Tbh. you should just go a drain tank build with DP, and heal yourself if you have to life tap. Works perfectly, and you still do sick dps.
---
That double post.
---
Thanks guys!
---
This is the truth. If you run away I either chase it down leaving the other mobs to quickly aggro someone else or I leave you to deal with the mob. I usually just make a judgement call based on number of mobs running towards the person or the amount of health it/then have
---
One less idiot free to roam the earth
---
Back in vanilla pre Naxx me as a prot warrior jumped a guy that was attacking my friend in STV, Keep in mind i was decked out in full epic etc. But prot warriors apperantly do not do any damage at all! And if there is 4 healers at lvl 30-40... Yeah i would have died if the guild mage didn't come by to rape em :P
---
Nice projection. I think the guy that needs the therapist is the one with the obvious porn addiction. 
---
Also I have plenty of hobbies that include physical activity. Like you have your incessant wanking, I have MMA, running, and enjoying not being in a loveless marriage.
---
My point is if you ask nicely instead of just demanding it, there isn't anything wrong with that.
---
I'm still with faerlina I feel that 3k will drop but if I did switch I'd go rattlegore no wait even at prime time

Hahaha no troll here fam, if I could figure out how to work reddit and post screen shots I would. Of said e-mail, time left till playable, ticket answer from blizz, etc.
---
Remember that this is over the course of the *entire* fight and is an average
---
The United States does this too.
---
At 60, in vanilla, I would look at the stats (int/spell power) then the speed. I wanted a rather fast wand for raiding for wanding back mana on judgement of wisdom. DPS wasn't a big deal, it was for stats and getting mana back.
---
At lower lvls, look at the dps.
---
I'm a tank. I'm sorry. But also thank you. Never bringing a hunter in my BRD pugs
---
Do u have the auto loot feature enabled in your settings?
---
You aren't overloading on healers if your ret DPS is just a wet noodle. You just end up bringing another holy pally to the raid instead of a dead DPS slot. Healing gear is going to be much less contested than plate dps gear anyways so don't tell me it would be better for gear prioritization. He said in the post you would be just as good to stand in mele range with a healer to get mana back with judgments but would lose dps on trash without going ret. I would much rather lose 5 seconds on a trash pull and have an extra healer than a useless ret pally standing there and casting cleanse the whole fight that can't throw a significant heal.
---
Uh huh.  
---
It is thing for those rightly banned to spread misinformation in hopes of an appeal to emotion of the player base to get them to on your side to revert bans.
---
TBC was when i quit
---
Came back for wrath and stayed until 2 weeks into Cata
---
Came back for classic
---
Will quit again if TBC is a thing (probably), would much prefer kara in classic+ and hyjal etc
---
They should make the dark portal like gates of AQ, if the playerbase really wants tbc, should make em work towards opening or closing it
---
Unlimited Powah
---
I'm a filthy casual, why would a healer need multiple binds for one spell?
---
Gotta get my fun as a lock in before good pvpers have their shadow reflect trinkets.
---
Love this!
---
Alchemy is obviously where the money is.
---
Yes and no say it‚Äôs a guild group going for ubrs key they need a random dps I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine to reserve those gems. Now on the loot side I see the appeal of it but you lose a lot of players when you state recipe reserved or specific item reserved because most people won‚Äôt waste time on that run unless they don‚Äôt need it.
---
Lol even when I was 12 I didn't care to bot, I enjoy playing to do it all myself. I did not bot fam, sorry.
---
Got a link?
---
My bad, but i had it happend to me when u go to stm fp, fly over it to go to darkshore, then fly back down to  land in stm :p
---
Very well could. I think I still have a level 16 green on in some slot...
---
It was also a fight with a pally that led me to this question. I dropped their HP to probably 25% before they were near but they just used a bubble and LoH. But in that situation what do I do, just run? Still feel like the sustain is lacking against a class that can heal.
---
They probably hired him.
---
I personally switched to Heartseeker. It has low pop in the mornings, medium closer to the evening, and we even hit high pop at night sometimes. It‚Äôs a growing server that is fun to play on!
---
idk, youre the one with the kid. Ask him. Make sure you wash your hands off first though. God knows youve wanked in the last 5 min judging by your post history and porn obsession.
---
I never heard of any level requirement for bank alts.  My assumption was that as long as you are actively logging into the character it won't get auto-flagged and the name become available to someone else.
---
Oh. Good luck tanking in greens without a guild willing to endure that.
---
Can anyone recommend an EU server without queues where I can start a horde character? I never played horde in vanilla, so I would like to try it. Recommendations for a friendly and mature guild would be an extra bonus.
---
I'm literally not even reading your messages.
---
Just enjoying a laugh at your expense.
---
You better run boy, that's the sound of a rogue coming to gank your scrub ass again.

You should tell your Mom how people on the internet are being mean to you in a video game.

You're so salty.

During leveling, warriors can roll on any weapon that's an upgrade. I would recommend you being fury dual wield or protection shield spec if you roll on 1h. Arms would be better with 2hand I believe.
---
Will do, unfortunately they aren't the type to disclose why or what happened that resulted in this situation, ToS is very grey.

That should just be assumed for every opinion unless stated otherwise

I'm playing on a PvP server and was part of a big battle the other day. Before we engaged, people in my party told me to enable my PvP flag, so I did. I'm so confused as to what this does. Why do I have the option to enable/disable my PvP flag on a PvP server? I was under the assumption that being on a PvP server meant that it was engaged at all times. I looked around on google and couldn't find an answer for this.

You're not wrong, but by 60, most PVE rotations are 3 to 5 buttons.  It could be done, it might be messy, but could get a useful set up.
---
Hmm...makes me want to map a wow to a controller for shits and giggles.
---
6month ban for auto run seems a bit steep though...
---
 I left my character auto running in the barrens once for like an hour when I went to get food. Does that mean I shouldn‚Äôt be able to play for 6 months?
---
&gt; Some of these posts seem like Dunning-Kruger in action.

I find it seriously humorous that people think EVERY MC raid will be the 100% ideal min max comp.

Oh...you think stealth is your ally. But you merely adopted the stealth;I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see the unstealthed  until I was already a Shadowblade,by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING! The shadows betray you, because they belong to me!

Nowhere near as good as 25% stun or WoTf. Seriously, fucking orc warlock/UD mage is ez mode for pvp.

I think you are posting this thread in an attempt to skip a step where mods post a poll hoping this thread will gain attention and force the mods hand.
---
Wait how did you make money off engineering? It is a goldsink, but a super useful profession to have.
---
Do quests in Thousand Needles or Stonetalon. You'll get plenty of wool.
---
Will there be paid server transfers at some point in the future? I'm on earthfury and can only run dungeons from 8pm to like 5 am so it seems to be hard to find a lot of people on at those hours. I'd like to transfer to a higher pop server in a month or 2.
---
I don‚Äôt go into dungeons worrying about how long it‚Äôs gonna take this isn‚Äôt retail I expect hours long slots through dungeons wipes etc. I‚Äôm not here to blow shit up for loot because that‚Äôs how others prefer to play.
---
Ferda!
---
Are you serious? $900+ a month!
---
I was that kid

holy fire rank 8?

what do you mean? classic bosses have less armor on average

55war here, still have WW axe, life is pain
---
I've been playing daggers up to 30 primarily 'cause I find higher damage/stat bonus daggers way more often than swords.

Right, I was able to spend it all on armoursmithing.  I bet I spent that hundred gold, but the most I‚Äôve ever had was 14.
---
And rocket boots and parachute cloak and mind control and shrink ray
---
Are you Horde or Alliance and which zone were you in? Each faction have some friendly zones where the pvp is not automatically on. For example, If you are alliance it‚Äôs not possible no venture to the orc starting zone and kill all level 1 orcs, even if you are on a pvp server.
---
The mods remove memes? Certainly doesnt seem like it..
---
I doubt the API supports this.

Hey, why aren't you helping the guild do more Jed/Rend runs instead of posting on Reddit?

You need to help me farm more Sulfuron Ingots, Mand.

I read some of the books when I was younger in my wc3 days. I‚Äôve had the chronicles as they‚Äôve been released and they‚Äôre great books for any diehard lore nerd.

While the writing is certainly good enough and nothing I‚Äôm gonna complain about, truly I‚Äôm a sucker for the art.
---
As a tank, when WF procs and the shaman pull, 9 times out of 10 I'm just going to switch mobs. The shammy is beefy enough to offtank a mob, and he'll have it dead in the next 4 seconds anyway.
---
A lot of people don't see the hidden benefit of melee dps in dungeons. You pretty much have two tanks for trash.
---
As long as everyone is focusing fire and the healer is keeping up, let your dps hold and burst down a mob.
---
I also switched to dual wield for a few levels in the 20's and it was a ton of fun until I found a suitable 2Hander to switch to. Keep doing you. Although the biggest change for me has been using Sunder instead of Heroic Strike while killing things. So much better and not constantly rage starved. Good luck!
---
Make sure you have crip poison on a well. Garrotte and Rupture with deadly poison on off hand will help burn him down until you can get your hands back on him, but it's a bad trade off for ambush and some gouge backstab action.
---
Youre right, its the point I made in response to your question
---
If the point of a sub is to generate legitimate discussion memes greatly detract from the ability to do that. They are low effort quickly consumed content that is upvoted frequently for those reasons. They tend to drown out all other kinds of posts.
---
Honestly a lot of retail players shouldn't play classic. I've heard way too much whining from retailer players who felt they had to play classic because it was the new big thing and then approached it with their BFA mindset. These are people who need guiderails and constant rewards every second. They get into Classic and have a miserable time and then go turn off other people who would enjoy it.
---
To me this seems like something that is guaranteed to roll 1400+ if you accidentally click it when fighting a mob and are at 90% health, and then guaranteed to heal four fifths of fuck all when you need it, as evidenced by your picture.
---
I wouldn't put myself through the pain of that rollercoaster.
---
According to blizzard.
---
Yeah this is why leveling Engineer pays off !
---
This, you don't need more than 2 brain cells to turn on the LOIC.
---
They're just dumb.
---
Yeah I get the having fun part but why make thoses weird excuses to pvp? My problem is with this weird mindset of "oh someone did x to me so I'll do x to someone else". But meh, people should have the freedom to play as they please, but I don't know, makes me feel weird when I think about the WoW community, well whenever I think about the WoW community I feel weird anyways that is just adding to the pyre I guess.  Anyways who cares about that... Buuut... About that war definition... I take some issues with that, lmao... Here's a link with a more accurate definition: https://www.britannica.com/topic/war
---
Same tired of hunters rolling need on every single item.
---
Of all fights why would you link baron parses? Any melee doing good damage on that fight is tanking multiple ticks of inferno and not getting targeted by living bomb. I‚Äôm not saying Ret paladins do outstanding dps but linking a fight like that as an example of a ‚Äúpure st fight‚Äù really shows a lack of understanding.
---
He called me ugly over the internet, big victory!
---
I get frustrated dealing at work on a daily basis with know-it-alls who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about but continue to spread these false-truths among others.  Bit of a pet peeve of mine.
---
But having said that, you are right, I do.
---
You can accuse me of whatever you like, but I have no means to get any advantage over anyone for anything. I am not blaming since there is no way for me to really know what exactly caused this, my best guess is this as its the only thing in the last 13 years I haven't done before.
---
Happened to me and about 7 of my guildies today aswell. Alliance on Gehennas EU
---
You find them when they are low health and drinking.  Or AFK on the road in Ashenvale...
---
Good luck doing anything at end game when no tanks are leveled. You aren‚Äôt clearing MC without tanks. Fucking mages...
---
did you not have any melee in the group or were they just bad? even tanks crush dps at lower levels
---
I've been told by multiple of my veteran vanilla friends , people who kept playing private servers for years and cleared naxx multiple times, that even 1 boomkin in a raid is not as much damage as 1 extra mage wouldve been in the raid :(
---
You could just test it with a low lvl enchant for now, but other people have reported it works fine in Classic.
---
Holy mother of god
---
Now, I don‚Äôt care if the clothies need it.  I need it too.
---
&gt; Healing gear is going to be much less contested than plate dps gear
---
Fun fact, even some ret paladin bis isn't plate. I'm 53 and in my ret gear set I have all of 2 plate pieces.  
---
also please tell me how an Azuresong Mageblade isn't contested.
---
&gt; Probably tried to trick the afk system
---
&gt; Just good old coming back in a panic every 5 minutes to hit the space bar.
---
So yes, then. Not a bot or automated program, but still intentionally bypassing a system that Blizzard has in place specifically to remove people who aren't playing, to let in people who are waiting to play.
---
i think the biggest reason to go swords is the gaurenteed quest items that are very good while daggers requires getting lucky on drops to have a good one
---
There will be plenty of casual raid guilds that won‚Äôt care if you can only show up for 1 raid and can‚Äôt contribute outside of that time. Just keep searching for guilds and be honest with their recruiting officer about when you can play.
---
Anyone know how pet exp works? Do you want to fight mobs near your level or near the pets level?
---
Yeah thats not a thing
---
I think the QS book is in Dire Maul, correct me if I'm wrong. So yeah, next phase.
---
The dictionary definition of hacking is "the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer." DDoSing makes no attempt to access data, it's more like if you automated a thousand cars to go stop at the entrance to the Disneyland parking lot so that no actual visitors could get in. Hacking would be if they had broken into Blizzard's database and stolen personal info about players or the company itself.
---
Araxom actually does a lot through Reddit.
---
Sweeping strikes is going to do reliably better DPS than the proc off of ravager. Additionally I believe the WW axe provides something like an additional 30 AP. Yes you can cancel the proc off of ravager but the +3 damage of ravager is mitigated by the 30 AP on WW axe and the GCD interrupts caused by proc. This has been theory crafted pretty extensively on the warrior discord and the consensus generally seems to be your going to get higher dps sub 5 targets with the WW axe.
---
Druidchads rise up
---
Unfortunately best guesses are all we got with Blizzard and bans. It is against their ToS to tell you what caused it as far as I am aware. Using my best guesses here, trying to help others avoid a potential 6 month ban.
---
DNg that‚Äôs awesome, good for you man! I‚Äôm having a blast fishing. It is so relaxing and he landscapes you can fish in are amazing. Good way to just relax at the end of a night or when you are on the phone
---
So stupid. Its a totally different game. Ghosttown.
---
I heard you need to delete system32 for it to work, otherwise it just closes your game.
---
Can confirm that is genuinely the case. Never messed me up this bad tho.
---
why...do you talk....like this....
---
I waved at a troll in booty bay and he followed me around for 5 minutes spamming/spit
---
\*Laughs in Undead\*
---
Man honestly if you enjoy the game the just play it to have fun. You will still be able to get a lot out of it just by doing dungeons for gear and what not. It sucks not to be able to raid during progression, but you can always do a catch up when it's on farm for most people. There are other cool things to do outside of endgame as well. If you enjoy PvP then you can start getting a twink ready for the bg phase. And if nothing else just play the game like an rpg and do some of the wild quests that take you all over the world.
---
Instead of insulting somebody, if you feel a different fight is more representative, why not just link it? Your comment says more about you than it does about me
---
I did BRD last night for the first time in 15 years and this is why I love it and appreciate it. It's a maze, it's massive, and it feels alive. Modern dungeons are so incredibly linear. BRD is full of hidden rooms, wandering mobs, optional bosses, etc. It's intimidating and daunting.
---
No they didnt. Also, they baked it into the TOS. You agree to let them do it.  No lawsuit or court order prevents you from agreeing to let them do it.
---
Doesnt matter for DM because spellcleave isn't mostly viable until later.
---
I didn't make my first jump either...
---
I hear this song in my head when I'm about to kill some alliance on my lock
---
_If you have to be told which end to stick em with, you haven‚Äôt been paying attention_
---
True. I mean shit, more power to you if you can make it work. A rotation wont be too bad, I guess I'm really just used to playing a certain way. Im kind of curious to try it now myself.
---
Whoa.....not part of the deal. I took that to mean that amount of health I was lacking upto 1500.
---
Engineering is best spec for PvP hands down and there are lots of stuff that isn't unpredictable like bombs for example.If you wanna focus on PvP then yeah go Eng (get both gnomish ,then goblin specializations  )
---
No blizzard employee is going to overule the ban AND appeal because you posted a sob story to reddit.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say, but I‚Äôve raided as both sword and dagger and it‚Äôs the same.
---
What level do those quests become available?
---
I could go for some Weffles n Serap.
---
He's got a one slot prison pocket.
---
Never knew about that potion. That actually sounds hilarious to use.
---
If you‚Äôre opening with cheap shot you need to gouge right after. If you delay it just right they‚Äôll blink but be gouged. After that you can chose what you‚Äôd like to do. 
---
Improved sprint from combat tree is generally the best way to deal with being able to stay on the target.  This is harder to get if you‚Äôre playing Hemo. But is part of the better all around dagger PvP spec. 
---
If you‚Äôre leveling. Avoid the mage and just go for the low hanging fruit when you can.
---
Why are you shooting Mankrik in the dick?
---
Are you leveling? Because you are probably combat then and it kinda sucks.
---
But in short: Cheapshot, and expect the blink, either move as if he will blink or try get a gouge in with batching.
---
He blinks, you follow him, he tries to poly? You blind him before he gets it off, if you can't blind then sprint vanish and get him kidney'd before he gets you out. This will trigger a iceblock. 
---
When the iceblock ends you should get a gouge on him every time. This you can follow with some damage from the full combo points you get at this point. 
---
From this on the mage has small cd on blink, you have no cooldowns. Rogue should have a good chance here without the use of prep/coldsnap, and if you use both you have an even bigger chance because prep is better than coldsnap.
---
Well I've been playing a shaman so maybe not a great comparison, but he did beat a hunter, warrior tank, and druid.
---
I've seen people pay $25+ for a small custom icon, much more for larger drawings.
---
We can‚Äôt abandon them. We must keep the twins together!
---
best vasectomy ever bro.
---
Yes, that would be better. 
---
No, it's not needed. I crit for 600-700 on average with ambush. Then a couple SS, evis, and I'm very surprised if the target isn't dead. Like ambush hits so hard that it's insane
---
Priests are really efficient levelers.  The most important thing for leveling a spriest is getting a really good wand, and the second most important thing is getting tons of spirit.  If you take tailoring enchanting you can make your own wand, but it isn't too hard to keep a wand up if you ask guildies/look up wand progression on google.
---
Take wand specialization and spirit tap asap, pull with 2-3 damage spells, then wand the mob to death while your damage over time ticks.  This lets you regen the mana you spent on the spells while fighting, and you basically never have to drink unless you overpull and get in trouble.
---
Shamans are honestly better tanks than warriors at RFC level. Hold aggro easier, and you're not taking enough damage for it to really bother your priest.
---
A warrior gets benefit from weapon damage and on hit affects. A Hunter (who is presumably at range) does not get any benefit from weapon damage or on hit affects from melee weapons.
---
I fail to see how you could think both classes get the same value from these items.
---
You crying about your guild outleveling you isn't relevant to his question. You could leave that part out and get the same result.
---
Ah that‚Äôs okay, just enjoy your time in the game. How much you enjoy the game will be mostly dictated by the people you play with, and how much room for fun you leave yourselves.
---

Omg that was me! [https://imgur.com/tf0lU9z](https://imgur.com/tf0lU9z)

I remember flying out of Dalaran and getting moonfired by a druid to get knocked off my mount and sent falling to my doom. Oh the good days.
---
It‚Äôs very nice for things like mocking blow when taunts on Cd and a monster charges a healer.
---
Mulgore and Teldrassil always get me...
---
The coast north of booty bay and I spent a decent amount of time running the coast of feralas hitting the various pools and I wanna say there were 2-3 wreckages
---
take a look at this dipshit redditor!
---
Me thinks he was watching too much blacklist and thought he was going to be wined and dined by a IRL raymond reddington.
---
I play a Rogue and am thinking about rolling a Tank as well...not 'cause I don't like the Rogue (I LOVE THE ROGUE AND THE ROGUE LOVES ME) but 'cause I haven't Tanked in the past.
---
If I did I wouldn't be worrying much about getting them all super geared bad ass 60 epic-y...mainly a dude that'll help Tank mid level instances for fun.
---
On the German servers, at least on Lucifron Chuck slowly gets replaced by Keanu. Same jokes, different meme.
---
I like Chuck more.

They attacked the login servers.  Retail players were also effected.

This just in: Twitch streamers do things to catch your attention.

Who gives a fuck?

No thnx.

Goblin stuff tends to cause damage when it fails, and Gnomish stuff tends to be silly when it fails.  =P

Tell one your warlocks you don‚Äôt need 3 warlocks

The spirit of vanilla pvp is alive!
---
I got a similar thing:
---
I never meet people IRL who's as hardcore and committed to gaming as I am, or even more. But online, I see people much more committed than I am, all the time.
---
I mean if you want to slog through hour+ dungeons for no reason, have at it.
---
I'm going to be running them fast and efficient and not wiping at all, because I don't have 2 hours to waste on one shit-fest of a dungeon when I get home.
---
Necessary Seinfeld
---
Yeah it levels up relatively fast but still takes a few hours if it's five levels below
---
I sense the meta is strong in you.
---
Have fun with the race to 60 while the folks playing to enjoy the game take their time avoiding trash players with opinions like yours :) Cheers!
---
You are right moonkins were never brought in. There were like Ret paladins, a big joke.
---
I find I just have two seperate gears and just bank if im going feral/tank or healer (spirit/int)
---
Some asked if I was botting in a tell the other day, said I was "Running Sideways on my mount"...which is something I've seen others doing, but didn't actually do myself, so its probably a weird lag bug, but dude thought I was botting cause the game rendered my mount sideways...
---
Because cursing in response to a calm post doesn't show you as being angry and or childish? Dude I get that you're a shaman player and you took it as I was shitty cause it was a shaman getting it but that wasn't it at all. 
---
And yes it is a courtesy thing to pass on an item you can't immediately use even if you need it to someone else that does and can. I was just lamenting that I've ran it that many times trying to get the specific things a warrior wants from there and to have that happen. To another warrior who also has ran it plenty trying to get his items and hasn't been able to. So please get off your high horse.
---
Ya I just personally couldn't do it.
---
Okay so you just want to be a pretentious dick
---
I see.
---
If it was something you said in-game, the email wouldn't of said botting...
---
Just trying to explain to you / the others that see this that I am not the type to try to achieve some type of unfair advantage in the form of exploiting or cheating. I have done what I can with the appeals.
---
*laughs in Jagex
---
I only paid 75 silver for the recipe, so I'm not too upset. I figure it will pay off one day. 
---
I mean, it's 3 stacks to turn it into a profit.
---
How do you think groups get started?
---
Yes and no. There is a non insignificant chance he ends up with a job (after a heavy fine) because of this.
---
You are the best Reddit Psychologist around.. for the note Dr. Dickhead, i‚Äôm interested in multiboxing because I paid for a months sub for my brother and he quit the game 6 levels in - now I have 2 accounts with a month on them and nothing to do.
---
So wanna make any other blatantly false assumptions?
---
Yeah that's what I was going to suggest.
---
The people that watch give 'cause they think it's going to get them fucked.
---
A boomkin will never do as much damage as a mage, but boomkin damage plus the bonuses to other casters may make up for it?
---
I only did beginning of AQ, never Naxx. Server-first BWL kills. I mained a warrior back then, so I can't be sure.
---
Whew buddy you dodged a bullet there. Those are the type of petty people that can be really cancerous in WoW. Creating their own microcosm of brain-think eventually leading to people not towing the line being screwed over in a big and usually publicly shaming fashion.
---
We did it! Just like how we caught the Boston bomber!
---
You had to use more adjectives though.
---
Shes probably a cam girl on the side.
---
That is equivalent to rolling a 1 (1.46 is the actual number, but round down) out of 100 on a need roll...
---
Dustwallow is actually unfinished. Red ridge is fine there‚Äôs just a lot of quests that involve killing elites.

Scripts work but not ones that play the game or make decisions for you

It take 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. Imagine how many calories it takes to make a ball of pure fire or to do the reverse and make a bolt of pure ice.
---
On the topic of fire, severe burn victims are put on a high calorie diet of like 4000+ during recovery. I imagine healing your face after a fireball hits it takes nearly as many, if not more due to the speed of healing, calories as letting it heal naturally.
---
After 4 years of having to hide my enjoyment of games being with someone that doesn‚Äôt like them, I‚Äôm now single and it has been the most liberating positive experience - not just for games but for being able to enjoy what I enjoy without being judged
---
The main aspect to being a good PvE hunter is to not ignore your group utility. 
---
Practice distracting shot into trap in the open world. If you can CC seemlessly you will be a better group mate.
---
Setup some mouseover macros for pet control. A macro that sends your pet to attack a target, then macro to manually cast growl is very valuable for 5 mans, allowing you to peel off a squishy class onto a more tanky pet. This only tends to work early in the pull as pet growl generates flat threat, it's not a true taunt. However if you have intimidate, that can be enough to control the mob until your tank can pick it up properly.
---
Regarding pet choices, most people go for the big deeps pets. Broken Tooth everywhere. Furious howl is a good skill. It's worth considering a boar or turtle if you want to focus in on the utility. Boars have charge which is excellent for use in controlling loose mobs as noted in the above paragraph. You can manually cast it as part of your mouseover attack macro. This allows you to intercept a loose mob before it even gets to your healer. A turtle with shell shield is basically a form of CC in itself and worth considering, not much it can't tank.
---
Of course selecting any pet that can't train Claw is a moderate damage drop. Just killing things faster is often the best way to make a dungeon easier. You have to gauge your group.
---
Feign death is an aggro dump. But to not pull aggro in the first place, usually you just give the tank 5 seconds to lock the pull down, then you start DPS on whatever has the most sunder stacks, or whatever tha tank is targetting, or has the lowest health. Usually the way dungeons turn into a shit show is because DPS exercise no target discretion. Some tanks will always mark targets, I do anyway. But not always will you get a tank who does. Target your tank, and have a /assist macro ready to go. Don't aggressively multishot or multidot early into the pull. The first 5 seconds are what makes the pull clean or messy.
---
Go get gator axe from gator boss in mara if you're really struggling and want an upgrade. Can farm the hit ring from princess at the same time. Both bosses are beside each other
---
what? 
---
people get arrested for saying racist shit all the time in the UK.
---
not to say racist shit isn't bad, but we don't arrest people for it in the US, you just get publicly ridiculed and blacklisted by companies
---
That‚Äôs one of the best things about it though. It‚Äôs really. It‚Äôs really not that hard to get. As long as your guild is doing MC, which really isn‚Äôt that hard, you will inevitably get it. A lot of guilds get to a point with it where they are giving it to alts or bringing it out of guild priests just so it goes to someone.
---
Hopefully

Sigh *unzip*

But who was he?

Blizzard doesn‚Äôt think that way and if I could cheat in WoW I would.. I used to bot the shit out of WoW.

The follow up on the ticket says this - Hello, XXXXX.
---
An additional review of the action has been completed. We have confirmed our initial findings, and the action will not be reversed or changed.
---
We understand that you may still have concerns regarding the action, but we must reiterate that it was taken to address a violation of the Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (https://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/), which all players accept before logging into the game.
---
We understand that these policies may seem harsh, but they are in place to ensure that every player is able to enjoy their time in our games. Thank you for respecting our position. 
---
which doesn't reiterate botting / exploiting / cheating as per the e-mail. Hence my confusion, frustration, and blame on Remote Login software being the culprit.
---
I mean, if you include ‚Äúfit‚Äôna‚Äù it‚Äôs not that new
---
Simple mistake, my man. OP probably grabbed the first pre-Cata map he saw, it happens.
---
To alleviate this, just be upfront at the beginning of the instance that you'll be rolling on things with better stats, regardless of it's cloth/leather/mail status.
---
Evasion is still worth using as a rogue. I'd rather take 2 overpowers than 6 white hits.
---
Shoot I'm not sure about stealth addon but I think the energy one is called "NugEnergy"
---
ElvUI I imagine
---
Oh yea I totally forgot to say I have ragehax.exe running in the background before I charge in.
---
...but seriously, I‚Äôm not making it up and I haven‚Äôt had any trouble with rage or tanking so far and I‚Äôm level 55 now. I‚Äôve done every dungeon on the way except deadmines. You didn‚Äôt include any rage generated from the initial hit off the charge and all the subsequent hits from mobs. You typically do 2 white hits before the dps can get in there hard and that‚Äôs all you need to get your whirlwind off. The amount of threat a SS whirlwind generates is insane. At the end of the day you might just need to go try it for yourself. Good luck.
---
That makes no sense at all.

That's only for Retail you can play for free until 20.

Nope. My main characters have always been a hunter and a paladin. Sadly, Horde doesn't get paladins in vanilla and I play on a pvp server so I probably be playing one in Classic but I've always loved playing a hunter.
---
Perditions combat rogue is probably the highest ST dps class in the game for the current phase.
---
Lmao what? It's a game dude
---
The good thing about WoW commissions is you only have to draw about 5 then you‚Äôre done üòú
---
So, good for blacks and Native Americans? 
---
Got it!
---
on my server world1 world2 world3 world4 and world5 got all locked by 1 guild. its fucking stupid.
---
Not necessarily. Some people do shit like this just because. That's just it sometimes
---
Fun to watch, how many times did it backfire making that?
---
It shouldn't. Ever see a bunch of people spamming "LFG" for the same dungeon but never grouping? Use "LFM" even if you're alone or people will never bite.
---
IIRC Priests aren't super awful if the fight lasts 90 seconds and they can use debuffs.
---
Same thing with boomkins, they both go oom extremely fast.
---
Fair. The incentive in my example would be a new self-contained zone storyline to absorb. Maybe new mobs with a decent challenge. As far as loot is concerned - I would love new shinies I just wouldn't want it to be a "you must do this zone cause gear" more than any other zone - to not disrupt the *nochanges* crowd. Maybe added loot incentive like a pet or a daily amount grind (like the baby raptor quest from retail ungoro)
---
Much too high as only characters above level 5 are counted. So basically only characters you've invested more than an hour of time leveling them. It's probably very close to one character per player. All people I know only have 1 char over level 5 and some level 1 maybe level 2 bank chars.
---
Had my first 1v1 vs a warlock on my pally. Got feared at half health and it lasted all the way to death. Amazing.
---
Blizz allows it because of extra subs. It is most definitely cheating, as it provides the player doing it with unfair advantages that regular players don't have. But I'm not gonna argue with cheaters or their enablers.
---
Even with that a lot of people still went swords.
---
It's absolutely good for them, if they don't have anything better? - The epic sword is a bit too fast, but still a solid weapon for anything melee. Literally a 1/1 agi/stam weapon is better than that, for hunters.
---
I almost downvoted you because I hate how miserable this is
---
Ah i see the difficulty :(
---
Didn‚Äôt realize you could play WoW on the DS
---
Conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Come on. It‚Äôs named ‚Äúthe pirate bay‚Äù.
---
If they upheld the ban in an appeal already then it's not.
---
I've used it about 90 times with no other outcomes so it must have changed before 1.12
---
Hard to shower when you're at work on a tow boat.
---
Yup. Most of these guilds will fail pretty quickly or just keep being a loose collection of players. It takes strong leadership and smart recruiting to put together a proper raiding guild.
---
Skin and either herb or mining, or farm cloth?
---
I have no idea if you're serious or not, but they most likely have counsel for the US, UK, EU, Russia, China, and probably someone or someones who deal with rest of the world. I would be shocked if the legal department at Activision Blizzard was less than 10 (Including aides, administrators, etc).
---
I mean, I was legit away from the game for an hour or maybe two. Picked up some grub, came back, mashed that spacebar, ate, took care of some stuff around the house, and came back to play without ever getting logged out.
---
It does for people with legitimate skill.
---
It would count as a player induced death. The damage source is your self, so no durability loss.
---
Holding breath =/= swimming 
---
Horses can swim, they're also insanely strong animals. 
---
Swimming requires stamina, something horses have lots of. Horses are good swimmers
---
&gt;There's nothing for OP to gain from this other than to share a very weird experience.
---
There's nothing to gain by people who post random stuff in this subreddit daily except attention, yet that's being done constantly.
---
And if I had the time and dedication, I could create ten thousand alts and harass you from each and every one. Here on reddit you can make a new account and all you stand to lose is karma. Most of the time it's not that easy.
---
FYI The cap was 310 with the arena gladiator rewards.
---
I /lick people when I buff them and I get some interesting responses
---
haha i know right? fuck the alliance and fuck homework
---
I've gotten close to a kill on Rotgrip but I don't think my SP is there. With levitate you can kite him around the big rock in the water but his HP resets when he glitches into it so it's not possible just to kite him around that. With more SP i could kill him
---
I just rewatched the "White Christmas" Black Mirror episode, and now I'm imagining this staticy toon waving in front of some salty player.
---
Whats the punishment for something like this?
---
I mean you don't have to take my word for it but I have no reasoning to make a false reddit post / lie. For what purpose would I have to do so? We get enough misinformation nowadays. I don't post often and was hoping to save others some trouble on a possible future false ban. I have time to play, just wanted to maximize my time throughout the week.
---
Anything Arthas and Lich King
---
Yeah I agree. What about if a 2h drops amd the arms tank wants it?
---
After looking into u/reallybadpennystocks post on how to link your computer to your phone, I had given up hope when my phone gave me the fabled "Port 0" failure.

Axe spec doesn't matter in pvp

I see everything around me when I use Gnomish Cloaking Device though so I don't think that first part is entirely correct

Even your reactions here makes you sound like someone who knows they got caught for doing something you weren't supposed to.
---
Oh thank God, I can sleep at night again /s
---
Haha, I don't know where you get this idea that I'm out and about searching for low leveled enemies to kill. I'm busy leveling my own character. If I come across a low leveled horde, I kill them. Get over it man
---
What class?
---
Pretty sure it doesn't backfire. I've used it 90+ times now. Counting pservers I've used it like a thousand times with no backfires.
---
It most certainly is, it is also a bfa one
---
I played a resto Druid during Legion. It was the first time I tried healing and I really liked it. So I thought it might be a good idea to roll a priest for the very first time in classic.
---
Thanks for your words!
---
No, it was multiple hours for 2 days and it was all servers at times. Yes they targeted certain servers at certain times, but they also brought down all of their server at many points as well.
---
But, is your character a troll?
---
Mouseover is built into the game so when you hover over an enemy or friend, you can interact without interrupting your main focus. Think about it like a "hover focus" where it's only available to what you hover over. Imagine being a Healer targeting your Tank and suddenly the Mage pulls aggro from something to them. You want to Shield the Mage but not lose your Tank target, or if you're a Tank you want to keep the boss targeted while Mouseover Sundering other mobs nearby. The Mouseover macro will direct whatever spell you have in there towards what your cursor is hovering over, without you losing that initial target. It's super nice for Buffs - it's more of a Healer thing imo, as in they benefit incredibly from them while other classes like Rogues would mostly benefit from being able to Mouseover Blind targets without them losing combo points.
---
It's mostly a convenience, which sometimes can be the difference between easily controlling an emergency and wiping.
---
The WW Axe is one you're supposed to work towards during 30-40, the charms are the toughest part and usually each mob will be rough or unkillable alone. Like when you get your Brutal Armor quest you're super far away from being useful in RFK, though there's an item you need there. The best idea is to ask a friend or a stranger to help you out, or wait till you're able to solo the mobs. Using Sword/Board sometimes helps a lot here - especially vs the ones that cast spells at you. As for Cyclonian? Try to find some other Warriors doing the quest or hope for a kind soul to assist you.
---
Nope not insinuating that at all. Guess you struggle with critical thinking skills. You think botnets are cheap? You think people spend money on botnets that don‚Äôt work? This could very well have just been a publicity stunt to sell off the botnet that he helped create. For someone who mocks conspiracy theorist, you sure jumped to conspiracy theories pretty quick.
---
Last time I saw the numbers before they barred census, it was 67%H 33%A
---
Well they basically remade them week before release. They used to have crusader strike etc in the beta but they got oom so fast so now ret is just auto attacking pretty much.
---
Rip lower back and posture
---
I was able to get on other realms but I heard about retail issues.
---
I dated a girl from Norway a while back. From what i gathered, pretty conservative country. Like she rated weed as a top harmful drug. They have this very weird blanket attitude of all drugs are bad.
---
I grinded the rock elementals in the top left corner of badlands for about 8-10g/h. Pretty sure I grinded out like 1.5 levels there from 38.5 to 40 roughly. They drop a fuckton of rocks that vendor for a few silver each, as well as some AH items like elemental earth
---
Pet casts it, not the warlock though. You‚Äôd have to cheap shot, target pet and blind it(which resets all of your combo points) then stand there auto attacking the lock because you‚Äôre out of energy. Best case scenario, the lock is bad and you think you‚Äôre going to kill him before the dots kill you but then he just life taps lol.
---
Check your ID, where‚Äôs your liver go when you die?
---
&gt; Even if he did try to spin this to emphasize his skills in "hacking"
---
The sad thing is that this isn't even impressive. Literally anyone could DDOS like this after 5 minutes of Googling.
---
Something I had to get first was that doing orange quests isn't worth it at all. If you're farming too, aim for enemies slightly below your level, it makes a huge difference in how many you can kill per minute.
---
It's a video game
---
Some people are saying the exact same thing.

Thanks for your tip

"Have you seen SeaSirens' wifeImeanhusband?"
---
Lol, the 14k decrease is actually close to 20% ‚Äî but sure! You definitely know what you‚Äôre talking about or something lol
---
Hence why I am here saying remote login did this, as I don't use bots or 3rd party automation to run my account / character. I am physically able to do so and HAVE been doing so since release. No macros. I have gone to get food / came back and moved around / ate / came back and played type of thing, but automation? bots? Not me. Wouldn't waste time making this post if I had done something like that, lets be real here.
---
Leveling a priest first to heal in dungeons after I hated being pigeonholed into healing as a feral druid.
---
I might just level up my Warlock instead because my inner teenager is getting louder because priest leveling is slow.
---
Bit of a nitpick, but the tab this addon adds is not styled the same as the in game friends list, kind of a bummer and turned me off of it.

Save face from what? I am not sure why you take some dude making fanfiction about elves so seriously?
---
You don't seem to understand why people wanted classic. It's not nostalgia, people want it because it's the better version of the game. And there are no other mmos besides it, everyone took WoW and dumbed it down further. Classic was just right for many. Give is great content and balanced classes, but fuck off with layering, instanced worlds, cash shops, LFR and all the other garbage.

Turns out it's happened multiple times in the last couple decades - my bad. But it does not happen all the time. I live in the UK and I've been regularly showered in racist shit over social media - you don't have to look hard to find it on Facebook etc.

The US media has a field day painting Western Europe as some kind of PC police state so after a while you get sensitive to it.

But they can't perform *well* at the roles so what's the point? Paladins can tank/heal/dps as well, but just like druids their tank/dps kind of sucks

Okay fair, it sort of does, but without the same wording. I mean regardless I am here posting because I believe it was wrongful, not because I think blizzard will see it ? You can only appeal through tickets through the ban / suspension appeal anyways, nothing good is expected from this post, just trying to pass the time / wait for that ticket to be answered. No bots were used.

just got my paladin to 59.

Worst decision ever, my classic experience is ruined since i cant be arsed to level another.

I rolled a pala because we didn't have one in our grp, and i wanted to be of use to my friends.

It's not that easy if you want to continue using the site or game or whatever as intended, and just ceding it to the harasser feels pretty shit too

Learn. To. Control. Your. Pet.
---
Can't tell you how many Hunters don't know wtf they are doing simply because their pet control is horrible. Damn Huntard, Not Hunter, wiped us in Gnomer cause he kept pulling with his pet when I'd tell him to stop as I was tanking. Well in the Hallway of doom to the last boss he tab targeted to the mob down below and sure as shit his pet went down aggroed it and wiped us. Then the fucker had the never to party quit like it was our fault.

Not really. Anonymous twitter acc. So we could attribute a twitter to it but not a person or identity to the twitter.

Yeah, and thats why I am here posting ? Because I wasn't doing anything of the sort and the only thing I have done different over the last few years of playing is using this remote login to get into queue. Believe what you want, wouldn't be here posting if I knew I fucked up fam.

Agreed, but once again blizzard is taking the wrong direction. They're putting us in a US realm with a Brazil tag. The problem is that the active players will remain in Thalnos/Faerlina since they have an active community aswell, soon enough the Brazilian realm will die like Azralon, Goldrinn and such.

Tough pitch for a company to provide support to 3 different versions of content all for the same monthly price. I cant see them doing that, I could see them doing TBC release with maybe new content and then Wrath with the same, but i cant see all 3 options.
---
What's the name?
---
Are you kidding?
---
You will NEVER top meters as a druid that's not what the class is designed for.
---
You're designed as a jack-of-all-trades. You can flip from one role to another with a swap of gear.
---
THAT is why druid is so amazing, and why people bring druids.
---
Would an @mouseover blind or kick reset the combo points?
---
Yard creds man. All about the yard creds.
---
Well then the way you catch him would be the same as with the ddos attacks. Hes definitely doing it all from behind proxies.
---
Even if you do all the quests there are (spillover rep ones included) you won't get anywhere close to exalted. I still handed in way over 300 Stacks of Runecloth and all the Morrowgrain I could get my hands on. 
---
I can recommend to start the day with an hour of Un'Goro soil farming, then playing the AH for a bit, then questing/doing dungeons. While you do that always keep that bag on cooldown. The overall goal is to make as much Gold as possible and to buy the Runecloth when it is cheap (usually in the evening when lots of people get rid of theirs - I bought anything under 8s I think). 
---
Do not farm Rune cloth. Do not AOE grind either. Although it feels as if you're making a lot of money and cloth you really aren't. The best way to make money is to trade and I highly recommend getting into TSM and setting up multiple bank chars. I have seven now, each receiving different types of whites from my main to then sell off and trade with. Don't ever vendor stuff, sell it on the auction house or store it for later. I started with zero experience in trading and by the time I hit exalted Darnassus I also ended up with 1200g in the bank and way over 2000g in items stored on my bank alts. It's really not rocket science, but it makes a huge difference whether you vendor something for 10s or whether you sell it for 14s99c on the AH. 
---
After you've set up all your chars you then move on to dungeon farming. I made loads of money doing LBRS pattern runs but just clearing Stratholme works fine as well. I'm practically done with my pre-raid BiS gear at the same time and the whole thing really didn't feel like a grind. 
---
Happy farming!
---
Yeah both them
---
&gt; "A few" is, most typically, used to indicate two of something.
---
No, a "few" is very specifically used to indicate MORE than two but still a small number.
---
&gt;&gt;Every five minutes, a perl script contacts the front page of Runescape and scrapes the displayed number of online players. 
---
wow, its almost like its exactly what i said and not relevant at all.
---
It was on the first two attempts :)
---
Won't be anything more than we've already seen. Blizzard announced bans, they don't announce who they ban. Unless the banned themselves go somewhere to bitch and moan thats the end of the story.
---
If people have rushed through classic and aoe spammed dungeons to race to 60 to the raid constantly after only a month they deserve a long wait until nax zg etc as for plus content I say no pvp is enough
---
Trolls are evil so no qualms about killing them. Feel more bad for all the animals though
---
Imagine thinking that WoW Forum MVPs have any genuine opinions and aren't just sucking up to Blizzard so their name can be green.  
---
You sweet summer child. . .
---
Never heard it refer to 2 of anything, mostly 3, sometimes a generic small number. 
---
The point being the second part of the post, where I mention how it feels like it been out longer.
---
A bit of both ?  Rogues are rough to level up, it gets alot easier once we reach level 30 at this point we have your poisons and both your main stuns available (cheap shot at lvl 26 and kidney shot at lvl 30). also at level 31 we can unlock blade flurry which gives us the ability to dps 2 mobs at once for a bit.
---
I had a really rough time in darkshore, its hard not to pull a 2nd mob and lets be honest a 2nd mob for a low level rogue usually means death. I moved to westfall at level 13 its a bit better as mobs are not as close but again dont pull 2 mobs at once lol
---
You also want to go to Stormwind asap to pick up the Sword training  (also you may want to pick up the mace training while in Ironforge). Rogues are extremely dependant on their weapons you want a slow main hand weapon either a sword or a mace and a fast off hand weapon.
---
Another tip regarding weapon is to upgrade them often, dont be shy about using your gold and buy weapons on the AH. Sure it puts you a bit behind on your mount but it will make your life soooo much easier while leveling up. I purchased a [Midnight Mace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=936/midnight-mace) for 10g on the AH at level 33 and it will last me a very long time, at the very least until level 45+ and i dont regret it at all
---
This used to happen to me years ago.
---
I started telling everyone to go fuck themselves when they expressed disaproval of my hobby.
---
Now they just don't comment about it if i ever bring it up.
---
I don't think being rude is nice, but it's amazing how people change when they know that you **WILL** face them if they forget their place.
---
Of course I am. Is there another faction?
---

All the Uchiha were evil except one, though, and even he was kinda sorta evil.
---
I see.  But DDoS is not especially sophisticated, right?  And certainly not a demonstration of‚Ä¶ what, network prowess?
---
I mean it was never about bringing down wow. He was advertising his power to attract buyers of his services. This has been a common theme for a while now, with these botnet runners.
---
Staffs actually do more across the board.
---
he's upset.
---
IF they do BC it won't be for another couple years at least. I would focus on what you enjoy now. Would you rather be a Paladin, or would you rather play Horde.
---
One important thing to note is that this item is BoP and crafted by Engineering, but does not require Engineering to use, so you can level engi, create this and drop engi for another profession and still be able to use it.
---
Using all of a kill and taking something to prove you handled the bounty aren't common? I hope you aren't comparing a game that is clearly set in the real world equivalent of 15/16th century to the modern day.
---
Good idea, I should do the same.
---
I've used this for WoW for the past few years and have loved it.  [https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g602-wireless-gaming-mouse.html](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g602-wireless-gaming-mouse.html)
---
Can you link your skill in chat? You couldn't in Vanilla but I think they added in TBC. That would be a very welcome addition of it's not already in.
---
Oh good now the discord follows me to reddit! Damit Rey
---
Throwing up the thorns on everyone is a fast track to running oom.
---
Sell them in the cross faction action house since the quest in Tanaris needs them.
---
You should have played TESO. :D
---
üòÇ stay safe mate out there!

---
Need a spriest for shadow weaving for sure. But beyond that, sadly SPriest damage is pretty stunted by the debuff limit.
---
maybe. but not in this instance
---
Thanks haha
---
That's why I'm here. I'm praying we get tbc at some point because that was peak wow from a QOL/Raiding/battlegrounds/engagement level. It has just enough new skills to make more specs 'useful' (looking at ret/prot paladins, Bal druid, s priests).
---
Rogues are mediocre, not terrible. They get decent at the mid 30s, and by 45+ you can non stop chew through mobs.
---
It would still reset.
---
I was but it‚Äôs that on top of every dps on their own target. Just... ugh.
---
What about a cake?  Cakes have layers
---
Bloodfang to my eyes is as good.
---
There's nothing wrong with that guy playing the game the way he wants. No reason to call him trash just because he is ambitious in game.
---
Which mobs?
---
Salty
---
OK that makes sense. Those ROG laptops have a bad habit of frying that connection and/or having battery failure. I replaced the brick and battery 3 times, and it never would hold a charge. Had to keep it always plugged in.
---
I have a pally, rogue and mage. I had to get all 3 üòÄ
---
It's for both, it's a massive threat booster.
---
For raiding yes, for leveling, doesn‚Äôt really matter as you‚Äôre not spamming AS and MS
---
can't you just use a lesser healing spell?  or not bother healing until they're below a point that its no longer wasteful?
---
Read the comments there buddy. Useable when the warrior blocks dodges or parries. Know your class man.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler
---
As a feral druid, you need a 16-slot bag full of these.... per raid.
---
I dunno if you read the ToS, maybe you should. 
---
ToS part C subsection 4. any code and/or software, not expressly authorized by Blizzard, that can be used in connection with the Platform and/or any component or feature thereof which changes and/or facilitates the gameplay or other functionality;
---
Using a remote desktop to sit in queue isn't gameplay. Using it to REMAIN in the game is a different story. Playing from your phone is a ToS violation technically. 
---
If you truly only sat in queue, i would email them again and appeal their claim citing the above section. Unless blizzard somehow considers sitting at a desk in front of their log in screen gameplay. If you played your character at all using a 3rd party program it is a ToS violation technically and you really dont have any recourse. 
---
Blizzard is quite lenient with bans. They want their subs to stay subbed. Its hard to believe they would hand out a 6 month ban for what you claim to have done.
---
All of those things besides n.3 are for raiding, not leveling
---
My bad i didnt zoom into his 9 inch screen üòÇüëÄ

---
Nice video m8! I enjoyed the gameplay.
---
Mind posting your current spec at lvl40? And how does it work with farming and dungeons?
---
Haha! I understand! Just stay strong, it will get better with time I like to believe :)!
---
You can change to classic in settings
---
Dziƒôkujƒô
---
The Robe is "Robes of Antiquity", you get it from the Ruuzel quest in Zoram's Strand, Ashenvale. As for the armor I don't know which piece you're referring to, if it's the shoulder pads then it's the Silk Mantle of Gamn from a quest in Wetlands in the excavation site.
---
This has been my issue too, nobody seems to remember in Vanilla you'd cc what you could and then dps would attack what the tank was attacking. The only aggro you'd lose is an occional mob towards the healer and you'd quickly taunt him back.
---
Now it seems no matter how many times I ask for people to focus fire I have 3 different dps attacking 3 different mobs with not a single one being the mob I'm attacking and have complete aggro of....
---
For the most part it seems tanks remembered how to tank, healers remembered how to heal and the only dps that are from vanilla and now classic are huntards that simply rerolled different dps classes
---
Some of my best friends are trolls though.
---
ive always found it jokes that he slapped himself in as a placeholder and they just ran with it
---
You're not seeing the point though. 
---
Ret pally = Endless mana, focuses on some DPS, and more importantly, cleansing. Who heals the healers? If your healers are the lifesblood of the raid, wouldn't it pay to have help cleansing, so they (Healers) can go about their business, cleansing and healing others?
---
Either way, I think in the end the difference in speed for the encounter, it's probably negligible. Either bring a Pure DPS, and stress the healers more... Slow DPS with ret pally, less stress on the healers... or Bring an extra healer for minimum stress on healers, more forgiveness during the fight for the DPS.
---
Imagine that mattering to anyone on the entire face of the Earth.
---
Not to mention, have you spent much time on the WoW forums? That place is a hive of scum and crybabies. It's not hard to imagine that people praising this are genuinely happy that Blizzard did something about it so fast in an era when game companies ignore massive bugs and exploits for weeks at a time with no dev contact.
---
Its one of those shows thats curse is its success. Season one is spectacular. so is season 2. Season 3 is where it gets to the "we didn't expect to be in the air this long" point but its still very much worth watching. I watch it on netflix so the newest season just hit today and I have no idea how good it is.
---
I got rod of the sleepwalker from BFD because it is a legit good upgrade over crescent staff. Other party members were not so happy
---
how do you think he gets money from DDOSing exactly?
---
I was about to chime in and mention that.
---
Has been min-maxed to death on private servers.
---
ZG trinket gives the spell hit required for taunt not to miss.
---
I believe too.
---
how do people know what layer they're on?
---
Why would your current gold situation have anything to do with the value of the item? If anything that means it's even more important that you get proper value for it.
---
If you're leveling with a holy paladin you might could use this strategy as well.
---
Because they wouldn't say that?
---
What they know is that a piece of software on the computer was controlling mouse inputs and not in a particularly human-like fashion.
---
What they don't know is that it was being controlled by a person, one click, one action which is entirely within their ToS.
---

Except to show you that my point was about the average player base declining ‚Äî aka my point...to which you came in about math and how 14k is 5% of 91k (the high) ??? While? Accusing? Me??? Of ? Not? Understanding??? Math???
---
i remember in ZulFarak the event on the stairs as spriest...i havnt been casting any shields on the tank warrior in the whole run.
---
so that event happens and i am just afk wanding , but then our tank warrior totally goes off how i am so stupid for shielding him when it was the friendly npc and he can just cancel it...
---
or some healer who never dispell despite explaining them why it is beneficial for the group and asking them nicely multiple times to do so...some people dont know whats going on or are just learn resistent or do the opposite out of spite.
---
the amount of times i have asked if there are any questions about strat/dungeon/tips/ or if anything comes up to not be afraid to ask only to be met with silence and then shortly after disaster happens.it feels like a lot of people join groups while being on 2 button autopilot...
---
Gotcha, I see what you man. Though, I'm still not really sure this is an indication of that, considering this really is a few weeks ago, minus two days.

Yay you found him

&gt; Do you think I‚Äôd be taking that big of a hit by picking the WW sword instead?
---
absolutely not
---
Anything in the north part of STV. Pretty much everything up there is a lvl 30-35 beast.
---
For Priests you will find much more benefit from Spirit instead of MP/5. You even have multiple talents which buff your use of Spirit - Spirit Tap being the most obvious one. And your Regeneration in the 5sr is based on Spirit. MP/5 is okay but it's more of a Shaman or Paladin stat, due to their faster casts largely removing them from utilizing the 5sr.

This is what a 'bad' BRD is like lol

BRD is both the best and worst instance in the game. If the group is good I legitimately think it's the best instance, but if the group is bad... may God have mercy on your soul.

I have spoken with someone who used to investigate accounts for botting wow.

He said literally none of the bans that he, or his colleagues, sent out were false positives. Take from that what you will.
---
Nah, people are very cool with them.

DD is my 1st RPPVP experience, and I love it! It is in my opinion the purest WoW experience. I'm pretty sure you'll fall in love with this realm!

Yep.

Fire can ruin a person it can also make a chef, cars can ruin a person it can also make a mechanic, football can ruin a person it can also make a pro athlete, mmorpgs can ruin a person it can also make a game dev. Or all of these things can make great hobbies for someone and a long lasting memories of learning them with their parent or on their own. You do you and I‚Äôm sure your a great parent but I know if I never got to play mmorpgs as a teen I‚Äôd have missed out on some amazing memories I have now and that honestly is sad.
---
You can farm a few stacks of these pretty quickly. Slow fall comes in handy often.
---
No shit.
---
People here thinking that Blizzard really gives two fucks about your #AuthenticVanilla experience haven't realized yet that the name of the game is farming cash. If the best way to farm the cash is to keep you hooked for long periods of time and thus subscribed, that is what they will do.
---
That is also what they will do in regards of future undisclosed content updates.
---
Thanks for doing with the other commenter should have done at the start, as I expected the Paladin was only able to achieve hi DPS by stacking literally everything he could in his favor, this is why I wanted to see the logs
---
Nope, world PvP is great and playing for fun instead of a reward incentive is always better.
---
If you can't have fun in world PvP, the problem isn't a lack of battlegrounds, the problem is you.
---
&gt;That place is a hive of scum and crybabies.
---
So close!
---
"a more wretched hive of scum and villainy"
---
Its a video game. Hunters are usually trash. Sorry if that bothers you
---
I have some random people constantly prank calling me at work, granted if it was a good prank call I would respect it. What your typical prank caller consist of is those premade prank calls where you say "hello" which activates the prank call but if you just don't talk they keep talking like they are real or something. It's the dumbest shit in the world and someone is paying to do this.
---
Never said it has.
---
No one is twinking right now.  Battlegrounds are in phase 3, which is probably half a year away.
---
You'll be giving up a lot.  Hard to quantify, but hundreds of gold probably.
---
Dear diary, today I killed a gnome.
---
Link to news article of arrest?
---
I said in the comment, I build groups on first come/first serve because dungeons don't matter. It's just a fact spell cleave is really, really good.
---
Rank 14 Weapons are usually better, other gear has more stamina than pve until the following raids. 
---
BWL, Naxx and AQ 40 pve gear is pretty well better than rank 14 pvp in almost all aspect. However is arguably easier to get in almost all Regards. 
---
The grind for Rank 14 is no joke
---
And hammers are just heavy staves. Everything is really a staff when you think about it
---
I think leveling a warrior as an alt is a good idea because you can farm gold for an hour on your level 60 and be able to outfit your alt to the nines, making leveling easier and more enjoyable.  
---
Rogues are very unique though, they are incredibly fun classes to play with all of the tricks they have up their sleeve like vanish, stuns, sprint, stealth, and all of the options for your combo breakers. Very immersive class imho.
---
Hey man, what's the addon that allows you to see the dots above the enemies nameplate?
---
Fair enough. Highly impractical but still good.
---
Though to be fair, for someone who is new to vanilla, "increases chance to hit by 1%" is pretty vague.

Question about paladin professions, should I take Mining and engineering or Herb and alchemy? I know engineering is recommended for the Grenades and bombs to make life a bit easier, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs much gold making potential at end game. Being self sufficient with pots / flasks as a healer would be good I think + arcanite bar transmute would be helpful.

Feral can pull the same, or stronger numbers given the right consumables.
---
If anything, feral is easier to pull stronger numbers more consistently, with MCP's.
---
I'm not sure why you put boe epic brain hacker in all caps, it's a weapon that is literally considered garbage outside of this particular use. It is way too fast for traditional retribution pallies utilizing SoC, it is way too fast for warriors, it provides no stats and is thus useless for hunters and even looking at horde it's too fast for enhance. On top of that he spends the majority of it with Manual Crowd Pummeler. 
---
After getting 60 in classic and farming your pre-raid bis there really isn't much to do besides farm for consumables, if you feel the need to list using a flask, elixirs and sharpening stone (enough for an entire raid week can be bought for under 100g) then frankly you're just lazy.
---
Take advantage of it while you can. I farmed 3 stacks of felcloth now so I don‚Äôt have to fight for mobs in a couple months
---
If it gets a bit boring quest grinding, I have a rogue I am using to farm herbs and leather. In retrospect I should have gone Mining/Herbalist, it's a bit more useful. Leather isn't in that high of demand on my server.

I was looking for this a few months ago with no success, thanks for posting.

Warriors don‚Äôt have windfury

We had a "guildie" yesterday complain and insult us because we wouldnt  power level him in dead mines ... the average of our guild is probably lvl 25 and our 3 highest players are between level 40-45. at first we werent sure if he was joking or not , then he starting cursing at us and shit ... he got booted rather fast lol
---
Demo shout or no, only cleave groups can achieve 100k+ exp per hour in torch room.
---
Herbalism feeds your blinding powders. Decent money maker while leveling, or it used to be. Engineering is highest utility though. Mining supplements engineering. Alchemy is probably the best end game money maker. If you can level an alt to 35, you can max alchemy, then feed herbs from the main.
---
Warriors are notoriously hard to level, but they become absolute powerhouses in the late game.
---
Druids are amazing throughout the game, they can fill all roles, have great travel options, immunity to most CC and are one of the least played classes so you generally have a good chance of snapping up some good loot.
---
cheap and common insult, but still a dig at Horde...
---
-ref?
---
"I'll allow it."
---
oh so you're also a goon??
---
It‚Äôs really not. Every single thing on Kali is a well known vulnerability, so unless you‚Äôre running Win8 with outdated defender you‚Äôll catch a public exploit. I doubt those types of vulns would be applicable to a server of this scale, and it definitely wouldn‚Äôt produce the results you want of denying service of WoW itself
---
What?  How so?  The thread I linked is WoW pvp, both retail and classic.  By the logic of 'put specific topics where they belong' then that's where all classic pvp should go.
---
What I'm getting at is that it's fucking stupid to act like topics like these should go to a super specific sub.  If you don't like it then downvote it and shut your mouth.

---
Works the same way for tanking as it does for DPS because the mechanics for feral tanking are the same as DPS only for bear form.  Was watching Skarmtank on onyxia he was using it as well.  I was just curious when that type of threat generation was considered necessity.
---
Why ? BG's while leveling is fun
---
nah, ddosers don't really present any valuable skills.
---
Where can i find shaman macros?
---
One macro I cant get to work is to cast lightning bolt and start auto attacking.
---
/cast lightning bolt
---
/startattack
---
But it says I'm out of range when I use it? I assume its trying to melee from a distance? Any help?
---
It‚Äôs possible to level without prioritizing efficiency. Daggers are more fun per minute and more minutes per level, the math checks out from that point of view.
---
It's gone now.
---
Yes and no because I played before the max pre even and I definitely feel like dungeon elites were more dangerous even at SM levels during this time period I‚Äôm not sure if this was during 1.12. But even in BC leveling I remember dungeons not being a complete cake walk.
---
Seeing as I play the master class? No
---
Im not a sociopath, in fact I'd argue people in your line of thinking get off on cheating people out of fair exchanges. At the end of the day we're gonna have to agree to disagree, but just know that the community will always remain split and your reddit circle jerk isnt going to change peoples opinion.  Reddit isnt some ultimate authority, and its up to the groups and players in them to decide how to handle loot. You cannot force people to do what you want by group think.
---
eNd oF DiScUSsiOn

I can't fucking wait to get my epics. I never played classic wow (started in BC) but even when I did play wow I never played it properly. I skipped all the quests most of the time and just killed mobs to level for a while, never tried to learn how my class worked, and never picked up a profession. I was really young and pretty ignorant about trying new things so I basically just stuck to what I learned at level 1 and rolled with it. Terrible I know. Now that I am older I am doing things right. So far got my Rogue to level 24 and I got 150+ in engineering. Doing every quest I can find and learning everything I can about my class. This was literally the perfect time for me to play WoW classic and I am so stoked about it!
---
weird i downloaded that but it wasn't working. maybe i had a dated link. can you link me where you got it from?
---
doesn't really help, but if they've flagged and banned you it's not going to get reversed unfortunately.
---
Is this the leap of faith quest?
---
Reserving items is perfectly fine if you disclose it ahead of time. If you try to pull that shit after inviting people, then it is problematic. 
---
Will I join a group where an item I want is reserved? Probably not. But I have the choice not to join just like the other person has the choice to reserve the item. 
---
Let people play the game they want as long as they conform to the game rules. We are all people with different goals and objectives.
---
Until it's time to raid. Then it's me begging for motw, and getting trolled with rank 1.
---
Engineering won't make you a ton of gold late game, but mining will. A few arcane crystals can make you some serious bank.
---
Pots/Flasks are always welcome, and having a steady supply of mana/hp potions as you level is very useful.
---
Personally I prefer engineering, but that's just me.
---
WoW was not down for several days, it experienced attacks at peak hours over several days. They didn't do as much as people seem to believe.
---
You are a true warrior!
---
Well played!
---
It's a very common business practice to compete with yourself. For example, Elvis' manager used to make buttons that say "I Hate Elvis Presley".
---
Blizzard can make bank by making an MMO for players that like a slower paced game, and an MMO for players that like a lobby based hack 'n' slash gacha game.
---
I feel this, I'm zone hopping because in STV I've outquested my level, and my buddies are over level 40 now as I'm hitting 35 and my progress is getting a little slower.
---
That'll teach me to reference an anime I've never seen.

I'm having a much easier time on my lock than my priest. Fear kiting has made enough tough mobs or bad pulls much more manageable.

Something like the ragnaros fight, someone might take a spike of a few thousand damage, then fall taking more damage or even falling into the lava and being unable to get out for a few seconds which means they could potentially die. Best bet is to keep them as close to full as possible.
---
Downranking is pretty important, max rank heal isn't always the most effective heal to cast (in terms of hp healed and mana spent), not even taking into account RNG critical heals.
---
they got someone.  whether or not its the right person or the only person, TBD!
---
pre-edit: I hope they get the person that did this and smack them down
---
Remember to strafe away from mobs a bit. Even at the outset of your pull, when your GCD is resetting - every yard counts here. Cast Holy Fire first &amp; SW:P immediately afterwards as you're sidestepping. When the GCD ends cast MB and begin to Wand. Sometimes you'll cast a Smite here as well. Try to stay inside your 5sr as often as you can so you regen your mana before Spirit Tap procs. Use your Wand to take mobs from at least 30-50% while you allow your DoTs &amp; Wand to finish them. Refresh your Shield and apply Renew only at the end of cast-times so you do not futz up your regen.
---
It's a bit more nuanced than this. Mechanics leading to the mobile-game-esque retail can be distinguished and adjusted. The examples I listed above were purely off of the cuff, but the removal of them would be massive steps towards the classic+ vision laid out.
---
Playing Horde, playing casters, doing dungeons (I used to be afraid of other people in game somehow), reading the questtexts, crafting.
---
No?
---
Eh my friend bought the recipe for 10s on AH and makes like 50s-1g a stack (cooked) on AH lol. It's flooded. I made 18g on a stack of nightfin soup though.
---
Interesting I don't feel the world is alive at all. Zones are static. Most shops are empty with useless vendors. Quests are general kill x for y and bring back y. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, shoulda specified! You're correct
---
Most likely it's talking about the auto attack. Does even the lightning bolt start to cast?
---
(Also because We can't do shit solo)
---
Grats on having a friend. Wait for him &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm stuck forever solo and it‚Äôs depressing
---
Mind telling me which quest that is?
---
By what metric is it a success. You have literally no useful information. No idea how many people have shifted from retail to classic, providing 0 extra income. How mant people consistently resub for 1 month every time an expansion comes out, and they resubed for 1 month of classic and will leave. You have no use information about the demographics of classic players. No idea how much implementing classic cost. What running costs classic is incurring. No idea how many people will quit in a month or 2, or how many have already quit. You have no a single reliable statistic to judge the success or failure of classic wow.
---
Definitely recommend waiting for your buddy, my two friends are 6/12 levels ahead and my buddy who was very close stopped playing. it took a lot out of the grinding experience.
---
use an alt to do professions and grind money? try different races and classes?
---
Whoops
---
Dang you got me. Didn't know pentesting was basically help desk. I've been lied to all along!
---
&gt; That makes no sense at all.
---
Invading someone elses property and destroying it in the process Is how the Horde was founded lol
---
I buy it, pretty much all the hybrid DPS classes can achieve raid performance with enough effort, it's just that if the pure DPS class has put forth the same amount of effort they completely blow them out of the water haha
---
You sure it doesn't activate auto attack? I thought right clicking an enemy or trying to attack them would put you into attack mode, even if you're out of range?
---
I did it without priest bubble last night. depends on the server tick, if you are jumping when the tick happens you can do the entire run with only taking like 3 separate damages from lava.
---
Shoulda used monero
---
Could it?
---
*continent. 
---
Sharding is zone only, layering is the whole continent.
---
Most of my playtime in Vanilla was world PvP - but I never ganked lowbies, it just wasn't fun.
---
And interesting things happen when you still emote and behave friendly around the people you *do* gank. By the time I quit the game, I had significantly more friends on the opposite faction, and we frequently got together for duels or "third faction" style gank-everyone groups.
---
yeah as soon as i got cat form and the move speed that went with it i kinda just stopped giving out motw buffs because i had to go out of cat form buff people run out of mana run a bit at normal speed while mana regens and then get back into cat form
---
Well I mean....
---
2 of them were sorta evil, and ended up being okay in the end
---
It essentially allows players to be in the same area but on a different layer. So if me n you wanted to kill the same thing I could be on layer 1 n you on layer 2 and we can both kill the same mob. It‚Äôs a way to not have a full server overcrowded.
---
I feel like we‚Äôre at a weird spot in the economy, none of the lower stuff will be worth much till all those people who hit 60 without leveling their professions head to the auction house to try and start them.
---
USA in the rust belt, specifically Michigan where the manufacturing crash hit hard and hasn't ever recovered while housing and cost of living has steadily risen.
---
It's a sad affair really but it's not like many folks have a choice as to the situation. Personally, I love my job but most people I know hate theirs and wish they could afford to move somewhere better or find another job but the crazy thing is that very few people can afford to move away as it costs about 2k to do so bare minimum and hardly anyone around here has more than $200 dollars in savings between paychecks.
---
shit that takes me back
---
To be fair, mages are broken and were given way too much stuff in vanilla. I'm a mage main and feel shitty for how much of tool kit I have.

Linking me to your own post that one other redditor agrees with does not disprove anything. Less dungeons, with more time spent in their design alleviates this issue. Making severs that are only 60-70 alleviates this issue. Giving low pop/full servers a free transfer alleviates this issue. 
---
That's just off the top of my head. LFR is by no means a necessity, it's a lazy, bandaid fix for impatient players that falsely believe they have the answers (see: retail wow)
---
I never played TBC but I love the aesthetics and mechanics of it. Too bad it should have been a stand-alone game, with its own 1-59 experience.
---
Unfortunately, by stacking it on top of Vanilla, TBC committed so many cardinal sins of MMO design:
---
* Incompatible resources between expansions
---
* No porosity between Vanilla and TBC professions and rewards
---
* Disconnected geography where max level characters no longer inhabited the same world
---
I'm not even talking about *flying.* That's superficial compared to the more fundamental design mistakes inherent in adding content and raising level caps for a linear Theme Park MMO.
---
Nice to hear the story is from my server!  Played on Smolderthorn back in the dizzy.
---
We have to give MotW out like pez, but as I get higher in level and druids seem rarer, I get people pestering me for the buff.  It‚Äôs funny/sad.

Well, had I not got Ravager I would've used it for longer.

You're asking the wrong person, friend. I know neither how one would cause a DDOS attack nor how one would protect themselves in the event that they did one. I would be an exceptionally terrible hacker, and I am perfectly content to remain that way.

The alliance is the allied races of Azeroth who are protecting their homeland

The horde is the orcish races that are invading Azeroth from another world

Dual wield tanking is more of a later tier thing. There comes a point when you're farming T2 and T1 bosses just tickle you, you're rage starved, and your equally as badass-geared DPS are creating a lot of threat. Dual wield tanking in a fury/prot build can fix that problem. This probably won't be your MT though, respec costs could get pricey. 
---
I imagine there is also a point when Naxx is on farm that you're just so over geared you can pull this off MT in current tier. Probably on the back end of every tier if you chug +armor consumables. But you'd still need shield for aoe and certain encounters.
---
I saw Asmongold say this the other day lol
---
People found a way to hop layers inside instances, so they could essentially skip an entire dungeon and repeatedly kill a specific boss every couple minutes. Those people are getting banned. It required a specific set of actions that are so far out of regular play it took 100,000 players 3 weeks to accidentally find it
---
Thank you for this
---
Some people are just dicks. My experience as a mage has been great so far but every so often I entered a dungeon having just learnt a new water spell and the healer would say something like "need 200 water" and it's like sure....let's just wait 10 mins whilst I make 8 per full mana bar then drink for 45 seconds lol.

That's fair, but I personally don't agree.
---
I think parts of retail suck ass (post-Cata talent system, removing glyphs, Heart of Azeroth, etc) but I think parts of classic suck ass too, like the relatively terrible quest design, having Horde starting zones clearly being inferior to all the Alliance ones, horrifically unbalanced classes, etc.
---
What I'm getting at is each has good things about it. Sure, each spec in retail can do MOST (but not all) things, but they each feel very distinct from each other, more so than classic in my opinion. I like things about both, but fundamentally disagree with adding new content to classic as it would change the very nature of what people wanted the Classic experience to be.
---
Great....so was it that kid from London they suspected after all? ü§î
---
You can still totally run traditional groups, there a plenty of people who feel the same as you do. 
---
The vanilla wow spirit / feeling of the game was largely rooted in ignorance, it was a brand new game and nobody knew the optimal play styles, specs, or compositions. There is nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs just a fact. Obviously things change as a player base improves and becomes accustomed to more challenging dungeons and raids over time.
---
The correct answer is put faerie fire on them so the mobs kill them and they take a repair bill.
---
If you kill them no repair bill :p
---
crime bad
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think they enforce that. People name and shame ninja looters and stuff all the time here.
---
What? The people that revived classic and are currently working on it are some of the people that worked on vanilla. There‚Äôs a video of them all playing the game literally talking about some of the quests they designed in vanilla.
---

---
It's an issue and at the same time it isn't. For starters, know that Blizzard's plan is to remove layering before phase 2.
---
Anyway, realms don't *need* to be so populated that we need multiple layers. In fact, supposedly each layer is about the size of a realm's population back in actual vanilla. In theory a server can just be 1 layer and there will be no population problems, and while things like quests may be a problem now, that'll keep decreasing as time goes on and naturally solve itself. Essentially, the issues you suggest do not need a solution.
---
So why do we have layers? The reason is that Blizzard expects there to be a major dropoff. They're expecting that a ton of people will come here, try it out for nostalgia, try it out just to see whats going on, and then leave. And once they leave, a previously healthy population would shrink down to a small population and the server would start having issues with people being unable to find groups or such.
---
And without a doubt, many people will quit. In fact, we're in our 4th week, so presumably a lot have already quit (queues are indeed going down). The real question is, did Blizzard correctly predict the number of people that will quit? Y'see, if Blizzard estimated too high, we'll have too many players for a single, coherent server without layers. If Blizzard estimated too low, we'll still end up with a dead server.
---
I'm personally inclined to say that Blizzard probably overestimated the amount of players who will be leaving, and that turning off layering is gonna cause issues, but who knows? We'll have to wait and see how much the servers stabilize.
---
Thanks! 
---
It is TukUI with a slightly reconfigured "TukUI 18" theme.
---
(It was a high level priest)
---
and that might be part of the problem.  Espeically when it comes to an alt I'm more willing to deal with tricky leveling for a character I care about.  I leveled a prot warrior to 70 in the early TBC days and it was worth it because that was the character I was planning to invest in.  But as a time passer alt, maybe the class that requires the most investment isn't the one to pick.
---
Man that was obviously some light humour when the dude was banned, how did you not see that? Are you 12? Lol
---
Why doesn't Blizzard use Silverline or some such protection service like every other real enterprise company in the world?

SoC does NOT want a fast weapon. SoC wants a SLOW weapon for the instant attack procs, SoR wants a fast weapon and is not standard in paladin dps right now, that's why judgement's video is unique. He's taking a twist on an old "meme spec" and has made it vastly superior. spellpower on his gear will become more and more available as time goes on as well, his damage isn't going to "fall off", it's never going to be as high as pure dps classes but that's okay, there are other ways that a ret pally can contribute to the raid as well.
---
And I didn't say "look at this amazing thing" I said ret pallies are fully capable of pulling solid numbers, which they are. "solid" doesn't mean warrior/rogue/mage.
---
Not really. It's expensive as you make. If you started LW and skinning it's gonna be cheap as you level as you go. I decided to get gold first for mount. And now leveling it. 150+ won't be expensive because I'll be getting the 'expensive mats as I level. I'm up to 225 now and think it's probably cost 10-15G at a rough guess after vendoring what I made etc.
---
I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that Unbreakable passed away, but you can watch some of his stuff on YouTube. He was a shaman in vanilla that made pvp videos. He had one video where he took all his gear off and just had the hammer and was still one shooting people. He made me want a shaman so bad.
---
I have no real sympathy for this tauren, mainly because of all the horde players that hit level 40-50 and then decide to go to redridge and fuck with all the level 20 alliance players just trying to level.

It‚Äôs not uncommon for people who do this sort of thing to use an email address and credentials they farmed/stole from somebody else. Like if somebody breaks into your car, steals a gun you use for personal defense from your glovebox, then goes to murder somebody with it and throws it in the trash while they‚Äôre fleeing. Cops find the gun, trace it back to you, now you‚Äôre looking awfully guilty of homicide. Have fun proving that the gun was stolen from you.
---
Not saying that‚Äôs what happened here, he could be a fucking idiot. But just wanted to bring it up as a possibility.

It absolutely wasn't, but it still wasn't an insult. I was emphasizing the point that you're using an awful metric for analyzing and discounting a class.

No they don't. This would be a HUGE privacy violation.
---
Yup, I've killed skull level Warriors before because they just can't do anything about it unless they get super lucky with resists. I don't even have Cone of Cold yet either...
---
In later dungeons maybe, especially if you can stun lock a caster mob. In that case I wouldn't even spend rage on that target. But in leveling dungeons where the mob is melee, the extra rage from getting hit is great.
---
*calculator

That's what I'm saying.

As a new wow player, I feel this. I want to tank but every time I respond to a LFG, I advise them that I‚Äôm new. Immediately, they kick me from group.

whats the addon you use to show the current CC on the target? like how its showing the psychic scream debuff on  the enemy portrait where his face would be
---
Or maybe there was just a lot of people subscribing within a very short time frame which in the long run isn't a big deal at all? Just fucking stop it with these shit posts. I know you want classic to be the best game ever made in the world and to prove everything wrong. But give it some fucking time before you go around talking how classic changed MMOs and blizzard should now devote all their ressources to making classic-like things..

What about his free action potion before your nova?

That's just pathetic.  Bet his GF does play the other faction cause hes a bitch.
---
The whole point of layering is that it's supposed to happen without you noticing. If you've been invited to join a party you've probably layered
---
You better matching the stereotypes of another generation doesn't suddenly change the date of your birth and I reckon you already know that. Kinda seems like we're having a pointless discussion to be honest lol.

Conversely to how Japanese ninjas are the worst ninjas (everyone knows of them, how secretive can they be?), Tauren rogues are the best. No one has ever seen a Tauren rogue, so they have a 100% success rate.

Here's a little story from Ultima Online:
---
When the game was first designed, they created a virtual ecology. There were grazing animals that would eat the vegetation (which grew back over time) and predators that would eat the grazers. The idea was that the player would need to control how many of which animal they killed in order to maintain the ecological balance. Kill too many predators and the vegetation would disappear from over-grazing. Kill too many grazers and the predators would die out from no food.
---
When the game launched, every player immediately went around killing every animal they saw. It totally borked the virtual ecology, and the devs had to scramble to re-code the game and basically remove it.
---
TL;DR -- never give videogame players too much credit.
---
I always thought that my art and video games were incredibly normal together.  Everyone in my personal life that knows me as the guy that does art is not surprised by the fact that I play video games.  
---
I always saw the two as kind of going together.  
---
And I do fine art.  Landscapes and painting of flowers and shit.  
---
I am completely blown away by the idea of someone looking down on you for playing video games because you‚Äôre an artist.  
---
Good lord, I would show people pictures of my land plot in archeage all decked out with canvases of my artwork, that I sold in game, and they would get a kick out if.  Most of the people I would share that with don‚Äôt even play video games.  
---
I have an ex that was a proffesional photographer that thought it made perfect sense that I was a gamer.
---
1 - Blizzard (and the majority of the WoW Classic community, myself included) is strictly apart of the #NoChanges gang, so asking for this is like asking an ocean to dry up.
---
2 - Too few talents? Each tree for each class has 15-20 talents alone. Sure, some of them aren't the most exhilarating, but it's not like we're starved for choices.
---
2 - Too much level? Doesn't this contradict the "too few talents" thing? Too many levels would imply you have too many talent points to spend, and no idea how to meaningfully use them.
---
3 - Gun-wiedling Rogue already exists in retail in the form of Outlaw. If you want pure gun-based ranged Rogue... That's just a Hunter. Spellsword hasn't really been tried in WoW yet if you don't count Death Knights.
---
You mean blizzard and the police organizations that caught him? Because they sure as fuck think he did it. Ffs
---
Oh no people tried to be nice and help me out with an issue I voiced on a public forum. Get over yourself, you‚Äôre kind of a douche
---
Using the remotr app to remote into my desktop at home.
---
From what I've gathered rolling my first warlock the two rules are... stam = PVP, spell power = PVE. I'm saving a seconadry set of armor right now in preperation of phase 2.
---
As for BiS I'm currently [following this guide on WoW head](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow) 
---
Lastly - my wand is from [Jed Runewatcher] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12605/serpentine-skuller) which is a rare spawn in the 10 man raid UBRS. :-) Good luck on your adventures!
---
&gt; Blizzard Security Team worked around the clock with local and international law enforcement agencies to track down the source of the DDoS.
---
Yeah this is totally the same situation
---
That isn't against tos
---
30s vs 40s and skulls. Yes. Oh well. And the horde didn‚Äôt have the thought to not rush in. Smarter not harder.
---
Good thing I have my die move.
---
Something that says "leather daddy"?
---
Hot cigars and leather.
---
&gt;Well they aren't spamming heals for one.
---
That isn't something a ret does better than a holy pal.
---
&gt;I think they get a few improved seals that holy spec typically dont use, one of them can help with in-combat Mana Regen.
---
All paladins get seal of wisdom, and ret has nothing that improves the mana gained.
---
The reality is, you are better off bringing a holy pally that offers an extra buffer of healing than a ret that does less dps than a tank. It is just not a smart move to bring a ret paladin, period.
---
3 possible spawn locations on a 7 hour respawn timer
---
It's a rare mob with 1.0 attack speed. Pretty much the de-facto hunter pet in vanilla.
---
I never said anything about justifying, you can absolutely have whatever faction on whichever boss. But it clearly makes no sense for Alliance being the ones to take down Onyxia and I think it'd be cool if it was like that, but it's not like it's a big deal. You don't have to be so anal about everything.
---
mage
---
Just say ‚Äúi‚Äôm new to tanking‚Äù and leave it there. I‚Äôve been playing since Vanilla and have been doing that for every dungeon i‚Äôm in! 
---
They don‚Äôt need to know your new to the game nor does it matter. Don‚Äôt be discouraged - those are the kinds of groups I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in anyway. See if you can find a lvling guild to work with, a few friends around your level to team up with.
---
I'm almost sure if it was horde running around they would kill me asap. Very very rarely I met a high level horde that didn't decide to butt rape me as I'm walking with either full health, dieing from a mob or just left their horde pals alone when I could have killed them.
---
Oh, you're right -- I think, I haven't actually tested it in-game. In that case the damage difference between the sword and the axe is 25 points of damage, which assuming 400 attack power is about 10%.
---
It‚Äôs not tricking anything, its literally going to the computer to press the button, the very definition blizzard states is ok.
---
true. thats a really good point and it depends on the level range. the trend i have seen so far is that boe under lvl 40 are 90% of the time a vendor sell while on my current realm disenchanting of lvl45 and higher should net on avg a noticeable plus(up to 100%). i havnt done any calculations yet how cheap linen,wool, silk and mageweave/leathers affects the enchanting mat market, but there can be possible profits for certain shuffles.
---
i use auctionator and do daily scans. it shows me a tooltip with  % of what i can possibly get when i disenchant and how much on avg it is worthin the ah. technically i could scan for cheap greens which give me on avg x profit by disenchanting. 
---
another good income are cath runs, disenchant both blues once everyone is set gear wise, the shard is worth 4g on my realm and contribute them evenly since we run it so many time for the xp then use that gold to get other mats you need.
---
&gt; Forcing an expansion upon players does not delete all progress.
---
You've been lied to.

It's hard to see if you don't care about looking behind the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù curtain, but [**there will always be a reset somewhere.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/d3u8mg/the_pyramid_progression_cycle_my_revised_thoughts/f05cae0/)
---
Sometimes it's really obvious, like when your purple epics that you struggled to get are so quickly replaced with green commons that a new player gets handed just by showing up. Other times it's trickier to see, like when talents and spells get slowly pruned over multiple expansions because of bloat and homogenization.
---
Attunement chains get quietly removed, XP requirements get nerfed. Don't be so blind, Dart. You've been living a lie of progression this entire time. Your character is the product of cleverly disguised reset after reset.
---
There will always be a reset somewhere. The only difference is whether you notice it or not.
---
Every month it seemed we got an extra day or two back then
---
I hope that piece you're looking for drops and you lose the roll to a warrior.
---
Idk if that was HIS or stolen/fake mail but even so.. we couldnt see that info for his twitter anyway.
---
Well, kinda, but no. Hacking is a term from frontiersmanship, when confronted with a difficult situation will you be able to overcome it:

And they only gank redridge because there are 8 level 50s in hillsbrad.
---
Damn that sucks :(
---
Question about Rogues and backstabs. Are they viable in pvp? and do they proc on bosses? Noob question never played Rogue but looking through the talents. Dagger spec seems to rely on backstab abilities.
---
Right quick math failed me 21 pts +10 level = 31 but there is effectively 21 levels of pts from 10 to 30
---
&gt;Given the massive success
---
But you already called it a success.. its to early to call it that. You need to realize that ALOT  players never played wow.. and they just tried it because of hype, and will quit very soon.
---
Blizzard know how to hype games
---
Classic got one big problem.. there will be never a update path, new content. Classic simple got no future, and this is really big thing from players perspective. Sure you can play with friends now, make few dungs, few raids.. but thats it.
---
I just watched the movie again few days ago
---
I have a warrior friend who cheered at an alli hunter taming Broken Tooth. As soon as he tamed it, he killed it and then killed the alli. I just hope the fucking thing didn‚Äôt run away because when you take them they‚Äôre already at minimum happiness. Fuck
---
Classic+ will never happen until naxx is out and over. So probably don‚Äôt have to worry about it not being the endgame.
---
huh?
---
Yes, engaging games are supposed to be challenging, not just be a clicker fest with sparkles and a cash shop for cosmetics.
---
I had a rogue in my raid who would just ninja locked chests because he was the only one who could open them. I guess we auto skipped the rolling on that one
---
I already forgot this happened and this kid ruined his life over it. Any idea how many years he's getting? What a moron.
---
I go full normie during the week then enter neckbeard mode on the weekends and holidays.
---
That made my hands sweat just watching this. GZ
---
All these post about horde getting groups together to take down high levels are great. The ‚ÄúI ran to the guards and he got pwned‚Äù are not so great imo.
---
Most addons are still being worked on and will slowly improve as time goes on. You can type /console scriptErrors 0 and it'll hide the errors but you can't really stop them from happening unless you disable whichever addon is throwing the error.
---
Sonteraven and Bonechewer are 2 excellent blue level polearms for hunters that usually sell for pretty cheap on the ah.
---
He'll probably do a year like the last guy. Precedent proves the US will extradite if he's living abroad.
---
Whats it do
---
Travel (flight paths too) entertainment was taken into account too, i remember hearing a dev say way back they'd add things they thought would look cool even if they served no purpose just so people had things to look at and explore while running/flying. Some of the flight path stuff are zones that are totally pointless too
---
I think I'm on a similar pace. It's just that this will take weeks longer at this pace to hit 60, and I've seen a decent amount of rogues manage much quicker then it feels like it's going to take me. Then again, maybe they're playing 3x as much, while I only play after work and on weekends.
---
Depends on where in Australia... I get 1ms to blizz oceanic servers on 100/40 fibre.
---
Big congrats! As I was taming mine there was a warrior on a ledge above me about 1 feet and I just kept saying ‚Äúoh please don‚Äôt fucking see me oh god oh fuck‚Äù thankfully I think he was afk but damn
---
Missed opportunity to put the water at crotch level
---
Yeah. I'd wanna see that on a black mirror episode haha
---
Still using it as a level 28 Rogue here. Have a few gear pieces that have higher stats but not when the bonus is applied.
---
Lmao what a crock of shit fanboy post.
---
"Completely wrong and baseless" seems like a bit much.
---
WoW became what it is today partly because of feedback from the community. People wanted more content, balanced classes, etc, and Blizzard gave it to us. Obviously it wasn't perfect, and in some cases they admitted they messed up and attempted to fix it, not always successfully. That's how games like this have evolved, and you can't seriously tell me that the OSRS devs have NEVER put something into the game that didn't work or that people didn't like. The difference is that Blizzard can't just remove core expansions features from the game once they're implemented, only try to learn from them in the future (which they sometimes manage).
---
But adding more content to classic and creating classic+ would likely (given Blizzard's sub-par track record) would likely just end up with people wanting original classic back again, and now we're back where we started.
---
I mean attacking some indy company would probably be easy but someone like blizzard? Don't they have a good anti ddos system?
---
I know that there was a time in RuneScape when ddos attacks happened quite often (both on individuals and world's) and to my knowledge noone got caught.
---
It started that way but by the time their were 15 horde it became a game. Enjoy the repairs lol.
---
someone actually did the math in a thread a couple weeks back and Hunter with cheetah was faster I believe.
---
Alcor's 500-1000g atm
---
Opinions **based off of their private server practicality** means about as much as fan-generated star wars movies on YouTube should mean to the writers and producers of episode 9. 
---
Blizzards official servers dwarf the popularity of pservers, so the implementation (or lack thereof) of LFR/dungeon finder/flying mounts should be treated as such: with a much higher population potential for each leveling range.
---
Perhaps you worded your first reply to my original post a bit confusingly, but the black and white conclusion you gave was simply inaccurate
---

I'm on the highest pop french server which is always high/full. My guess is that people who don't speak english don't have access to as many guides and stuff and aren't aware of the meta as much, so there's less supply.
---
Always be suspicious if there's a cross-faction priest higher level than you (32+).
---
Sweet as cheers for that, do you know if it was a relatively recent update? I will update tonight regardless.
---
How long can a message in mail be? Like, how many characters?
---
Pain is your body telling you stop using those muscles.
---
 Oh, is there such a thing?
---
Alliance still does this in retail lmao
---
Surely the hunter wins easily?
---
The top comment in the thread you're replying to is someone intending to harass the person. It's a reasonable assumption.
---
I mean, it's not like you tried to research it. You're just going for some reddit karma.
---
IIRC each instance of damage has a seperate chance to break fear, with the higher damage having a higher chance to break, as dots and drain spells deal low damage per tick they actually have a relatively low chance of breaking the fear.
---
I could be wrong about that though.

I personally wouldnt level as balance. Youll be oom after every mob. Itll take forever
---
If it does, I‚Äôll just take out my frustration on some helpless hunter trying to tame a rare beast
---
NA was basically all weekend
---
Should show in chat

I'd have assumed their would be more druid healers than shaman.

maybe blizzard keeps track

Beat me to it!

Nah bro they'll get a network security job and use this arrest as job experience on their resume/interview

Fun police over here. Sorry everyone no sub-optimal builds. This guy doesnt want you to run a non minmax build while leveling.
---
should put "epics in retail" as first panel.

Ever heard of chrome remote desktop?
---
How often are offtanks needed in raiding? And will there be raiding spots for offtank druids in Classic?
---
I believe it was called grid and it was exactly that, a raid frame setup of enemies near you. The problem was it was too useful making things like multi dotting a breeze. So blizz changed the API to break grid and remove that functionality from being possible.
---
I think you can still install grid but it's just a shell now that displays the frames but you can't interact with it at all.
