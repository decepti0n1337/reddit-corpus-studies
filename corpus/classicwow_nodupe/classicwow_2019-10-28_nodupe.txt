AOE ZF farming sounds pretty nice honestly, and im sure mage leveling can fly by now that there isnt a ton of competition anymore

Horde have an fp in bb?
---
haha, alright. :)
---
Sorry but he just wasn't important enough for the pic :( but here he is

Theres also no druid trainer. Would have to visit stormwind or teleport moonglade every few levels.
---
I play a warrior and I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out why CC in classic feels so brutal. It's the lack of pvp trinkets!
---
they arent bad really, they are average. you can self heal, so you dont need to eat every second mob like other melees. you also get free mount at 40. and a ton of defensive cds to survive any cheeky situation and get away.
---

---
never heard of them being mentioned specifically as a bad levelers.  ppl usually say they are bad/exhausting to level, in a sense of them being BORING to level. thats what ppl mean. cos you mostly just autottack all the way. 
---
but in terms of their speed/strength as a leveler they are in the middle of the pack.
---
Way back when (2005?) I leveled a warrior to 35. Got super bored. Started again as a paladin and took that to 70. (TBC came out mid-journey)  
---
No regrets on the pally
---
Her boobs look kind of droopy and not as perky as I like, but overall an excellent work. Perhaps all that time in the humid jungle has taken its toll?
---
except you don't angry. You flame so they know better next time, not to vent off. 'Dont crack open boxes in strath in middle of pulls' for example
---
Play Orc and problem solved. Idk why I see so many orcs using swords. 1 tank in my guild bought quel serrar. The other needed and won both dal rends. Both Orc.
---
you \*get\* to do dungeons.
---
Me!   
---
The I usually first come first serve invites and my team comp was Warrior - Priest - Warlock - Warlock - Warlock lmao
---
Where horde may have quests, I will argue Alliance was favored in both their classes (Paladins are the far superior tank) and the level design in alliance zones is so much prettier and detailed to Horde based barren wastelands.
---
As someone who wants to level with my friends,  I find dungeons a pain as my friend is q tauren warrior and aoe threat sucks but all the outside instance quests wind up being kill myself drop rate quests
---
*walks to the crossroads and back*
---
Alliance early level zones are far superior though.
---
Basically Tim's sold out for a cheaper, shittier blend of coffee when they became much larger years ago, and McDonald's Canada switched to their old supplier. "Tim's is shit and McDonald's is good" is because of this; you're drinking old Tim's (however, the supplier couldn't sell the exact Tim's recipe/blend, but made one for McDonald's that's close enough).
---
Can y’all dm e farm as the arcane/frost raid spec? Half pre bis atm
---
not possible
---
I mean. I don't care to spend that time. It would just be more analtyical and a stronger argument to actually look at number of available quests instead of just posting a big complaint with no data
---
Got the same drop last Thursday. Gz man.
---
Does WPL change the fact that Horde have better late leveling?
---
You cant cast inner fire on a friendly tho
---
When I first started playing WoW (2005) I was still young (14) and the thought of making friends on the internet back then was such a foreign concept. The internet was still full of “stranger danger” so making real life friends out of online friends was out of the question.
---
Fast forward to 2013 and I join a guild and a handful of the players end up being from my state. One of the guys is one of my very good friends to this day and we have an annual meet up with a few guys from the guild (who are from out of state) to this day. It’s crazy how much has changed in the last 15 years and yet WoW is still here and we’re still making new friends and maintaining old friendships through the game we love
---
So that's what happened to my undeads jaw...
---
It’s not a tip if it’s expected.
---
I mean we're talking about going from regular riding training to epic riding skill. I assume your average joe (or a 10 year old who's been practicing) probably falls into the former category. The people who ride all their lives are experts.
---
With that said, this is the dumbest argument ever and I'm done with it. Really wish you hadn't bothered to reply at all.
---
&gt; The developers and team members that made World Of Warcraft are mostly no longer even working for the current Activision-Blizzard.
---
This is our last chance to have a new content that's actually made by *some* of the people who made Vanilla, and by the people who dutifully recreated it in Classic.
---
&gt; And that'll be your Classic+ a new, different, painful death into something similar to current retail.
---
If there somehow were an unlimited number of good expansions for them to recreate, then that would be fine.  But if they remake BC, then remake WotLK, they'll then have to start winging it to try to keep people playing.
---
I would much rather the people who know Vanilla/Classic start making new content *now* rather than have a whole different team at Bliz try to expand on WotLK content (including its dungeon finder system) at some point in the future.
---
By asking for BC/WotLK, you're asking for WotLK+ in the far future rather than Classic+ in the nearer future.
---
No
---
I was thinking perhaps Weakauras but didn't want to bias potential answers!
---
I miss how dark vanilla was vs what it is now.   
---
If people dont know; blizz removed actual night/darkness from retail due to some players never being able to play during the day so they could never experience WoW that isnt pitch black.
---
Who gives a fuck? How does it harm anyone else?
---
There's nothing wrong with it. It doesn't hurt anyone. It's just cringey.
---
As you leveled a rogue main, I think you'll find leveling a mage is like setting the game on easy difficulty
---
nope
---
It's just facts, it's happened so often. It's not players to blame, it's class design leading players lacking fuller understanding of game, as well as selfish players to make these choices because of how the game itemizes. But it is still just facts. It happens every now and then and someone from my group gotten screwed over same day in that exact way right in front of my eyes., in that instance causing group to disband. It's  many times i've seen it.
---
You see classic is far more social? This is not random it's how the game makes you interact, similarly some classes lead to more antisocial behaviour rogues, hunters easymoding etc. Mages elitists, tanks big egos. Etc. It's not random, it's caused by the game how it is made - what experiences it leads players to.
---
Downvote me all u want, it's just facts. Reddit is a weird place where tiny egos spam the downvote if they can't handle the truth.
---
you do realize that "yankee" is a derogatory term for "american" right?
---
yankees could mean: the baseball team
---
or: stupid americans
---
I think Priests edge them out at end game, but they are very strong viable healers, that’s for sure.
---
Gouge into bandage is a popular rogue leveling mechanic for a reason. Waiting for big cooldowns like blind/evasion leads to much larger down time. This isn't really arguable, most good rogues do it.
---
Not to mention the fact that improved gouge is integral to gouge kiting, a technique that is integral for solo tough elites.
---
Mirah's and Thrash are no where near as good as dalrends
---
I’m on mobile, what’s his battle tag ?
---
The addiction is real lmao, house and neighborhood may or may not burn down, worried about WoW instead.
---
Yet, Horde get a horde friendly zone with 4 instances they get to camp. The point is that they should’ve had equivalent.
---
Flaming is not the same as giving decent advice, it’s about the tone in how you say it.
---
And then the mage needs on it.
---
Roll mage, cast detect magic.

I saw both drop on my first run. Won the MH. Saw MH again in 8th and 10th run. Got OH in 13th run. And then MH again in 18th crazy as i had a guildie that needed 108th runs to even see it

My friend and I bought wow together and played together all the way through high school. For months before wow classic was released I tried to get him interested. He just didnt want to play. After I leveled my mage to 60 I made an undead rogue identical to his, with his character's old name, and told him his character will live on through me. All I got was "lol nice". Damn! I just wanted to play again with my bud.
---
Well for once if you're not human or orc a must have item is something with +5 weapon skill. A choice could be edgemaster's. This will give you +3 hitrating and reduce your chance for glancing blows, which in turn increases threat and rage generation. I don't think there is any item with +5 to fistweapon skill, but edgemaster's increases sword skill by +7. For an optimal build I would chose qs, but then again it is a lot of money. How hardcore you are willing to be, is up to you.
---
Cool story
---
Population declining != dying
---
If you think classic is dying you are so out of touch with reality it’s not even funny. RETAIL wow is dying. Classic is thriving and will continue to thrive, despite a declining player base (likely leveling out around mid p2/p3)
---
Dw if you died, it happens to everyone learning haha
---
Yeah better to just leave out points that dont support the argument then just paint a broad stupid brush over everything.
---
Tarren mill doesnt even have a goddamn cooking fire.  South shore is far and away the better town in this zone.  Swamp of sorrows sucks in general; the flight path takes 45 minutes to reach from any feasible starting point.
---
Sure there are a handful of points to be made, but I could see a replica of this thread coming out with an opposite argument and the same "reeeee" factor.
---
That’s the concern I’m told. People keep thinking their crazies when their just silly. No racists, but man that’s poor luck on the naming.
---
Same with Hinterlands. I feel it should have more Dwarven interactions but it doesn't.
---
I'm not going to argue it anymore. You can find other rogues that talk about it at length, i'm sure.
---
Didn't even bring up gouge kiting, i guess it's a bit advanced.
---
Gnomeregan is in the VERY BUSY Dwarf/Gnome starting area and is surrounded by alliance only zones and tough-ass mountain passes.  There's no completely neutral enemy territory adjacent to it that would make sense for horde characters to be able to penetrate so deeply into alliance territory, unlike the plaguelands, hinterlands, alterac, etc allowing for easy travel into tirisfal glades.  Without a teleporter it is infinitely less convenient to get to than Scarlet Monastery
---
You've moved the goalpost while simultaneously making the argument against the previous goalpost for everyone else
---

I'm not saying either is good or OK. Just saying that if it was 4 am and there's only one UBRS group going, it would suck less to be in the toxic but efficient group
---
I have pretty much the same setup... Hairy, warm and purring
---
Hmmm
---
Is that a twink already.
---
That's not flaming. Flaming is commenting "what a shitter." Instead of giving constructive advice about how to avoid it next time
---
There are problems with TBC tho. Namely:  
---
Makes lvl 60 content void (understandably enough, but still - all those epics ppl are now attached to will be made meaningless. Not to mention all the fun and unique vanity items were all made inoperable/useless after lvl 62, they seemingly adopted a we-hate-fun policy, possibly due to arenas.)  
---
Flying - The jury is clear on this. Flying mounts diminishes the immersive and expansive feel of the world. TBC did a reasonable job of keeping it, but flying was definitely a net negative for the game.  
---
Shattrah. Having 1 capital zone for both factions eliminated much of the faction tension. It also served to make azeroth feel rather dead. In hindsight it would have been much better to add content to both areas, which is ofc why they released Kharazhan. The effect is still clear tho, adding outlands diminished kalimdor and eastern kingdoms.  
---
Raid size reductions. Some people love it to be sure, but much of the grand epic scale of raiding was lost when the size was reduced. Will inevitably split some guilds.
---
He's not in bear form but spamming his abilities as if he was.. so he's basically sitting there auto attacking and hitting moonfire occasionally and he has 0 awareness and doesn't even notice that his abilities aren't even going off.
---
Yeah that’s what I said about my graphics card too after a month.
---
Just in time for my 3rd toon. Already have mage and druid, what to do next🤔🤔🤔
---
I love gnomer :/
---
So, you wanna talk about "downtime", but then bring gouge kiting into the conversation... because that's not slow as fuck.  Alright.
---
1-20 is super fast for Horde and they get to stay in the Barrens.  Alliance have to slog through Elwynn, Westfall, Loch Modan and Redridge.  Took me twice as long on my Alliance chars.
---
People can be inexperienced and nice and still learn at the same time.
---
Exactly this! I play this game for the social experience. I get bored playing solo and so I’ve been doing a lot of dungeons and I’m having a blast.
---
Were you in my group this morning on firemaw? Aha
---
It’s all about threat.  I dont remember every single specific as it’s been a while since i brushed up. But obviously the free attacks from Ironfoe are why its good.  But after that the 9 agility on the sword gives crit and dodge. More crits means more rage and dodge is an obvious need as a prot warrior. 
---
Thats why your preraid BiS chest is Savage Gladiator from BRD. It has agility as well as a flat 1% crit chance.
---
What do the numbers mean in those tables? Like 711-1000? Does it explain what this means anywhere?
---
Actually the chance that this happened to him is 100% considering the evidence provided..
---
We have an arms war who pumps insane dps out with Ss n ww etc. Might be worth a thought too
---
Our guild top dps are all fury wars using 2h weaps. Its all about the weapon, just get a strong 2h out of MC and youll do dmg.
---
Because there's multiple experiences on a PvP server. You have epic zone wide battles that rage for hours, you have intense 1v1s, you have intense 1vX's even.
---
And then you have people who sit on bridges and kill lowbies/throw them off, or who stunlock people while they're fighting tough mobs, who group up in raids and head to leveling areas to kill every player and NPC, or who camp everyone they come across as though the idea of them playing the game offends them. Usually they do this after leveling entirely through dungeons specifically because they can't handle others doing this to them.
---
The former is super enjoyable for everyone who participates but is only possible in a system that allows the latter, which is enjoyable for people who get off on little power trips and trying to ruin others days when they can't do anything about it. 
---
Personally I accept that on a PvP server, lots of the latter kind of people will be there. They can't help it, they literally play the game to antagonise other people and love sitting there imagining how mad the stranger is. What I do love though is how mad *those* people get when you point out how sad their behavior is. Way madder than anybody I've ever seen get ganked. But such is life!

I would recommending doing as much grouping as you can. Whether that’s mostly dungeon leveling or grinding or questing with a friend or two. 
---
Paladin leveling solo feels very boring to me. But my best friend says he loves it so idk you can try it out yourself. 
---
Just make sure that you enjoy healing and buffing!
---
wtf u can't solo Zf farm at 52. dont feed people garbage.

---
Loot council is only good in a certain type of guild with everyone on the same page, and with content that actually benefits minmaxing a few people first. Im talking Method level of guild that actually knows what its doing.
---
I doubt any content in classic will require gear funnelling to specific people, at least not till nax (tanks being only exception) so any guild using loot council is mostly unecessary or beinh intentionally greedy to gear up themselves and friends.
---
You mean when burger bought them out...  When they turned into a glorified hospital cafeteria food retailer.
---
It's so annoying
---
Thing is people are speed clearing in greens and blues. The content is not hard, besides the main tank nobody needs to be funneled loot. Spread the loot out and keep the raid happy. Problem is all too many loot councils become circle jerks of 5-10 people. My guild is using loot council and some drama happened over loot distribution,  of course, and what do you know 30 raiders left,  including the rogue who was fully geared from the last months raiding.
---
No offence but most of that was just the tired old rhetoric used by most people that just want blind obedience of a dog out of their cat.
---
Cats don’t have to like everyone, so it’s perfectly okay for them to hide when someone they don’t know or like is coming over. As for them being destructive to cables, that just sounds like poor discipline from the parents tbh. 
---
Also not sure where this master crap comes from as I treat my cats as family not subservient mindless animals. Cats are a lot more intelligent then you seem to think and probably know you don’t care for them so why would they waste their time on you?
---
Dogs were bred for obedience like you said and that’s not really a good thing. Literally bred to be unquestioning slaves so that actually is a master/servant relationship which is quite shallow. 
---
You can think of cats as more introverted animals that you have to earn the trust of over time through patience and understanding much like a feral animal(because like I said cats are not fully domesticated and they don’t “need” us to survive like dogs).
---
Also you mentioned “we” have had cats but did you actually take care of them personally or just happened to live with them and tolerate them?
---
That's my laptop AND my cat. What in tarnation is going on here?
---
&gt; kiddo
---
I always wonder if people who talk like this to others realise just how it makes them look. Only three kinds of people I ever meet who call others "kiddo"... kids themselves, kids who are just entering adulthood and are desperate not to be seen as such, or adults that only have their age to cling to and use as a reason for being "better" than someone.
---
People like u are just awful

I wear 6 piece Wildheart (along with 2 pieces of tier 1) full time as a 30 Feral / 21 Resto tank. The set bonus is actually really good in low rage situations and PvP. Armor rings + armor trinkets + tank cloak + tank neck + Warden Staff in my other slots.
---
I probably won't replace the Wildheart until I get the full tier 1 set. Which will take a while because I've been passing on it to the Druids that mostly heal, rather than tank.
---
&gt; The Stonetalon Mountains flight path is useful for nothing as well.
---
its worth getting as a connection point though
---
Yes
---
No?... Did you read my comment? Start in Orgrimmar, take zep to Grom'gol in STV and swim along the coast and you're at Deadmines in 10 minutes.
---
Update: I tried it and they told me to piss off
---
Hehe wow man, I didn't mean to hit such a nerve. Maybe think about why that upset you so much and take it in to account for the future.
---
Lok'tar.
---
as Ally its Menethil Harbor. Close enough to IF. Can boat to Theramore,  can do BRD FP. Saves a few minutes of flying to travel to Strat. I like it.
---
 Other than standard Kargath I like booty bay I suppose. Has bank, transport and fresh meat.
---
My friends wanted to play on Bigglesworth, I wanted to play on Faerlina but they were very insistent on playing on Bigglesworth because of how high the population would be on Faerlina (Biggles ended up being nearly as populated lol). Bigglesworth is a cool server, no issues with it at all. Its where I will be playing my alliance characters. That said I have had a really fun time on Faerlina since most of my friends who started playing at launch flaked. Seems like overall population is the same when it comes to attitude (Mostly good experiences. Maybe some bad apples here and there, but overall pretty good). I have joined a guild, have some guildies willing to teach me the ins and outs of tanking, and am running dungeons when I please. The talk of the toxicity on that server as a whole seems VASTLY overstated. It certainly exists, and maybe more than other servers due to it being one of the higher pop servers, and it being the "streamer" server, but all in all I have had a good time. 
---
  
---
The one thing I dislike about Faerlina is the queue time, but in the grand scheme of things I can live with it. Longest I have had is 2 hours, but the average is somewhere between 25-45 minutes at peak times.
---
If you dare
---
I made this post 2 months ago when there were many more than 2 layers on servers at launch.
---
Which cloak is that?

I don't think I have ever seen anyone place their unitframes like that. Are you okay?
---
What’s so bad about Mace spec?   I am in the same boat, got princess mace tonight and about to hit 49. 
---
Currently using ravager / arms / axe spec as an Orc warrior but very tempted to respec maces for this weapon.  
---
Should I just try to get Gatorbite off the croc instead and stay axe spec?
---
And the dungeon of similar level in an alliance starting zone? Horde can teleport there.
---
Im not trying to join a high end raid guild. I just want to find a nice casual raid guild that will accept my degenerate enhance boi ways. I think i've just been unlucky in finding casual guilds.
---
Wotlk was probably my favorite to, I started in vanilla and loved TBC but Wotlk was really the pinnacle for me in part because my best friend came back to the game then and we raided at a high level and pvp'd.
---
Not really. You're not going to get enough runecloth to do enough cloth turnins to hit exalted with another faction before 60. But unlike the level 40 mount, the vast majority of people don't have enough gold to get their epic mount as soon as they reach 60 anyway.
---

I mean, there are ways around it. Skull of impending Doom. Tag a mob add combat starts so it hits you and breaks the sheep. Discombobulator. 
---
Plus, there's a chance it breaks on every server tick. And each time you get polymorphed it gets shorter, until you're immune after the third or fourth one. The first one is going to last a while, usually, yes, but so does every other form of CC.

I'd be interested to know what % of players have purchased the latest retail content, and also play classic, vs. those (like me) who only bought as far as TBC but came back for classic).  I think that Blizzard will think of ways to get 1-time sales from my demographic, as Classic matures.   Otherwise, having for example 100,000 (totally made up number by me) additional monthly subs who (mostly) play classic will keep it strongly supported by their team.    
---
What I could picture them doing down the line is some sort of copy/insert (not transfer) of your toon FROM Classic TO (name-the-expansion) to encourage expansion purchases, or an incentive program to leverage Classic subs into retail purchases.   (perhaps a special mount or character boosts or game time or something)
---
This triggers me so hard. All the locations of ammo vendors are wack. Also I'm in hinterlands and for some reason the ammo vendor there doesn't sell Jagged Arrows??? Quest mobs are around 45 and Jagged are level 40.

Gadgetzan as a gnome mage. It has a bank, gives me access to the southern part of kalimdor, plus I can already port to all the major cities.

I would steer clear of it. It’s awful. 
---
Our guild moved from there and it ended up being an amazing decision.
---
original guild names has left the chat
---
Not really, it will split the pop some but it's the same path really. Move to TBC then WotLK then in 6 years spin up new classic servers leaving 1 of each prior iteration running. It's the path with the least risk and good reward. It makes sense to release TBC more so then classic plus which is higher risk and cost.

I'm leveling a paladin as a twink as well and I can tell you: It is slow, but it isn't bad.
---
YTA, you should’ve invited them to your group, invited them to movie night with your wife, made them godparent to your child, and wrote them into your will. They popped a CD for you dude
---
Yeah this concept is something a lot of people seems to not grasp. 99% of what professions do in vanilla is totally useless to the owner. Just take herb from the start and farm money to buy devilsaur lol
---
So many folks on this sub want to control the content. Say what you want. The negative comments always come first.

No fp in stv except for booty bay for ally, manual running not click on fp and afk. Run from sw or duskwood.

If you’re Alliance, they aren’t on your side.

So they *started* by putting alliance in as an afterthought at the edge of zones with few inns and quests??

Well it's 3 second for the as so is probably like 3,4 it something but I don't know for sure

If they don't ever fix HoJ, I'll be using rune on my rogue for a long time.

Not worth. If you're set on not going Krol/Mirah's or farming the Dal'Rends, you should have a look at sword of zeal.

Or, like 5 other Horde - you will try to kill the next Alliance you see on a boat.

In their defense, I’m Horde and I’m not even 100% sure where he is.

I had online friends whom I don't know how to get in touch with. I grew up in the 90s and played tons of CS, Quake, Ultima Online, DAOC, and AoE2 with a bunch of people. It was a relatively small gaming circle but we didn't have any easy-to-use social media websites to keep in touch with each other. Years ago, I reached out to some of them via their Yahoo Emails and MSN Messenger and got mostly notifications about account closure.

Btw, cool user name, I want a new Monkey Island in the style of MI3 now.
---
Oh man you mean I didnt need to go around the whole zone to get there? Damn it.
---
nope brother, this isn't even a drop of stress to me
---
That's not at all what they were saying dude.
---
I just had a seizure
---
Of course it is, everyone just joins it genius. That's why it moves at the speed of trade chat. Literally nobody is claiming it comes automatically set up.
---
I think Tirisfal Glades my favorite starting zone, though.  After that, you’re right.  I don’t think Horse even has anything comparable to Duskwood.
---
Faster weapon = smoother rage generation (so you’re not stuck with some large awkward amount)
---
Higher DPS = more damage = more threat
---
If you have high rage, faster weapons = more heroic strikes
---
Is that what Uldum is!? It’s so cool going to the gates and talking to guys or what ever and then you just
---
Never hear of it agajn
---
Hey man, had the same problem. Anyone who answers with “just disable the xp bar” doesn’t know the issue.
---
The only thing that worked for me in fixing it was to uninstall the add on and reinstall it.  
---
Kind of annoying but it’s a one time fix since you won’t be leveling anymore.
---
You could be passive-agressive while telling us a story
---
Nah, I was running to SM to run some homies through some dungeons and ran upon this guy what looks like just after this clip was taken. He tried to MC me off, broke early, killed him.
---
When I realized what he was doing, waited for him to res. He resses, immediately jumped off the bridge to the water below and hearthed instead of fighting me lol.
---
Wait, horde has two FP in ashenvale? The fuck? 
---
If I want to do anything in Felwood as alliance my options are: take the absolute terrible Felwood flight path and ride south for 10 min or take the one Ashenvale FP and ride north for 10 min.
---
Does classic not allow for realm transfers? I’d just pay the $15 and transfer if that’s an option for classic
---
I 100% feel you, All my friends are scattered across the realms and even some have stopped playing. I log on everyday and try to blitz through some quests, get a level and call it quits. I struggle with harder quests as a solo rogue. I end up just grinding mobs endlessly.
---
I’m currently in the States until February so I’m 7 hours behind the EU.

Zandalar tribe EU - Kimimaro

Feel free to introduce yourself 😅
---
Flying is immersion killing and overpowered.
---
\-every zone becomes some small nothing that is below you, often barely in view.
---
\-no thought or danger in traveling (contrast with how guilds travel to blackrock mountain in classic)
---
\-introduction of the "dumb mount spam" reward system with the netherwing and shattari skyguard
---
\-is the prime enabler of the go-go zoom-zoom mindset, by allowing players to skip over everything between them and their current destination
---
\-makes ganking even worse, because now the level-capped player is able to fly anywhere, and this also makes it so that your faction cannot retaliate against him
---
\-feelsbad. The various landmarks, cities, and bosses are more impressive/dominant, at least in classic. A personal anecdote is that I had to rotate the camera in order to look up and see Ragnaros' head. This doesn't happen when you are 200ft above the terrain/npc.
---
It’s not generic.  It’s called “devout” and is better for a priest.
---
Can't blame him tho.
---
Yeah this is definitely the best option for an Alliance mage.
---
I got the book already, I have hit rating gear, just not edge masters
---
I mean, Kargath is pretty big endgame. Easy access to BRD/BRS/MC
---
AP frost, 31/0/20
---
Link proof dude.
---
Not everyone cares about min/maxing to the absolute extremes. You realize this, right?
---
why tf did you get downvoted damn ppl mad asf
---
It's not part of who I am. People that do that kind of thing or suggest it are horrible people.
---
/S in case no one gets it.
---
Freezing band dropped for me during an AoE dungeon farm with 3 other mages, I was so pissed, until I won it.
---
Imagine being this insecure lmao
---
What is the max fishing skill you can have as alliance before the stv fishing event comes out?
---
Wand is such shitty dps, it’s just efficient. After ~45 it’s hot garbage. Like swinging with a 2h mace on a balance druid.
---
Spritecaster. Interrogator in BRD.
---
&gt;Even my server is bad, the faction imbalance on Herod is ridiculous. 
---
That's your entire problem. It has nothing to do with being Alliance or Horde, it's just that Herod is a shit server to play on. Pretty much every Alliance player who is decent will have jumped ship by now.
---
Meh. I’d take a group of fun peeps playing like ultimate derps over 4 tryhards spewing vile and venom. Life’s too short for listening to people like that.
---
I’ve made some good friends in WoW and most of them are from arduous dungeon groups. Wiping in challenge modes a thousand times. Running mythic+ high keys on alts and just dying again and again and again. Teaching each other how to heal on a new class or tank big pulls.
---
Try hards are tiresome. I’m good enough at the game. I know enough about trash packs to deal with whatever they might do but dumb stuff happens and it’s better to just laugh.
---
Playing with newbs is fun too. They don’t know anything, don’t have interrupt on their bars, don’t even see debuffs that need to be dispelled, can’t put the boss in the right place, stand in cleave, all the stupid things, but it’s a chance to teach people and raise the aggregate skill level of the community just a little bit. It all counts. Plus laughing is healthy and mistakes can be funny.
---
imagine questing to level
---
Not to mention most people are often mounted now
---
Multiboxers are just free honor to anyone with sapper charges
---
I can't comment on the pvp stuff since I was never that into it, despite playing a pvp server back then.
---
Flying mounts didn't make Outland feel small, not to me at least and it worked quite well there. The zones were all designed with flight in mind and yeah you could just fly over everything... but that was definitely a plus at the time, everyone was sick of long run times while questing and especially to dungeons. Plus it had it's trade offs, if you wanted an herb or ore vein, you either had to fly low enough to scout stuff or run on the ground. Plus when doing numerous quests in one area, I generally stayed low to the ground if I flew so it never felt like just cheesing over the entire zone, taking yourself out of the world and killing any challenge.
---
 It ruined everything when they allowed for flight in the vanilla zones, which obviously weren't designed with flying mounts in mind. So looking back, yeah flying mounts sorta ruined a lot, but imo they were wonderful when limited to Outland and don't think they will or should be restricted any more than they were in TBC, definitely not removed.
---
To buff an entire raid a priest needs to drink back to full mana like 12 times. Think about that next time before you complain "Group 5 needs fort", like bro I'm fucking work on it.
---
Menethil easy flight to Ironforge and boats to north and south kalimdor.
---
Menethil Harbor is a good little travel hub. A lot of people say just put it into Ironforge but Menethil is good if I'm having to go from point A to B. And if I do happen to need services then Ironforge is a short flight.
---
Savage has 2% flat crit
---
And let me guess as soon as you buff the tank starts pulling while you have 200 mana and can't drink because you're now in combat...
---
This is not true.  I played the original game Horde quests were revamped after release.  Hinterlands literally had zero quests until almost a year in for Horde same with WPL, Badlands etc.  What people are seeing now is the very end of Vanilla questing experience which was incredibly superior than the "lets go grind boars" model of how I originally hit 60.
---
Also Kings for alliance rogues gives you 110AP
---
People who say that things are cringy are usually pretty cringy themselves
---
I see so much arseholery in some comments...
---
Dont they share cd?
---
A month is a bit too pessimistic.
---
I think it's going to last half as long as original Vanilla wow did.
---
Which is still quite some times as IIRC the span of Vanillas launch and BC was like nearly 2 years probably a bit more. We gotta wait for the next wave of semi casual players to tapp out the content and get bored before we start calling Classic dead.
---
I’m elemental because a hunter in my guild was going tribal and wanted to be able to make living shoulders for our shamans and druids. It definitely has its ups and downs. Downs....almost all of the gear isn’t great. Pretty much living shoulders is it.
---
Upside, elemental has way less competition and living shoulders are preraid bis for resto druids and alternate for shamans. And they’re really cheap to make, 4 living essence and some rugged leather, and usually sell for 20-30g, for an easy profit.
---
They are also not a Canadian founded company, it’s all propaganda.
---
Does anyone know the server populations on Arugal v. Yojamba? Which tends to be the larger server/what the faction pop is?
---
But then you’re a dwarf.   It’s not worth it.   The cost is too great.
---
For one mage.
---
Yeah, now imagine having to go to like HALF THE DUNGEONS IN THE GAME with that experience.
---
Upset? At who? Flies don't upset me, but I still kill them.
---
I don't think that's an option yet.
---
lol, what a turd of a person
---
If you’re a gnomish engineer and have the teleporter, then LHC
---
Not everyone has 4 hours to spare on wiping to ridiculously easy content.
---
I got Ravager on my second Armory run and I don’t know the drop rate but I’ve heard that some people have a hard time getting it
---
&gt;one group had trouble with this thing, that means EVERY group will have trouble with it
---
lol
---
I didn't realize that when I responded, but did later when someone else mentioned it.
---
Isnt this common knowledge since months?
---
I have a friend that's with a new girl every time I see him. I'm a virgin. I don't really have the patience for women.
---
Hyp! ;)
---
I'll never understand the sense of pride people get from topping dps meters.
---
TBC would fuck up classic numbers AND retail numbers, like classic did, and then you want to do the same with wrath?  
---
  You seriously want to spread people out through FOUR different clients?  
---
 What about panda classic?  
---
  Legion classic?   
---
  People will ask for them, and they have the grounds for it due to BC already happening.  
---
  If you go down the path of tbc plus you're doing nothing but going towards a brick wall with a set expiration date.
---
So I guess you’re pretty cringy?
---
Alliance: menethil.  Horde: kargath
---
You fucking maaaaad lad!
---
Settle down, save some pussy for the rest of us... damn.
---
Do you really think he made this post for the sole purpose of contacting the other player? Or to share the kind experience with others? How about YOU think logically lmao
---
Upvote for Ultima online, and AoE2
---
Stfu I mind control you off the boat
---
&gt; the horde ones have no grinding periods
---
LOL found that one guy who only levels when fully rested. Lots of stupid shit gets spread on this subreddit but this is actually one of the most absurdly wrong things we've had here so far. Good job!
---
What's this fishing event I've heard twice about now today.
---
I'm not denying anything I'm just asking for proof.
---
I'll add this; if you leave a guild that has decent raid expectations, and you are fulfilling them, just to join another guild, where do you end up? Right back on the bottom of the totem-pole. Hopefully they are not rewarding a player who does not meet expectations in performance by skipping cons/fail assignments/slacking. If you are doing well, hang on for a bit, talk to the right person about your concerns, and if you still aren't happy after getting some loot, that is the time to leave. Save your raidlogs and talk to a guild recruiting once they've FINALLY thrown you a couple bones if it truly is unfair, the new guild will be happy to grab someone who tries hard and already has a few pieces of loot.
---
No.
---
Makes sense because ours is the uphill battle in Azeroth.
---
lol true
---
Which part am I wrong about, it being against ToS in Vanilla, or it being against ToS in Classic?
---
Which one is this?
---
Menethil Keep. Gives me access to every part of the world I need to get to. And it's a 2 min flight from IF if I need to get to the city.
---
He is talking abour playing fury in raids and tanking in dungeons. What the fuck are you guys not understanding?
---
Have you been playing classic? Lfmage Lfspellcleave etc etc etc, zoom zoom mentality is impossible to get rid of at this point.
---
Nah bro you're just being a bit of a dick
---
There are parts of Mara you are able to solo for gold. If you look you can find guides for priests.
---
So I don't know if this is a biproduct of using elv - but if I abandon a quest it drops the items, if I try to delete an item associated with a quest it pops up a warning and says the quest will also be abandoned. If no pop-up, the item is safe to delete.
---
Eh.. not much else to do till the battlegrounds drop and everyone starts posting the 360 no scope headshots
---
Can horde see me if I’m in cat form doing stalk ? I’m level 22 idk if that matters? I got ganked quite a few times trying to get to Felwood by some level 30plus horde who then camped the spawn point and I had to whisp all the way back up to the next spawn point in Ashenvale ..I wanted the flight path but it’s not worth getting killed over and over ..
---
Kinda smart... ummm... hope you don't want to return at any time though.
---
Or are you just done with wow in at moment you find Classic has lost its charm.
---
Personally, that's what it's gonna be for me.
---
Really wish the gif lasted about 5 more seconds YEAAAAAH LIIIIIVE YEEEAAAAHHHH WINNNNNN
---
I quoted "and will be in classic" it's not in the classic TOS, and we have no indication it will be. Hell you can right click horde and add by battletag with most addon setups. They left that open on the API on purpose. They definitely don't give a shit.
---
Try ClassicAuraDurations
---
Dude I'm one of those friends. Fucking kids man. I wish I had more time to game, but I also love hanging out with my family. I play a lot more single player games I can pick up and put down easily.
---
Its because you can have an add-on that makes them into emotes similar to twitch chat
---
&gt;I think it's going to last half as long as original Vanilla wow did.
---
im curious why you think people will lose interest so fast.
---
my go to argument why classic wont "die" in any relative timeframe is because it already didnt... on private servers. classic is beeing actively played for way over 5 years already.
---
releasing official servers with objectively better, more authentic gameplay where you dont run into: random shutdowns, dev drama, corruption and paytowin is now somehow going to kill the game in two years. i dont think so.
---
I solo's his recently. Ran in (dying twice), then feared the guardians and grabbed the egg. Barely made it.
---
I guess greater eternal essence is expensive? So ppl guy greens and disenchant?
---
That Fear Ward came in handy earlier today when I put together a group to run Sunken Temple.
---
&gt;not like they are using every consumable and world buff out there
---
They have tribute buffs, ony, elixirs, elemental sharpening stones and sometimes even songflower for their main raid speed clears. Idk why you are suggesting otherwise. The original argument was this guy saying he did Naxx in 2006 with none of those things on top of not knowing how to spec or how hit rating worked. That just didn't happen.
---
This is why I want Classic+ more than BC. Half the zones in the game aren't even finished. The world can be MASSIVELY improved without the need to release Outlands.

Dude post it on there &amp; update it plz &lt;3
---
The context of that quest extends in WotLK too, with, if i recall correctly, some horde quest camps in Howling Fjord and Dragonblight having you help them for their research in making a new plague too. But i don't think it foreshadows Sylvanas betrayal, probably because that wasn't even a concept that existed back then, and activision came up with that bullshit idea much later, when they run out of other content and new expac ideas. I think what it foreshadows instead is Grand Apothecary's Putress's betrayal (who was working under Varimathras) and the events that led to the Wrathgate and the battle for Undercity in WotLK.
---
Alliance have a quest in Arathi called "Hints of a New Plague?" as well, which is also probably connected with that and other quests too.
---
422 afaik
---
300 + 20 from the iron fishing pole + 100 from the  aquadynamic fish attractor for 5 minutes and +2 from the enchanted fishing gloves. 
---
Which is a joke considering you need 425 to be on the safe side to catch anything at the bay of storms.
---
This is why wow will never be back in its golden age with classic servers.  It's just a different gaming landscape and it's a different time in my life. It felt so good to bring all the computers into one basement and play for 16 hours straight and then repeat over and over.
---
Tailoring can also be a gold maker if you move bags in bulk. You can usually grind silk or mageweave pretty easily when you're a higher level, and as long as you're supplying the cloth, at least half of the ah bag value is profit. Also, mooncloth only goes up in value as the game goes on (needed for naxx stuff especially), so making mooncloth every four days is nice.
---
My personal recommendation is to never level a crafting profession on the same character that intends to use it unless it is already bankrolled. Basically, I find that unless I spend a bunch of gold to level the profession, quest and dungeon rewards will be faster to get than self crafted mats of the same level. I have a lock alt with tailoring. He's level 10, and has 150 tailoring, and several items banked for use. This is the only time I've ever succeeded in having a crafting profession create a reasonable number of items I'd use. Maybe I just suck though haha.
---
Professional athletes who get frustrated at their career is not the same as playing world of Warcraft lol you guys are hilarious
---
Lmao so what’s the point of it being a pvp server?
---
Saw a 40 lvl guy with same cloak look as my Sapphiron  drape :-( bit disappointed
---
Kittens.
---
depends what spec.
---
it seems like if you are a dagger rogue, it's not a good time XD
---
if this doesn't get answered, ask it again in the actual thread.
---
I usually stack winter's chill while the tank gets aggro/position.
---
Lmao this is wow
---
That's just the way it is in classic lol
---
That's just WoW, no addons
---
sounds like you need some therapy if people goofing off in brd makes you this upset.
---
You couldn't when they were 20k though, that's why the price went up so much.
---
Damn missed it!
---
If you want to look lorewise you are wrong, NE are very militaristic, even their Females are warriors unlike any other races. Humans? Only Jaina is a mage, Orcs? no Females at all, Taurens? well, all tauren soldiers are Male, High Elves do have sorceresses though as well as Male footmen. 
---
Lorewise Orgrimarr is small freshly built village not huge ass well fortified capital. Orcs are refugees in Kalimdor they are small in numbers. Taurens as well, in fact they barely survive against thousands of centaurs, there should be much more trolls though, Kalimdor is their home continent after all. 
---
NE should in every corner of the Ashenvale, Agressive living trees, Owlbears, furbolgs, Giants etc. 
---
Humans should be in every corner of Eastern Kingdoms, Stromgarde, Hillsbrad, Stormwind, Alterac, Dalaran, even after Horde invasion they barely noticed it. In fact if you level as a human most of their quest is about some subtlety plot of Onyxia and her Black Dragons. 
---
They should have Gnomish submarines like ton of them, flying machines left and right, huge ass fleet. Theramore island should be dominated by Humans as well. Eastern plaguelands should have tons of High Elf refugees and be basically Alliance zone. Scarlet Crusade keeps should also be Alliance territory. 
---
Last but not least, Blood Elves should be Alliance race not Horde. And Horde should have get Ogres. 
---
It's just Blizzard very biased towards Horde and had to balance forces to make Horde and Alliance equally strong in the game. It's understandable why Blizzard are biased though, Warcraft 1&amp;2 is basically a story about Horde, how they happened to get between hammer (Burning legion) and anvil (Alliance).  
---
Also if you look at racial abilities, Horde racials are way better and teven in TBC with introduction of BE silence and useless Draenei's Gift of Naaru.
---
Hunter &gt; Druid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; War.
---
Wars are worst then rogues for farming.
---
Hunters are great and Druids are nearly on par with them - depends what you are farming.
---
Thanks for the bump. :D
---
Nope, not all of them. I'm not saying naxx was piss easy, I'm saying naxx was nowhere near min-max.
---
Dafuq do I know I've used elv since Wrath. I have no idea whats been doing it lol.
---
&gt;14mo after Launch not even new people were doing it.  
---
Youre making it sound worse than it actually was because 6 months later wotlk came out. 14 months compared to 6... but even if that was true, I remember some guilds *still* doing Kara pretty much right up until that wotlk patch hit.  
---
&gt;Good you have someone to carry you, now you don't need a tertiary source of catchup gear then :)  
---
Except not everyone is a good guild or in a super high pop server. Which is why having catch up gear isnt bad. Seriously catchup gear doesnt affect you negatively in the slightest, yet you treat it as if it does.
---
Then sound less whiny when someone answers your question, I hope you don't actually respond to people IRL like that
---
You'd probably have to dump 300-500g (depending on the price of runecloth) worth of runecloth into another faction's rep vendor, only to then have to pay 90 or 900g for whichever faction mount you want. At least you can do it though, I'm a tauren and they can only ride kodos or wolves
---
Edit: You also have to learn the (insert mount here) riding skill which is another 10g
---
Oh dude I whispered you a few weeks back about remembering you from Hyjal after seeing you on Skeram.   I remember your buddy too! Crazy seeing this on here
---
sheesh lighten up
---
Early dungeons suck because blizzard didn't know what they were doing in terms of design and made them WAYYY too big and confusing (wailing caverns is another example of this). Don't worry, they get shorter and more concise as you level up (until the end game where they get pretty long again, but not in a confusing way)
---
It's sad because for me, aesthetically, Hinterlands and Azshara are my two favourite zones at the moment. Shame there isn't more questing there :(
---
Dusk wood and Wetlands... now there’s a a couple names I haven’t heard in a long time. Shit I didn’t realize how much I missed Wow till right now.
---
Only works on slows and stuns as far as I know.
---
nah, every priest most likely have inner focus to get free cast, everyone uses  2-4 times total rank 2 prayer of stams (whatever its called that buffs whole group. one with inner focus and next with normal cost 
---
source; im priest
---
I wasn't making any points about desolace questing but rather pointing out that what he said wasnt relative to the OP's post or the what the guy he was replying to said. 
---
But yeah stay mad weab.
---
How is garbage like this upvoted? Max rank frostbolts the entire time. You don't ever use ice barrier in raid because you go deep arcane and not deep frost. You will never go oom with mana pots, runes, gems, evo and mage armor. 
---
If your guild is not one phasing rag you need to have a serious talk with your dps because they are not pulling their weight. Mages in deep frost spec might be a good thing to cut for mages that actually run raiding specs, for example.
---
It isn't bad, it's just very passive. Not that slow either, and you can heal dungeons when you want a more interactive playstyle. Personally i'm prone to burnout leveling one, so i tend to do like 1-40. Play an alt / main for AGES, then 40-60 weeks/months later but that is just me, my mates can 1-60 one no probs.
---
there are also 2 kinds of runes you can consume. Not the best for raiding, never claimed that. But decent and still bring totems.
---
I've leveled... Three now. One in vanilla. Another in BC. Now this one in classic. I always do like the first 40 as ret then switch to prot and tank to 60. Holy is incredibly good. Do it.
---
It kinda of is. It's not level-10-player-vs-level-10-player, it's player vs player. Have your friends you rolled on that server specifically for help you or why even play that server if they won't? Not really playing together if they don't help at all.
---
cool. is that on judgement?

Freezing Lich Robe dropped in Scholo
---
Guess so
---
Ugh ok thanks for that. My friend told me that but I wasn’t 100% sure .. I’ve never had a problem getting picked on before but today was really bad. It’s also the farthest I’ve strayed from safe zones though so there’s that

Wasn't that the same name as Leeroy's guild?

I tried.. so hard to play classic wow. I did play for awhile and it was soooo fun and exciting and nostalgic but damn, I got to 40 and just don't have the time anymore. I get an hour or two every few days and maybe a full day on the weekend but with my career, if I spend an entire 8hr day  on a game I wasted I ton of time I could've be improving myself. It fucking sucks. I want to just love wow again. But I can't
---
And damage over time is what DPS is. R1 frostbolt to get winters chill will increase every other mages dps but it will decrease the WC mage dps by a lot more than what you gain. It'd only be worth doing if you have like 15 mages in your raid.
---
That sucks. Sounds like they don't help much anyway so why not just roll on another server?
---
Well he reiterated that that was the only point 3 times so yes, I do...
---
Hunter.
---
Best class in the game.
---
"Valid" technically but not worthy of sympathy imo
---
hahah spelunking ftw
---
Unless you blitzed past some of the zones, you should have quests on back half of felwood, winterspring, Burning Steppes, and a few others. There is also the quest from fallen hero of the horde.
---
Also 54-60 you should be farming mats for gear and enchants on top of grouping for gear. Things like skinning devilsaurs in crater. There is tons you can do solo while trying to get groups.
---
i still see tons of BRD groups, lots of 60s still run it for certain bis pieces (banthok sash eluded me for far too long, i saw multiple hoj's before i got my belt)
---
That's my struggle man, between the fam, my doge, and work, and my irl friends... most of the time i turn a game on, then as it is loading into the menu I have to get up for hours. 
---
I just picked up a single player game, atom rpg, I think I have like 30ish hours into it.... but maybe 12 of those are actual play time. The rest of the hours were from having to get up and not bothering to quit lol
---
Is Faerlina a good server to start?
---
That's kinda what kept me from subbing the second month. Meta leveling and the majority of players being so far ahead. Either way I didn't imagine a good time.
---
lol youre gonna be done like few days after you hit 60 i guarantee it.
---
Yes, you can measure healing on those instead of dps
---
Hunter/ranged- How do you use your Gnomish battle chicken? I have noticed the little fucker doesnt seem to go and do... anything... if your not like, RIGHT in melee when you use it. I havnt used it too much but curious what your strats are for it.
---
&gt;I would bet my nutsack they will make changes "they believe are better and more inline with how the game should play".
---
I think we should give some props to the Classic team, because they are aware of this problem, and they made some effort to avoid it.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1910
---
Not the best at spelling though
---
Is there an addon that helps me conjure water until i ran out of mana?
---
indeed, hunter has a deadzone to work with and the fact their traps can't be used in combat and even thrown til later expac(have to combo with feign death). that is why you always see hunter with scatter shot and entrapment talents if they ever want to pvp seriously. Pretty much most hunter tricks are two-step(require more than one skill to execute).
---
even til this day when i look back at old hunter pvp  videos, it still amazed me and i can say even with 3 years of experience playing one, i can still learn much from those videos. In pve you just need to learn how to reliably trap and strafe kiting a mob(no real need to know jump strafe)
---
Horde playing pvp and having fun? Yes typical horde ;)

what about xfire?

BRD and LBRS gets run a lot. Even a group with 4 60s just wants to get it done so they are fine bringing a 50-something.
---
He acts like the whole world is against him, which is how toxic players think. 
---
I am alliance and get 1 toxic person every 100 dungeon runs.  I had people help me with quests and ganks throughout my leveling. 
---
If you are constantly experiencing toxicity, it’s time to look in the mirror!
---
what was your /played to 40 using this?
---
if so then your guild needs some mages
---
That gnome in the background seems to be watching you.
---
We get tired of the complaints when you know exactly what you're getting into with a pvp server. It's easy enough to reroll. I can't stand this being done to me even though I like pvp every once in a while. Therefore no pvp servers for me.
---
Yes this is what I used as a Rogue, he focuses on mobs that are probably lower level than you. If you start with it and like it then I highly encourage you to stick with it till the end because there are a few parts of his later level episodes that require items or prequests from lower levels. 10/10 would recommend
---
4D chess moves right there, respect.
---
Your buddy has made a huge mistake and you shouldn’t do the same. Transfers are only available from high pop servers to trash low pop ones so you’ll end up playing a single player game forever, not being able to find any party to dungeons or raids. 20-30 lvl is not too much, convince your buddy to come back.
---
So for packs of mixed elite/non-elite mobs, like say the first few pulls in Strat, does anyone have any recommendations for controlling the packs? I’ve typically just focused on controlling the elites and having the DPS focus down the non-elites. 
---
Is there a better way as a Warrior tank? I’ve tried spamming Battle and Demoralizing Shout, Thunderclap or just trying to tab Sunder everything and just focusing on elites (while taunting the odd non elite) is what works best.
---
yeah hence why i said "media giving them exposure"
---
I'm considering rerolling off of mage due to such strong competition in raid gear after nearly 17 days played.  I am so so so sick of losing rolls to 10 other mages in the raid.  :-/   Don't get me wrong, fun class to play, tons of damage, tons of utility, but man, you're going to be rolling against a busload of people for every single item.
---
What’s happening on your screen though
---
Savix
---
Warrior or Hunter.
---
thanks mate.
---
Someone just lost to a priest wand 🤣
---
Prowl works on the same mechanics as Rogue stealth. You can be seen if you enter into their field of vision, which becomes greater if they’re higher level.
---
I remember my first brd run in classic, 3.5 hours, like 7 full wipes not counting the 4 times our shaman ankhed, end result some sweet gear and friendships forged in a literal volcano
---
&gt; Even a group with 4 60s just wants to get it done so they are fine bringing a 50-something.
---
Hasnt really been the case in my experience
---
I main a rogue, and I find the pally can be a little boring at times. But the contrast is sometimes nice, plus pallys get better with level.
---
Yeah it feels like I'm just too far behind even though it's only been a couple of weeks
---
Reroll
---
Oh no I’m the super casual friend
---
Warriors aren’t the best for gold farming as they don’t have a lot of sustain.
---
Hunter would probably be your best bet.
---
He must not have a bestfriend
---
I've saw the vid yesterday actually, very helpful. And LOL at the ban thing. I'll check the discord out, thanks!
---
Is your guild gnome only?
---
Just because some levelling brackets are dead doesn't mean the game is
---
Also, I remember going through WPL to get to SM eventually. Though I guess I did go from Southshore a bit.
---
Not always. Just items that can be picked up more than 1 at a time so that it's possible to acquire more than than you need.
---
DAOC.. Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time, in another life.
---
Okay, awesome! Thanks for the information. What would you say the fact balance on your server is?
---
That is both an exploit and if you were to kill people up there, abuse.
---
Maybe just talk to your GM? I don’t know if it will help, but a conversation with them would go a long way in helping you decide what your next step is.
---
You can make steady, although not outrageous, gold pickpocketing BRD. 
---
Combat rogues can be pretty decent for farming. Not great, but decent. I remember farming elites in Tyr’s Hand back in Vsnilla, although I was blinged our with raid gear.
---
They hate mages since they are all rogues and don't get invited to spellcleave dungeon runs
---
52 for arena runs, and then it scales from there for different runs you can have.
---
Yea, after further inspection I saw that the extra DPS from Axe of deep woods compared to Mirahs is about 10str (compared to 9str from sword). And i think i value the axes special ability plus the +5 axes spec from orcs, higher than 9 agi. So I'll invest in the Axe.
---
Flight masters only attack when you attack first. Might want to get a clue before opening you mouth.
---
Most people do in classic so I don’t understand your comment
---
Get Details! It's a much better damage meter.
---
You can measure healing but the better thing to keep track of is over healing. If you are wasting a bunch of mana overheating you aren’t as affective of a raid member. Sometimes it’s better to use a global cooldown for mitigating or dealing damage. For instance a dot vs a renew as a priest. If you are playing well your threat will be high but not so much you are pulling and your mana will be enough that you can deal with contingency. 
---
Don’t be afraid to try a raid though. There are plenty of guides online that will keep you from coming into the raid the most newb. I would also recommend going over the boss fight videos so you understand the boss mechanics because nothing slows a raid down more than trying to explain something to one person while everyone else sits around waiting for you to figure it out. Don’t be afraid and don’t bail but do your best to know what you are getting yourself into
---
That sounds like actual hell on earth
---
Am I the asshole
---
does it not hit for base damage of weapon aswell as evis dmg? also switch because sometimes it all gets dodged or resisted. Dont have high level daggers yet.
---
It sounds like they were having fun.  There nothing improper about that scenario.    The mentality that the only way you can have 'fun' is maximum efficiency all the time can stay in retail where it belongs.  If that's how you play that's fine, but other people are not doing it wrong, so to speak.
---
Honestly I hate wow because it killed the mmorpg community.
---
All games before wow were group content orientated.
---
After wow, all mmorpg games are solo questing.
---
Talk to raid leader and/or guild leader. Tell them you're there to raid and ask what opportunities you have. If you have none, leave. If they honor having you there, they'll give you a chance.
---
[There's a path around the city that doesn't require swimming](https://i.imgur.com/aUpAvP4.png). If you fly from one FP to the other, the wyvern avoids the city too, and follows the same path. There's no 'road' but it's clear it's where you're meant to run.
---
Spent 5h inside Maraudon the other day..can relate.
---
LT works for tanks. Not so much for every1 else. Some form of decaying dkp system works better. After all, BWL isnt coming out anytime soon and stacking everything on 1 person creates threat issues.
---
You also get a lot more buffs under level 40 because obviously, nobody will dismount to buff random strangers. As a Druid, I think I mostly stopped buffing strangers at lvl 20, because shifting out of cat, buffing them, then back into cat took a lot of mana and slowed me down because I had Feline Swiftness skilled.
---
I'm going on 29, and have never had a group of friends that I played video games with :/
---
Got catfished when I was 13-15, but that's it. 
---
Funny thing is that she was actually a girl, just not the one I thought, and when she came clean, we actually met up and dated for a bit. (Both lived in the same city).

Why only dwarf priests?

Dude if this happened to me I would find it hilarious, feel a little stupid and then walk 5 seconds back to my corpse and never do it again.

Everybody needs gold.

Great shot!

You can get some rewards, including the best fishing pole in the game and a trinket that turns you into a fish (with increased movement speed in water.)
---
Ok dad, will do.
---
Nah. Definitely have kept items that are required for quests otherwise
---
I wish I had people to play wow with. It’s a lonely world even as small as it’s become

My (probably unpopular) ideal scenario is Classic -&gt; TBC -&gt; Wrath, then branch off from there. Practically no way this happens, but I can dream..
---
Lvl 49 mage currently. Looking for the next upgrade. Right running main/off hypnotic blade/celestial orb. I ran this in vanilla and loved it. Don't remember when I switched off but I stayed main/off for the rest wow cuz of this combo.
---
 https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7515/celestial-orb
---
So I guess, what's the next upgrades, any suggestions? And viable 60s main/off options too?
---
 Generally going to be Pvp focused and I'm not all about min maxing, as long as it's good I hope my skill picks up the rest ;P
---
Ok so get a couple of mates to kill the stealth druid. Easy.
---
1 press per cast.
---
The way stealth works is that if someone is a lot higher level than you, they will see you within roughly 30 yards no matter what.
---
hunters doing 1k dps overall in MC during phase 1? no.  only 8 people in the entire raid dealt damage? no.
---
Tirisfal Glade is my favourite starting zone. I really like it, one of the better zones in the game. You are "raised" in a crypt and start your adventure.
---
What would you propose to do in order to improve balancing without homogenization? I was thinking about changing the arenas format, maybe add something else into the mix aside from the pure PvP matches, e.g 3v3 capture the flag.
---
Yes, stocks equivalent to rfc, and deadmines to wc. 
---
But rdk and rfk both easier and quicker for horde. 
---
BFD is closer to horde fp than alliance, not to mention 90% of alliance starts in EK, and for good reasons why. So travelling there longer and harder already. Plus the run from fp. 
---
SM as others have mentioned. 
---
 ZF is one fp away from horde cap, and for alliance is a fp to the boat city wait for boat, then fp.
---
Cannot read the name without shouting this in my head.
---
I've heard a lot of complaints about this. I suspect it is not operating correctly, even for melee classes.
---
Best choice for Horde it looks like. I also heard arguments for Grom'gol in another thread and I agree.
---
You get easy access to UC and Org.  Easy access to Blackrock and ZG. Easy access to Neutral AH and Bank in Ratchet.
---
As others have said, generally speaking, only a mage's Detect Magic can pull that info from an enemy unit.
---
Beyond that, we can get somewhat close by monitoring the combat log. This will give us info on when buffs / debuffs are added / removed. It won't be able to get info for buffs / debuffs that don't make it into your log (too far away, stealthed, etc...). It also won't get properties about the buff (AFAICT) such as talented duration / effect increase. So you won't get the whole picture, more of an approximation.
---
LibClassicDurations can track this, and addons such as ClassicAuraDurations can use that information to display enemy buffs.
---
Which AH is your main using?
---
Did anyone say it’s better? No, just that it’s possible to have fun when things go wrong. Because it IS possible; just not, apparently, for you.
---
It's less damage than an auto attack. Against a target who will have more armor than a Protection Warrior.
---
You will need to heal eventually, and you will run OOM because you can't regen mana while the Druid can.
---
I really haven’t given it much thought, as I’m still learning about the balance of classic with it being my first time.
---
Either way, there’s more feedback available than ever before, and people have already experienced what wow turned into, so with a good team, they should be able to come up with interesting ways to balance the game without giving every character the same tools.
---
whats your rotation to top dps then? Thats similar to my spec..I can spam frostbolts  like anyone else, and have the same gear as everyone else yet im like 50% of the dps of some other mages..
---
Rofl, man I loved their stuff back then
---
Classic would simply be better leveling experience at 1.3x - 1.5x xp rate. Weeds out the 'dead' zones questwise and grinding need while retaining a big time investment needed.
---
I’m fortunate enough I’ve got 2 great friends I played vanilla with 15 years ago and after us all separating and fizzling our over last 5 years we came back together and are raiding together again. We ran MC all 3 of us last week for first time since then. Pretty sure we all got a little misty at one point.
---
My auctioneer doesnt default to 1c bids... maybe you need to adjust your settings
---
there are more items you can get. but it basically comes down too focusing on blues that give int+stam instead of spell dmg.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i actually just use my pvp set for this which currently has about 150 spellpower, 3150 hp and 5950 mana (its not complete. the final version will have about 3400 hp)
---
Very jealous of this.
---
Am i the asshole?
---
Faerlina is very high population and often has login queues. It is highly competitive and has lots of very strong guilds. It is also the streamer server.
---
I don't fully agree with OPs post, but the bottom line is that there are more quests for horde than alliance.
---
1-60 leveling guides for horde have no grinding periods. Alliance guides routinely have you grinding out a half level every so often just to bridge the gap between the quests. 
---
that said. Iron Forge is super close to brm, so alliance have it nice there.
---
&gt; The real dicks were the ones in the floor underneath ganking everyone in a spot the guards don't see them.
---
That actually is bannable
---
I don’t understand why an end game weapon with that on use ability didn’t exist- druids got the short end of the stick
---
If you’re considering pvp but also don’t want to be shunned from pve, why wasn’t rogue considered? Very fun pvp and single target dps in pve is one of the highest with warriors
---
Between kids, spouse, feeling drained after work, etc. Some people don’t haven much time. There’s other investments that’s necessary. 
---
It’l sucks but it happens
---
Official realm list says Arugal is "new" while saying Yojamba is "high. My bad!
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
That's so odd. I am using Joana's and am 2 levels higher than the guide. I must have terrible quest item drop rates.

Oh I hope so, it would be a shame to see them regress in such a way.

Am I The Asshole. Theres also a subreddit for it for IRL things
---
no really. it's not.  
---
horde have around 10% more quests.   
---
I'm only doing leveling guides this time around. In vanilla i just played aimlessly and there was a lot of grinding involved, and world pvp distractions etc...     
---
Horde have an easier time leveling, alliance have a nicer time with endgame with IF being close to BRM.     
---
there's no bias there. just facts.
---
I like Aux. Is simple to post items and I can still use the default too.
---
Have used other ones but I'm not an AH poweruser so i wasn't using most features anyway

Of all the things in life I could not be very good at I guess I’ll take making fake gold in a game full of pixels as one of my first choices.  I’ll continue to have fun playing the game in my spare time anyways.

You on the other hand get to go through life being an asshole.  Good luck with that.

Kinda sounds like you don't want an auction house addon
---
r/longlostgamers is a longshot but you can try there
---
In addition to the above comment, people have an addon called spy which will sound an alarm when someone stealths within render distance of them, letting them know to turn around and watch their backs
---
There is no bad luck prevention system in the game. RNG is RNG
---
Also I can’t buff from the back of my Raptor *shrug*
---
as someone who leveled as alliance 15 years ago, and doing horde for the first time i disagree.  Horde feels disconnected and bounced around. Alliance flowed and you could jump into the flow easily. stormwind-westfall/redridge-duskwood or dun-loch-wetlands-arathi/hills. horde is spend 20 levels in barrens.

underrated comment
---
Dude, you are way too nice to even be thinking this hard about it. You are being used. You aren't part of the cliche. From what you said, you don't have banter with these guys on even a superficial level.  
---
Un-fun raid atmosphere + no loot for you + nothing to do outside of raids with guild = /gquit  
---
I mean, what more reason do you need?
---
As far as loot systems go, the less people play big brother with gear the better. For the long term, point based systems like EPGP or DKP offer a good, fair, and transparent way to guarantee rewards for your time investment. EPGP is a very straight forward and milquetoast points in gear out system, whereas DKP can get pretty crazy when it comes to bidding on items, but it can be a lot of fun if you enjoy some drama. If you like to play fast and loose with rolling, then suicide kings that resets at domo is about as fair as rolling can get and still keeps thing simple instead of trying to delineate items into categories. If want a high risk/high reward environment then there are guilds that do completely open rolls where you can win multiple pieces in a night, or walk away with nothing multiple weeks in a row. Also pugs will do this, but the 2 downsides of pugs are that they run MS&gt;OS because it causes less drama, and a rotating roster of players means competition is never really decreasing weekly the same way it would in a proper guild.Every other system aside from the aforementioned tries to do too much and gets too convoluted to be actually effective in the long run.
---
Ultimately, most of these weird hybrids systems that still try to use loot council only exist because someone wants power and/or items over others; no amount of smooth talk will hide that obvious truth. Loot council at this stage of the game is frankly a joke. The entire foundation of loot council is based on progression, and there is none to be had. MC is an easy raid, and Onyxia is like a side boss; pugs and casuals can full clear in one sitting while wearing garbage. The only guilds that should even consider playing big brother with loot are tight-knit speed running guilds, because they have actual gains to quantify and low turnover rates unlike guilds comprised of randoms and cliches that can leave on a whim.
---
About 15 to 20
---
Valuable comment. Solid contribution to the conversation.
---
Probably has a life and family
---
I never played WoW before classic, but I think a lot of  people remember WoW as a time sink and view that as a negative, especially now that their lives are full in other ways (children, marriages, careers, etc.).
---
Roll a rogue.
---
Main tank roles in raids are really competitive. You only really need like 2 actual tanks in mc, the rest can be offtanks that are just dps warriors with shields. You probably know all this but I am just putting it in words. Also, your main tank usually has a real high position in the guild, as the MTs gear matters a lot. They get fed a lot of stuff. that means there is only around 1 slot for a different tank, and if you have another tank that also has connections and shows up for every raid, a benched tank is going to have a real tough time finding a slot. 
---
I am not saying that you should leave your guild, but you should see if you can maybe work something out. In my guild there was someone who was in somewhat of a similar situation and they decided to start leading guild PUGs on different days so they could still get a lockout. Now we have 2 different guild raid groups that have grown out of that situation. Your guild may or may not be ok with that happening, but you may be able to talk to other benched people and try to form a working relationship with another guild that you can do MC with while still staying in your main guild.
---
Alliance: ok i need to start in dun morogh, then head to loch modan, then do some darkshore, then go back to loch modan, then start redridge, then some more darkshore, then finish redridge, maybe sprinkle some westfall in, then we head to duskwood, then wetlands, finish off darkshore, do ashenvale, finish duskwood and head down to STVietnam.
---
Horde: durotar, BARRENS, quick jaunt to stonetalo- BARRENS, ok maybe some ashenva- BARRENS, finally done with barrens, thousand needles.
---
Just fucking respect for raid you pleb
---
I think it's unfair to pass as much judgment as you as to what I enjoy or how I play. What's the difference in a 'system' and a 'game'? It sounds like semantics to me. If you enjoy a certain way of playing, why is that bad if it's different than how you play?
---
What level are you? In the high 20s and early 30s his guide is rough. But it gets much better. 
---
Also, he grinds from quest to quest. Which will cause you to fall behind as time goes on.
---
There's adult responsibilities besides just work. And i'm sure he has other hobbies and doesn't want to dedicate all his free time to a game.
---
You don't see how that may be possible, but for some people not how they want to spend their life? 4-5 hours a night if you have kids? Most young kids are in bed by 9-10. So 4-5 hiours a night playing WoW when you likely don't get home from work until 5:30-6PM? That means getting home from work and not really seeing you children, dude...
---
It's about 700-1000g in Runecloth depending on rep &amp; your servers AH.

I agree, great point! There's no wrong way to play, however, stop expecting that your way to play is the 'only' good way! To be clear, I'm not directing that statement at you directly. Thanks for your reply!
---
In addition there is no system in place to reward the effort.  You could run something 1000 times and not the item you want.  It won’t take pity on you just because you’ve run it 1000 times.
---
Seconding Auctionator. It doesnt change the default UI, just adds tabs to it.

---
If you only look at them as a competition with others and not as a metric in which you can judge your own overall performance yes, they are bad.  How else are you supposed to know if you are improving if you never measure your performance?  When I saw my DPS was way down compared to the other hunters in our MC raid I went and asked them for advice, and did MUCH better the next week. 
---
If I didn't have dps meters I wouldn't have known that I could do better.
---
If the group is a pug, you don't master loot. You kick idiots who do idiotic shit, because you are the party leader. Prior to the run starting, you inform the rest of the party that it is Main Spec &gt; Offspec and to roll accordingly.
---
I look forward to killing you filthy scum.
---
also he can  DPS/heal/etc.
---
Man this makes me miss my big old guild, only one or two even got back into Classic
---
What's sgc
---
Honestly if you Master Loot you might have more trouble filling.  I have seen so few instances of anything getting ninja’ed that I would rather take my chances rolling with Pugs on normal loot vs running in a group set to Master Loot by someone I don’t know or trust.
---
It's what I use, but it's very simple. You don't have access to historical prices but you can check out booty Bay gazette for that or set up your own database.
---
I’m completely new to Wow. I’m level 21 mage. So I’ve been picking up pieces but I’m still struggling to understand the full scope. What exactly happens at 60. Does the game just start at 60? So far, it seems like the meat of the game is the leveling process, but I’m confused about the end goals and full picture. Is the game focused around world PvP and Level 60 raids again and again or is it the journey to 60? 
---
I’m having fun either way!
---
And this is relevant to his post how? Or did you just want to humblebrag?
---
That's fair! And I agree, however, I don't think it's fair that you'd necessarily expect people to bash their heads against the wall for as long as they did. Granted, it's great when a group of people are actually willing to do so together, but I wouldn't hold it against someone for saying, 'Guys, we tried, but this isn't what I envisioned for this dungeon and I'm going to leave if we wipe again.'
---
You realize most people who play WoW can't even tell you what shoulders those are, right? Like.. take a break.
---
Once the group is made and ready the person rolling on off-spec item should clearly state his intentions. You can also ask everyone in the group if they are gonna be rolling on their main spec
---
Yeah if I was playing and I saw a level 60 join for my WC group, I'd leave.
---
Yeah this game is so complex
---
Totally a fair and important comment. It's OKAY to not want to play the game the same way as someone else, recognize that, and move on without judgment or negativity. Find your people, cultivate those relationships, and enjoy the game in the way you would like to do so.
---
Auctionator is by far the best one. Looks close to the default ui and doesnt add all these unecessary functions. You open the sell tab and drag your item in, the addon scans the ah for other offers on said items and makes your price the lowest with a minor undercut.
---
Couldnt recommend it more
---
Work for 8 hours, come home and eat, wow for 4-5 hours? Bruh... that’s literally your whole day. Doable if you’re young and single maybe, but that leaves zero time for family/friends/literally anything else. 
---
Tough for an adult to justify that to themselves.
---
very
---
It sounds like you found a group that was willing to solve those challenges together. That's great! I'm just saying, there's nothing wrong with someone in that group stepping out if that isn't what they wanted to do - naturally, I'm assuming a respectful goodbye and good try... not a 'fuck you, suck a dick, you all suck'.
---
HAH!! Gaaaaayyyyy &lt;3
---
I'd join this guild in a heartbeat.
---
Lmao triggered by something like this 
---
His advice is sound your ideas are shit
---
I found paladin to be quite enjoyable for leveling. Yeah you don't have a lot of active moves but you start to learn to appreciate your auto attacks, heals, oh shit buttons, and the support you bring to your fellow adventurers. You can survive a lot of situations that others can't and save your friends from certain death as well. Healing is viable in any spec, if you'd like to tank I'd advise holy to get consecration first, or just go ret with a big slow weapon and seal of command. You can also experiment with twisting some seals together.
---
What if you want to go fast?
---
Yeah, i'm one of them (level 49 and a 58); but "2 months" vs the potential year at 60 that'll be spent there until AQ comes out is worth noting.
---
Again mr butthurt, i'm not disagreeing with the general sentiment above; but there is at least one big benefit of alliance city locations till phase 3.
---
Continuing on what the previous comment said; yes, provided that your atk speed is greater than 3.0 sec (AS has 3 sec cast time).
---
Get your kids into it. 
---
My mom showed me how to playp
---
It is actually faster to fly from Darkshire to Westfall then run East to Sven's camp than it is just run from Darkshire to Sven's camp, and that's crazy.
---
Kind of what I figured. I'll just start posting a message after the group is full
---
A MCP with a 3min CD, but is unique, with damage numbers too low for other melee to want to use.
---
Yep I kind of figured. Got any message that seems to work?
---
I avoid loot council guilds.  Simple matter is that even if leadership is 100% honest and not greedy (and that is rarely the case) you can still feel like decisions are made that you disagree with.  
---
I myself only raid with a guild that has a DKP system.  I grant you it has some issues but it keeps the drama down.  You get what you want most if you save ya points and as stated current content isn't so hard that anyone actually needs any gear to progress.
---
Nice
---
I’m straight up skipping STV as alliance - running from booty bay to quests and back is just constant suicide runs. 
---
Which is sad. Best leveling zone in the game for horde.
---
Any message you know of that does the trick?
---
Maybe, just maybe, they moved on to the REAL WORLD... of warcraft o_O
---
I usually try to destroy the stuff. If no dialog pops up, boom. If it does, I'll cancel. Its not fullproof but I'm lazy.
---
This has been mine since lvl 20. Almost 60 now.
---
I'm on 14 so this gives me hope :)
---
We rotate our officers as well. 3 officers in for a month, new raiders every week.
---
You really should only undercut at 1c, unless you're undercutting someone selling linen cloth at 10g/ea.   Most people do not undercut at 1c (in fact you can tell who are the seasoned AHers real quick just looking at this alone), so it's not affecting the stability of your economy. 
---
The primary cause of economic instability is that the economy hasn't stabilized due to being new and classic has a ton of gold sinks.   A ton of people are saving for crafted and BoE BiS items and epic riding (a huge gold sink atm), the major wave of levelers is still settling in at 60, more rare recipes are being farmed up causing more competitors to enter markets, etc.   It's going to take at least until phase 2 for things to settle down.
---
As for TSM, it's now my go-to AH addon.   It took a little bit to get used to, but it's pretty easy to setup some very basic groups and operations using their defaults and desktop application that automatically updates your market values.   Once you do that, it's by far the fastest way to post all kinds of things to the AH and sort out what should be just vendored.  
---
TSM is completely unusable without groups and operations setup though.
---
I still buff people all the time. Except I no longer can buff the whole zep every time I'm on it. Not because I don't want to, but because there's too many people on it with layering gone. I like to do my mana bar and another bar after drinking, but that doesn't even get half the people. 
---
Way less of buffing people walking around though. I still try to, but only when I have more than half mana. Don't want to get killed by some alli because they see me oom after buffing someone. Always through out forts when inner focus is up though. Also me being on a mount or them moving away on their mount before my buff gets off tends to be an issue too.
---
That's not how reddit works. There are no bumps.
---
Dude yes, i do miss this as well. Were all married now, everyone is having kids (or has kids), careers, or have just grown apart.
---
Will always be a very cherished time in my life. At one point there were four of us during Wrath launch raiding Naxx, all racing to 80 with no little sleep. By the end of Wrath of the Lich King everyone kind of stopped though right as Cata was coming out. That was the end of it. A few have returned here or there, one never touched it again, but it was fun. Just life got in the way.
---
We started with EverQuest (a total of 6 of us in Jr. High, all lived in the same neighborhood) and then WOW in 2004 when we were out of high school.
---
Moonkin Aura, as a group buff was, in TBC at least, godly.  There was usually only room for one or two moonkin druids in a raid, and the casters would nearly slit one anothers' throats for that extra spell crit, hance BOOM!kin.
---
Horde pissed. Must downvote.
---
TBC helps the pally experience a lot.
---
Props homie &lt;3 yall are fucking based
---
I leveled engineering to 245 for green lens. Just went straight into Goblin like a fool. If I wanted the BOP trinkets, I’d need to unlearn goblin then level engineering for Gnomish then unlearn and level again for sapper charges right?
---
You're gonna give someone a seizure with a clip like that.
---
Since you're an Orc, take a gander at the quick 1h Axe from UD Strath. Boneslicing Hatchet.
---
Arugal is 100% the oldest with the highest pop. I have been playing there since day 1. Horde has a higher presence on Arugal.
---
blood thirst &gt; whirlwind &gt; hamstring  
---
reason is each one is a "extra hit" meaning unlike cleave and heroic strike which over ride your white these are seperate from your white hits. More hits means more chances to proc Windfury aka more damage  
---
only use heroic strike/cleave when 70-80+ rage  
---
also use cleave over heroic strike if you are worried about threat.
---
I don't get it. I do between 700-900 dps on bosses in molten core without a flask on my warlock. More on trash. Those numbers look like classic to me.
---
Yeah, Destiny 2 says i have like 120 hours. Just started it two weeks ago. I think ive been afk for 60% of those hours easily just from having to get up to do things.
---
Then you calculate the gold per mana on your non-mage water and multiple
---
you can get both those weapons as horde too fyi
---
It also requires  a dedicated piece of software which monitors every keystroke mouse movement, and click. No thanks, even if I was confident I can 100% trust the author and community that's still a hard nope from me dawg. If Equifax can get hacked, so can TSM and no amount of QoL is going to convince me to let a free service monitor my computer inputs.
---
What is the point?
---
Both have capital city dungeons - Ragefire Chasm in Org.
---
Run about as much as stockades, which is to say... not?
---
WC &gt; DM. Plus all of Razorfen is in the barrens, add on SM - it’s not even close.
---
Playing Alliance sucks. My punishment for switching for Classic :(
---
Gonna reroll a NE druid on Pagle, the most populated PvE server. Will I be able to find groups easily while leveling as a bear tank, and raid groups easily later on as a druid healer?
---
That has a chance to fail AND a 4 hour CD, with the hearthstone you can hearth back to gadget to vendor every hour
---
Can you get someone else to buy you one, or is it bind on pickup?
---
I’m so confused, first y’all complain how taking away the toxic ass layering broke the game and showing pictures exactly like this. Now we get the same pictures of people praising wow. Make up your decision reddit!
---
Between WC and RFC its supremely easy to get to 22/23 before you need to go anywhere else. Running WC is mandatory at least once for Crescent Staff for just about every single class
---
I’m more of a stove top loot kinda guy myself.
---
If you only strictly kill the exact amount for each quest.

So tonight I was told that I was being voted against to be kicked from my guild. A guild I have been apart of since the discord before launch. A guild I have worked hard helping others in and recently started raiding. I was getting voted to be kicked because of my ex online boyfriend who happened to be a senior officer and close personal friend to the GM. The senior officer was upset after I dumped him 2 weeks ago. He decided to get upset in guild chat last night. Made a scene for no reason. And then use his outburst to make a complaint to the officers to kick me out. And then only providing one screenshot of a fight we had where I look bad. But not providing any other screenshots against him. And of course I have no screenshots because when I broke up with him. I deleted everything like an adult. Because of our personal relationship, he decided to take to the guild. Resulted in me being voted to kick. This senior officer has many fights against other guild members publicly and taunts other members from the server that our guild members have run into problems with.
---
This is all stuff that only matters to you and your ex guild. 🌊🌊🏊‍♂️🌊🌊 this is me in your tears.
---
For greens, you want to AH ones that have main stat (Str/Int/Agi + Stam) these are the ones that can be quite good sells. At times, you may have to re-list, I usually just post any green up once and then DE it. You should have an alt (lv. 5) and get it to learn enchanting so it can DE items for you.
---
Some greens can sell for 8g+ even higher. Just depends.
---
When I do this I get to a preview screen and cant apply configuration. It seems the commenters are also having issues. This post obviously isn't great.
---
4-5 Hours can potentially be a lot to devote to anything given certain circumstances

Do you really want to stay in a guild where you ex is being petty tho?
---
Woah woah woah, where do i get polymorph pig??
---
My guild takes both enhancement shamans and elemental shamans to raid.
---
Honestly thought we could coincide. GM asked me to put him on ignore. And I did. But I had a lot of friends in this guild... I hate that it had to come to this.
---
I just lost my best friend of whom I met in WoW. Drama is a b*tch.
---
I'm envious.
---
But catchup gear is literally in vanilla. Naxx makes the previous raids obsolete just how you complain that Sunwell did. I dont see how you fail to understand that this mechanic wasnt added in tbc, it was already in vanilla.

8 years ago I had a break up so o picked up wow again in dragon soul in cataclysm met one paladin who invited me to play league of legends with him and his friends and since then we’ve traveled together Seattle Ireland Vegas and more and I couldn’t ask for a better group of friends just because I messaged a paladin about his pants
---
As far as druids go, it's a tough call when you say ms before os. Druid HoTW spec can do both tank and heal. I think you need to ask what peoples ms is and say ms before os or state they roll for the position they are filling in the group as Ms before os.
---
Buy a skateboard.
---
I think TSM lists an item sold if it stops appearing on the AH which is annoying but i don't think you can find out what items sell and what items don't.
---
a useful thing w/ tsm is where it also lists min/avg/max buy for items you've bought off the AH - it's nice when re-selling.
---
Carlos one of my best IRL friends, we stood on MT. Everest together and he wore a North face cloak. Get on my level
---
I'm 26 so still younger, but I have limited time to play between responsibilities and family obligations. Rather get something done quickly and transactionally with dicks than waste time with nice people. Obviously neither scenario is ideal or very fun
---
Classic isn’t for everyone. I hope you find a game that isn’t boring! Happy gaming.
---
In that situation you seem to have had equal cause to roll for a healing item, with them as DPS and you say you're a tank.
---
Best way to try to guarantee, is as you craft your group you cause any items you want to have 0 competition, or close to it. Then there is no need for discussion, no one else will even want it so if it drops you'll be the only one rolling. Like, as a Mage I would make melee heavy groups, as a Warrior I bring only clothies.
---
my god, it's been 11 years since wotlk
---
I think the average playerbase is around 45 now, i just hit 50 after 8days played lol. Still no issues finding groups cause i think no one has started alts yet. Still trying to get that first toon to 60 like most people. In 6 months time though... Server merges will need to be done probably.
---
ma'am this is a wendys
---
Just a warning to stay clear of the guild and it’s senior officers because if you break up with him you get kicked from the guild. I hope you have floaties so you don’t drown.

How? Horde has literally 2 flight points in Ashenvale. You only need to walk past Astranaar once. Horde gets WC, SFK, BFD, RFK, SM literally in their backyard. Oh, also Badlands with Kargath vs Loch Modan
---
Hardest hitting? Probably Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros. However, generally not considered to be a good weapon for most DPS classes (I forget why).

you deserve it for choosing gnome

It's only better than warrior in hte fact you don't die like the warrior does. Take everything bad you've heard about warrior and it's a 'tiny tiny' bit better.

People that complain about world pvp or the things that you can clever do in classic world pvp should just go back to retail. After all, their constant complaints is what made retail what it is today. Bunch of casuals.
---
[This is the current build that I'm running](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-023055210005011-5022101) and having a blast with it, open with ghostly strike, then SS spam till you get 5 combo points and evis the target. Riposte when you can and dont be afraid of using evasion (+65% dodge rating when combined with ghostly strike). Rogue is very much a pick your battles kind of class where you need to use your ranged weapon to pull enemies and try to fight no more than 2 things at a time. Dont be afraid to vanish if shit gets hairy and for the love of god keep your weapons poisoned at all time.
---
As a gnome mage, my HS was Gadget until DM was released, at which point I changed to Silithus.
---
We used FFA loot as well, eventually you get to the point that if someone wants to ninja loot your raid you didn’t want them there anyways. Plus most guilds that survived long enough to get to Naxx actually trusted each other.
---
Hurry, before it disappears up it’s own ass!
---
For some who thought my post was shit, you seem awfully interested
---
Paladins are really designed for group play. In solo play, they don't have many buttons to press and the class can feel pretty boring. They have lots of tools they can only use in groups.
---
Paladins are strong in raid content, and they're arguably the strongest support class in the game. Typically, healers have no gear competition in 5-mans, so it's pretty easy to get pre-raid geared.
---
People say this BS all the time and is 100% not realistic...
---
My second char is lvl 57 after maxing my first and I haven’t gotten into ONE group that has gone over rules for drops.. 
---
yea they will tell you what’s reserved usually before the group as there advertising but it’s just a cross your fucking fingers thing and hope there are no ninjas. Cause end of the day a ninja is going to be a ninja.

---
Took me 13! I do the same thing wear em with pride when in cities
---
Ya, Barrens alone are the equivelent of Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and half of Duskwood in size, quests and leveling spread.
---
Poor Night Elves get Trldrassil (durotar basically), Darkshore and then shoved right into Ashenvale where horde are higher level.
---
I know, but since it's an item with lvl 60 requiered, it is possible that it can only be droped by mob lvl60+ which make way rarer than any other world drop that can drop off lvl 58-59 mobs in dung for example. Yet, I never seen it in the auction house in 2 months.
---
Hey anyone seen rexar?  
---
Nope, in feralas maybe?  
---
Think I saw him in North desolace 1 hour ago.
---
Don't fight mobs more than one level higher than you. A lot of quest guides are written from a hunter POV who have a much easier time killing high level mobs.
---
Big time.
---
You can go to other major cities for auctioneers?
---
Honestly ML is only gonna fly if you reserved loot on a particular boss, and not for the rest of the dungeon.
---
And don't reserve more than one thing, it's really sketchy.
---
Easy Frames.
---
This made me ugly laugh
---
I used hypnotic blade for 15 days /played until I got mageblade.
---
Because that perceived unfairness continues and will always exist. You'll still be ganked all around due to the high popularity of hordes. The dungeons/town placement will always be in horde-favored. A lot of content for Alliance feel unfinished and nothing will ever be done about it since it's a big investment for Blizzard. I decided to quit the game after a month of wow classic as a new player. I just can't fully enjoy the game when there are so many things that reminded me of how the reality work and how powerless I am to change them. I play a virtual game to escape reality, not to be reminded of it.
---
Then 'poof' - you vanish never to be seen again.
---
He wants a rematch? Fuck that he is beneath you now forever

Seems about normal, if you think people stacked world buffs and full consumables back in the day you will be surprised to learn it was quite the opposite.

What’s even the difference ?

ur right the yellow outline isnt glowy, have u tried playing with the graphics settings, low, classic, medium, high etc?

Depends if you want to be surrounded by streamer fanbois, also you will have to deal with long queues (worse when asmon and such stream/do stuff)

You see i wish I wasnt a loser and had some sort of fulfillment in my life to the extent that I didnt need to desperately cling to escapism in the form of videos games that im not even good at
---
Nah, they’re just lazy ass kill quests which are boring but super efficient.
---
Both sides have walk 10 ft quests. Leveled 4 horde classes to 60 on vanilla, 1 alliance and doing alliance now.
---
Horde questing and city placement is just better, except for Ironforge wchixnis better to Eastern Kingdoms than Org is to Kalimdor, and BRD - which is significant, but not for levels 1-59.
---
AuctionFaster is my favourite.
---
You don’t need attack and sinister strike on your bars. Lol

I have no idea what that statement means nor its purpose.

I use auctioneer for searching... and then just... Adjust my posts before I post them...
---
&gt;Hinterlands: I Just finished doing this zone on the alliance toon i'm levelling right now, and honestly this was the camel's back that broke the straw for me. This is unbelievable, Hinterlands is one of the greatest late leveling zones for the Horde, even though their town has a terrible position (not as bad as Theramore or the Feralas town though), they more than make up for it with having a massive amount of quests.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Meanwhile alliance has a CLEARLY unfinished town, with barely anything going on: empty buildings, almost no vendors, named NPCs that do nothing (can't even talk to them), and a number of quests that can be counted on one hand. For whatever reason wildhammer dwarves are a faction you can gian rep with (even though they are 110% useless), it seems Alliance is supposed to just grind trolls for a repeatable quest. Overall this is THE worst questing area for alliance next to Azshara (minus current Silithus) VS one of the highlights for the Horde. Jintha'Alor is pretty much Horde exclusive too, and has more quests for horde than alliance has in the entire Hinterlands, or very close.
---
This pissed me off so much. Aerie Peaks is like... lore important for Alliance, and the zone feels so Horde centric. It's dumb.
---
That and Ashenvale are just rage inducingly dumb.
---
Dwarf priest will get you into pretty much any raid group's roster. Fear Ward is overpowered and priest healers are very good. Benediction/Anathema is very strong and has a 50% chance to drop every raid.
---
Used to despise gnomes. Playing ally this time around.
---
There might as well not be another alliance race. That small character model is just excellent.
---
Honestly the slow killing of a paladin isn’t that bad, just watch Netflix or something on your other monitor. You basically can’t ever die so you don’t even have to pay too much attention.
---
everybody go home, 
---
the horde is cancelled
---
Yeah, no one ever actually goes over it beforehand, but you should.

I get that a lot. I get people in dungeons tryna tell me how to do things. Annnnnnnd I’m the most geared feral Druid on the server. Pretty much all bis except for 3 pieces.   
---
It’s always funny to hear some mage or lock tell me my tank spec is a meme spec. Yet they can’t catch me on threat.
---
If I can convince my opponents to lose with their own actions that's still a win for me.
---
Still need ubrs for shadowcraft bp for prebis, and painweaver pre DM.
---
And without all the qol
---
Yes. Say "Rolls are Main Spec &gt; Offspec" so anyone who is rolling need on gear for a spec they aren't currently playing and they didn't ask for permission won't be shocked when they are kicked and blacklisted from future runs
---
Do you have a video / guide on how to do this?? I’m getting bored of typical aoe farms
---
Then kick you from main raid group because your parses are falling behind the other rogues who are getting funneled the gear as you stay stagnant with pre bis
---
In my experience the kind of person to say this was going to be doing that anyway, was just a matter of what excuse they were going to use.
---
You can use the Winter's Chill build if you're farming inside 5 mans and UBRS.   
---
This way you'll bring that debuff with you where ever you go, but in all fairness it doesn't quite make a difference outside of raids. I personally like having Shatter when I'm going to be spending a lot of time in dungeons for a few days because nearly everything can be rooted.
---
The numbers I used in the tables are just a way of putting the percentages in the form of a number roll.
---
You can basically think of it like there is a random number generator going on in the background every time you attack. That random number generator runs between 1-1000. Whatever it lands on corresponds to whatever your attack does. So if it lands between at 813, then that 711-1000 range qualifies and it does the thing in that range.
---
Video games are essentially a waste of time and an indulgence. He could be researching things, doing exercise, meditating, spending time with family and friends etc. Don’t get me wrong I play games, but in reality it is unhealthy and I could be doing better things. Some of my best memories definitely come from playing games with friends. If your gonna play wow and have it not just be an unhealthy waste of time make sure you are playing with friends at least.
---
Man I basically said the same thing to a friend who asked me to play WoW. And it's cuz I'm busy now. If I had some type of way to hit pause on life and just play WoW I totally would!
---
wow, that sounds awesome...if you do it on a skinning knife, can't you use it at lvl 1?
---
"A lot." He'll be back to name them all shortly.

Getting the key is the best way to get dalrends. Fish for Jed then fill the group with casters once you find him.

Barrens is gorgeous - makes me miss East Africa.

---
I believe you do,  look up wickerman buff for alliance might be in duskwood or something?
---
Shield slam scales like a fucking dumpster fire. It's damage is increased by... 1 per goddamn 20 str. While we look at bloodthirst over there.. mmm tasty. You very quickly would generate more rage with bloodthirst than shield slam because all the 'enhanced threat' people tlak about.. yah.. it's pretty much static numbers attached to the skills and they don't scale. Sunder armor in MC is the same as Sunder armor in Naxx for instance.

There is no path through Stonard in classic. It was added in Cata

Wow they let him waste a deathbringer in his offhand?
---
if it's on a skinning knife, can a lv. 1 use it? Or is there restrictions.
---
Someone else watches dubya dubya e!
---
Dude, Barrens is as big, has as many quests, and covers the level range of Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and half of Darkwood combined.
---
It’s horde’s Redridge on top of its other Redridge that is already central barrens.... 
---
It’s all super asymmetric, which is good, but yeah, falls in favor of horde easily.

Combat. [This](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=rogue&amp;l&amp;t=uNuOtktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtdtFtGtHtItjtJtKtLtXtZt0t1t2JTJUt3tMC0tpuIuJuKuQuLuXuMuYuDuEuFuGuHuyuzuAuBuC) is the spec I'm using @55 and I've had no trouble taking on multiple mobs. There's more to it than spec, of course. Using cooldowns, kick, and CC abilities effectively is important. Also, when the adds really are too tough to deal with, learn how to kite one mob and get the others to reset, so you can deal with one or two at a time.
---
I giggle every time I see your name pete
---
‘Conjure water’ is really just ‘wring clothes’
---
No, and neither has anyone else.
---
I just mean that like, Stonard is just a giant piece of shit in the way for alliance trying to get from Nethergarde to ST or whatever else they have to do in the zone.
---
Currently Horde - US - Faerlina - PvP
---
Former Death and Taxes Vanilla Raider looking for guild.
---
Currently playing on Faerlina Horde, but willing to reroll anywhere.
---
On Faerlina I have a 56 Warlock and 48 Rogue, I'd be willing to play either. 
---
If I reroll I'd love to raid on a mage.
---
Ouah and me thinking I had quite some golds to spend yet with my 2.6k, I can't even afford it if it drop at this price xD
---
My guild handed in the Ony head before we went to MC, few people lagged out after it was handed in because that many lightning bolts hit
---
ok, so people learn 1 specialisation first as that has BoP trinkets and other gear (which are useful/wanted for pvp).
---
The other specialisation, has BoE/consumables. People drop the 1st and pick up this so that they can craft those consumables (rather than relying on someone else/the AH). Plus, iirc, the trinkets/gear from the 1st specialisation do require engineering to use - but they don't require the specialisation.
---
Google knows
---
The fury tank does way more damage, they're trying to make fights shorter for higher uptime on pots/cd's.
---
/r/eyebleach
---
I have a similar build that I will be running lvl 55-60 
---
Allowing me to tank dungeon a little easier and able to solo some content 
---
The only thing I think your build lacks is improve overpower. Please remove 2 point from either 1% 2h damage or something else 
---
But those 2 point in overpower are ... Overpowered
---
I mean it was still fun because how everyone was rushing to level back then and those unexpected places to be camped hard and that one guy passing by with an epic mount when i was still level 10 made me wonder and accelerate the pace.
---
&gt; in a real situations you dont need to click on people in order to talk them
---
That makes absolutely no sense
---
Thanks :)
---
From a quest perspective maybe Ashenvale is Alliance favored, but Astranaar isn't really a good central location. It's central by the map, but I'd rather have the Horde flight points for where the actual grinding goes down.
---
Roll horde on a different server.   Play whatever you feel like playing.  Do what makes you happy it's a game, but you can always change your mind.  
---
Also don't forget it's alt time now for s lot of people, so there will be lower levels to group with for sure!
---
Literally me. I think I get and feel more lonely every time I play cause it’s always alone.
---
Clearing a raid in 2 hours vs 4 is a pretty decent metric too.  And if you can't clear a raid, DPS meters are a must need tool (among others) to understanding why.
---
More realistic situation: Being in a group of toxic, overconfident tryhards that aren't competent, don't actually know what they are doing and consequently rage quit at the first wipe amidst salty blaming and shaming of everyone else.
---
"Got bored of warrior so I leveled paladin" is literally the most contradictory thing I've ever heard... Anf I was Christian for 18 years.
---
The Mograine family really got screwed over. Thanks, Arthas!
---
Classic threat plates
---
I leveled my pally by healing 5mans 90% of the time. I understand that isnt as efficient as other forms of lvling but I loved it. Pallys have some great holy shit spells
---
I just don't understand why people even bother complaining or let alone get disappointed that they are getting camped on a server they choice at start. This behaviour it's what thrived world PvP in classic. Hell, if I get camped I either ask for help or find an alternative route. I choice the server for the experience of greifing and the knowledge of knowing I'll be greifed as well. 
---
And the reason I get upset is because these exact players are the ones taking it to blizzard and complaining about an experience that made Classic WoW. Instead of figuring how to get around greifers they just complain to blizzard.  Just play retail where you can have your hand held or pay to Max level.
---
That's not really a great idea if you're reserving things (going by other comments). You'll just have people leave and take more time. If you just say loot rules that's fine though, but this doesn't solve the issue about the healing gloves,  because someone can just say they're ms dps and came to heal or whatever, so you'd need to specify roll on the loot for the role you're playing - but a lot of people won't like that so again YMMV.
---
It's even worse when you hit endgame.  While Alliance does have a very convenient travel route to Blackrock Mountain with Ironforge being right next to the Thorium Point FP, every other location of relevance is much easier to get to as Horde.  No idea what they were thinking during development.
---
I had the same feel, until I found a very active guild with funny humor. Maybe you should also try to search for one
---
That's awesome! I definitely think that us leveling together made the experience that much more fun. Send me a screenshot when you guys hit 60!
---
I recently got into UOF and I'm having a blast. Highly recommended.
---
You're an undead rogue. It's years of their traumatic experience coming at you :D
---
I'm not complaining, I was discussing it with other people talking about the same thing. And it will get better.. right now it's fucking horrible because so few people are 60, it will improve as many of the people who are in the leveling zones are able to park their own 60's in whatever zone they're in to sort out gankers.
---
And I've said in basically every comment I ever made about it that I support this ruleset because it allows real world PvP to happen. Doesn't mean I can't and don't have an opinion on those who just want to be dicks to those who can't fight back.
---
As for "ruining world PvP".. people greifing others endlessly do more to make that happen than any level of complaining. And even if it did... is your complaint seriously "they need to just take it while I shit all over them because if they don't it might get taken away from me"? Really? Come on. If you want people to stick around and have world PvP thrive, don't go out being a dick to those who can't fight back.. they don't find it funny, they don't enjoy it, many *will* quit.. and what do you gain?
---
On my server the horde create zone wide raids to kill every alliance they see as well as quest givers/whoever else they can kill to stop them from playing the game. All they achieve is having the alliance players log off, go play something else, and then they stand about with nothing to do. Said server is now *massively* horde biased so horde have little to nobody to fight and alliance are so heavily ganked they either level in instances or play a different server.
---
&gt;Wouldn't make sense to me for Nelves in Ashenvale to have giant fortified walls, y'know?
---
They've had some struggles over the thousands of years they've existed, so I don't think this really makes sense, no. They would have figured out how to fortify major cities and towns by now just in cease.
---
Did the quest glitch?
---
Im thinking of asocial aren't I...
---
I didn't think to check at the time. =(
---
What’s the term for when two groups think the opposing group is the only one with bad manners? Alliance has people killing them with 10:1 horde ratios too.
---
See: Scarlet Monastery for proof that your faction isn’t perfectly mannered.
---
I have 0 sympathy for horde in classic. I've never done a BRS run without 10-20 horde camping the balcony. Oh you got killed by 10? Welcome to every time I do DM or UBRS
---
On most servers things are so horde sided that it's borderline that ridiculous
---
Yes, it's my coordinates.
---
Not true. There's a guy behind a building in NE Southshore who repairs.
---
I don’t understand the point of this post. Are you complaining or just restating useless information?
---
Lol its a pvp server and horde do the same shit
---
The true hunting done here is of opposite faction players
---
I got rooted from stealth by something and then a bunch of ??level gnome rogues came out of stealth who all began casting gnomish deathray and they blasted me for 900+ damage each lmao i dropped all the quests there after that
---
Is it normal I get 30 FPS in Orgrimmar with like 100+ people? I am using a Ryzen 2600 and RTX 2070.
---
These types of players worry me. They take the game way too seriously. If I saw another player doing the same quest as me, I’d casually whisper to group up. But if ignored, I’d continue doing my own thing.
---
Why shouldn't it happen ? There is one thing people need to understand, it is that playing a DPS spec or a healing spec in Classic WoW is all about your gear. Especially for a druid that can heal pretty fine as long as he have some early essentials talents in Resto tree and a full healing gear.
---
People really need to change their BFA state of mind especially about gearing in classic WoW. In BFA you can actually play Druid and never have to ever heal in PVE content, this is near impossible as a druid in Classic wow unless your the lucky guy that have his feral spot. Paladin, Druid and Shaman are mainly considered as healer and they need to make sure that they have a viable gear for healing at any moment.
---
I got High Warlord in Vanilla without anything but typed coms. So even that is possible heh
---
&gt; Video games are essentially a waste of time and an indulgence.
---
&gt; He could be ... meditating
---
riiiiight.
---
How does my race and class choice excuse griefing?
---
Haha well, most of my stuff is on healbot. And when I need to Fade, I need to Fade fast.
---
PVP is bottom of my priorities right now because I know I won't be that dedicated for awhile. But it's good to know I could still have some fun there (up to 12 I guess) playing as casually as I mentioned.
---
Thanks
---
You are not wrong. FPs are a good time to take a break to stretch and drink water and stuff.
---
I've got another character that can make potions so bandages are more of a secondary healing item for me. You're 100% correct that with cooldowns 3-4 enemies/1 elite and a goon are fairly easy to deal with. I just like the silly dodge rating that comes with evasion/ghostly strike ( I sit around 88% with the two together)
---
Why do horde think allies are the only side that pulls this shit?
---
admittedly I don't know what's better or the details so I'm not going to pretend I'm an authority but yes his take is that daggers is way better until bwl.
---
When i was waiting for darkfall to come out i ended up hanging out with a few guys in voip. Short story darkfall was shit and we just kept being friends. That was over 10 years ago. We hardly talk anymore, i got in a big fight with one of them. We fixed it but its not the same anymore. Me and my girl just broke up, its pretty lonely over here. And the worst part about being alone isnt the pain, its getting used to it to the point where putting yourself out there is what seems wrong and being alone seems right.
---
They do help and we are having fun together :)..
---
But like i said, it is really horde heavy server. There is not really safe zone for alliance. You often end up questing with multiple hordes around you.
---
I am fine with pvp, but it just gets so tiring. After 50th time undead rogue killing you middle of combat..there really aint nothing to laugh at
---
Well soon lvl 60 so i might roll an alt on another server
---
You do realize Nelfs only get Darkshore before Ashenvale, while horde get the whole of The Barrens (at least!) which is like 4x the size, quests and level range. 
---
Ashenvale is basically Nelf’s southern Barrens. Except it’s contested and they have 1 FP to the Horde’s 2, covering both sides and dropping them off like 20 yards from the dungeon, all the while sharing it with higher level, hostile players lol.
---
Ashenvale is all bonus to the horde relative to the Nelfs. They get kicked into Ashenvale at ~18 and have no where else to go until 26 or so except Horde centric Stonetalon, unless they travel to the EK. 
---
The Barrens cover up to 33. Ashenvale is just where you go to get that sweet early level blue quest reward and kill Nelf lowbies as Horde, maybe gap fill a few light spots from the Barrens instead of Stonetalon.
---
A couple of minutes is a lot. Especially if you use it often.
---
Because I only ever see Horde doing it after the Allies have been doing it and we clear them out. I've literally never had a one on one fight with an ally without them running away, or calling for help.
---
Fair enough, if you've got infinite potions it's not too bad. Average new levelling won't though worth keeping in mind.
---
LOL PVE
---
Same, just started playing on a TBC private server that's still as active as ever. There are a couple good Wrath ones out there if that's more your taste.  
---
Best of luck
---
With appropriate addons (for raid warnings - DeadlyBossMod for example) and decent players, anything is possible. Just be sure to know your role and know the encounters.
---
I personally think it's less aggravating to have a faction only zone than to pretend a zone is contested but have everything favor one side over and over. No one playing only Horde only cares that Darkshore even EXISTS. Meanwhile, low level Alli are risking life and limb to get to SM. They're either corpse walking from Plaguelands (which is 50+ FFS) or walking through TWO HORDE ONLY ZONES from Hillsbrad to get tehre.
---
Cause it’s fun getting y’all back and seeing you cry on Reddit about it. 
---
Goes both ways, stop being stubborn.
---
I dunno.
---
Frankly you're a saint for giving this person a second of time.
---
I'd have at best said "No prop Bob" regardless of what they said. That or "Hard day?... here! Have a hug!" In a facetious manner of course.
---
The guy gets bent out of shape, crying about being social.  All the while acting antisocial... I bet you dollars for dounuts that that guy walks about the world, puzzled as to why people avoid him.
---
From what I've seen, the best rules of thumb for being sociable are; be open, be pleasant, be respectful.
---
That guy was none of those.
---
Come to think of it I haven't seen anyone asking for them in /lookingforgroup either so they mustn't be any good in raids or dungeons either.
---
Level 41 Mage looking for the fastest XP while all my friends have long since dinged 60.
---
Awesome! If you think of it, send me a screenshot when you guys hit it! =)
---
Mostly every pvp server is majority horde. I don’t see how you could possibly complain about one time being in a place with a group of alliance.
---
They 100% do. It's much easier to go to BB and teleport in than to walk from IF.
---
Facts
---
I have timed it many times too, the tram was always faster for me, regardless of when the tram got there. Usually by a couple of minutes
---
Hollands glorie? What server is this!
---
"Getting y'all back"?  
---
The only time I've participated in a large group killing allies is when said allies had been griefing other players previously. IE - A group of level 60s in Hillsbrad killing level 30s.
---
Horde do exactly the same on Arugal at every end game dungeon. Occasionally 2 groups of ally will zone out or rock up and clean up and hold it for a few minutes.
---
BRD- Camped
---
BRM - Camped, BRM chain - Camped, LBRS door - Camped
---
DM:E/N/W - Camped
---
Basically the dominate faction on your server will usually always have control. (60-70H : 30-40A for us)
---
That's pretty bias. Both factions do it.
---
Lol, nah, bro. You are.
---
Meanwhile, no one notices the big boi deer-bird at the bottom of the screen. I bet ya he started it.
---
OP, u do realise that in very reply u typed u used the phrase "I personally", right? Ur action does not represent ur whole faction. The same goes for the group that killed you. Also, like a lot of ppl mentioned above, there usually imbalance between the factions and horde are almost always the majority. So think about what ur fellow hordes are doing when u r whining on reddit. Have a good day.
---
Ya for real. 4-5 hours would mean I never see my kids and family. My average night is
---
6 - Home from work
---
6-7 Shower and help wife with supper (work construction so I get dirty and shower after work)
---
7-7:30 eat supper
---
7-30-8:30/9 - play with kids, get the ready for bed, (baths, pjs and storytime)
---
9 - help wife with dinner cleanup, make lunch for tomorrow
---
10/11 - bed since I have to be up at 6am.
---
I get maybe an hour window between 9 and 10 where I have personal time, but that is usual spent having quality time with the wife and talking/planning the week.
---
Got any recommendations? ;)
---
Plus, as a druid, it gives me an easy way to jump continents with HS in kargath and teleport to moonglade.
---
Pretty sure most, if not all, servers have at least one Sulfuras already. It is in Phase 1. Thunderfury cannot be completed until Phase 3.
---
That said traveling at end game is basically brain dead easy anyway. It's not like BRD is \*hard\* to get to, especially after epic mounts, but for Alli at that level something like RFK is actually pretty rough and consumes an exorbitant amount of time. And others that you mention, like Strat and Scholo, are easier from UC than any capital. You can just keep UC your hearth while in that leveling range.
---
Meanwhile, no one really would run Stockades if there weren't quests for it. And Horde can literally get to Gnomer easier than Alli, even though you shoudl be able to take a piss on it from Ironforge.
---
nah they are right though. You have to go out of your way to talk down to him? Why not just ignore it and move on with your life?
---
Strongest healers are priests
---
Swimming is like 2x-3x faster unless the boat happens to be there.
---
Classic actually feels way more casual than retail. Retail has a lot of casual aspects to it but classic to me feels more laid back. It is very much play at your own pace. 
---
You can also do discord and not talk. Really only time it would matter is in raids or pvp. I have done many raids going back to BC and just listened. I don't like talking lol. With discord if your mic is muted no one is going to expect you to talk. It is nice if there is a certain strat the group wants to run.
---
It is not nessacary though.
---
Same! Raided with Fortes during SoO
---
Horde bias is not something new.  Devs probably thought that the Alliance was going to be the more selected faction because of less gruff looking models or something stupid so they compensated for Horde leveling?  
---
But like...why does H get Rend and Ony buff but not that way for Ally?
---
Maybe they wouldn’t find you so easily if you stopped leaving a trail of tears everywhere you go
---
If you have a consistent raid spot as part of a guild or some other group, I’d suggest a rogue. They do great in both environments, it can just be hard to find a group for raiding from time to time.
---
It's not griefing. It's part of the game design and the internet has already gone over this.
---
Most versatile healers are priest. Most efficient is paladin.
---
"Horde questing is better because some zones have 80-90% Horde quests and shitty Alliance towns. The fact that other zones only have Alliance quests and no Horde towns is not worth mentioning."
---
What drew you to Faerlina to start?
---
Too late now
---
For a horde, you're being quite a crybaby about it. Dont horde usually say the children are all on alliance?
---
Dude. What. Barrens is the same level spread and quests as Elwynn, Redridge, Westfall and Duskwood combined. Of course they do, they are collectively the EK/Alliance version of The Barrens alone - not to mention 1k needles which is horde wetlands.
---
Let alone Hinterlands? Seriously? Alliance have like 3 quests and horde have 20. Its one of the best horde zones and worst alliance.
---
English is not my first language. I did not mean a time that was the only one. I meant it in the context of “one time I was standing outside..”
---
I have to side with everyone who you are annoyed with. Especially after you got cranky when you asked them to stop helping. 
---
I think i would enjoy being your guardian angel too
---
Afaik, mages and warlocks both spam just shadowbolt during raids. But if it helps, mages are still very popular so I wouldn't worry about not enjoying the class  (great in pvp btw). And mages are still great in TBC, but I don't think that matters, as TBC is a dream more than reality. 
---
Happy gaming!
---
It appears to be over crowded and starting on a server that you need to queue into doesn't seem fun to me.
---
Actually it is Varimanthras Orders and you agree to do it. Yea some are traitorous and so are you if you chose to do that quest.
---
Still 10k queues during primetime and our server is still layered, yeah classic wont die soon
---
People are bad. They have bad intention, they always have bad intention. People are frustrated, frustrated by life, frustated by job, frustrated by the game, frustrated by anything. People are a big cup that is filling with salt as they are growning up. That's people nature's in 21th century.
---
When people are playing World of Warcraft they can evacuate some of their frustration by killing other players for no reason, or to be exact for the true reason of pissing theim off. Because people are frusrtrated so they want to make other people as frustrated as they are.
---
At the end in the world of Warcraft, people are not doing PvP, they are just exchanging some frustration. People that actually want to do PvP are playing other competitive game, or they try hard to find some real PvP combat in World of Warcraft, but they are the rarest portion of people that goes on PvP realm.
---
Hope it helped.
---
I was hoping that some of my old buddies might pop back on for classic, a few came back for BfA but left after two months or so. Literally none of them came back for classic, I talked to one about coming back and he was debating it but wanted the full original gang back, me him and two other guys all started together and played together up to WotLK. I lost contact with majority of the other guys I used to play with. 
---
Luckily I was fortunate enough to be in a guild with some cool people that was super comfy and nice to be apart of. But sadly over the last 3 weeks most of the people I got to know or liked have left the guild for varying reasons, no guild drama but people hitting max lvl or close we’re leaving to join other guilds. And now the guild is sadly gotten quieter and mostly filled with new faces of new recruits leveling. I hate to say it but a lot of them are complete noobs too. I don’t mind helping new players but it’s gotten tiresome helping someone out and eventually they bounce. All the old officers have mostly left and our GM has been busy with life/school and barely comes on. So now our guild is being run by lvl 30-40’s taking forever to level. I don’t see it really going anywhere soon if ever. Highly tempted to join another guild.
---
This is nothing. Wait for phase 2 when you get rewarded in HK to do it and there is no BG yet.
---
Charge, shout, hamstring. Try to fake out blinks and frost nova - the latter is easier, just to a quick backtrack right when you get within their nova range. Try to force our their defenses before they can hit you with a frostbolt.
---
"The evil of others justify my evilness" wow very original feelings you have there
---
didn't read any of this but is objectively false lmaoo alliance zones have far more detail and care put into them and are a lot more interesting.
---
I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that MGT invalidated all of that previous content. It was a process that started long before MGT was introduced, you didn't just walk into a single 5 man dungeon and get a full set of gear.
---
There were countless of nerfs to T4 and T5 bosses that made the content easier for the more casual guilds as time went by, I believe they even removed some of the attunements that were required to enter later on. Many of the bosses got nerfs to mechanics or health pools and damage done etc.
---
Then you had the introduction of ZA which dropped gear equal to T5 level raids. This was after Black Temple and Mount Hyjal had come out, so you had the top guilds already wearing T6 and they didn't care for most of the loot in there.
---
ZA was mostly a late "Karazhan" so the more casual guilds could finish the harder bosses they had left in T5 and start getting into T6 raids with all the gear available from there.
---
Then at the same time as ZA came out they also introduced new badge rewards, and combined with the 10 man raid that was a lot of new gear more casual players got into their hands without having to do a single 25 man raid.
---
Then when Sunwell came out they added even more badge gear that was equal to items you could get from T6 raids like Black Temple.
---
All of this was before MGT was even added into the game, and as a new player you still had to run all of the other heroics apart from MGT to get enough badges for all of that juicy gear you had available from just doing 5 or 10 mans.
---
Margol exists. No key needed, just walk in through badlands.
---
you can try watching videos on dire maul  east lasher farm, but  I hear it's not popular because it's less gold/hour than folks remembered.
---
A tip I'd give is to macro pickpocket to openers. Will help with lockpicking and gives essential rogue items like blind powder. Healing pots are a common pickpocket too.
---
A concise summary of exactly what OP said, nice.
---
Yeah... who isn't.
---
A Classic experience without add-ons is not a complete experience.
---
lmao do not do this, combat is the most scrub shitty spec imaginable i can't believe people fall for the combat swords meme
---
Idk why people come and ask things like this here when there is over a decade of information about it with a basic google search. Here you go:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1728/teebus-blazing-longsword#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1728/teebus-blazing-longsword#comments) 
---
long story short it's a very rare item and is good on hemo rogues. but there is better. most of it's desirability is it's cosmetic look, which is pretty dumb. If cosmetics are your thing retail wow is a thing, I personally prefer functionality. This sword also appeared on the original WoW box art. 
---
So not sure why it's relevant, your server may not have had one drop yet, and when it does just based on rarity it won't be selling for cheap. Keep 5-10k gold on hand for one when does show up if it's that important, but it's world drop rate is almost non existent and it can also be seen from a couple other sources with an equally non existent drop rate
---
spec into ambush, use daggers. find mob, ambush for 70% of its health, hemo hem evicerate. I literally take like ~10% of my hp damage fighting a mob cuz i have a 25% base dodge, and I use ghostly strike every fight if I can so that makes it like 40%, with evasion I'm untouchable.
---
&gt;open with ghostly strike
---
lmfao what the fuck
---
Horde also get RFD, RFK and on the other continent SFK and even the best mid level dungeon with 3 wings in the game in SM.
---
Alliance equivelent is what, Gnomer? Which Horde get a straight up teleport right into....
---
The names tho. Bless rppvp servers.
---
How long until the brigade of people that inevitably complain about phone pics/it not being a screen shot come in and start throwing a fit instead of contributing to the discussion/post??
---
That the way, did you report it? 
---
I feel like there’s a “no changes” joke around here somewhere but I am far too sleepy to think of it.
---
&gt;as you have to run through the wilderness and lvl 25 mobs to avoid the Alliance town in the middle of it.
---
? You can basically roll up outside the gate of Astranaar and skirt around with no aggro mobs, then pick the road up again. What path are you taking exactly? And then once you have the FPs it's a much better experience than Alliance who has to run from every end to the other over and over because they can't fly anywhere they need to be.

I was just going off of wowheads “content phase” which says [Sulfuras is in phase 2](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17182/sulfuras-hand-of-ragnaros). Maybe the data is wrong (or more likely I am misunderstanding it).
---
Lol or I can avoid suffering as a spec I cannot stand. I'll pass. My rogue is my main. I'll raid on him and get my mage into 2ndary groups from guild so he can get geared until the better phases.
---
I remember seeing that icon in the WC3 map editor...
---
" the phasing is all over the place. its 1.12 base, but there's a lot content that is either 1.0 state or just no info on when it'll appear. "
---
yeah it's really sloppily done - just incredibly inconsistent and confusing
---
&gt;And BRD obviously being alliance favored.
---
It's not though by comparison. Horde has a FP IN THE ZONE with mounts. SM is a very important leveling spot, and any Alli that level are running in from two zones away without a mount. Or do a death march through Western Plaguelands.

I wish I could find some of these around town, smash em and plant an alliance flag in their disgraced ruins.
---
Set mine to Ratchet when I first passed through and haven't changed it since. I'd even argue that its better than Grom (for Horde at least). Good location geographically speaking as its pretty much the center of Kalimdor, has a bank, boat to Eastern Kingdoms, not too long of a FP to Org/TB. The general aesthetic of the area too is was sells it for me; a bustling goblin port that literally leads to the crossroads of Kalimdor!! Also a good place to kill alliance as well ;)
---
Says the rogue
---
as long as no one else did it, yes
---
Druids are **fine**, actually good. Wish I hadn't let the dumb recycled thoughts before launch talk me out of maining it. After leveling a warrior the druid is so much gd easier for everything, and you can literally do anything in the 5 mans while you level. At 60 you can HotW and tank or heal 5-mans or PvP without respecing, as my friend has. It's a great healer in wPvP and good in raids too, and we all know how they flag carry etc in BGs. Don't believe any BS about how they suck from people focused on min-max raid crap. Raids are giving away druid loot like party favors and every raid PuGing on my server is looking for heals and ranged DPS.
---
My experience is that loot council can work but you have to be absolutely transparent and explain loot choices to the point that you might as well just do dkp. DKP has it's own downfalls but it is easy for everyone to understand why so and so got the item that they did. 
---
If the leadership is not willing to discuss things with you (loot or otherwise) then it's time to find a new guild. The good news is now is a great time to be looking. Many guilds are just starting MC and are looking for more raiders. I'd find a guild with leadership that you can trust will talk to you and actually wants you to be there.
---
Really cool to have this history captured over time.  I've been greatly enjoying classic wow and a lot of old friends are still on it.  But my best wow partner has been gone from this world for a number of years now.  The relaunch of classic wow just ripped that hole open all over again as every experience is extremely bittersweet.
---
free 40 mount, severely discounted 60 mount (compared to other classes)   
---
I think 400g sounds about right for 60
---
Me when I corpse camp a rogue/druid duo with my lvl 60 after they gank my alt while I’m killing basilisks for my crystals.
---
How it is still possible that people check some totally wonky droprates from a website for a random world drop and start to grind the mentioned mobs like crazy?
---
It is a random world drop, random!
---
Yes, I do use Google since quite a lot of time now, as well as wowhead and I already read all the comments on the link above.
---
Yet, Classic WoW and Vanilla WoW is different game. Silithus mobs in phase 1 have different loot table that Silithus mobs in phase 5.
---
Wisdom and flash of light + pots.
---
Definitely not the strongest healers. Priests and Druids can put out more raw healing than a Paladin. It's just that Paladins have small, fast heals, which leads to little overheal, which leads to them looking good on healing meters. Always needed in large amounts for their blessings as well.
---
As for leveling a Paladin: Agreed on the lack of buttons. They're pretty strong in world PvP while leveling, which is a nice plus if you're on a PvP server. Their damage and ability to score kills tapers off as you get closer to max level though.
---
Always buff mages, we’ll fix your Int problem in return.
---
Yup! i just hate having to level pets. I got BT earlier today so imma have to level him to 60. I mentioned wind serpent cause i cant think of another pet off the top of my head that doesnt have a level 55+ version. Im sure there are better examples lol.
---
It sounds like you can understand it, you likely just don't agree with it.
---
I'm no ganker, but i can see plenty of fun to be had in it.
---
Also, it you may not have been aware of the 12 piece bonus that was mentioned by the earlier gamer's remark - i never knew that either, and its full perks have't been listed yet.
---
you are delusional if you think you can somehow farm / grind for this sword .
---
If you really want it, farm  many thousands of gold in whatever is the most efficient way for your class and pray that somebody on your server will loot it in the next 6 months
---
For the dungeons, I haven't heard any solo farms yet but that doesn't mean they don't exist.   
---
As for devilsaur, you can easily kill them even when not in good gear.  Just use good openers, healing and switch to bear if you take too much damage.
---
Theramore is the best HS spot for mages. For other classes, I'd say Menethil of course :)
---
It's perfectly fine for MC. It's best if there's another druid for improved MOTW, but not necessary.
---
Its like the Matrix: Reloaded, when Neo runs down the hallway, opens the door and ends up in the mountains.
---
Yeah Barrens is the best leveling zone of all time lmfao get outta here with that ally coping
---
How is SW so empty? I'm not on a super high pop server, but even at 2am it's like an ant next right there.
---
very good , now connect the dots and accept the conclusion
---
They 'increased it' to it's original cap instead of scaling it like they did the content. At the start of vanilla 8 was the cap, but by 1.12 the cap had increased to 16.
---
That’s really odd, Arugal and Remulos were the original two pre-release realms.
---
Within the first hour on launch day they released Yojamba and then Felstriker was  released later that same day.
---
&gt; naxx catchup gear available for mc progression
---
like what? dont doubt you im just curious what specific gear this is
---
I’m out farming rep and Essence of Air with that snek and it’s a true grind with him level 53. Can’t imagine trying it with BT - respect haha.
---
In boss fights thats pretty much all you do is spam frostbolt.. especially in raids. When fighting trash you use a lot more AoE.
---
With questions that have a definitive answer you're better off going to Google in the future. You may get trolled on reddit and you have to wait for someone else to answer. Google is instant and can provide websites that will assist you with additional World of Warcraft related questions. 
---
So you've got multiple options. The easiest one is the anti-venom from first aid. Every class should level first aid and it is learned at 80 first aid skill. 
---
Jungle remedy has been mentioned. More information by /u/SemiAutomattik [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ted9k/useful_item_jungle_remedy/).
---
Heart of Noxxion is a Trinket from Mara that can remove poison.  
---
Restorative potion would work too.
---
They aren't except on specific fights like Shazzrah and maybe sometimes onyxia.
---
This is what did it for me. Its missing a lot of spawn points, but still got me there
---
Nice tip about the Shadowburn! Never thought about that, ty
---
You can reassure him that his single target rotation in dungeons and raids is just frostbolt (fireball from t2.5 onwards), so he can spend tons of time watching any streaming service they prefer.
---
Not unique to mages though, pretty much all dps rotations are extremely simple in classic.
---
Well if I had 6 month to gather the gold, I'd rather grind mobs that can actually drop it, even if I do a little less gold/hour.
---
Love reading these posts always so good when the community is like this horde or alliance side :)
---
Wisdom doesn't even come close to the natural mana regen a Druid would have. And potions go both ways.
---
Gehennas by far
---
What about HOTW druids? Its a healing spec that can tank
---
Literally the only instance in classic right now in which someone is going to have 1m+ overall damage is MC, and there is no way in *hell* that the top 3 overall dps in fucking MC are hunters. Literally just mathematically not feasible, period. There would be warriors, rogues, and mages well before 3 hunters of all things. This screenshot was not taken in classic.
---
You can do it quite early, especially if you are not the MT. I played furyprot until yesterday (and tanked MC and ONY with it), you can go fury/prot if you have a good grasp of the games mechanics and know when to equip a shield, and if your guild lets you. 
---
Furyprot VS Deep Prot Missing:
---
5% Parry
---
4% Extra armor
---
8 Def
---
If your guild feels it can handle your heals go fury prot, its great since you can enter dungeons as a dd
---
It's coming!

I wish I were as confident. On the balance of probabilities I think it may be reasonable to assume they will manipulate their market to produce, in their favour, regardless. (Source (Blizzard and most other companies with high success and varying reputability). 
---
Do you really think Blizzard previously fucked up? I can't help but assume they squeeze and plan meticulously.

Not only is it filled with a fuckton of quests, you get the best fishing rod in the game there and it's horde only. It's lame.

Is there a link to the all the brilliant peices you have done so far?

take the neck. its pretty good as tank too and mostly longer viable. the trinket is changed in bwl, the neck isnt. :)

Your lack of details and complete smugness have convinced me.

I visited the place on my lvl 45 warrior and saw all this hostile dialogue. I decided to kill their night elf as a "fuck you too!" and left with 2995/3000 unfriendly status, never looked back
---
I enjoy learning new fights. Figuring out what went wrong. Discussing strategies with my team to figure out how to do it better next time. That is tons of fun. It takes 4 hours when that doesn't happen, and people keep running in doing the same thing because no one can speak up and say hey guys instead of doing the exact same thing we did last time maybe we should try another idea.
---
Cool idea. Something to keep the tram useful
---
Don't listen to this guy, there must be something else you aren't very good at?

Jokes aside, the going rate for a 2 day cooldown is 5g +/- 2g, depending on time of day, day if week, your server and faction. 
---
Best to look at the price difference on ah between mats and finished product and make your cd price a couple of gold less than that
---
Because its fun and it makes it worth it when you post how salty you are about it.
---
If that is from classic its really wierd that no one noticed it till now. Including myself. This is probably a bait.

🌊🌊🏊‍♂️🌊🌊 this is me in your tears
---
This is so wrong its hilarious
---
Ogri'la and netherwing areas are exclusively accessed via flying. Same with the skyguard area. 
---
&gt;Everything else was perfectly accessible with a regular mount.
---
Not really my point, was more that certain areas just feel like a complete pain in the ass without it. Akin to the devs just saying "eh, fuck it, they'll be flying anyways." Not in the literally required  sense mind you. There were tons of areas in blades edge/netherstorm/shadowmoon that felt that way. 
---
That feeling has kind of just increased more and more as retail progressed. I have no problems with most vanilla zones because they were very clearly designed to be traveled on foot. Zones from tbc onwards just got messier and messier in that regard, which wasn't really a big deal until they started adding pathfinder grinds in my opinion.
---
i think his point is, since you already had krol, unless you had to farm UBRS for a different piece of pre-raid bis gear than the dal'rend blades, your time would have been better spent outside of UBRS, farming other pre-raid bis items, or farming gold, farming mats for consumes, etc etc.
---
IE "I already have krol, ill get mirrahs, I already did UBRS for my ony attune, no point in going back to farm for the rend blades, but i do sitll need my pre-raid BiS second ring and belt, ill go do those dungeons instead of farming UBRS for dal'rends minimum DPS increase"
---
I heared the neck is a lot better and you wear it longer. The hit and crit is really nice both for tanking and your DPS set/solo farm.
---

good rp set. warriors and rogues hella buttmad. much love from a warlock.
---
Can a gnome ride a tiger? There is a repeatable quest in feralas where you return a pristine hide for darnassus rep. https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7735/pristine-yeti-hide you could grind yetis (for horde there is TB rep)
---
&gt;reserving the swords.
---
damn how did you get any melee dps?
---
Druids can farm Mara, princess and Tinker boss. I hit 60 2 days ago and have been farming both, tons of guides on it. Once you get the princess fight down it’s easy, just time consuming. The tinker boss can be a little troublesome though. Decent 30ish+ gold an hour with mining or herbing.
---
dagger rogue real 42069iq spec for first few phases. get all the dank loot. perds + core hound tooth after raiding for 2 weeks gg no re.
---
They wait til TBC, where this screenshot is from.
---
cause hillsbrad having alliance friendly npcs makes this a horde zone lol.  
---
hillsbrad has very few quest for alliance cause most of the alliance quests are alterac.
---
you go to hillsbrad at 20 for horde and at arround 30 for alliance.  
---
pair that with friendly alliance mobs and you get yourself a horde gauntlet.

hillsbard is pure cancer for horde.

That’s my spec and what he’s saying is roll for the role you’re playing currently. I wouldn’t ever roll on healer items while tanking without asking first.
---
I believe so if they are bop
---
atm our dagger rogues are beating swords, most have perds and/or corehound (i think)
---
You seem to skip the zones that are somewhat alliance favored for some reason.
---
Blasted Lands: Has an Alliance hub and flightpoint nothing for the horde.
---
Eastern Plaguelands: Has an Alliance hub and flightpoint , the horde has no flightpoint but have to go from Undercity.
---
It’s both really, the leveling, the gearing, leveling your professions, choosing a spec and playing your class and then doing the endgame dungeons and raids to get BiS gear. The game is endless.
---
Yeah and Duskwood, both zones with a nearby Horde FP to grief lowbies.
---
u/kirmm3la probably thinks warriors also shouldnt roll on leather
---
It isnt though
---
If you are the healer in the current run you roll for healing gear. If you tank you roll for tank gear.
---
But you can allways ask can I need for tanking/healing when somwthing drops that you would like to need, and if everyone agrees than you need and its all good.
---
The main point regarding loot drops is to understand that 10% drop chance doesn't mean that it is going to drop at least once in 10 runs
---
Nice :). I often have a lvl  1 of the other faction on the servers I play on to thank people.
---
No. I refuse to picture you. I don’t even know what you look like and I don’t want to.
---
Im in a WPvP based guild, so it's in the guild leaders interest to gear appropriate people, he only cares about the guild. Gearing his guild is like gearing his character. The guild is what he wants to make strong over his character.
---
As for PvE guilds, its kind of a bet whether corruption will exist or not
---
it depends. single player horde is easier. the racials and shaman stuff has a larger impact for one/two player/s alone.  
---
alliance dominates in structured PvP and PvE.

Is pally really faster than rogue/warr at 40+? Assuming all have decent blue weps

Is that where P4L is at? I remember pvping against them in vanilla.

Jesus Chirst what an arrogant fuck.
---
As an Alliance Mage, Gadgetzan. Southern Kalimdor is the only place not within reasonable flight range of a capital city, plus it has a bank.
---
So you are saying you lost a roll? We’ve all been there.
---
Is shadow blade good at lvl 60 for dagger combat? For pvp/raiding/duengons?
---
It's his horns
---
Blaumeux is a PvP server and you can only have characters of one faction on PvP servers. It's mean to strengthen your hatred for the opposing faction and love of your own.
---
TellMeWhen/weakauras, makes it much easier to play more optimally.

---
But the Feathermoon boat has to be the slowest in the game.

Good thing it’s just an ony head and they drop every time
---
I hope most are gone by the time I get to play again
---
A very valid option.
---
Youre welcome
---
Devilsaur is pretty mandatory for some classes though and not that expensive
---
Just one week?
---
I'm in the same boat but still leveling. Getting very tired of logging on and getting ganked 4 to 5 times in the span of 30 minutes and that's if they aren't focusing me. Cant get anything accomplished and groups camping mob spawns, plus the collusion you talk about I have experienced in some dungeons. At least on retail I can get on and accomplish SOMETHING every time I get on. Here, I struggle to complete 3 quests in the span of an hour or more.
---
lol - so it's only counterplay if you get the initiative? 
---
So would you can anyone that uses stealth to attack others? Would you ban someone that uses MC or Distract? Would you ban Warriors using Overpower?
---
He shouldn't have been allowed to make that roll. What is the point of MS&gt;OS?
---
Also soul shards, Heath stones, drain soul for shards, along with the curses and banishing you mentioned. Warlocks are a lot more complex than just shadowbolting
---
Thats me
---
Gratz on Lok and Rhok.
---
I disagree about endurance, Riposte is extremely good for lvling, hits hard and procs often, costs only 10 energy and is off the gcd. Also while you have more mobs on you it procs even more often making it amazing with blade flurry.
---
Noob
---
Well, combat isn't a pvp spec, didn't mean it isn't very good in pve.
---
witchblade from scholo and aquamentas orb from Linkens quest
---
Na just wolf and kodo
---
Yeah, my guild ALWAYS takes me for raids as enh shammy. I played elemental but switched to enh at 55. I am now 3 BiS away from full pre raid and I absolutely hold my own in dungeons, raids, and pvp.
---
join a guild
---
And 30 people roll on it.
---
This makes me so sad for the friends I’ve made and lost. At least Azeroth is there for me.
---
its still worse in pve. ambush spec and gouge backstab is way better damage, i out dps every combat rogue in pve
---
theres something funny about the powerful warlock kemrah the immortal and his partner Carlos
---
Neck is bis forever. The trinket is hot garbage.
---
People arent that shit anymore. Any bracket1 premade will require proper comms
---
*validates your feelings*
---
still in denial, I see :D 
---
i don't think there are any mobs you can solo, they need to be lvl 60+ elites. right now it should only drop inside instances
---
the silithus thing is from when the opening of the gates event takes place.  the boss mobs that spawn then had a chance of dropping various boe epics
---
Only purple haired gnomes
---
- “Horde has a vastly superior questing experience over Alliance”
---
“Oh you just left pre-barrens, now you get to sit in the Barrens for 15 levels until you can go to other barrens and other-other barrens”. 
---
I get what you’re saying, and it makes sense on paper, but after doing both horde and ally 1-60 my opinion is that alliance is vastly superior. Nothing beats Elwynn-Westfall-Redridge-Duskwood. Each different zone has its own flair, while Horde zones just feel like desert after desert. Sucks about SM though
---
You clearly never leveled a warrior.
---
I'll live but I thought I had beaten the odds finally.
---
Looks like default nameplates to me.
---
Problem with healing performance is that there is no really good way to tell it. With DPS it's easy just to check that you do a lot of damage, you do it on right targets (i.e adds) and you don't take damage from things that can be avoided. 
---
But with healers these kind of strict rules do not exists. Healing meters are just some kind of image how you are doing. But manipulating healing meters is easy. Just snipe all heals from other healers. You get great numbers but just screw your raid.
---
Yeah horde do this all the time and it’s very sad.
---
No no that’s workcraft.
---
It really comes down to if u want to play on a mega populated server or a smaller one , I always advise on rolling on the biggest server bc there’s always something going on and don’t have to worry about population issues down the line
---
I'm a Tauren bud
---
*Moooo*
---
See?
---
How much are they contributing though. Had two undergeard pugs today. They died on like every pull. One was level 58 and had totally shit gear. Sure. We "cleared". But its not like that player was contributing anything at all. Would have been just as easy to drop the shitters and clear with 36. One of the pugs also then needed repairs due to dying so much, and revived at spirit to repair and wasted everyones time
---
And when you inevitably pull more than one? Hemo with a dagger doesn't sound like it hurts that much
---
Just a joke about EU Saurfang being weaker than NA.
---
Sounds like you neef to play on a pve server. And you cant collude like that in dungeons, if you win an item its bound to you, cant trade it.
---
How is that abusing game abusing game mechanics? Like an actual reason
---
You can grind for years and never get it.
---
Never take imp sprint over riposte if your goal is to level fast.
---
Well healing isnt a competition in a raid. If you can off heal that is an option you would be a shit dps speced holy but its better than watching a pally do all the work. You have renew and shields though so you can play around with global cooldowns going to dots rather than healing or the pally can dps and let you get a chance. It really is up to you two figuring out what works best. If you both decide one healer is all you need for a pull its between you to make a plan and then just make sure the raid knows what the plan is.
---
That's clever
---
Anything between 1 run and an infinite amount of runs for any drop chance greater than 0% and less than 100%
---
They poured all their energy into Westfall/Redridge/Darkshore and just said 'fuck the rest of the Alliance zones lawl, but especially the Nelves lawl'.
---
Warrior dont have to buy gear. You can get all your pre raid from dungeons
---
Can't call it til the sword rogues have viskag and brut tbf. But swords should pretty much always be slightly ahead.
---
Honestly the amount of threat shadow priests generate in my groups sometimes makes me wonder if they'd be good tanks
---
Spamming emotes at a dead body is part of game design...? Hm...
---
&gt; So would you can anyone that uses stealth to attack others? Would you ban someone that uses MC or Distract? Would you ban Warriors using Overpower?
---
none of those kill people. all of those are also countered by just pvping the other person
---
Uh it's one of the best debuffs and is used widely in good guilds for a reason. By just applying that debuff all your phy dps including tanks are doing dmg with 600 less armor on their target. By just doing that you are in effect doing more dmg than anyone else.
---
I'll look in to this thank you
---
Do this without layers!!

Its based on % of your health.  Not a set number that would relate to bonus healing.

Just so you know, it isn't a direct teleport, it's a teleport from a specific NPC at Booty Bay.

TB is way better. It's super compact and you have the mail, bank, inn, AH, forge, and repair right next to each other.
---
It’s cool I’m having fun
---
People skipped travelling through the world because it was annoying and boring. You have still failed to explain how people skipping parts of the world they have no interest in is ruining the game.
---
Not everyone wants to play exactly like you do. If you cant wrap your head around this simple little concept, i can't help you.
---
This. So far we just one shot every single boss and clear MC in couple of hours. So is there really need to feed loot to players so they can do better damage. It makes more happy people when every one gets some loot every now and then.
---
I have never raided in Vanilla. But I remember how people said raids are gonna be tough and you need to farm resist gear and work super hard. I would've understand loot prioritize if that would've been the case. But as Ragnaros dies before P2, I can't say this is hard. I am yet to see how BWL, AQ and Naxx are going to be but so far my experience has been that people have overestimated how hard raids are in Classic. And that is the reason why I personally think that guilds should not prioritize loot (except tanks and items like Sulfuras).
---
Just out of curiosity.  What class are you?
---
Hell yeah! About to start the SM journey with the same goal. Gratz to you!
---
Paladins are off healers at 60. Not strongest.

Dont embarras hordeside with a potato picture, alliance is doing that..  horde have printscreen.
---
Downvoted on 500 accounts.
---
Fucked me up, abandoned the quest sweet amber while having the 3 quest items in me inventory because I needed space in my log. Felt really stupid when I realized it deleted the quest items...
---
Just like you can kill the guards and then pvp the other faction that was just standing there. Counterplay and emergent gameplay!
---
What addons are you using?
---
Me right now... the real adult realization there.
---
That is what killed PoE for me. It just isn't a social game. My friends and I grinded hours and hours for gear. Talked to eachother all the time about gear and builds. Yet, we rarely ever mapped together or got to see eachothers builds. In WoW we can party, quest, dung, and raid together. So much more fun to be helping eachother and doing PvP and rolling against eachother and shit.
---
Warrior. And this priest stated in the chat he only rolled to give it away.
---
I'm curious as an AP Frost mage in MC/Ony; if you have TOEP - would you pair it with reed (29 SP static) or Eye of the beast (2% crit static)
---
unless you are some hardcore theorycrafter, you won't notice any difference in 99% of the gameplay
---
It's not sometimes, here's a 100% repro:
---
Be flying from A to B. Launch a second instance of WoW and login to the game world. Voila.
---
Maybe. But,
---
&gt;Alliance exclusive like Duskwood or Wetlands, so aren't really worth mentioning.
---
??? Why do these not count if ashenvale counts?
---
Plus blasted lands clearly is better for alliance.
---
And you first said you finished leveling but also say you only finished up to hinterlands on alliance?
---
To be fair, that wasn't vanilla.
---
I mean alot of people complain because of the phases but i still like it and am enjoying wow for the first time in a long time
---
Hunters are best at holding their own in pve, do pretty great in dungeons and are strong pvpers.
---
Its ruined many social lives. F.
---
How are hunters ? Have a 35 warrior with whirlwind axe but still get fucked in wpvp, wanted something that can hold itself and really like the class fantasy of a hunter. The main thing that’s stopping me right now is being able to find groups for dungeons n raids, and also how their viability starts to decline after patches
---
Mages just use the same ability over and over in raids.
---
Join a different guild. Sounds very similar to the guild I leveled in, then hopped when I was level 60. Some guilds are just destined to go nowhere with lack of leadership and organization. Having noobs doesn't help either
---
Look for a pre-bis druid tank with Crowd-Pummeler
---
Bashguuder doesn't stack with faerie fire.
---
It's good when you don't have a druid though.
---
Annihilator does stack, it's a very good weapon to have.
---
Still, mirah has better individual performance. Normally you want an offtank with these utility weapons and a maintank with the most stats.
---
The only difference with classic apart from the obvious stuff, like the content release schedule, is the player mentality. Min/Maxers are out in full force and it is changing the meta of the game. Game play wise, it all feels like I remember. Blizz did a really good job with making it as true to vanilla as possible.
---
There are lots of instances where 2 mobs are close together. Get into the habit of sapping one.
---
If you have herbing, you can do easy lasher farming in DM:E and venture to pull satyrs if youre geared enough. Even without satyrs but with herbs and book drops it should be 35gph. You can also sneak into the library in DM:N to repair and sell greys then back to DM:E.
---
Alternatively if you are good at aoe farming, ZF graves are really good for raw gold, you can get up to 50gph with the right pace.
---
If youre on a pve server and just want to farm mobs, you can farm felwood satyrs for felcloth but that should be based on felcloth prices for your server (on mine they are crashing due to the large influx from DM:E satyr farming).
---
H Shattered Halls and H Shadow Labs at BC Launch was insane.
---
Perfect opportunity to call them out on their bullshit.
---
"So this lvl 58 dude got plenty of gear this run, besides being your IRL friend he brought nothing to the table. What gives? Is LC just so you can deck out your IRL- circle?"
---
Post that in /G and let the hate brew inside everyone in your position. Watch the guild implode.
---
No wall jumping. This makes me sad.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah warrior pulls pack to pack pretty good. But with mage you can do it faster with big pulls. I've tried both (not in SM yet, mind you) and mage for me is almost twice as fast clearing low lvl dungeon. (one thing to mentions is that with amge i didn't need to have my alts follow, as i brought big pulls near entrance - WC - pulling each side and centre. With warrior i usually have to demo shout a few times during pull to get aggro on multiple boss.)
---
Warrior is good, especially with 30s Sweeping strikes, although i had bad luck with ravager procs, so i stopped trying with big pulls on warrior.
---
yeah but I mean per example lets say I've been healing for 34 points since I put 1 point in it, then I placed 2 points, still 34, 3 points, still 34 healing when the talent procs, is thsi intended?
---
sure thing
---
It's a principle. EU demanded language-specific servers for very solid reasons, and now there's still few peeps who don't respect that. If you like being the outsider on a server, fine, but OP has no justification whatsoever to say he's the one being mistreated (and I'm very positive he didn't post this here to say that the person whispering him was right...).
---
hamstring kiting is pointless though because of leeway, you just face tank mobs and keep hamstring up if they run. Can be useful for elite mobs to create distance to bandage, but jousting is too much of a pain in the ass now for normal mobs
---
lol, that orc still using T1 gloves , must be 2006 indeed
---
we'll see ahaha
---
I've also said I'm sure horde do the shit too. I just think it's hilarious when people do shit like this. That's why the flair is "Humor". Or do you not understand what that word means? I've been in absolutely no way complaining. I think it's funny, and everyone here is getting overly defensive. Which is equally funny. I am in no way upset about any of this.
---
/sigh
---
Why?   
---
For a guild like APES which will contest world bosses, has to fight through 120 people every now and then etc. loot council makes sense. 
---
For the average guild it does not make sense, because PvE content is easy enough, therefore you don't need to deck out specific characters apart from tanks. If you aren't farming gear for outside the raid, then loot council has more drawbacks than advantages.
---
This is what Org looks like, I know its late but there is just one lvl 10 standing there all alone. This is one, if not the only, Alliance dominated PVP server and they lust for Horde blood. When/If the server opens for transfers again, stop being comfortable in your 90% Horde PVP servers and join the fight here.
---
Bis is a real chad, FOREVER CONSTANTINOPLE.
---
Ah you are just being a farmer for them. 
---
"Guild bank" good one.
---
Welcome to live.
---
You help the enemy and you get bit.
---
Maybe the dynamic boss level is a thing since TBC and it wasn't in vanilla yet, I'm not sure. But since TBC it's definitely true. 
---
I'd guess the downvotes are because I was being nitpicky or because they didn't know either and just assumed I was wrong. But it's okay.
---
Is that still viable? Thought that was fixed somehow?
---
&gt; you can kill the guards
---
sure, rip game time and reputation
---
which is the same as taking money out of someone's in-game wallet. ie: not counterplay even by stretching the definition
---
His keybinds is so terrible that i get the classic vibes anyway lol
---
First link in search; https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Priest_racial_abilities
---
Dwarf is considered the best race for both PvE and PvP, largely due to this racial.
---
That’s sad. Around 6 years ago, we couldn’t play competitive HoN(Heroes of Newerth) because we’re 6. Now sometimes we’re 3 if we’re lucky that day. Mostly alone.
---
Don't worry, even though we have a transport to gnomer most people skip it anyways.
---
Rogues aren't smart enough to figure out that they're black dragons.
---
Why don't they use warriors? Because rogues are useful.

He won the roll he can do whatever he wants. Roll better next time or get some friends into the ID as well so they can roll for you too.
---
I wish my dad played games, that would be hella cool, maybe when they get old enough they'll start getting interested in games?
---
Feather moon or Lights Hope Chapel (not in yet) with engineering for the gadgetzan portal.
---
A lit of those quests on alliance side are lengthy chains no one completes. I did some of them cause I wanted darnassus rep for the cat. It was rubbish and worse xp than grinding by longshot.
---
my friend had their lieutenant's insignia from RFC in their bags at 60. we got a good chuckle from that one.
---
Looks like they are both default. Unit frames just have the black border enabled
---
They probably want to gear the players that they think has the highest probability of not leaving the guild either for another guild or to stop playing entirely. 
---
Who are those? Their group of friends who they actually talk to and have insight in their lives and opinions rather than "unknown player x" who might quit without any notice.
---
So they gear up the "core" of the guild and leave the new/peripheral to sit and wait.
---
I think that's one of the probably number of reasons they do it this way.
---
Did you try it yourself? Cause when I did, if it binds e.g. F to bar 5, whatever I do with bartender profiles, F stays bind to bar 5.
---
Wow, I never even thought of this.
---
Loch modarn, westfall and duskwood. Alliance t2 zones.
---
North barrens, silverpine. Horde t2
---
Redridge is t2.5, like southern barrens
---
You'll be kicked out of raids spacing sub daggers lol
---
Thank you for your answer!
---
Ive just deleted my herbing for enchanting, so thats not an option. But its been leaning towards ZF farm, but will have to DE all the greens for mats to level up my enchanting aswell.
---
I think the felcloth is around 2g on my server, dont know if thats much or not
---
Who would want to win a fight that takes that long? Also I would probably just bubble hearth away.
---
Better on a warrior than a rogue.
---
The issue with Joana's is that its built around playing a class that has a way to deal with stronger enemies. If you can heal or have kiting abilities its fine but if youre a warrior or rogue or something its not good.
---
Eh, I'll take the afk time of flying over having to blink swim. Also Gadget has bank/neutral AH and a lively leveling community, Feathermoon is dead af, no Alliance players level Kalimdor after Darkshore.
---
Don’t kid yourself lol I’ve raided vanilla on a hunter and fury as well and they’re much more varied and complex than mousewheel frostbolt. Rogue has a bit more to do as well.
---
Plus on hunter and fury you have a decent skillcap to reach with melee weaving/pet management and heroic strike queuing, respectively.
---
To OP: if you’re friend favors PvE I wouldn’t roll a mage. Mages are the most overplayed class at 60, so there’s a huge surplus, and the rotation from MC to naxx is scrolling a 
---
If he favors pvp, I would definitely stick with mage. They have one of the highest skillcaps and can make a huge impact. Suffer through the mind numbing PvE and be rewarded.
---
Omen&amp;Vengeance at ~35 until thrash blade. Gets you through the latter half of the levels. Makes a world of difference.
---
I'm pretty lazy to link the thread that had them. Basically, 1 button presses for most skills such as zerkers rage, overpower, taunt/sunder, hamstring, charge, intercept. Not all are used for tanking but also world pvp. Made a helluva difference for me. Didn't have to keep switching stances all the time.
---
I'm also using leatrix with no grids by default
---
I almost made the same mistake and almost started gaining reputation with gnomes, but luckily I looked up at wowhead and found out that night elves can’t ride mechanostriders. Had to take that trash cat instead.
---
Nah that's bullshit apologism for shitty behaviour. His friend basically had double the chance of anybody else to win. 
---
Can I just roll twice and call it fair too? It would be the same thing.
---
What's bizarre is that in the past I was a PvP freak who played on a RP server. I've wanted to play on a PvP server, but it is intimidating as I used to play a rogue. Now I'd like to level characters I'm totally unfamiliar with and learning a new character while getting ganked doesn't sound like much fun. To each their own.
---
Of course
---
I'm sure you're taking the piss, but anyway: there is more content coming
---
Cloaks-N-Things
---
Maybe I'm just more cynical. I'm aware of what you've brought up, but I can't help but think that Blizzard have always been aware of vanilla's goodwill and have marketed themselves out to sit exactly where they are now. They can produce gold, hold off and exploit more microtransactions and then pick up with regained vitality.
---
I'm curious like OP because history can repeat itself.
---
Yes and no, one thing that we do is people who perform better gets the loot that had low % drop rate. So everybody gets the drop. The better players gets the rare loot. That's something that the raid does not know only officers.
---
No lol it’s fine. Go on YouTube and watch a guide. It’s ridiculously profitable once you get good at it.
---
What level are you and what are your professions
---
This is rather bad, because you can't see the cooldown of the intercept in your action bar.
---
Looks very clean! Can't help you tho
---
I abandoned my warlock at 35 because fighting got so boring: Send pet to attack, dot, dot, dot, Drain Life, Drain Life, Drain Life, Drain Life. Every single fight.
---
And I've raided vanilla as priest, mage, rogue, warrior, as dps, healer and tank, and feel qualified to say the dps rotations in vanilla are not complex on anything. In comparison id say something like legion Surrender to Madness spriest was quite demanding mechanically.
---
Vanilla is just so slow and simple.
---
You can no longer water walk your friends and watch them plummet to their deaths as they enter the staff entrance of maraudon. So sad.
---
Man some peeps really just love to hate. I don't think your UI is that bad man. It feels pretty true to vanilla to me. 
---
Keep on doing you.
---
Yup im level 27 and ive been getting buffed non stop by strangera since lv 1 lol
---
It’s weird to think of Centaurs... *grazing*.
---
&gt; be me
---
&gt; be playing enhancement shaman

&gt; get invited to group for WF

&gt; get harassed by rogue for subpar DPS

&gt; stop dropping WF totem

&gt; equal DPS
---
&gt; silent rogue
---
As long as you have learned the skill. So you would need to tame one of the LBRS wolves that have bite 8, fight with it as your pet for 1-30ish minutes until you see yellow text in the chat saying "You have learned Bite rank 8". Then you can abandon the wolf and pull your main pet out of the stable and teach it bite 8.
---
Only thought is that with oeb its pushing more dodge off the table so chances of getting an over power proc are low
---
you need some fresh air man, it's okay lol.. this Reddit conversation will be forgotten and you'll still be an angry little fella behind his keyboard lmao
---
Level as combat sword, faster and easier.
---
For raiding yes, combat dagger is better but only if you play with full consumables and world buffs, I suggest you to start raiding with combat sword and then switch to combat dagger, the important thing is you get a devilsaur set and 6 pieces of shadowcraft armor in the other slots, this setup will carry you for a long time.
---
Have you tanked a raidboss yet? Daggers are garbage, this isn't a pserver. You have no problem dumping rage.
---
\*runs to the edge to watch it fall down\*
---
Also don't forget to take the book around the steamwheedle port in tanaris to learn the other spec.
---
blackout was only 40 mins for me
---
You gotta pay the troll toll to get in that boys hole
---
they fucked up the warlock infernal spell (it doesn't really turn aggro once it's released, it only attacks the lock and then despawns or insta despawns if the lock is to far away)
---
Your post has a clear alliance bias. You're counting horde's neutral zones, whilst ignoring alliance's neutral zones. Your post is also extremely inaccurate in its bias.
---
Arathi highlands: Alliance base as centrally as you can get. Alliance has a camp in the neutral quest zone that is Stormgarde Keep, which is a huge advantage on PvP servers. Alliance: 11 quests, Horde, 9 quests.
---
This applies to most zones you've listed. Straight up lie about who has the most quests, fail to mention all alliance camps, followed by "even though it's alliance favored by every metric possible, it still **FEELS** horde favored to me (because I got outplayed &amp; ganked by a horde player)"
---
Except for all the trash and bosses that are immune to nature damage
---
Itemization is definitely a factor as you mention.  
---
I remember when I started MC back in original I had +14 spell damage. This time I had +162.  
---
Still fun though!
---
1) It seems weird to me that you consider Duskwood or Wetlands "not worth mentioning" while beginning your post with descriptions of Stonetalon and Thousand Needles...
---
2) You "conveniently" missed the exceptions to your thesis. Eg. Blasted Lands is a high level zone, has absolutely 0 horde presence, yet a huge alliance keep. Also, Western Plaguelands has only alliance camp inside it - horde camp is "technically" on the border, but it doesn't have a FP. 
---
3) Amount of quests actually bends in ALLIANCE favour if you don't count the quests that weren't present at launch of Vanilla and were added in later patches (to somewhat negate the huuge advantage of Alliance in PvE experience) - quests in the costal village in Desolace, and quests in the coastal village in Hinterlands. Before that, Horde had absolutely 0 quests in Hinterlands, and only a few in Desolace. 
---
4) Factions are not supposed to be equal. The main perk of Alliance is their max level experience. Alliance has much better access than horde to virtually every max-level dungeon and raid in the game.
---
You can do it more efficiently than that though. You can keep your shield on while you pop sweeping strikes and then switch to 2 hander, zerker stance for the whirlwind so you don't have to stand there without a shield on waiting for the rage. 
---
Improved charge speeds it up too if you sacrifice a couple of points somewhere. 
---
Imp charge, 1 swing, pop sweeping strikes, switch to zerker stance, bloodrage, whirlwind, back to def stance and shield achieves all of this much quicker than 5 seconds.
---
I know, just don't get why they force people on russian servers to translate their client but don't do so for other languages.
---
Thats bullshit, if you roll for something that means you want it. Or it would be okay for you if people in pug can whisp on other like a warr can pay 5g for the mages to roll for him for a plate armor? Would you like to lose to someone who dont need the item just rolled it for his "friend"?
---
in what ways specifically?
---
What s the command to mark a target in a macro? I havent been able to find one
---
At level 50 I went into maraudon with the goal of getting that nice pre-raid BIS ring and a cool 2h hammer.
---
A day of /played later, I have FUCKING DEBTs with the repair man and not even a single blue. More than 7 runs.
---
Grazing doesn't make much sense, but they are much better suited for plains than mountains.

Here is Fury

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
Not an expert on warriors but i don't think your going to find a combination of the two you might simply either find a warrior on your server from a decent guild and ask him some questions. Or combine these two and do some trail and error.
---
Is this some sort of hack or what's behind it?
---
Trinket is like 3rd bis for all of vanilla for defensive stats. Most people aren't playing that meta tho.
---
Why remove something awesome like that?
---
Krol Blade on my first Stratholme Living run. Made 370g with it and instantly bought my epic mount. Never had that luck anywhere else in my life
---
Hey man, sad to see you go.
---
For anyone else in the same boat, I would recommend finding a small guild and helping it grow. It’s easy to drown in the social circle or 100+ guilds with established cliques, whereas in a smaller guild, every members presence is felt substantially more.
---
One side of WoWs progress is visible: boss kills, gear upgrades, character levels, but the other side isn’t quite so obvious: the social progress. Making friends and developing as a guild is not something you can measure with XP, but you sure as hell will notice and feel it personally.
---
Just my 2 cents, all the best!
---
This is why we came up with a hybrid system. DKP for all items except weapons and trinkets, which are LC.  That means people don't hoard points for the rare items, and actually spend them on upgrades.  LC stuff gets handed out to those with best attendance and performance, and we made a conscious decision to skip over the officers in favour of the most dedicated members.  I'm a mage officer and haven't gotten a weapon yet, the two mageblades we got went to a mage and warlock that we didn't know before classic. 
---
Same goes for my husband, he's and officer and a priest.  We've had 4 benedictions now and he still hasn't gotten one for himself. The only officer we gave any real loot prio to was the warrior who is MT.  But he's only equally as geared as our 1st OT tbh.
---
Loot is irrelevant atm, would much rather keep the good players in the guild and build them up for BWL and show them loyalty.  Everyone will be geared by the time the new phase comes out anyway, there's no rush to get loot first.
---
In total it's around 778 stacks of rune cloth to get exalted, which is around 800g
---
I am rolling a mage level 28! Yourself?
---
That's exactly why I &gt; triple &lt; checked, because there were conflicting information. 
---
But some people do seem to have the gold to piss away on an epic mount and hundreds in runecloth to not care, I guess.
---
The teleport won’t fail.... sometimes you get some „bonus effects“ :D
---
I don't know about quest items that once destroyed make a quest un-finishable, but there IS at least ONE item for which the thought process behind it was confusing. There's a quest in Silverpine that once you complete it, you get a consumable with a limited number of charges that you need to use whilst fighting a boss. The thing is the item is the *reward* of the quest, and if you destroy it, then when you go to fight the boss, he can hit you with a pretty serious debuff that you won't have the consumable for (because you destroyed it). Because he's an elite, I decided to delay fighting him, but now my character is 42 and there's no point in going back.
---
But I think I will, if at least to empty out a slot in my bank.
---
Why bother? World pvp is literally only just an annoyance most of the time, and a way to spend like an hour at other times. If youre serious about pvp, you will need to raid, and that means you need to get into raids which is nearly darn impossible on servers dominated by 1 faction.
---
Having no dwarf priests in your raid is kinda bad because then you have no fear ward in raid.
---
After that humans are the best because of their bonus to spirit.
---
Then NE have no real bonuses, but honestly its not a big deal.
---
Awesome! I’m currently only level 28!
---
&gt; i think his point is, since you already had krol, unless you had to farm UBRS for a different piece of pre-raid bis gear than the dal'rend blades, your time would have been better spent outside of UBRS, farming other pre-raid bis items, or farming gold, farming mats for consumes, etc etc.
---
I already had all the other pre bis pieces, Dal's were my last objective in fact (well, just the MH, since I got lucky and won OH in my first ubrs run), because as I said having Krol+Mirah was good enough. These replies assumed I farmed the swords while neglecting other important upgrades, but I never said that.
---
That's terrible. Those mechanic spiced up the AH.
---
Do you get exploration xp when in ghost form? As in dead and not ressed.
---
I thought it would be pretty obvious to anyone in a dungeon group that the role you join as is perceived as your MS. Otherwise you could go 17/17/17 and just roll on every gear piece that you can equip and claim it to be your MS - which is utterly idiotic.
---
I am surprised by how balanced it is tbh.
---
For the majority of people on this subred the right answer is always:
---
In Pugs you roll need on everything. People who want upgrades are egocentric. Everyone is allowed to roll need on everything all the time, except before forming the group something else was set. 
---
I don't share this pov and from my experience no one on my realm (luckily) does. It's just: Roll need when you can use it. Roll greed If Not. Wanna Roll need on sth you can't use e.g. for gold (what I am doing right now for my mount)? Just ask, you know like adults would do.
---
The majority of the player base just wants to have fun. I don't want to make it seem like everyone is ruining the game, but the mage meta is really popular atm because of the rate that you can clear dungeons with a group of 3 mages. As time progresses and people chill out, this'll change.
---
I have friends who are raiding as the worst possible build for DPS (ret paladin) and a low-tier dps feral and nobody is giving them too hard of a time other than teasing them.
---
Just like always, don't let sweaty min/maxers dictate how or if you play the game. Just have fun and ignore them.
---
The defence nerf is active too
---
feign trap was buggy as fuck in the original too though
---
I have no idea.  Maybe it tics more often rather than for a higher amount? 
---
I dont play warrior. Just stopped by to inform that it doesnr scale with bonus healing.
---
Getting the robes is way less expensive than it seems so you can do it quite fast after hitting 60.
---
I raid next on Sunday. I'll take a pic of a solo boss fight dmg/dps and an overall dmg/dps. How much dps do people think classic players do? My guild has several people that are 600-1000 dps.
---
there is a flightpoint when u just entered moonglade on your left.  its pretty close to the cave entrance in moonglade.
---
this flightpoint is horde (iirc) but not druid exclusive
---
Theres a trinket with nature res that also removes 1 poison
---
&gt;BGs are cross realm and H:A ratio is close enough to not have a large impact.
---
One interesting question is if they mix PvE and PvP servers for the BGs.
---
Lmfao
---
Holy fuck 18 agi??? Here I was getting psyched for a chestpiece from a badlands ELITE quest which had like 20
---
Cheapest way ... run there at L1 and do every possible quest that gives darnassus rep at the proper level. Doing the same quests at high level gives only a small portion of the reputation compared to doing it when the quest is still orange/yellow/green. Additionally there are quests that give faction rep (aka rep in all horde factions).
---
There are lists of what quest you should do, you can check if there are any quests you have missed. After that its just cloths, cant do anything about it.
---
Anti-venom from first aid. Stoneform from Dwarf racial.
---
But DM is a straight path?
---
If / when reserving you have to advertise it when looking for people. 
---
Otherwise you might be wasting 3-4 peoples' time if they need the same thing (not likely, given different specs but still) and could have joined other groups meanwhile. 
---
Do not hold off with telling stuff like this, it had to be upfront if you are going to do it.
---
Sapphiron Drape is so ugly. I've been running with a cloak until now but had to hide it after getting that.
---
Maybe it would look good on a mage or something.
---
It's really not that bad. Alliance still has the advantage in the early game just because how good Darkshore, DUskwood and Wetlands are. You can struggle around lvl 30-40 as you will have to travel a lot between continents and you are kinda short on quests, but later on Tanaris/Un Goro/Plaguelands and Searing Gorge are more neutral.
---
Lock eye pulls in cath til 43 or even 44, then ZF graveyard runs til 51ish, maybe 52 if you have a great group going. then quest to 54 and start on farming preraid bis, do each big dungeon questlines and all your attunes and that will easily get you 60 and geared
---
No u don’t stop lying 😂😂😂
---
I’m not sure if this is just me, but I really enjoyed lvling my Paladin (currently lvl 50 as ret).
---
A few things that helped my lvling speed and made the most impact imo are always having an updated weapon. Getting engineering, the nades can help with AoE and stuns. For the general kill 10/20/30 things quest I would get into a group if I find someone else doing them as that dramatically increases the speed at which both of you can complete a quest especially in a contested zone. I’m also on a PVP server and horde mostly leave me alone due to how annoying it can be to kill a Paladin with bubble/bop/loh/freedom/dispel/heal/repentance/hoj. So many oh shit buttons, engineering can help with stuns and other CC or damage stuff too. 
---
Also don’t be afraid of doing green quests, as a ret I find them super efficient and fast and reward great exp. and mobs for those quests are usually around 3 lvls below you, you can sometimes two shot them with a auto attack SoC prof and judgement.
---
What most people say about paladins, for me at least, felt like it only lasted up to around lvl 20-30.
---
Also coming from lvling a mage as my first toon, Paladin was the perfect change I needed in pace and play style, it has been fun for me up to lvl 50 and I can’t wait to get to 60. 
---
For end game, holy is what I want to play and holy paladins are probably the best healers right next to priests.
---
just pay 20g to whoever is running it solo. much better use of your energy
---
You are supposed to grind out mobs between the Leveling Checkpoints..duh
---
Meanwhile Alliance trying to farm Scarlet Monastery...
---
What's your sp at? What spec are you? I'm ds/ruin. I have 278 sp, 8.4% crit, and 1% hit. That's as is without buffs.
---
That's a major disadvantage. I played a lock and would be pissed if fear didn't work.
---
Skarm tank on YouTube has a good guide!
---
You could create a macro. Check out castsequence. You can basically chain spells into eachother. So try out: 
---
#showtooltip
---
/castsequence Conjure Water, Conjure Water, Conjure Water
---
for example. Not sure if it works, but you could check it out further  [here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO_castsequence)
---
And then I self res and cast  forst shock
---
Greater Fire Protection Potion
---
Wtf are you doing with 7 runs in 24 hours?
---
Ive done 5 runs in less than an hour
---
Always go swords, they’re the most common weapon and most powerful weapon spec. 
---
Plus, 90% of the swords you use 1-60 are from dungeon quests so they’re practically impossible to miss
---
Honour points dont really matter when you farmed your prebis (and raid bis), as you only get subpar gear....unless you get into the last few ranks and good luck with that.
---
People actually sell Jed IDs?
---
I think that is not possible on classic servers. Those videos are from private servers. Duo'ing with a rogue should work though (at least I hope it does). If you can fit 5 runs in 1 hour this should be really profitable.
---
F is a strange key to map cannibalize to.
---
Imagine being hurt by some emotes...
---
No hack, Just a reportable exploit
---
Already have the look, Just cant figure out the text part.
---
Saw that pink bar and laughed.
---
I wasn't advocating letting mages stay at half health nor telling everyone every heal you are throwing. You can let someone sit with some damage if something else is priority but you have discuss priorities with the other healers. The plan going in needs to be loose enough you can deal with unplanned problems like pulling an extra mob but consistent enough that when things arent super hectic you know what your priorities are and what the other healers priority is otherwise you are just stepping on each others toes. 
---
You can keep it simple priest does this group pally does the tank and the rest. If anyone drops below 40 percent call it or dont call it and cover what ever as long as you can see when you screw up or when the other guy does because its a better indicator than anything on a damage meter.
---
Glitch abuse, permament ban most of the time.
---
You also need to understand the limitations of fury tank at current levels of gear.
---
As pointed out elsewhere ... its most likely TBC 10-man Karazhan which would make more sense.
---
lmao i raided sub daggers on pservers all the time as long as you can put up those big numbers nobody gaf and its nce to have someone who can actually sap
---
if ur good thats all u need
---
Why?
---
Rogue is all about the toolkit and how you use it. 1-15 is slow paced but it gets faster once you got your poisons and some talents.
---
Many tell you to go combat first but for me it went pretty smooth with 17 points in assasination (5 points malice, 3 Ruthlessness and 3 on SnD and then lethality and relentless strikes), it's a need variation and thanks to the combo point efficency/gambling your SnD and Evisc/Rupture never really are an issue.
---
Stunning oppontents with sap when going for a 3-man camp clear is something to get used too but it is important, also evasion is your go-to skill when fighting or accidentially pulling 2 mobs at once, try to activate it as late as possible too, maybe you beat them and save the CD? :) 
---
Anyway, this is messy I'm not to good at explaining so I'll end it quickly; get Skinnder and LW to always keep good gear, and try to play it smart, the most fun of playing a rogue comes in handling sticky situations like a gentleman thief. (or vanish and sprint :P)
---
AP frostmage works so far, we have a few in our raids.
---
I agree but we don‘t get to decide together what it means. All of us together get to do so.
---
Booty Bay is practically a Horde capital.
---
Not to the degree it is in Classic though.
---
Hence... You don't help the enemy and rather gank them next time you have a Chance... :P
---
I honestly have to reconsider from time to time, because I take terminology from private servers as gospel which people who haven't played WoW for 15 years may not be accustomed to.
---
I never get why. Its not like it takes 2 hours to get to BRM if you decide to do raids/dungeons there.
---
Flair up carebear. I played Alliance in Vanilla. Wtf is this crybaby shit? Should we post breakdowns of every discrepancy between factions? It's not going to change. 
---
You and yours picked your faction and can reroll w/e you want, what's the point of a post like this other than bitching?
---
Yeah, it’s really put me off of Hunter which is a shame because I was really enjoying it. Hopefully they manage to fix it so I can come back to it.
---
TY. To add parry is not common on items. Parry is one of the first mitigation probability counters against a physical hit roll. Parry after vanilla kind of meh.. but every boss in MC can be parried I am pretty sure. BWL, AQ, Nazz are not exact same but similar.
---
the percentages on that meter are close to 100, there are not 32 other people in that raid
---
I really think this is great accomplishment! We had nice stack of 5 friends. We thought our classes pretty well so we have good times to farm those pre bis at end game.
---
Well.. things didn't quite work out. It was beautiful idea but having multiple friends synced with levels is really hard. Glad that you could make it!
---
Wish journey's end ever dropped :(
---
Why? If you spec combat you can easily take down packs of 3-4
---
Aside from the “only my absolute bis is worth using” mentality, the only real difference is that everyone is way better at the game, if you into MC, it’s assumed you’ll clear 10/10, even with a pug.
---
They become gods because they dont really use any mana when they get some crit in AQ and naxx.
---
They have 1 button. ONE.
---
Fight mobs 1-3 levels lower than you and do green quests. Same xp as yellow quests but it's easier. I can literally kill mobs and regenerating with spirit alone between mobs and chain kill mobs 2-3 levels lower nonstop. I also invested in a good weapon for a few gold which helps if you're leveling it as an alt like myself. Also keep bandages available as gouge into bandage has saved me multiple times from a certain death. That should help ya
---
Come back Sunday for my screenshot.
---
Yeah this addon is just a really simple, slim and clean version.   
---
For poweruser i guess those other addons have way more utility.
---
And here you come after all this wholesomeness.
---
They are also a lot of people that got HoJ under 20 times. And they don't have to farm it forever to stay relevant. It's different.
---
We get to have the Illusionary Rod and Mommy's Chapeau
---
ya I can do that too without needing blade flurry. sap one, instagib another with premed ambush, pop evasion and have setup feed me cps to burn down the remaining two easily.
---
Do they really need to be elite
---
i haven't huntarded in the new game. but i was survival spec in the original after they nerfed the everloving fuck outta spirit bond
---
i'd give feign a 1 in 15 chance of failing to remove you from combat (despite the mobs not resisting you)
---
Nowadays he very much look like Hagrid? From Harry Potter
---
I was a pally tank...I can agree to this. It was incredibly interesting.
---
Yeah, I do over 1mil dmg in an mc run. Come back Sunday.
---
Dominance is asserted in a duel
---
you loose out quite some DPS without  sword or dagger talents in combat
---
Yes for sure.
---
What you sapping in MC buddy?
---
If you still want a raptor get to rank 10 when PvP get released.
---
It’s unfortunate too. I play on alliance side on Heartseeker and moved there the moment transfers were available. This first couple weeks things seemed fine as it was pretty balanced. Then blizzard added three more realms on top of the first two and all those realms were horde dominant servers and Heartseeker turned into a alliance safe haven.  
---
At this point, nothing can be done to fix the issue as the damage was done with that second wave of transfers.
---
Its estimate that you'd have to make atleast 100 runs before getting everything, and thats just based on the droprate 
---
You lucky dog.
---
I would take BRM over those every day of the week.
---
The glow on the handle is more than it used to be while the whole blade is less glowy in General.
---
Just a Change of glow as far as I can see
---
Druid gets feared + priest shields lmao. Barely a 2v2.
---
To be honest, the reason I’m asking for proof is not because I’m calling you out, it’s because I actually want to see this as I feel like with full buffs and proper gear and maybe some debuff slot allowance, this might be doable.
---
You're not supposed to do it solo mate...
---
Use a gun because it's so fucking loud.
---
Whats the macro? I bound minig mousehweel up and herbalism mousewheel down, but maybe the macro might be an improvement.
---
Yes xD Iridia lvl 112 elite knight before i sold it :P
---
Also played Libera, Danubia, Eternia
---
Always liked those headpieces. I used to chill on the Org bank wearing Cenarion shoulders and a Hibernal Robe. That robe really let's things breathe which is an very underrated quality in clothing designed for Tauren.
---
Couldn’t fit it in the clip but those two showed up as I hit the devilsaur. I got the shield after it was already over. They tried to take it and failed just thought it was funny.
---
Lol, blind spots where guards can't see you are not an abuse in neutral towns. 
---
The ones which make the guards "Evade" e.g. rooftops of Gadgetzan are.
---
Western plaguelands. Alliance has a town and a FP. Horde gets to walk from UC to do that damn nyx attunement bullshit, as well as other turnins around scholo.
---
SoS barely has any quests available. It is a quick stop.
---
Recommend doing DME lashers + satyrs.
---
Lashers should be doable in 2 pulls total, then clear imp packs with fire resist (they hurt otherwise), then do the packs of melee satyrs, then boss for Essence of Water. Try to get as close to 12 min runs as possible. There is also a chest spawn to look for.
---
Will easily be better than ZF by a large margin but will depend heavily on the auction house.
---
Your alternative is ZF which should net you a consistent 50-60+ gold per run. Simply do the three "packs" in the graveyard, do boss, run out then back in. The difference to DME is that it's all raw gold. Vendor everything. Turn cloth into bandages (Mageweave into normal ones and Silk into heavy), sell greens, mojos, grays, and bandages. It's also a lot more brain afk friendly so you can watch a show or do something else while doing ZF.
---
I've seen people do scarabs as well but in my opinion not worth it as you will just end up with full bags faster. The only reason you do them is for a chance at Edgemaster's (&lt;0.1% drop).
---
Maraudon is an option too, but haven't tried it myself, and I don't know how it is compared to the other two above.
---
Once you get some gold the best is to invest all of it into stuff that will be worth more in later phases. That's for you to figure out though.
---
Hakurai has a youtube levelling guide that incorporates cooking and herbalism.
---
He did it as a warrior and soloed the majority of it so it can be done as any class with ease.
---
I tend not to stray from it until around level 55ish when I spam dungeons.
---
You still need the riding skill for these
---
I have not, but I have rolled a warlock with a cool demon name "Asmodai", and I kinda regret that because I get daily whispers about whether I'm some streamer.
---
Does it require specing into Master of Deception?
---
I'm in raiding spec and cant be bothered to keep respecing for farming. If I could, I'd probably try pickpocketing BRD :)
---
Go 11 holy and rest protection for leveling and tank/heal dungeons all day long.
---
I'm confused, is sweaty not an insult?
---
Mining was best in the first month, after this herbalism makes 4-5 times the gold.
---
I really want my birb hat to finish my wildheart set off but I haven’t had any luck with the drop in scholo yet
---
Priorities straight.
---
Mining is definitely not worth the effort. If you want gold, then pick up herbalism. If you are not worried about gold, just pick what you enjoy the most.
---
As a Carlos, this is typically how it is all the time
---
The critique was aimed at min-maxers who make it their business to tell others when they're not min-maxing properly. Of course you're free to min-max and actually it's kinda cool that you do provided you don't start bitching when someone else plays a meme spec for the fun (and you don't apparently like you said).
---
Your DPS is 100% tied to how much threat your tanks can put out, it'll get better when they get geared. It sucks but that's the way it is
---
i am 99.9% warrior but holy hell do i wish i had leveled a druid first.
---
Definitely. It has ruined my personal life. :(
---
Trolling or retard?
---
Hold my tether boys, I'm going in!
---
There are a few unfinished quest chains for 1-60 (e.g "missing diplomat") which were updated after vanilla. The lack of continuation is kinda disappointing for me.
---
Its really good.  So is second age.
---
3 hunters and 1 druid in the Top4 DPS.
---
LOL. yea, probably a TBC damage meters, or a shitty guild.
---
Eat his corpse for true dominance
---
level to 60
---
go near him
---
press fear
---
win
---
Looks awesome. Grats on the set AND the Tabard :)
---
You can check all the guild logs at [warcraftlogs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/).  The thing that's so hard to believe about a 900 overall dps hunter is that even this guild with ony buffs, trib buffs, world buffs, and flasks active have two hunters who are presumably the best that they have (as competitive guilds only take their 2 best for tranq shot) are consistently hovering around 400-600 dps for the majority of fights while the other classes completely outperform them.  
---
Since you're non-competitive, then surely you must have seen the performance of your own hunters and can therefore determine just how much more damage is actually possible.
---
Tanks mostly look at threat meter.
---
I would go with herb. Not only do you need it for thistle tea and blind powder, but there's a lot bigger chance of rare loot than mining. Black lotus goes for 50g per, and I have found 2 (and I hit lvl 60 yesturday). There's also a lot bigger table to choose different types/areas to go for, where as mining is only a few. I think you will find mining fcking boring unless you can use the bars for something, in herb you can not only sell but also use it. For raiding you will need to make potions etc. too.
---
Join a guild and only melee DPS and tanks are eligible. 5 days reset and 10-15people rolling makes it quite fast to get.
---
Has anyone tried having another person attack the infernal after release but before lock is killed? Like have a rogue slap it with a dagger and then vanish so it resets to its set spawn point but maybe doesn't despawn since it now has interacted with another player. Just a thought.
---
If you do not have a good enough wand then rank 1 frostbolt is useful in some situations to fish for clear casting procs
---
I'm level 50, man, I can't fly through the dungeon
---
Because of hybrid tanks. Jack of all trades - Apprentice in many; but master in none.
---
If you need more than 3 hours to do any real progress you might not be very effective i what you are doing. I can definitely get some things done in an hour or two's time. 
---
Heck, you can clear MC + Ony in less than 3 hours if that's what you're into.
---
Wasn't this due to spellbatching bug and fixed like a week ago?
---
I started my hunter with skinning and LW, and when i was lvl 58 started farming devilsaur leather.  I did around 1100g with this, but the competition at ungoro was pretty low as there weren't much 60 farming. Farming devilsaur now is a pain in the ass, the zone is camped day and night, i don't think it worth if you can't farm 10 leathers/hour.
---
I trashed skinning nad took engi, just like my main lw/engi in retail and for me worthed a lot. Thanks to engi i dropped forlor's compendium in one of my first tribute run and selled the first compendium of my server in ah for 1500g. Maybe you'll not be so lucky but yeah, with engi you can farm tribute.
---
If not you need to see the competition in un'goro, maybe it's just better to do princess run in maraudon.
---
I'm not soloing. I'm getting pugs and doing it. On all these runs I have only seen a nice pair of plate legs and the ring once. Didn't win a roll. I have only got shitty greens.
---
weapons and offhands are the only items that can be switched in combat.
---
I quit after 40 rend kills and have thankfully moved on. With the gear I have now it would be maybea 10% total damage on raid bosses where the dps is far from lacking. 
---
Also, the game is easy. Do i really need to endure hours of pain wasting time killing rend for a prebis item?
---
Yes, pls help me.
---
Again.
---
The peak of fun in WoW is, as a priest to Mind Control an alliance player going to ratchet and right after the loading screen make them go overboard, knowing they have to swim all the way to the shore, die of fatigue or use their hs.
---
Rank 11. 10 is shoulders &amp; helmet
---
thanks guys :D
---
Why is Coke better than Pepsi? It just is!
---
Really though, what Reyzerokek said.
---
&gt;stop expecting that your way to play is the 'only' good way! To be clear
---
Stop replying to people not doing anything of the sort with this toxic rubbish, please.
---
Savage gladiator chain
---
apparently, the only mobs dropping it are : lava surger in MC, and the Colossus from AQ event.
---
I thought &lt;A bunch of Idiots&gt; were on Faerlina.
---
So like here is a guild on my server that has logged and has hunters. It's not an overall example but it's a boss log. 
---
https://ibb.co/F87GPDy
---
The story got me thinking... as a warlock, when there is a priest on board that might mindcontrol you into the water.... is it possible to hellfire yourself to death and soulstone at the destination harbor?
---
On my server Thorium goes for 12,5g per stack and there's several uncontested caves i can fill my bags up in before going smelting.
---
It all depends on the server.
---
Yes, I'm looking for an addon that will help me do it for an off-hand piece.
---
Level 60 here, rogue so can't solo it. Still haven't won a roll for the ring :D
---
Yeah but not standing on top of it and killing players below.
---
Id love to see a video of this. Curious how this is done solo as a mage. Water elemental boss in particular seems like it would be hard.
---
Did you forget that you switched accounts?
---
Can we ban these posts. This is posted once a week. Nobody cares about your age and why you did x. Its not original its a cry for attention, do you want us to validate you?
---
Wait are people not doing guild banks?  I assumed this was still going to be a thing just like in classic for raid materials, random BoEs, etc that later get used for crafting/flasks/whatever the guild needs.
---
This has worked fine for me, too. I mean there is always a "are you sure" dialog, but when it's a quest item for an active quest there is an additional warning in red below. After completing or abandoning the quest, the red warning will disappear letting you know you can destroy it.
---
The suit only works on the last guard
---
Our guild has loot council but there's not a lot of discussion because it's just the most basic rules (MS &gt; OS) and it generally just goes to a roll. Maybe when Bindings drop or something then LC will be tested.
---
Yeah, on private servers it was usually with the tokens but I suppose that's because that was essentially a copy of the game from just before BC.
---
I used to be married. Then classic....
---
Ahhh, he said "on" not "in" the cage, I misread
---
Looks fun for lower level late game 5 mans. But terrible for tanking harder bosses.
---
Didn't know about the /who guildname. That's a great tip, thanks
---
Press fear, get guard aggro
---
Alright, sorry :p
---
Some guilds are.
---
This guy above me had to bring his own flasks. The guild bank basically means guild leaders alts epic mount bank.
---
&gt;Scarlet Monastery is one of the best ways to level all the way from 30-44. You get a ton of good gear that will last you for many levels. SM is handed to horde on a silver platter, meanwhile alliance have to foot it through high level zones and horde territory, often dying a bunch. Then on a PvP server they will get 
---
Also love running across the entire continent into enemy territory to kill fellow humans that pose literally no threat to anyone I care about.
---
1)Phase 2 / wPVP announcement.  
---
2) Active subscriber /Classic-players Numbers  
---
3)Possible Phase 3 info ( any info will do)    
---
4) Diablo 4 news.  
---
5) Red shirt guy ?
---
Funny. Our rogues hold top5 spots at Ony. Huntards are slacking?
---
So the wands don't disappear when hallow's end ends?
---
More like some shit private fun server
---
it's a pretty sketch run but seems possible.  I don't have engi yet so I haven't been able to try it because you need to blow the door
---
Neck 100
---
It became my go to farm, after having to gear up a bit. Only few days ago came across a shadow spell power wand and 13 spell power ring, which made me 50g together
---
?? SGC is better than cadaverous
---
No moonwalking :(
---
As Alliance player on Zandalar, this makes me proud
---
Exactly this
---
You: 'sPiT oN aLl ThE mAgEs!!1'
---
Also you: 'can i please get a bit of food and a portal? :)))'
---
Why do you even care, and post this on reddit ?  
---
.....Also, you left a part out, of this conversation... why ?
---
second, curious
---
You’re right, some days I might even be that guy, just no need for toxicity while doing so.
---
This sounds very strange, and certainly backwards. Probably aren’t Hunter’ing correctly
---
Another monkey that thinks 2v1 is pvp?
---
Nothing personnell
---
Not sure, but I think if you can disenchant and hold on to the mats I think you will make a nice profit. Prices of leveling mats for ench will probably rise like everything else as more people want to speed level professions on their alts.
---
What are you exactly having difficulties with? If it’s mana then just use frostbolt+nova to kill mobs, walk instead of blink as it’s 10% of your mana and fireblast is also less mana-efficient so avoid it if it’s not an emergency. At 10-15% mob health, you can just wand kite the mobs, or if you’re healthy then just facetank wand it for that extra bit of dps.    
---
If it’s the damage you’re lacking then do lower level quests until you get the next rank of frostbolt, and get some spellpower/frost damage gear which you can get pretty cheap if you know where to look (Icicle rod in Wetlands if you’re alliance is awesome and probably the easiest quest in the zone).    
---
You can also run SM GY+LIB at around 32-33, and you can get the Hypnotic Blade(Arcanist Doan)+Orb (drops from Thalnos, forgot the name) combo which is bis for casters for a long time.    
---
And generally, optimize your leveling, because I think that’s the main issue, not the class. Jump zones, grind some mobs. Don’t be scared to farm green quests and aoe green mobs.
---
You've heard it already but report them. Make the game a better place for everyone.
---
Zave linked to it in the YouTube comments.
---
There's no such thing as "pre-bis" for Fury/Prot, because you wouldn't spec it until you have gear from raids that aren't out yet. It's not something to shoot for, if you see people doing it already they are just dicking around.
---
If you want to tank but not be committed to it solely, go full Prot at 60 until you have decent gear, then go Fury so you can do both roles.
---
We were very surprised, too.
---
Don't really get it tbh. You like to Min max the ah, other people just use it to empty their bags. 
---
Are you really so insecure that everyone who doesn't enjoy doing something you do has to be painted as some sort of idiot?  Live and let live my dude.
---
Could also go back after tribue completed to take the good stuff. Same goes for chests, knotts etc
---
You can solo it.  
---
Get movement speed enchant on boots
---
Be combat specced 
---
Pull Princess to the big boulder next to the bridge.  
---
Kite her around the boulder, only engaging when evasion is up, bandaging at opportune moments.  
---
Profit.
---
So you killed some npcs?
---
Wow...nice...
---
You will still have a hunters mark on you so good luck getting away.
---
You’re really smart and cool m8
---
Cus I think it's ridiculous. People instantly ignore people to avoid any discussion or confrontetion.
---
This is also the entire conversation. I fought a basilisk, this guy walked by and emoted on me.
---
Yeah, he's busy escaping an awful manga storyline.
---
Is the equivalent of Wailing Caverns.
---
You do have a flying path in STV, just before duskwood...
---
no. We dont like dead realms. This is a dead realm. 
---
If you give me a mega realm with 50k people playing on it, and all of them are alliance, I'll come.
---
Greed = gold.

You dont know what you talking about and its cringe

Runs quite good, gets a bit warm tho. Playing on graphic setting 3 and got between 60-100 FPS. Turning it down to 1 in MC
---
Easiest route to booty bay as a low level Alliance :
---
- Fly to Menethil Harbor
---
- Sail to Theramore
---
- Walk/swim north to the Barrens. Turtles on the beach are neutral but there are lvl 35-40 something murloc camps to the north, so swim around to avoid.
---
- Drown
---
- Spirit rez at Ratchet
---
- Sail to Booty Bay
---
I farmed about maybe 3000 pirates near Ratchet and not a single deviate recipe dropped. I got maybe 5 giant growth recipes, and about 100 Deckhand shirts, but no recipe. I eventually gave up and just bought it off the AH.
---
Good luck to you though. I hope you find it!
---
He's full of shit. He just said in another reply that he has 278 spellpower. That's not even close to full pre-bis gear.
---
glorified fountain... btw could you bomb the non-elite mobs for us...?
---
What didn’t you enjoy about it specifically?
---
Dungeons aren’t really essential and you can easily get to 60 without stepping foot in a single one (in fact it’s probably quicker).
---
But they’re worth doing to help you get accustomed to your role in groups, especially if you intend to tank or heal in end game.
---
lol Why did all the small dick dudes come out to defend him?
---
v
---
Lol how did you kill rag without them? Every guild on my server that has him on farm uses them
---
You don't mind thorium for thorium you mine it for arcane crystals
---
Yeah hardly beasts without a healer. Enhance shaman tier.
---
Yeah I usually do feather moon for that exact reason.
---
 Buy it  when you are 60.
---
Have you notice that on horde , 3 races of the 4 can be shaman or hunter. 
---
In alliance 3 races can be priest and 2 can be paladins..
---
Most horde play warrior mage rogue hunter shaman. 
---
Most alliance play warrior mage rogue warlock.
---
There seems to be more lore for priest and paladins on alliance. And more hunter shaman lore on horde. 
---
I don't see too many horde warlocks or horde priest. 
---
Similarity, I don't see too many hunters on alliance or paladins. 
---
Paladins seem like alliance hate them because they are defensive and have to be healers at 60. 
---
This is just my observation on my server. Ole blanchy.
---
No one runs through Plaguelands to get to SM lol, that's just asking for at least a -20% durability because a level 30-40 is not making it through level 50+ undead and bears/spiders. Almost everyone runs through Hillsbrad &gt; Silverpine &gt; Tirisfal.
---
There's more types of difficulty than just "Number of buttons pressed within a short amount of time"
---
The thing with warrior is that they're the perfect storm of every painful thing about leveling in vanilla WoW: Massive gear dependency, notable resource starvation, limited and narrow toolset, no utility, no survivability, no panic button cooldowns, all your main abilities come with substantial drawbacks, tradeoffs, or conditions, you have the longest travel times, etc
---
The game will warn you if you are about to delete an item that has a quest related to it
---
Come to Dun Morough if you think you're hard enough.
---
Hi, any idea what's the addon name for displaying combo points under nameplate like this [https://imgur.com/a/6jwEedD](https://imgur.com/a/6jwEedD) ?
---
I do wish I could stab horde players too, most commonly when mining.
---
Also threatplates is good for this, the colour on the enemy nameplate changes colour depending on who has agro.
---
Damn phase 2 is going to suck now
---
It's short for Line of Sight, meaning he went behind something
---
They're really strong though. You could mix it up with some shadow bolts or soul fires.
---
Amen.
---
lol, there just isn't a reason to pay that much. 
---
I have never paid a rogue that much to open a lockbox, its different for mage ports because it actually costs them money.  If anything, it helps rogues increase their lockpicking skill.  I have seen plenty of them in trade offering lockpicking services for FREE.  You wont ever see a mage do that. 
---
No point in spending 1 gold to make 56 silver from a lockbox, it doesn't make sense.
---
A level 60 gets honor points from killing anyone of level 48 or higher.
---
We all know how a fight like that will go, won't we?
---
How do you know that.
---
Nice, I am still missing boots and chest.
---
Do you want us to validate your comment? Leave the guy be.
---
Bro that was brilliant. XD
---
If he had 600 hp it would still be 1, 2 and 3 healing per second.  
---
Pretty sure base HP is above that by the time one can grab the talnts, at 30+
---
Dude. Get a fucking grip already. "Allies killing horde at SM". You do know that SM is in horde territory right next to a big horde city? Never thought to think that absolutely most of the times SM is dominated by hordes that are killing allies all the time? The horde also dominates on most server, I get killed sometimes 5 corpse runs before I reach BRD and I don't whine on Reddit about it. The fact is that allies get ganked a lot more than hordes, in the big picture, so be ready to get stomped by 1, 5, 10, 20 or 40 allys.
---
Except if he is in the same spot as he is. Being up there however, might prevent him from going down in the room and stay on the wall. Not sure he pulls aggro
---
Isn't Bonereaver with proc stronger?
---
Grats man! Just spent another week without even seeing him. I think the spawn time can be way more than 48h. Have fun with your tidal lucky guy!
---
You could just level goblin on an alt, after making your rocket helmet of course.
---
Maybe you can answer this for me.
---
I’m levelling an orc and doing all the Quests which gives Darkspear rep. According to a guide I should be able to exalted at lvl 48, but that’s private server numbers.
---
Let’s say you do all the quests until lvl 48-49. How much Rune Cloth would you need to get exalted. This character will stay at 49 btw
---
Such skill was clearly exerted... horde trash
---
It's way quicker and easier to farm RTV in EPL.
---
I thought I was sick from 34 kills, god have mercy on your soul
---
Fuck it dude, if you have PSN come play borderlands with me
---
Slam is a meme, you do not want to use slam EVER. get 9%hit, BT&gt;WW&gt;hamstring spam to fish for wf procs, and stack crit, basicly it
---
Let me guess, thats a Onyxia Meter. Hunters can only be #1 at Ony.
---
Yeeeah I knew I was doing something wrong...
---
Why do you have a ! in your macro?
---
There's a few empty houses in iron forge I used to squat at!
---
This is so true and annoying
---
It's 500g~ for revered to exalted with current runecloth prices.
---
Fish essence of water in Azshara, herbalism, fishing/making free action potions, doing all remaining high level quests at 60 for lots of gold, running instances.
---
Talk with the DPS who pull aggro or play in synergy with their strengths. Hunter puts down frost trap? Kite around it and take less damage.
---
I have a prebis list that works amazing for me. I made it myself using knowledge from both guided about prot and fury. Getting the most optimal setup. I'll see if I can remember it when I get home here in 2 hours
---
It's weird because in vanilla I was riding a raptor with my female tauren. At least around the time of Zul Gurub so maybe it will come later
---
Thelsamar, in Loch-Modan. It's cozzy and 2 min from IF, so deal.
---
Fishing in the lake is a priceless bonus too.
---
Assume theyll all take 2 hours, so if you can’t spare that then politely turn it down.
---
You can get a sense in the first few pulls too. If you’ve got a underlevelled group where the tank is a few levels below the recommended, is wielding a 2h and failing to keep aggro causing the healer to have to mana break very often, then you know it’s going to be a long one and  you’re better off cutting your losses at that point.
---
I can't say I remember those, but it sounds like they belong in the game for sure.
---
It's to reward people who are constantly there, or who need the upgrade the most.
---
Plus nothing more frustrating then raiding 4 weeks in a row, never missing attendance, and then gear gets given to the guy who turned up for half the raid. Keep your reliable raiders geared up, and slowly funnel trial players gear after they've proved themselves.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MniAwwFKsg
---
No you dont but you might need to bring a lot of vanish powder xd
---
I ran herb, made almost no money.
---
Mining has racked me up 1300g in the last couple of days, the money is in the arcane crystals.
---
Well at least [according to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/detyph/my_guild_got_sulfuras_even_though_im_not_a_raider/) Sulfuras seems to be ingame.
---
And I don't see a reason why it should have been delayed to phase 2. Sulfuron Hammer can be learned from a BRD quest and the mats for it as well as the eye can be obtained from MC.
---
Not if that's camped
---
The raptor mount has the race's listed on it that are able to use it.
---
Way to go on the grind though, hopefully you're able to get a pvp or ZG raptor!
---
Wasn't he a level 24 elite? He was also surrounded by level 18-19 mobs as well. I stealthed in there, got a look and *noped* the heck out :p
---
I was thinking of getting a carrion bird is that as good as the owl?
---
Personally I think they add a lot. When I played without them I never knew how much *I* actually contributed to the group, just felt like I was spamming my rotation and not seeing any direct results from it. For all I knew the boss could've gone down without my contribution at all, esp if I ended up being one of the bottom DPS (though I wouldn't know it).
---
It also encouraged me to learn to actually play my class. See that all the other mages are high on the DPS meters while I'm super low? Better figure out why they're significantly better / contributing more than I am so that I can actually provide value to the group
---
Meanwhile one of our rogues has gone 4 weeks with seeing zero drops in MC and ony and is still in full blues. Congrats mate!
---
like you said, it all depends on gear quality, but also luck with procs and crits and the players involvement, skill, and chosen spec
---
a protection or holy paladin, playing with sword and board is going to waste an enormous amount of time killing a single mob, but will take almost zero damage and have zero downtime if he knows what he is doing (seal/judgement of light and wisdom for example)
---
I like to compare my killing speed to other players in the area, and I feel on my paladin I do very good damage at a decent speed, especially if everything that can proc, starts to proc during a fight, but then there are fights where you literally just watch auto attack swings and do a judgement every 8 seconds, that's when you are very slow at killing your mob, and that warrior I'm looking at in the area is finishing his second mob
---
on the flip side, if everything procs and you get some lucky crits, then you can kill a mob in a couple of seconds, ex. a white hit with a seal of command proc and command judgement on stunned mob, if these all crit in succession then you can potentially kill a mob right there, @ lvl 39 that's well over 1000 damage with a slow 39 blue 2h weapon (for reference on average: command judgement 540 on stunned opponent, (if you used an iron grenade to stun then that's another 150,) command proc crit 360 and white crit around 300)
---
paladins have excellent dps while leveling, it's past 60 for raids that retri will have a hard time to keep up with pure dps classes, but in solo pve (and dungeons) you'll do great
---
I picked them off one at a time until i accidentally pulled him and his imp and 1 gnoll then vanished after killing the gnoll. The stun and bandages/potions were the reason I survived.
---
&gt; Ganking lowbies
---
&gt; being hard
---
There’s an innuendo and a joke in there somewhere
---
&gt;As far as druids go, it's a tough call when you say ms before os. Druid HoTW spec can do both tank and heal.
---
It's not that hard. 
---
In a pug, you roll MS on the role you fill, and OS on the other gear.
---
If you play regularly with a group. You roll MS for the role you usually play with them.

Aww damn. Do you mean that sweet sidestepping glitch? Because if you do, I'm sure everyone tried to maximize those sweet moonwalking moments for as long as possible. 
---
I don't think I've ever broken a minute though.
---
It’s a waste of 3 talent points, use them elsewhere imo
---
Teebu's probably.
---
Level in the NELF zones, turn in the cloth quests at level. Click the morrowgrain pouch.
---
I was 5k into revered when I ran out of quests. Needing around 300g from cloth to get exalted.
---
The healing is threat for the healers, not for the tank though.
---
Do you have any numbers I terms for rage and threat generation for the extra 200 AP?
---
Around 1 week wait time is the new norm.
---
If redridge, duskwood and wetlands dont count because of that, then neither do 1kn &amp; stonetalon and badlands.
---
You know you can have fun minmaxing the game right? I want to beat classic, I want to own it completely, gutter it down to its base elements. But that's what I find fun about it. I have had my fun exploring the world and roleplaying and doing stupid shit. But that stuff unfortunately doesn't last, so if you want to continue enjoying the game, a good way is to try to minmax the living shit out of it.
---
God I would love to see sub numbers but it aint happning :p
---
Fuck Rend and that entire instance. Run 50. Lost twice on MH.
---
Imma just farm for a Krol Blade, at least its more consistent to get.
---
Yeah, but you don't get shit for getting exalted. Not even as a rogue.
---
Lucky bastard xD
---
Ouf, you're right. It's horrible...
---
Exactly, that's why I did not consider getting one for my tauren. 
---
The wolf mounts say: orc, undead, tauren, troll.
---
In WoWiki which is notoriously wrong due to inaccuracies from later expansions is no source to be trusted.
---
Yea, about that, Borderlands drops are shit. It's like the game knows how to piss you off.
---
Try the server discord.
---
You will never find a guild on reddit.
---
Gl :)
---
BRD is amazing.
---
Ah thanks for the vid i might have to level a mage. I dont think hes able to solo the water elemental boss in this video. Ive been doing DME 3 man jump runs in 15 min for the ore too, that elemental is no joke. Thanks for the vid
---
Do BRD prison runs from 51-57, farm your pre BiS gear from 57-60.
---
funnily enough, yes
---
I don't know what's wrong. 
---
BM, Bear pet, Send him in, let him growl, autoattack then just about get enough agro when it's nearing death to attract the mob towards me into my deadzone often two shots before it would die. 
---
How does it get to deadzone? Well tab while auto-attacking, Otherwise instant agro! Often don't put on my aspect of the hawk or hunters mark as that might give me agro
---
(Pet is loyal)Pet happiness. Gave it roasted quail; happiness goes up to yellow from red. Back to red after 1 mob. Give it pie of same food level, it goes up to green then back to yellow after two mobs.

they also camped Grom'gol lol

How would you feel if people of any language started coming to english servers when they don't speak english at all? It kind of defeats the purpose of language specific servers. Players don't like that, comparing that in any way to racism is idiotic.
---
New to aoe: Go ZF aoe about 50g per hour
---
Experienced aoe(and have herbalism): Go DME, about 65-70g per hour.
---
5 mage multibox sounds like the ultimate game genie.
---
Not my style but I'm jealous nonetheless
---
30% more bonus attack power you mean? It's a utter garbage.
---
Would be dope!
---
AB is heavily alliance favored in structured PvP aswell.  
---
while horde has the better burst to clear out flags paladins can stall a cap for 12s. which is usually enough for another respawn wave.
---
on my server arcanite bars go for +/-60g for a couple of weeks already
---
Pick up engineering as fast as possible. Level it to minimum 200 so you can use Large Seaforium Charges for the Tribute door. Then you don't really have to bother about the second profession since you will make a ton of gold in DM T. Btw about the DM T runs. Be prepared to die, a lot in the beginning, but when you get the hang of it, it's really great!
---
I'd sell the blue sapphires to be honest. They are 5-10g each on my server and you can easily farm them in a 3men DM:E jump runs reserving the 2-3 rich thorium veins.
---
I'm on heartseeker horde too and it's just fucking brutal, I have an alt I'm leveling in SM right now and everytime I go it is filled with 15+ ally while I struggle to find a group of five
---
W A R M  C H O N K E R
---
If you die you go to a graveyard and have to either run to your corpse to respawn or you talk to the spirit guardian at the graveyard and resurrect that way, however after level ten if you resurrect that way you’ll get a sickness debuff for a little bit. 
---
As a warlock your melee is going to be bad. Locks are meant to throw spells and have their little minion help with either tanking (void walker which you get at 10 after a quest) or supplement damage via imp or later minion.
---
Most spells are channeled meaning you can’t move and cast or it will interrupt, however warlocks have some damage over time spells that can be instant casted.
---
I was dead serious, im just a wow classic noob haha
---
Thank you for your advice!
---
What did expect at 3 in the morning on a Monday?
---
ISBoxer quick start guide makes it brainless, its fun if you can stomach the 5 subscriptions
---
So with this logic if I attack someone in ogrimmar and the guards don't see me it's an abuse of game mechanics? Obviously not, people are being banned for terrain exploits where guards can never reach them not attacking people where there are no guards. If there's not a guard somewhere then there should be no expectation that it is safe.
---
Yeah, you're right. Tried to test it, but doesn't work. Guess it works for stuff that aren't on the GCD?
---
I think it’s more the opposite way, blizzard are a company that want money. If classic is making them more money than retail they will throw more devs into that
---
I leveled a Warlock and Pally and now I'm leveling a Rogue and it feels super easy compared to Warlock and Pally. You have very littel downtime and you can even AoE Farm when you get Blade Flurry.
---
There's always pvp
---
Thats how the horde be on my server.
---
Alliance since vanilla and i'm still learning shit like this, good god.
---
Elemental solo is doable with ledge abusing. I don‘t have a video for you, but if you check Vods of Frostadamus you‘ll find how he does it.
---
This sub is all 35 yo boomers bragging about shit no one cares about, sad.
---
excluding neutral quests in the hinterlands like the ones from tanaris, horde has \~10-15 total quests in the hinterlands, a little more for the elite area there (which many players skip). Alliance has \~8-10 quests total in the hinterlands, but most of those are started in different zones like feralas, if/sw and darnassus. 
---
The same is the case for many other zones, alliance has just as much if not more quests total throughout the game, they are just more spread and harder to find, which I guess is really inconvenient for the retail playerbase that got too used to visiting 1 outpost per zone, grabbing 15+ quests without any chains and delivering all of them at once before going to the next zone without having done any exploration or having any remembrance of any of those quests or their purpose.
---
True classic experience. /s
---
It's fine. 40-50g/h depends on herb prices on your server, if you have herbalism. 30g/h without herbalism. If you have herbalism, it's by far the best farming spot for disc/holy-priests.
---
or you do dun morogh, darkshore, then ashenvale and boom, with 1 run to mortemines, stockages and BFD, you are level 30
---
First things first:
---
1. You shouldn't be concerned about going to PvP designated areas until around 20, but you CAN flag yourself for PvP by attacking a PvP flagged player. The starting areas WON'T flag you for PvP, most of the world however WILL flag you. Also, even if you're killed, no, you don't start over (no one would play MMOs if death meant you start over).
---
2. That IS correct, you can't cast while moving. You WILL at some point get access to instant spells and THOSE can be cast while moving (as far as I know). How do you get better at combat? Well, decide HOW you want to play. Do you want to rely on your demons while fighting? Do you want to rely on your damage over time spells (DoTs), or do you want to rely on spells like shadowbolt or fire spells? When you hit level 10, you'll unlock access to something called 'talents'. These talents allow you to customize your character based on which path you'd like to follow. When you hit level 10, press the button 'n' (it's the default button), and you'll get a popup window that'll show you a list of talents. There are THREE trees, and you can switch between these tabs to decide which path interests you. You CAN mix and match between them. Keep in mind, the last talent in the tree is unlocked at the EARLIEST of 40, so decide if the last talent in the tree is something you REALLY, REALLY want before investing down that far.
---
3. At your low level, your melee isn't too bad damage-wise because the enemies don't have much health anyway. Later on, it would be impossible to try and win melee-wise for a warlock (and not too far later on either).
---
4. As an orc....I would say the game 'really starts' when you hit 13th level, as you're at the level when you can join groups to go to 'RFC' as you'll see people call it (it stands for Ragefire Chasm). It's a dungeon, and it's impossible to do on your own at low level, THIS is when you start joining groups to go to dungeons and do dungeon related quests and get gear, gold and experience points. The first quest you should try to unlock requires you to go talk to Thrall in Orgrimmar. He'll give you a quest to go kill a bunch of burning blade cultists in a nearby cave to get a drop, then go back to him. He'll then tell you to go speak to Neeru Fireblade. When you head to Neeru and talk to him, he'll have another quest for RFC, BUT he'll also have dialogue you can go through to complete the Thrall quest. Exhaust his dialogue, return to Thrall, THEN Thrall will give you the quest to go kill something in RFC. There are three more quests, but if you're new to the game and aren't aware of where to pick them up, they can be a pain, so ask your party members if they have other quests and to please share them with you. One quest requires you to head to Undercity to pick it up (which is easy, but I'm not going into all that on how to get there, even though it IS easy to get there, you can ask around in-game as well), and the other requires you to get to Thunderbluff. Thunderbluff is a pain to get to, you'll have to go running ALL the way through the Barrens (it's next to the starting area of Durotar), and then through Mulgore, it's a bit of a run to get to it.
---
America aka the 3rd World Country without Power.

---

---

---
I'll be thrilled to watch that. Tired of watching these hunters destroy tribute runs, bring on the blooper reel!
---
Also you don't need to care about pvp in first low lvl zones. pvp toggled off there. contested zones start from lvl20-sh (Ashenvale, Stonetalon and Hillsbrad)
---
For pvp combat warlocks have damage over time effects like curse of agony and corruption and the strongest control in game - fear.
---
Game already started. Have fun no need to rush. You wont get to lvl60 before phase 2 hit (with honor system ganking will increase) and leveling past lvl50 will be hard on pvp server. So be warned. You may consider leveling on pve server for the first time if you are totally new to the game
---
Good points! However I want to note that you can get the quest for the void walker at level 8 (so next level)!
---
Working on my transporter to gadget as a mage. Then I'm free to set my hearth elsewhere and have the power of instant world travel.
---
Sorry its actually 2nd bis. Styleens/Onyxia blood is BIS trinks for sustained defensive stats (if you ignore situational items like lifegiving gem).
---
Either dual spec (fuck off with your "identity" shit) or TBC talents / spells. TBC talents / spells improve the longevity of the game significantly by making more classes viable, while dual spec is a tremendous QoL change.
---
I want to say arena because I think that's what the game is missing above all to me. But vanilla is just too imbalanced for it, they'd have to change a million other things (TBC talents / spells, resilience, balance changes) that I can't see it ever becoming a thing in vanilla.
---
Wow IS a super casual game though.
---
Also alliance warriors in westfall.
---
"Yes, we designed an area where the monsters are either immun to bleed, can disarm you, or throw frostbolt with chill effect. Also, fuck you "
---
Merry Cakemas.
---
If that is overloaded, plus DM:E farmed crazy then likely stealthies are in silithus for black lotus and/or those nodes. In such cases it's better to do some diversification.
---
Ok thx
---
That's more of a coitus interuptus approach, but it sure works! Most of the time.
---
Look up how to farm Dm lashers
---
It's only really good if you're herbalism though
---
Spell batching and layering sound like unnecessary problems but I can't guage how much they affect gameplay
---
Too much yellow banana set
---
MikScrollingBattleText is the best solution I've found so far.
---
Learn your place, mortal!
---
If you're worried about 'Bad specs' the most viable one on your list is probably druid. 
---
Also, this is anecdotal but due to the low druid population I constantly see pugs saying "LD DRUID Healer - We have none!" Basically meaning you're wanted and you'll also have barely any competition for loot.
---
As far as I can tell everyone involved is a player soooooooo it's definitely not PVE
---
Do you think OP would really go on the internet and LIE?
---
to be fair, you are right, alliance have ton of back and forth quests between areas making big storylines that doesn't exist on the horde side, such as the defias brotherhood or the missing diplomat, or the legend of stalvan.
---
Noticing the same. Been dying a lot at tribute runs because of that bug. I thought it has something to do with spell batching. Anyways, I'm just feigning earlier to avoid this now.
---
The trap bug has been fixed like a month ago.
---
First-aid. Antivenom.
---
Like meme specs, sub rogues will only be top of the DPS in two scenarios and I assure you niether are to do with your spec or skill...
---
1. The people you are grouped with are straight up awful awful players.
---
2. You out gear them so significantly that you could be any spec and out DPS them.
---
A fair fight is a bad fight. ;)
---
I don't think a private server would mess that up, the restriction is already known from client-side tooltips.
---
&gt; Most of the people now are probably stacking items especially consumables for the phase 3 PVP and Honor I guess ? but I was not looking into it honestly because I have heard that people will be camping flight points or just outnumbering and spamming the sapper charges in big team fights, maybe BG is an interesting aspect but camping flights position, Zerg rushing or milking honor by killing while outnumbering meh. 
---
I believe a large group of players with jobs / families / limited time for playing just started hitting 60 these past two weeks.
---
I rolled a druid for the first time.
---
I love it. I know I'm only the healer because of viability... But it is awesome :P
---
I wouldn't have rolled a holy pala because I Need some good movement otherwise I just die all the time :D
---
Holy Paladin will pick up in the coming phases with PVP. 
---
Start a twink already though. You will have mad times farming Gold otherwise :P
---
many quests were added later to be fair.
---
Hello, I love your work and will buying your book if available in my country.
---
How many page do you plan for your comic book ?
---
Will be a collector edition/ limited sales ?
---
Sometimes you meet nice players and sometimes guys who'll gank grey players.
---
Personally I think that ganking people so much lower than you is no challenge and only useful to piss a random person off who can't do shit against you. But others have taken a "Red is dead" approach to the whole PvP element of the game. A bit like "I was bullied as well when I was young, so it's my right to do so now!".
---
That's just a fact of live on a PvP server and it will get much worse when the honor system is rolled out.
---
How dare people play the game properly.
---
What’s wrong with Tauren Hunter?
---
The problem people view of Classic+ is that they assume its classic with.. new content. It wouldn't be. The idea of Classic+, at least in my mind, was always simply the things Blizzard wanted to do but put off for expansions or ditched entirely. 
---
ie: Hyjal, Emerald Dream, Karazhan as a 20m lvl 60 raid, all the islands cut out in the South Seas and the Dragon Isles, Grim Batol, Uldum (planned as a raid)
---
On top of all that; you have the obviously unfinished parts of zones that they simply never had time for, or put bandaids on. (Hello? Theramore Deserters questline that literally ends out of nowhere?)
---
Worst 3 points spent of ur life....
---
Parry is also better than dodge because it speeds up your next attack also.
---
Its pretty accurae actually, nobody forcing you to interact with them? Heck you can ignore them if it bothers you so much. But no they need to leave your “Reich”.
---
Resto Shaman is what I wanted to play.  Only annoying thing is world PvP.  As deep Resto I don’t do any damage.

I think you have your answer right there. It seems very clear that they'll just give gear to their friends so I'll suggest finding a new guild.
---
What are some must PVP trinkets for a druid?
---
the guys wanting nochanges and the ones not liking classic weakness may be different people you know ?
---
Is this WCWBF on Chromaggus? =D
---
Remulos?
---
People wanted equality, blizzard understood similarity :(
---
This is exactly what I needed to read. Thanks so much for taking the time to put this together.
---
Yeah leather working was really nice for leveling, easy to keep up to date and get yourself some gear while you level on top of being able to make a decent living from it. I guess this was mainly during the early stages of the server and wouldn't apply anymore. I made a small fortune on quivers and Hillman's cloaks because everyone needed them a month or two ago.
---
I wasn't crazy about my ORIGINAL main (druid), but I took druid because I thought to myself 'I can do any role when the mood hits me: Tank, heal or DPS'. Then I tanked and I realized I hate tanking. Also I didn't unlock cat form yet (the druid was level 18) and....can't remember for the life of me WHY I chose to roll up a rogue....but I did. I rolled up an undead rogue and DAMN the game's been fun. I never enjoyed the game like this before. Back when I played vanilla, I played warrior, druid and warlock, and druid was okay once I unlocked cat form, but overall, NONE of those classes were all that fun. I'd NEVER played rogue before, and I am enjoying the *heck* out of this class. I wish I'd known how much fun they were back during vanilla to be honest, I can't believe how much I've missed out.
---
Very lucky, those boots are so rare!
---
People better understand the meta, but I'm not sure min/maxing wasn't always a thing. I clearly remember spending six hours on saturday and sunday being unable to clear molten core. We'd come up with edicts around gathering a certain amount of consumables and running dungeons for upgrades just to get invited back. The min/max was absolutely there, it's just that as a restoration Druid I could show up in Wildheart and people would cheer without realising it was actually pretty crap for healing.
---
Depends on your server, I started a bit earlier than you but I'd wager I paid almost twice that.
---
Krol blade+mirah's song is ~2% worse than rends and you can easily farm for a krol blade within a day. Also, mirah's is better than dal'rends off-hand once you get 1 raid weapon.
---
No, it’s not. Report them.
---
Oh lord. On Gehennas-EU, greater fire prot is 7.5g, sometimes more om weekends
---
take neck, trinket is not needed
---
Tell them to stop being cheap and lazy and to bring Mana pots and Dark Runes.
---
Yes the mount itself it cheaper, however you still need the riding skill in classic. I rode the r11 mechanostrider as a dwarf in classic and had to have gnomeregan exalted for it to be able to ride it.
---
its not een fucking close to anlla lmao
---
its bugged as fuck and there are manychanges
---
I started a lock as main, then switched to warrior at around lvl 33. I actually regreted it and often switched back but the warrior playstyle with the crits and the reactive playstyle to rage and stance dancing always brought me back to warrior. I hated lvling between 30 and 40.. after 40 it got a bit better and now with a bit of hit gear and lvl 55 I freaking love my fury warrior. Though I will finish leveling my lock as well at some point, but never looked back, despite every fucking frost mage I encounter (ever, if lower level or higher level) is trying to kill me (sight).
---
Can confirm, got the fourth one yesterday ...
---
I mean thats fine, but its has no place in any build.
---
tell them if they wanted mana they should have made warlocks
---
Yeah, I don't believe that for one second. I did all the Org quests as a troll and still had to spend a boatload on runecloth to get a wolf.
---
Could only answer it based on the WoWhead drop rates. Both are at around 0.01% (but I don´t think anyone knows the exact rates)
---
Sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed in a dungeon, I play as a Warlock and try to keep my dots up and apply them to the mobs but sometimes it´s hard to see which mobs have dots and not and sometimes it´s hard to see which mob I have targeted. Can you recommend any add-ons I really should be using and how?
---
Right, because you also have RFK around that level which Alliance has no easy access to.
---
Why wouldn't they be?
---
I regretted my priest until I decided to stop caring about my usefulness to others and switched to shadow. I really like shadow spec, melt down pretty much everything that crosses my path, and thanks to +10% hit from talents, end up near the top of charts anyway. I'll enjoy that last part while it lasts lol
---
Shadow priests are great classes to farm with, which is what I like doing in my spare time anyway. No downtime farming low-mid 50s mobs.
---
the herb market is very weak
---
raids are too easy so the demand for potions is minimal
---
love how you censored their name and replaced it
---
It's literally a better DPS item for warriors though. And CHT has a fairly high droprate and is more reliable for PvP anyways.
---
Chrommagus EU? - Was Ally myself in a guild called "Style" Human Warr called Stomped.
---
the graphic option has to be on 3,
---
blizzard said it themselfe, 4-10 are new graphics, and 1-3 are the old ones
---
This is stellar advice
---
You'll be delighted to know that Horde has a flight point right in the middle of Felwood!
---
I would imagine so as you have access to all the same abilities regardless of spec. If you try and can not successfully solo try a duo. Get yourself a rogue friend to pick the locks to doors, if there are chests throughout you can access those, and you'll make a friend in the process. Split the winnings 50/50 and as Samwise Gamgee would say, "[share the load](https://imgur.com/gallery/4YrDAUi)"
---
Questie and Bagnon will take you far, but I don't really use much addons so I can't help too much here. Questie is the one that's benefitted me the most.
---
First to 60 on WOW Classic was Alliance...
---
Nice Name, wish I didn't get Server fooked on Name Reservation! Cheers dude!
---
Chrommagus EU indeed. I used to be in WCWBF and Inspect Me on horde side. :)
---
How is mining not worth the effort with !cast eagle eye?I have made around 4k gold as a hunter miner so far. You can even farm silithus along with rogues efficiently. Depends from server to server iguess, and your gear.
---
If this guy is having fun on a German server for whatever reason, who are you to deny him? Hes probably the .01% there that doesn’t speak german so who gives a shit.
---
Guessing that sustained defensive stats to rule out Sapphirons trinket (which is literally almost the very end of content anyway).  Surprised nothing drops in AQ20/40 kind of.  I personally want styleens with drakefang (for the hit + dodge mostly) with lifegiving as my situational.  It would be slightly less mitigation (whatever 8 defense is worth) but 2% hit is kind of important to me.  Either way I probably wont be getting drakefang for a long long time so lifegiving + styleens 4 lyfe.
---
yes, most likely in about a month
---
Orgrimmar
---
Chosing Horde while Orgrimmar exists? The fuck were you thinking?
---
Reserving both and masterloot so no one can roll when they need: obligatory class: undead
---
A good option that I've seen a few times now could be class based LC. A planned discussion with guild members of your class where you discuss / agree upon who needs what. 
---
Shared items the officers would have to discuss in between themselves with the officers of said shared items.
---
I know it doesn't compare exactly, but I found two blues (Dagger, High Burg Helm) within 15 minutes grinding the elite trolls in Hinterlands last night. Felt good.
---
My first character created on day 1 of Vanilla was a Dwarf Paladin. Figured he’d offer me the best of both worlds. Ambled to level 19 with my Gnome Mage mate and did Deadmines, where we met [Mr Smite](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=646/mr-smite). It was decided there and then that we’d made a terrible decision and both rerolled as Taurens - me as a Hunter, him as a Warrior. Had great fun levelling to 60 together. My Dwarf is probably still level 19, never to be seen again.
---
Yes i did. Blood elf pally
---
Playing priest (currently lvl 46), because I didn't want to run a pure dps class, afraid I wouldn't find dungeon groups, and the min-maxer in me remembered priests to be the best healers, especially as a dwarf priest with fear ward. Also the old wow friends who convinced me to start again for classic did not have a healer yet, but a warrior who would be able to tank.
---
Turns out, those friends all stopped playing again very soon, and I don't see myself raiding much if I make it to 60 at all. There are also a lot more healers than I remember from vanilla, so finding groups is arguably more difficult than for a dps. Tanks are much more difficult to find.
---
TL;DR: Should've rolled a druid instead, as it's one of the few classes I never played back in the days and I could've gone tank now.
---
&gt;s Priest gear l
---
you kiddin? In our 5 weeks of raiding we had this amount of Priest items: 1 eye, 2 chests (nobody uses anyway because tailoring), 1 shoe, 2 Helmet and 1 shoulder. (We're 6 Priests, one of them is shadow)
---
All our Rogues are soon completed and yesterday I had to disentchant 3 of the druids gear, RIP T2 pants.. 
---
any tips or tricks how to get Priest drops? :P
---
I read that it is allowed, but there is some vague limitation that it is not allowed to camp the spot for days
---
&gt; wasn't a thing in vanilla lol
---
Yes it was in a sense, i leveled all my alts dungeon only from about deadmines @ alliance side and SM Horde side. AoE tanking and farming the mobs.
---
People just refined it with mages cause mages are busted.
---
Managing mana in the middle of the fight can be tricky, but for out of combat, you can head to a general vendor at 1st level and buy refreshing spring water. Later on, you can head inside inns and find the 'food and beverage' vendor and buy higher leveled water items.
---
Actually it very clearly wasnt. For instance you'll see sentries roaming Orgrimmar, suggesting that assassinations are possible within that area as long as you do not get spotted by one of the guards.
---
'Coz undead females look sexy.".......You what m8?
---
Noone's gonna talk about how they both have a Cataclysm title in 2008?
---
the herb market crashed too
---
which already was weaker than the mining one
---
besids tanks I dont think anyone bothers buying flasks now for lotuss
---
I originally rolled a priest but I "had" to reroll because apparently we didnt have a tank, so I rolled a warrior and damn do I wish I didnt. 
---
Tanking is meh and playing the warrior outside of raids is incredibly boring. The only time I ever enjoy it is when doing jump runs and that's only because I hang out with my friends at the same time.
---
If I had any other role than being our guilds MT I'd reroll in a heart beat.
---
TY. I am just gonna run SM until 40 then head back to questing once I am over-leveled.
---
Oh? Like what?
---
I have a 52 hunter, 40 warlock, 38 druid, 27 rogue, 20 mage, 20 warrior
---
Unless there are bugs and changes in the raids, I haven't experienced anything of the sort in all of my time playing.
---
Did well to grab ‘Carlos.’ Gz.
---
Gonna play devil's advocate for just a sec:
---
I've been an officer in a LC guild, and my god it was hard and a lot of work. I usually put down 2 hours after every raid just to get things sorted loot wise until the next one. Tracking everyone's attendance, buffs, while at the same time having to help new members gear up outside of raids, getting to know them, check in on morale and give advice, farm douses, because that's what's expected of me.
---
Officers are held to a higher standard. Raiders just get to show up for raids a lot of the time. Officers put in a lot of extra work, and they should also be rewarded for it, provided they actually do the work.
---
Officers also tend to stick around even in bad times, which is also a good investment for the guild. You know you won't lose that Drake Fang Talisman, because Johnny started the guild and is good friends with the other officers and he won't leave.
---
Oh my, 10%. LOL what a gamechanger. Most of your xp doesn't even come from quests. Yeah horde may have a slightly nicer experience but the grind time is more or less the same across both factions.
---
Good thinking our LC is similar
---
Yer tried to do tribute runs but found a mistake was costing me so much time it wasn't worth it for my gold. Ended up sticking with mara.
---
because sweet sweet reddit karma
---
Ehhhh..... not really I kinda wish I made a tank but that’ll probably be my 3rd or 4th alt but besides that I’m having a lot of fun making money with warlock right now.
---
dunno why people like EPL
---
its too easy to aggro random mobs
---
What's the best unit frames add-on for healers?
---
I really don't mind blizzard's default unit frames, I just want it to be resizeable, with click to heal abilities, and I'd like it to move back and forth seamlessly between raid/alterac/wsg etc mode, and 5 man dungeon mode.
---
I used to use healbot, but since classic I've found it to be a pain. It doesn't show mana the way I'd like, and it has to be rearranged everytime I switch from raid to dungeon and back. 
---
Asking for my druid. I don't use unit frames on my warrior or mage, but I would if I found one easily configurable enough that it would integrate with the rest of my ui without being a pain.
---
I paid 15g for mine at level 48. It dropped on the first run, so I think I spent a total of 30 minutes getting it including travel time.

---
Meticulously finding every nelf quest at the appropriate level won’t even net you half the rep you need to get to exalted, I’m not even sure it’ll get you to revered.
---
You’re much better off just zooming to max level however fast you can then spending 1kish on the Runecloth.
---
You can go the questing route but you’ll likely get to your end destination much slower overall.
---
we don't do much, but it's honest work
---
Got a level 60 nelf priest who is missing desperate prayer and either fear ward or 5% spirit in exchange for roleplay value and two skills that are unusable.
---
UC to thorium or kargath is long enough to autoafk you on the flight.
---
Not on tauren you cannot.
---
Kinda, but not because of the class itself. I can handle shitty solo farming abilities and a tough leveling phase. Warrior is still hella fun, I like tanking and I like how well he synergizes with others in PvP and raids to become a DPS monster. 
---
Biggest issue is that everyone figured out that warriors can top DPS charts. Way too many warriors around. It was more than fine from 1 to 60 to pre-BiS, as I was willing to tank and that set me apart enough, but now I'm competing with a billion others for a few raid spots and the rare useful raid drops. Finding a PUG when I miss the guild raid is a nightmare of "LF healers, WL/Hunter DPS". When you finally find a raid willing to take you along as DPS, then you're lucky if there is a single item you can roll on throughout MC, and for that you compete with 7 (plate DPS item) or 15 (melee item) others. 
---
Going on vacation soon, and might re-roll WL, hunter or druid when I'm back. At least as twink, to see where things go.
---
this will be true when new raids come out, so far fights are short so you can get away with spamming flash heal and having 30% overhealing if you want, it doesnt really matter.
---
Kinda bad move to drop herb for Enchanting if you wanna make gold. Enchanting is the most expensive profession to level and it won't beer you much in the long run either. And using your disenchants to level your enchanting will severely gimp your gph as well.
---
Yeah... Its funny how lack of time was good and bad thing for Horde zones.
---
You can see how much love, care and detail Blizzard put in Eastern Kingdoms starting zones. Early quests are actually pretty good (even Forsaken quests) and environment is detailed and full of history.
---
Kalimdor is quite literally Wasteland made in hurry. It looks plain and deserted. Most quest are about killing and collecting 60 bear assess for random reasons. 
---
BUT this lack of detail and care makes the actual questing simple and effective. You can just pile up dozen killing quests and do them all in one trip.
---
That's not the riding system Classic uses though, there were two different ones during vanilla. In Classic the R11 mounts will be 100g and will require the associated skill. For example the [raptor mount](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18246/whistle-of-the-black-war-raptor) will need Raptor Riding (1). 
---
The [AV mount](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19029/horn-of-the-frostwolf-howler) however will be 640g and not require Wolf Riding (1).
---
You had a better PC than most back then. Graphics look passable :) and yeah very pvp heavy guild from looks of the gear :)
---
It's really the weapon itlseft (when fithing packs) . 
---
Wait till Ravager becomes less relevant with leveling and you won't see many warriors pulling that much dps.
---
"OOOMMGG xDDD"
---
How?
---
EVERY FIGHT IN WOW HAS TO BE 1V1 SAME LEVEL SAME GEAR SAME CONSUMES SAME CLASS OR IT DOESN'T COUNT
---
So there I was... At the mercy of four, monstrous Horde!
---
He's right. Sword spec isn't necessary while leveling.
---
Hey. The digital comic book will be share for free.
---
I don't want to sell copyrighted content.
---
The only way a physical copy might come to be would be maybe to ship to high tier patrons after reaching the goal.
---
But at the moment we're pretty far from reaching the goal :P
---
There arent any 40 mobs in bb, the level is irrelevant and at level 30 a lot of people didnt use ironforge as their home base
---
Cant humans ride the mechanostriders? I’m pretty sure I saw a human warrior with it. But it might have been a hallows end buff
---
Wait, wait, wait.. Are you saying that he 1v5'd by having four people jump off the boat whilst the fifth killed him? I don't think I'm quite understanding this still..
---
Fwiw I hit over 1m in a BRD clear, but I vastly out geared/leveled the other dps in the group
---
TankWarningsClassic. Basically let’s the group know if your taunt etc got resisted or when you activate a heavy CD like last stand. 
---
ThreatPlates is also a must. 
---
MarkMe. Probably don’t need this, but it has a nice marking panel along with a ready check and a customisable message you can send with one click all in one place. 
---
Aside from this, anything else I could recommend are just general quality of life add-ons which anyone could be using.
---
Firemaw discord or ingame channels... not reddit
---
&lt;3 means a lot :))
---
Well ofc i know some people have fun that way (you for example it seems) and thats completely fine. Everyone builds their own classic experience. 
---
Its just i dont see any joy in this. I play games to relax, i minmax my job, no need to do that outside of that :D
---
there is noheal/mana chart but you can easily see it by watching the abilities used, a priest using 70% heal rank 2 will have a better hpm than another priest spamming rank 7 flash heal. But for this tier of raid i wouldn't really track that stat. Maybe during your first MC but i'd guess fights will still be short.
---
What's funny is since the meta seems to be min-maxing now sooo many people rolled priests with the expectation of raiding and being the best overall healer for classic. With an abundance of priests (especially dwarves on Alliance side) they aren't finding raid spots. Meanwhile, so few people play druid that it's incredibly easy to find raid spots because of their utility.
---
Well layering is mostly gone, at most servers have 2 layers and there's up to an hours cooldown on swapping. But early it was super abusable, and you could just hop around. You never had to wait for mob respawns because you just layered to one that wasn't cleared. Some stuff like that is still possible but like I said only on 1 hour.
---
Spellbatching has a lot of annoying stuff that pservers never had. Things feels delayed and stuff gets batched so much more often than pservers did(which had an "attempted" spellbatching). 
---
Oh and to add on the list, the servers can't handle more than 150ish players in the same area, so whenever there's big pvp fights in BRM you have massive lag.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yZYGbVNA-s&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yZYGbVNA-s&amp;t=5s)  it's quite evident in my guilds vid here.
---
If it is designed to be safe, why is it possible to attack other players? Killing someone fast and then being killed by guards, is that also banable? 
---
You are talking out of ur ass
---
lol mr neverdies in wow
---
You got trolled.
---
Yes defenitely!
---
Once every 30mins xD
---
I thought I could only search for names, thank you!!
---
Stop telling people. The farm is completely worthless since someone made a youtube video. There are 6 pools and like at least 10 people running/swimming around trying to farm those at any time of the day now. Before it was an ok farm, now it's just completely worthless.
---
I feel you. There are so many people from Quake 2, Quake 3 and WoW Classic to whom I've lost contact and would like to know if they still play / what they are up to now.
---
Revered*.
---
Revered to exalted its 21.000 rep, 50 per turn in. So thats 420 turn ins.
---
Yeah... I never understood that and probably never will lol
---
If your mages are crying that they can't have mana tide, it's probably about time that you grab some new mages and then put your resto shamans where they belong; in the healer group
---
Horde
---
You are asking for an addon that shows you incoming heals by others right?
---
This is correct
---
What's in it when you farm rep for them?
---
How are u making money? Mara farm?
---
Wisdom or Salv. Or at high levels kings. 
---
Getting BoM on your pet is ideal too though.
---
ravager is broken
---
Oh, Out Worlds didn't get that good critics tho, I won't buy it. And you rushed the game, forgot to enjoy it, or could have enjoyed it much better, but you're sitting empty-handed and bored when others are out having fun in the WoW-world. Maybe you have learned from this. PS: Your downvotes are real and you should think twice about em ;)
---
Agreed, and that’s on him, but he probably has his reasons for choosing a German server. Still doesn’t change the fact that people telling him to gtfo is pathetic though.
---
 But that place sure as fuck isn't centralized on the map by any definition of that word
---
I was also ignored when I joined my guild but now I'm having a ton of fun raiding Molten Core and Onyxia with them. So much that I've learned since then. Leveling is hard though
---
Thank you! I’ll check it out asap. We actually moved from a pve to a pvp server (still warlock, only around lvl 20 now but super happy) and started skilling again. So that’s very helpful
---
You can use FR gear instead of pots.
---
?
---
Or just be a healer in raids, healing is basically reverse dps youre doing the same thing lol
---
You can do it by messing around with white and blacklists.

What? Our raiders rented a generator and are lan partying until it is over
---
I revived another person inside that building and got killed by the guards ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
hey, just wanted to add - I ran SM with my group the other day (4 of us) and I tanked with Ravager, Herods shoulder and the Firey Blaze enchant from the Badlands quest and was quite a bit over 100,000. I believe I was lvl43 at the time
---
True, but meme specs are disrespectful towards people that play their class the way it's been intended to be played.
---
Neither blue sapphires nor arcane crystals depend on layering much since they are dme farmable.
---
lmao mage is so fukin ez wtf
---
The only Raptor mount you could ride as Tauren would be **Swift Razzashi Raptor** from Bloodlord Mandokir in ZG. Otherwise we only had wolves and kodos for vanilla.
---
Disable filters for buffs / debuffs under Unit Frames &gt; Target
---
Fuck off if you reserve something cause you made the Access yourself, found Jed, and precised that some item were on reservation then yeah ML that shit. Make your own groups if you ain't happy.
---
If the priest was in the raid, he can roll and do whatever he wants with the loot if his roll is highest. Are you telling me he shouldn't get a roll because he didn't do with the head what you would have done with the head?
---
It would be an awful shame if one was to..... lose control of their mind and jump hohoho!
---
I think you mostly kite and do damage with spell dots, so Spelldamage gear would be advisable.
---
Why does it only have to be boss drops. What about everything else enchantable?
---
I remember getting the helm on my troll shaman back in the day and getting pissed at how stupid it looked on male trolls because the faceguard was open making you look so silly.
---
MS&gt;OS implies that your MS is whatever your current role in the party is. This has always been the case.
---
Awesome bro!
---
I don't have any of the People I used to Play with left. They all moved on with their lifes...
---
I have some new People to Play with though and an amazing guild! My brother actually started playing too :D Although he is taking his time to Level... :P
---
Have a lot of fun you too! I want another screenshot once Naxxramas is out xD
---
Rage is based on damage done, not weapon speed.
---
The main reason tanks want daggers is to dump rage, which is not a problem in MC since bosses don't really hit hard.
---
Missing one autoattack and not being able to attack for 2 seconds instead of 1.5 is not gonna break your tanking. Missing a shield slam is the problem.
---
Nah, not on Classic it isn’t.
---
Correct I believe
---
For the toxicity, either you are unlucky or you are subconsciously biased... statistically, very improbable that all a faction is toxic... players are the same
---
Correct
---
Not at the table carlos.
---
First princess down at lvl 47 and my bis ring dropped, never saw a ravager to even need on in 20 arms runs.
---
Peaks and troughs
---
 I'm getting told by guides that this hunter macro should work:
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
/cast Raptor Strike  
---
/startattack  
---
/cast Counterattack  
---
/cast Mongoose Bite
---
And it should obviously prio Counterattack before Mongoose Bite since both are on GCD, unlike Raptor Strike. My problem is that if I dodge and Mongoose Bite gets activated, I cannot use it because the game tries to use Counterattack instead (even though I haven't parried). Is this something that wasn't carried from private servers to classic and is there any fix to it?
---
They are still contested zones and not alliance zones.
---
So Stonetalon, 1K Needles and to some extend Ashenvale could be compared lvl wise to Duskwood, Wetlands and Redridge with the difference being that Alliance actually have a few quest in the Horde centric zones where Horde has none in the alliance centric zones.
---
So the Horde has a lot of contested areas that favors them, but the alliance have contested zones only made for them.
---
- Wetlands, Redridge, Duskwood. You left out those Alliance-exclusive zones. 
---
- Ashenvale is wrong. Astranaar is a major quest hub and there's also a minor quest hub (with no FP, though) on the Darkshore border.
---
- Hillsbrad is also a weird justification. Southshore is a major quest hub for the Alliance. There's a very good reason Hillsbrad is an absolute warzone on PvP servers: loads of Alliance and Horde quests there, meaning loads of players.
---
Also, while this has become far less of an issue today with quest guides and such, the Alliance has more quests in total. Horde players who just take quests as they find them have often found themselves needing to grind their way through the mid/late 50s.
---
They can however ride Baron Rivendares undead mount!
---
I like my mage. There's tons of stuff to do, capable of doing pretty much any content in the game, and it's the perfect class to raid lead on. I only have to worry about my mana bar, I'm ranged so I've got a nice view of the fight and everyone's position, there's not that many mechanics I have to worry about and there's enough of us to that any mage specific duty won't take away my focus from raid leading because I can just assign it to one of the other mages.
---
I don't think it downranks at all. I have been getting +32 stamina buffs at around level 15.
---
Yeah, I agree with you. If you have some, throw them in for 35g. Maybe some people think they are getting a bargain. :D
---
I mean Kirtonos only has the one person able to craft them so it makes sense that the “tip” is high. also I don’t understand how people haven’t been saving mats since the beginning.
---
Well... your title says allies, so you started it all. You could have used people or player.
---
&gt; Gamers are a community.
---
wrong, gamers are people who play games
---
How is he a loser, he got his item and a felstriker that's giga rare. If anything he's the winner here and you sir are the loser.
---
! In a macro makes it so you cant undo the command by double pressing
---
And you wonder why Alliance players like instances so much?
---
Do /startattack btw, its the correct way to make this macro
---
Luna ui has this functionality
---
Join us then :)
---
Not equivalent to priest either in terms of full healing power. Good enough but not the best.
---
Personally, I find it way for stressful to heal than to dps. Maybe due to the tank health moving way to fast.
---
Rogues should be whatever spec they wanna be
---
I would. Mechastriders are awesome.
---
I have to be discrete
---
When you've gotten used to the mechanics, you can easily pull off 3 runs / hour. You're getting 15-25g just vendoring the green/blues each run, additionally you're getting pots and books for auctions. If you're still in the learning phase, mara gets you more gold. But after getting used to solo tributes, mara isn't worth it anymore.
---
I should have rephrased my question better to say that I dont believe any of them to be memes, but I have seen certain specs have a hard time being accepted by others. Thats more so what I was going for. My old guild literally kicked someone for rolling on gear against another guildie that had a higher potential class when it came to getting BiS gear. So the "meme" label is more so a product of the overwhelming amount of single minded classic wow players. Still joined the discord cause I love when people are passionate about their class.
---
Wrath without the dailies though :P
---
Because its a pvp server? Figureitout
---
strat live group LF dps... orbs res!? THE FIENDS.
---
only cause i was playing outer worlds !

semi correct - yeah people do DM E Jump runs, but those are not the only place.  
---
They are obtained from the world as well, and thats where layering comes in.
---
Didn't say it was hard, but I need to pay attention XD
---
Here's how it works:
---
The items you want drop only for people in your guild, on their first run, also your party gets geared to the teeth and you're stuck running the same dungeon for weeks. When the item you're after drops you lose the second tier of RNG in the form of rolling and then have to run the same dungeon a few more weeks.
---
Then you get frustrated, reroll and the steps start all over again.
---
Enjoy.

Yeah, my gulidie Rogue and guildie Druid do duo tribute all the time.
---
I got to level 33 on my priest and after having LFG chat up all the time decided to reroll druid. Just about to ding 20 and no regrets... couple more levels on the priest and I can have more max professions.
---
Well there is a zul gurub drop that's a raptor mount. Drop mounts don't have any restrictions.
---
Lucky enough I made a rogue friend not too long ago, will definitely have to ask him to do that and share that sweet load
---
Is there a good Addon that will show full dungeon maps and boss locations in game? After running BRD three times this weekend I still can’t remember how to navigate it
---
Best geared feral and missing 3 pieces? What server?
---
I love everything about priest especially how easy is to get the full preraid BiS. Healing in dungeons is both easy and satisfying.
---
What I dont like is that healing in raids feels a bit hollow and kinda pointless. The current content is just so easy and everything is just a race to top the healing meter so you just mass spam Flash Heal because if you try to be mana efficient and heal people with appropriately sized slower heals somebody will just heal them faster.
---
I don’t give a fuck about internet points LMFAO
---
https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-outer-worlds
---
Also you’re wrong. 
---
Have a good one :)
---
If you prepare correctly for the Hinterlands by getting every possible quest for that zone from other zones (IF, feralas, tanaris, ruth'theran) you can do a single huge questing session in the Hinterlands completing 7-8 quests in one run (excluding those in the elite area of which horde has more), which is pretty much the same as for horde, except that they get all of their quests conveniently at one place. This is the same case for many other zones as well.
---
i was only speaking of raid bis capes, because 1 frost power is worth roughly the same or more than the 4int 4stam 5spi that spritecaster has. so buying a frozen wrath 15 or higher cape is better or way better, and most frozen capes under 20 frost are cheap asf.
---
and then in pvp spritecaster loses to level 40-50 capes of the eagle anywhere from 6/6 to 10/10 int stam.
---
Hm, I have to check my old screenshots from vanilla. I'm pretty sure I got the wolf and raptor for my tauren. 🤔
---
I like it so far. Don't have to worry about loot and can just raid and have fun and see what gear I get after the raid.
---
How does sword mastery (chance for extra attack) and windfury work? Can each seperate hit trigger WF, and can each WF hit trigger a 2nd attack?
---
Me and a guy I teamed up with for launch used this guide. I still use it for all my alts. Funny I’m randomly finding you posting about an update.
---
Thanks for the guide gripper
---
LUNA UI has a steep learning curve but has been able to do everything I wanted it to do.  I can’t recommend it enough.  If you do download it, watch a YouTube video on how to configure it.  I would recommend setting about 1-2 hours to learn it before you never have to adjust it again.
---
This hits home... Breaks my heart that I can't relive the good old days. But with a wife, kid, career and real life, it just wasn't possible. 
---
It's hard to spend 5 hours playing a video game, when you could get paid hundreds of dollars instead. You could also change the "P" to an "L". That is way better than a video game, tougher too! 
---
Maybe when I'm old and gray!
---
also in the lumberjack camp
---
A massive shitstorm of a protest while I wolf down a giant tub of buttery popcorn.
---
Oh yeah, and some stuff about games, I guess
---
through tab targeting you go basically from one mob to the next, so you should get every mob. Some addons like threatplates or kui nameplates also have options to show buffs on the nameplates. 
---
I've also heart people write mouseover macros so that you can hover over the mob and cast your spell. 
---
but honestly... as a tank/dps I have no clue if other players have put dots on every mob or not. It's more important that you learn how to use utility (I think Warlocks can help stopping mobs from fleeing) than doing maximal damage.
---
I thought I did. I started druid so I could tank. I got bored after level 25 and started a warrior. Hated that and even went back to retail for a little bit which was fun. Came back and started a mage which I actually really liked as it was like ez mode. Back on druid now and love it. I'm specced for tanking but did sm as cat last night. I love being so flexible. Healer goes oom, I started healing. Tank got a bit big for his boots, I swapped to bear. So good
---
Weakauras can help in this regard
---
I think there is some anger against leather loot here.
---
if the top guilds in the world are all using fury tanks wouldnt that make it by definition optimal?
---

go ahead, look down the list and let me know how far down you have to go to find a guild where ANYONE in the raid used Shield Slam. I went through the first 5 before i stopped.

---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/)
---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
You can read more about our history here: [https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
We are currently running MC every week and recently have started running 2 x 25-man groups for Onyxia.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule (UK Times)\*\*  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.

It’s bannable

Rolled warrior because I never played them at all in classic. Enjoyed it, I like that face that I can tank and DPS with a gear switch. Problem is I was not enjoying PVP. Warrior isn't something I enjoy pvping as. I rolled a warlock alt and have been having so much fun it may become my main. PVP with warlock is a blast.
---
Ahah. Got it. I'm a filthy foreigner though, so you have to excuse me.
---
People complaining are obviously people who never group up.
---
Try it.
---
Get an alt for AH, it's much better
---
Up voted for moneky island!
---
Yeah, why not farm that yourself + sell whatever leftovers you find. I’m rogue and went with Engineer and mining, once engi got high then I deleted mining and swapped for herbalism. 300 skills later and I don’t regret.
---
That's better than what I had when I started playing back in the day! Haha
---
And so another Tauren loses his life farming the unfarmable mount. RIP moo friend lol

Yeah. It’s like a Classic heirloom.

Properly geared Hunter's can top meters until bwl
---
Fake
---
Which is stupid....Horde needs those Triprunner Dungarees too ;-)
---
Y'all just went from friends to friends with benefits. You're welcome.
---
278 SP is trash, I don't believe you for a second that you pull 900 dps overall lmao. Either your dps meter is shit, or you're full of shit.
---
Venoxian here aswell, saw it once. Can't remember how much it went for tho I'm sorry.
---
Dark runes? Mages have mana gems, which share the same cd. You can make multiple mana gems as long as they are different ranks.
---
Orc on Hydraxian Waterlords server perchance?
---
Druids are also extremely performing main tank for 90% of the bosses, don't let people confusing vanilla with classic telling you the opposite.
---
HealComm should work with a range of unitframes. But Luna Unitframes has it built-in.
---
What addon is that showing loots
---
Kind of annoyed about Hunter. I love the class but i get fucked on by good rogues and Warriors the more they gear up. There's also 4 Hunter's in our core raid and we see almost no Leafs and I'm sitting in 2 pieces of GS while some are coming up on 5 piece. I just feel like dead weight but being able to tribute farm kind of makes up for it.
---
 Off put by Hunter scaling and dependence on leaf.
---
Is there any recommended item set for mage AOE farming? (As a 60 mage with 6 BiS and I want to make my life easier with ZF grave farm).  I understand that INT &gt; STAM &gt; SP when it comes to AOE farming, but isn't there also an impact of SP when you Blizzard and such?
---
Not sure if I get what you are saying. Are you saying that just because I got item the system works?
---
lol yeah I give away so many healing pots to random warriors on my rogue. Last group I was in I gave the dude 15 and still had 10 left for myself. They're part of my regular rotation now just to use em up
---
A proper totem weaving shaman is using that talent.
---
trinkets will not increase your dmg by a lot, if you are bad no matter what ur gear is u will be shit on on the meters
---
It cost gold to level alch. If you play alot than do this, if not than factor in the time it is going to take you to personally farm all the mats to level alch or the gold investment to level it. You could easily spend 700-800g swapping back and forth either in raw gold or time that you could have been farming.
---
Personally I love GRID2, it offers many tools to customize what debuffs and buffs you want to recolor frames, show a small square in the corner or similar.
---
As long as you keep flurry up 100% there is your warrior critcap. Having 5% crit being 90AP vs flat out 120 AP the AP wins as long as you keep flurry up. 
---
If you take crit every time over AP, even though when converted you are losing raw DPS, you are a bad warrior wasting potential.
---
On the other hand, alliance have 3 moderately-sized contested zones mostly to themselves up to level 30, with many quests, all on the same continent.
---
Horde need to travel between The Barrens and Hillsbrad, have less quests, and the quests are spread out over a larger area.
---
As a former horde player, leveling 1-30 as alliance is a lot more convenient.
---
erhm lad, there is still layering on zandalar tribe, there are 2 atm and the server is high-medium pop, not low-medium pop.
---
yeah you need 275 for the Powerful Seaforium, but Large is enough for the second DM T door.
---
lmao u mad?
---
I don't get these. Any of them.
---
Is there a purpose or is it just random mobs and quotes?
---

---
Yes.
---
If you played the race you'd realise it happens to everyone. But I get that crying on reddit makes it feel a little better.
---
IS that a Dick on your tabard ?
---
Can’t see past the tabard.....
---
Gz though:)
---
This. This is what I hope to see when I log into reddit each night. People being able to get the gear they were unable to in Vanilla. Congratulations! Benediction next on the checklist?
---
Does having a lower level/enchanting level affect the type of mats you get from disenchanting?
---
Smart man. I keep hearing people say they want level 35 alts for transmutes but by the time you factor in the time/gold investment to level both a char and alch and you wouldnt even make your gold back for the better half of a year off transmutes.
---
the number i saw was 4.4%
---
that's damn near what you get for spending 5 points in sword spec. that's fuckin awesome.
---
I dunno if this is the right calculation. But Gorosh has a 1 in 6 chance to spawn (16%) and has an 8% chance to drop chain. 8% of 16% is 0.0128.
---
Go do the coffers and get the blue chest piece which has 2% crit and it's only missing a couple Str and 14 Agi
---
What this player did was ninja-ing and you would have had every right to kick him. 
---
If he wanted to need on the gear of two specs, he should have stated so at the start. The only time this isn't the case is lower levels (Basically pre 50) since tanks and healers always need dps gear to level. Even then, it usually only works one way (Tank/heal rolling on dps gear) and not dpsers taking tank/eahling gear. 
---
As mentioned before, ML-ing isn't really worth it in dungeons and will put some people off. Unless its a very rare/very important item for you which you are specifically hunting, then perhaps use it (But warn the group you will)
---
reee spellcleaves
---
Flight from UC to kargath is long enough to autoafk tag you on the way.
---
If your hs is in kargath and you are not a mage, it's like 10 minutes if you ever need to do anything else than BRM.
---
Warriors are top DPS on Shazzrah, just saying.
---
So I tinkered a bit and these are my thought. First of for current content and probably for all the future content the Blizz frames are good enough and its all about just making something that feels nice. 
---
What I use is grid2 +clique which I think is not the best option, but its the best looking one. It can be configured a lot, but it need work to do stuff other addon do from the box.
---
Aptechka is I think the best addon and it comes basically preconfigured really well, but it is ugly imo. And it seems configuration is limited.
---
Healbot is very good, can be configured a lot, but again ugly imho.
---
Vuhdo is something I see recommended often, but did not try it myself.
---
Just go questing. I bounced between EK and Kal; ended up in Revered with Darnassus by 60.
---
After that, just get to 60 and go back to Un'goro to pick up dirt. - I would recommend using the Darnassus turn-in as opposed to the Feralas turn-in. The seeds are stupid cheap compared to the possible potion drops from the Cenarion Cache bags (I tend to make at least 1g per bag in AH sales). ((Both turn-ins award Darnassus Rep))
---
Also make sure to pick up every crystal. Since they don't have a vendor price, they have no AH-deposit price; free money! :D
---
Not against warriors with same gear.
---
Blizzard has a terrible spell coeficent, so dont bother with SP. Just collect as much int and stamina as possible. The Mage and WL t0 sets are actually decent for this.
---
It's a few years old Lenovo. The size is nice but the processor is a mobile one that's horrible. It really can't handle any modern games. Thankfully Classic is smooth sailing.
---
you can have atlaslootclassic maps (you need atlaslootclassic before of course)
---
Been doing about 150 duo jump runs now, probably had 4 blue sapphires. I think they will stay high while arcane crystals will drop in price
---
Faction leaders give a big chunk of honor. The supreme honor farming method pre-BGs is to have whoever you want to get honor tag the leader then have a raid kill it.
---
Fuck you
---
That's why you're in the melee group.
---
Grats dude, I couldnt imagine farming that item
---
A little. My only word of warning is that if you are going to roll a paladin, you HAVE to be in a guild that gearing healers first, otherwise you will never get gear.
---
Sadly it wasn’t until T3 that blizzard knew what paladins did, so our T1 and T2 sets were crap for healing. Meaning that all our BIS gear is OOT gear. So you’ll also be rolling against: mages, locks, druids, priests AND other paladins. Basically half your raid.
---
Still fun to play though, oh and we get the coolest mount in the game.
---
I mean if I'm being honest that one probably just needs better spacial awareness. Darwinism is alive and well in Azeroth. Those damn spirit healers just had to go and ruin it.
---
And for Raid gear and PVP still stick with BiS guides to max SP right?
---
Banana shoulders are Paladin T1 and there’s none of those in the pic. Those yellow shoulders you’re seeing are Paladin &amp; Warrior PvP shoulders and a couple of Paladin T0’s.
---
What is your point?
---
OH YOU KNOW IT! I did own it back in the day though, but it will be even sweeter second time around :D
---
Thanks ! I want to add that to my targetting macro to add a skull to it (finding targets that are far away can be hard)
---
delete your account
---
You need to make sure you put your pet on passive right before you feign death.
---
which one?
---
"Buy consumables cause I don't want to spec optimally"  
---
Yeah, that logic is just terrible.
---
So why I ask? It doesn’t make much sense. That a man if my stature should have to wear a dress
---
Depend what spells rotation and talents are you using. Frost nova / Blizzard benefits from SP but the coefficient isn't that huge. No crits so you can drop crit gear for int/sp. If you are taking lots of damage/dying then either add stam, limited invurneability pots or make smaller pulls.
---
If you have shatter and do cone of colds and firestrikes with ignite then you want/can use spell crit.
---
In 90% of the cases it won't be the gear but how well you can execute it. When you master it you may not even take any noticeable damage. Mage can solo Lord Incendius, there are videos about it but they don't show how many times you will fail in one way or another (usually due to gravity) but when you master it it will be easier, may even require less FR with just dampen magic.
---
Report then.
---
I mean there is a druid over the lock
---
Isn't the tribute ring better anyway
---
nice reserved run
---
You've been rolling on gear and losing it to bad luck, and you're still considering leaving the guild. This is why loot council exists.
---
I feel like the op is entirely Unaware of the fact that this is phase 1.5 of 6 phases.
---
 There is plenty of content on its way.
---
If bored you can:
---
 level an alt
---
Farm gold
---
Play the ah
---
Farm cosmetics
---
Farm off sets and try different roles.
---
(Op said he plays a pally why not make a tanking set focusing on thorn / reflect damage and Aoe farm)
---
Roll a horde character, the progression and quest experience is quite different 
---
Help noobs out and make new friends 
---
Or do the opposite and gank lowbies 
---
And if literally nothing above is appealing then why are you even here. Go take a break and come back in p2
---
It's just that people are too stupid to download an addon that does it all for them.
---
I 100% guarantee I spend less time than you at the AH to "empty my bags".  
---
And I undercut by 1c every time, because it's automated.
---
Legit git gud you scrubs, taking longer and making less gold per hour
---
I often wonder how much HoJ makes a difference. It seems quite significant.
---
Whats your unit frames addon?
---
For main tank healing yea priests win but i think druids are better at raidwide healing due to their hots its easy to keep the whole group topped
---
I've got to say, full Trancendance with Benediction is iconic for a reason. I hope you achieve that and more!
---
As good of a read that was, I was taken aback by the name you signed off with "Conlock". 
---
This has long been my desired name for a Warlock alt. I've actually created/deleted a level 1 alt to see if that name was available, but didn't want to hold it in case I decided to not play it!
---
hypnotic + orb is better for every class
---
That's more of an issue with your realm rather than class balance. A lot of non-tank warriors are more than willing to tank dungeons if the can reserve things like orbs for gold.
---
Amazing! 
---
Thanks, I started levelling engi on my hunter, got to about 180 them got all disheartened cause I thought I needed 275 (Which would have been more money than I was willing to spend whilst also saving for my epic mount) 
---
Now I know I'm not far at all, I'll get straight to 200 tonight and start farming DMT for some noice loot :)
---
Thata a fucking deal. Dudes crafting for 250g on mine he just got the first recipe on alliance kirtonos
---
That’s the plan!
---
Don’t know what to do with a screenshot :D pm me ur in game name
---
Thanks, good to know.
---
It never evolved past what it is, because WoW killed it and basically every other active MMO back then.
---
Define what is best. For personal use other LW can craft gear for you, for some money making it will be way harder, maybe elemental as very few pick it while right now it has the patterns advantage.
---
As a caster, you should look into getting a wand. They work like a ranged attack - no ammo or mana cost. You will use one almost all the time leveling.
---
You cast your DoTs (Damage over time) spells and then wand the rest of the HP down. That way you save mana for the next enemy.
---
I'm 100% sure there are still layers, just yesterday I was trying to trade with a friend in OG and we needed to be in the same party to see each other
---
You were likely incapacitated by the grenade, not stunned.  Private servers likely did it wrong.
---
I play an Orc, so like your friend I was in the Troll starting zone since level 1.
---
It's just strange, because there's plenty of reactions to that video but none of them mention it being wrong. And people love to tell other people they are wrong on the internet...
---
It seems excessive because it's a somewhat hardcore thing to do.  In a hardcore playstyle you do everything possible to obtain every single edge possible.
---
Min maxing around 40 is pointless to me so I prefer Illusionary Rod for the looks
---
Had that moment a week ago, my two mates went apeshit because of excitement =D
---
Never heard of that, what's chain healing?
---
Wow this is actually gamechanging...Puts UD in a much better Spot for PvP
---
You haven't been in many guilds with LC or you're just one of those players who's never putting in the most effort to deserve loot.
---
I quit the game 2 years before Cata, I still haven't seen the new world fully, maybe I'll do it one day when the call of classic has lost its urgency
---
why so?
---
Dont be toxic, let me corpse camp a red name without your "this isnt honorable pvp" input every time.
---
Thanks for posting the thing on the thing here
---
either way, who cares? PvP servers are for Pvp
---
Probably the ZG raptor mate
---
Why are tanks in such short supply?
---
Because i can do a DM E Jump runs in 7 to 8 minutes, so ill get instance locked very fast.  
---
For maximum efficiency you go mine an area .when you done with that area, you ask for layer invite and double to profit.... so thats why its still being (minor) affected by layering.  
---
just wait and see, i'll expect and increae in price when a server has all of its layers removed.
---
Had it at my first jed kill
---
Are the druid/paladin/shaman relics (gun slot items) in phase 1? I thought they would be in a later phase, but then there was something about the loot tables being the 1.12 loot tables, so I don't know wtf is going on.
---
thanks!
---
You seem obsessed with calling people stupid for having different priorities to you. Mind boggling lack of self awareness.
---
Resets on all if there is a server restart
---
it certainly does, since I buff myself for +12 all stats, but on a lvl 10 it will be only the +5 rank
---
Maybe you should find you a pocket dps like most healers.
---
Got my t2 helmet yesterday as well while 15 years Ago it never droped.I feel your happyness pal
---
You could run 50 DME jump runs and get 50 crystals or you could also get 0 crystals.
---
Isn't WotF sleep/charm/fear? 
---
Should not give any edge vs grenades. Obviously great vs the above mentioned conditions.
---
thank you
---
Cool beans! I applied to WCWBF at one point, but was told I was "too" Norwegian to join, haha. You made the cut :D
---
Looks like arugal
---
OMEGA PI OMEGA!
---
is the pvp gear still planned to be the later/better version (i.e. the lower ilvl pvp gear won't be in the game at all)? or did they eventually backtrack on that decision?
---
Lets go!
---
Just go to the warrior discord and stop being dumb, here. Thanks
---
I never raided so I would like to know what mechanics there are like as a noob mage I would just copy the other mages and follow them. Wouldn’t that work well for raiding the first time ?
---
It's easy to get one for everyone if you have everyone go into the dungeon out of group, walk in a bit and /tar him. If someone finds him, he forms the raid group.
---
I think your own capital city is unlocked in Classic too? Like if you're an Orc/Troll you automatically have Orgrimmar, Dwarves/Gnomes have Ironforge. But I get what you're saying.
---
Oh right, they added that flight path later i think
---
TPS isn't the problem though, the problem is lack of gear for it, no taunt, no reliable shield block and mana being finite. Those are rather crucial.
---
you shood try it!
---
I spent over 35 hours farming mine second week on launch.  Now it's like 7g.
---
no that info is wrong, all kinds of mobs drop it in MC and also some in UBRS and Stratholme. There is enough evidence for this, both from comments on thottbot  and from pictures / videos from that period. 
---
But in total only about 20 mobs.

Very true. I'm just saying, I really like some of the systems and the way the classes worked in DAoC and wish i could play a more modern/updated version of the game. Like a remaster or something.
---
Just clarifying what they are doing since you can’t watch :) 
---
Video 1 is him duoing it with a rogue, while vid 2+3 are solo, but they make it very clear you need to get lucky with the boss add being a mage (1/3 chance) to be able to solo it
---
Still a very interesting farm, while not as lucrative as the older videos says (as with most of dm)
---
Who care
---
Thanks, quite valuable information. 
---
Additionally, can the first hit trigger both effects for a triple attack?
---
It's not
---
It's the weapon skill that makes the difference here. If you are level 60 40% of all your white hits will be glancing blows against level 63 targets. That means that 40% of all your white attacks will deal reduced damage. Although the probability of glancing blows cannot be modified, the penalty of glancing blows is affected by weapon skill. It’s worth noting that glancing blows cannot be critical hits. At 300 weapon skill the glancing blow penalty is 35%, at 305 it’s 15% and at 307 (with Edgemaster’s) it’s 7%. In practical terms that means that 40% of all your white hits will deal 65%, 85% and 93% damage compared to a normal hit respectively.
---
Finally weapon skill reduces the probability your target dodges by 0.1% per point of weapon skill against a higher level target, up to 315. At 300 weapon skill your target will dodge 6.5% of your attacks, at 305 he will dodge 6% of your attacks and at 315 skill he would dodge just 5% of your attacks. A mob’s block chance will never exceed 5%.
---
What level are you? A couple of levels after WC (and after getting that sweet sword) leveling started to be super easy for me. Now that I've got blade flurry or whatever its called it's even easier, basically letting me pull 2 mobs at the same time.
---
Gear matters a lot, first aid is awesome to not have to wait an eat every time.
---
Also after getting vanish you get a almost 100% guaranteed get out of jail card.
---
jesus. the fact that that sword can be that good all the way til 52+ is insane. makes sense though. I wonder at what point it falls off? 60?
---
1 crystal per run is insane..  I just staryed doing my jump runs and am 0 for 10 so far. Had a friend report last week he got 6 crystals in 5 runs.
---
looks like about 80%

plus, FB drains your energy, so you have to be a little careful with that (i.e. use it when you have as close to 35 energy as possible)
---
It is a great addon but my God was it ugly and convoluted before I changed nearly every single setting.
---
Demonslayer?
---
My first character in vanilla was a warrior and I got him all the way to 60. Decided to try a rogue out almost immediately after that and never looked back. Played rogue until I stopped playing BfA. Stealth is just too fun, especially when world pvp is as big as it is in classic.
---
yes it is, put that puts the orc stun resistance in a whole other perspective. Stun resist ist only that much better if any class has a stun (e.g. grenades). Thats my humble opinion

Lok’thar brother! I bought that 49” ultra wide Samsung. Game changer.
---
Ratail lul
---
Keybinds existed even if you didnt know or use em back then my dude.
---
I figure you did MC + Ony back 2 back then? :D
---
Because Ragnaros only deal Fire Damage. Armor being irrelevant against him, only fire resist and hp counts, and bear druids are the best in this regard, because they can take fire-resistance focused gear while having a shiton of hp (and evevn keeping a lot of armor, making them able to tank onyxia with ease)
---
fuck off !
---
True. I'll give the video a watch at home and see if perhaps it might be different for trolls. I suppose it all comes back to just who has more quests in the world, and trolls *are* certainly numerous and have many quests. Truthfully though I am honestly doubtful, getting to exalted requires a really giant amount of rep. The other guy (who had the benefit of +10% rep gains for being human) still had to turn in 250 stacks of runecloth if I recall correctly.
---
But, I could be entirely wrong, I've yet to watch the video :p
---
I hate this HS, because its pretty much mandatory
---
Last two bosses of MC then we all decided to down ONY as well
---
Not sure if this exists. You could search YouTube for dungeon name + shortcuts / skips and probably learn a lot.
---
For when to use LoS and what classes to use for optimal efficiency, you probably learn that from running the dungeons and learning what mobs do. I also think wowhead does a good job at describing different (notable) mob abilities.
---
LoS pulls efficient whenever there are ranged mobs and spellcasters, generally speaking. 
---
Comp would be any classes that can counter said mob types with appropriate CC/abilities - be it silence, sheep, shackle, AoE burst etc etc.
---

Heey what is that toolitip showing at cursor location addon?
---
IKR
---
My "fellow" players :(
---
Your ignorance knows no bounds I see.
---
Before judging, ask where the MT got his FR gear from. I'd guess the guild bank funded it since it's really expensive.
---
Yes I regret, I regret the choice of my facial hair.
---
impressive ,i cannot focus on same career at all time.
---
To keep up with OPs retoric: Hyperbole is a fraction of how good an objective argument is.
---
Most of the zones you mention that "alliance has a fraction of the amount of quests that horde has" when in reality its like 32-35
---
Too much responsibility. DPS going ham on DPS immediately. They get gear fast because they don't ever have to wait for dungeons. A lot of the first tanks to hit 60 have their gear. Only 2 classes can tank on Horde, I would argue that shamans can pull it off but has bad stigma.
---
&gt; and if you're going to change the game mechanics a ton, is it still Classic? 
---
And even if *everyone* was on board with changes, we'd all be arguing about what to change and how to go about it.
---
Do we need to improve the levelling experience; add more raids; balance classes in end-game; add dual spec or revamp the PVP system?
---
No matter how perfectly balanced and considered. Any change that blizzard makes will take the game in a direction that will be disagreeable to some players.
---
Wait, does that mean Taurens also can't ride the Black War Raptor since it requires Raptor Riding?
---
How is it fun to share these types of posts? Did no one in-game congratulate you for finding a BoE or something?
---
I swear this sub has turned into /r/classiccirclejerk since release.
---
If you're evading guards by abusing terrain it's punishable.
---
I quested through wetlands and so obviously had Menethil Bay as my FP, then when I'd moved on I realised how awesome and handy it is
---
you are a loser
---
haha oh wow - yeah I'm talking about a totally different server. See my edit.
---
I see it from both sides all the time on this subreddit and it's so annoying. So many comments that say "Why does [enemy faction] always gank 5v1?!?" Or "Ganking lowbies, must be [enemy faction]. I can kinda see venting on reddit about ganks helps people feel better, but those comments just come off as pathetic to their own faction.
---
I'm a mage and people keep recommending I get decursive.  I google "decursive classic wow" and all three top results give me fatal errors every time I load the UI. 
---
"Your world of warcraft client version (11302) is too old to run this version of decursive.
---
You need to install an older version of decursive."
---
and the addon hasn't been updated since early september. I can't find any other versions and everyone else says it works fine for them, what gives? 
---
The version I have's zip file was named Decursive-2.7.6.4, and in the addon menu it says  Decursive -Ace 3-
---
nice! ok, now to find out how much it costs XD
---
You're right. My bad.

Joining the question
---
&lt;Extreme Anglers&gt; is looking for Mature players and guilds to raid with!
---
**&lt;Extreme Anglers&gt; | US PVE Pagle| Alliance | NA |**
---
**Intro**: Extreme Anglers is a guild of Vanilla WoW and MMO veterans. We’ve come back for Classic and we’re interested in expanding our regular raid/dungeon/social team. WoW Classic brings back the social and community aspect to MMO’s, and we’re looking for individuals (and guilds, see below) that appreciate that.
---
**Who are we recruiting?**
---
Many of us are Parents, have significant others, or otherwise have serious competition for our free time. We respect and appreciate that WoW doesn’t come first, but we’re looking for people that are excited to experience all WoW has to offer. Mature adults that value community will have a great home here.
---
**What classes are we looking for?**
---
We have openings for every class, but we are particularly interested in Rogues, Hunters, Druids and Paladins.
---
***Raid Schedule:***
---
Raids will begin mid November or early December. Our targeted days are Wednesdays and Sunday from 9:30pm to 12:30am Eastern Time.
---
In the meantime we encourage people to reach out and run a dungeon with us!
---
Loot will be a modified DKP/Loot Council.
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/qfs8kfU . Feel free to ask any questions/contact us in discord. Or in game on Frosted (GM), Egnatius, Therob or Everrest (Officers)
---
*Additional Note:* If you’re part of the leadership of a small guild and have a similar mindset, please do reach out! We’re looking for other guilds to join forces with. We get the feeling that there are plenty of small guilds out there who are considering their endgame options, and we’d love to combine and grow into something that can better appreciate endgame in classic. We are already a part of a small coalition of guilds and we’d love to help expand that pool of capable and mature players.
---
You're so funny o m g .
---
The chunck of Mara after teleporting still takes like 30 minutes with a normal group of 47s-50s.
---
I doubt it. TBC already brought most of the things I hate about retail WoW with it. I don't think it's just me either, judging how popular Classic is. 
---
If Classic remains popular after phase 6, classic+ could be done in the spirit of the old game. Not like some posters above are saying. New content doesn't need to give better loot than Naxx. but side-grades instead, need say, frost resistance gear or holy resistance which isn't used much in Classic. 
---
Also it could give new spell books, things like change hunters min range to 4y instead of 5, new rank of water or new teleports for mages, or +1s to frost nova and so on. It could also drop new crafting recipes, new legendaries with long quest lines for all the classes.
---
Why not? Eye of div and T2 helms drop all the time. It's completely feasible. Also I don't see the problem with getting several pieces in one night if it's a DKP based system for example.
---
If they really start banning people for avoiding guards like in my example (in Ogrimmar) with no terrain exploiting then private servers will become popular again. I'll be certain to run straight to some guards so I'm not breaking the rules after killing someone in Org lol. 
---
Also one GM's response =/= the rules. This is like saying because a customer service rep at Comcast told you something it must be true. Customer service reps for all companies say inaccurate things and mispeak all the time. They're in a low level position they don't make the rules.
---
The grind is driving you cray.
---
it's most likely pseudo RNG, as it often is. often you use a seed to "randomly" generate a sequence of seemingly random numbers, meaning if you know the function and the seed, you know which numbers will come up next.
---
true RNG is throwing a physical dice, or picking out a physical card, in real life, since there are no functions and seeds that have already predetermined the outcome.
---
And that's fine for you. But maybe other people enjoy different things. Clearly they had a blast, hell one of the people on the run showed up in the comments and said it was his best worst run. 
---
They enjoyed their company, sometimes its about the journey and not the destination. Hard to fault them if they all had fun, it's a game after all
---
Oh whoops, you are totally right - somehow I envisioned multiple attacks, ty
---
I spent 0 gold, you should get some connections. hehe
---
The Undercity Elevators have a killcount.
---
Don’t join horde, specifically undead
---
We've started giving sinews to random people since every hunter already has it. Sorry m8. But then again I think we've done 45+ onyxia's in total across all split raids.
---
I second Grid2. High degree of customization and very minimalistic yet informative - and quite small and non-intrusive. There is also a quite decent how to/conf guide on murlocparliament.com (? .it / .org ? Can't recall). I pair it with Shadowed unit frames (SUF) for basic unit frames and installed HealComm since it is supposed to improve the heal predict feature between various UIs in raids.
---
Yeah, but it is still waaaay faster than 7 runs in 24h played... I did it many times with 47-52 or so groups.
---
Tinfoil hate is on!
---
In the sidebar between the subcounter and the discord logo/link is where you can change your flair.
---
This! My buddy and i wanted a tank and a healer. But now im unable to farm and unable to find a group without him.....  healbot priests are not very much in demand....
---
NA East - Horde - Incendius 
---
Guild name: Gary
---
We are an elite guild of Gary’s. Our clan name is just that; Gary. We semi-competitively play, help each other when needed, and have a few core members that play 12-16 hours a day, and are looking to up that core number. If you’re a grinder, looking for a relaxed but at times serious &amp; helpful organization, look no further. You’ve found home.
---
My in game name on Incendius is Garycoleman. Come join us, fellow Gary.

Nahelys Warlock lvl 60 currently farming pre-bis.
---
Since i'm living in asia I'm looking for a guild who raid during daytime (8am-5pm server time) any day of the week.
---
Don't hesitate to whisper me in game for a talk.
---
Guild Name: Sociopath
---
Server: Herod
---
Focus: PVE/PVP
---
Contact Info: https://discord.gg/XMc47uj or DM In game/discord message: Cobra, Justrun or Sythus
---
Raid times: Wed/Thurs 7-10 East (server time)
---
Current Recruit Needs:   Recruiting all classes for raiding and anyone interested in a laidback/friendly guild. Raiders who can attend as close to 100% of the time and people who genuinely enjoy raiding are most encouraged to join.
---
About Us: What up!!! We’re a group of cool people looking for other cool people to come hang out in our guild. Nothing sexual. We are targeting a Nov 5th start date for raiding and need a few more members to fill our spots.  We’ve got a nice community of level 60’s and high 50s currently farming pre-bis and are more than happy to help people gear, however if you’re enjoying the journey and want to take your time we strongly welcome that too! We will also have an active PVP community come phase 2&amp;3. Again, nothing sexual.
---
Feel free to dm with any questions/concerns! I’ll be happy to answer all questions.
---
What do you mean? a cast sequence macro?
---
True on that front.  Plus the drop rates are pretty good.  Inhad ring, 2h mace, allnplate in like 6 runs.
---
There's a very easy way to fix this issue. Play on PVE server ;)
---
The catch is though if you were efficient you could often beat the hour cooldown just by running, not to mention the amount of times I had to go to a different zone for a turn-in or pickup.
---
Gotta time those frostbolts right.
---
I don't think this is even possible. 32 Black Lotus in 3 days. They spawn 1 at a time in each zones with an hour between. You could get 32 lotus in 32 hours if all you did was travel from zone to zone and you found each spawn in each zone.
---
They play a couple hours every weekend? Dang, where do they find the time?
---
TSM just doesn't seem worth the effort if you're already good at auctioning and reading the market.
---
I just want something that puts things up at reasonable undercuts and sometimes if supply is high 1c undercuts won't cut it if you plan on the items selling without losing massive profits from expirations.
---
Rend bracers have hit which are useless. Use Sadist or Gordok.
---
Drak belt same thing. Use the one from the quest instead.
---
Yeah, the barrens is the only zone I can think of where u can go from like 11-23 or even 24 in quests
---
No one care
---
That just confirms Karatag's point
---
If you were after Dal'rends as an orc, you're fucking stupid.
---
It's best not to have Charge and Intercept on the same key.
---
You are misinformed. Any spot with guards, where guards can't reach you, are bannable - it counts as a terrain exploit.
---
yes exactly
---
Lol.
---
You obviously have never hunted lotus in classic.
---
Tried messing with the filters, but couldn't get it to show debuffs applied by other players to show. For some reason removing filters made my own debuffs disappear from the target as well.
---
Yeah at this point melee shouldn't bother trying to get it since DMT is straight up better (albeit only slightly for warriors).

---
Devouring plague word cannibalise and touch of weakness for an extra shadow stack vs a zerk
---
I think a LC+Roll system is the most fair. Prevents people from taking items they don't need, prevents people from stacking DKP and eliminates any potential corruption a LC could have as everyone who needs the loot would roll against eachother. 
---
 A loot council is needed to some extent, depending on what the goal of your guild is. If your guild advertises itself as a "PvP guild" it makes sense to have a loot council that decides who can roll for what, so rogues can get their 1-handers before the warriors because warriors don't use them for PvP.  
---
Classic content is easy, so funneling gear isn't necessary, so the loot council should focus more on what class gets to roll on what items (melee prio on ony head, etc). They should also focus on punishing players, for example if Billy is late a couple of raids in a row, causing his entire team to have to wait for him, he should be exempt from loot for 1 week of raiding.
---
Okay then I see.
---
TLDR: still a loser after an entire decade
---
Totally.
---
I rolled a mage because that was my main in vanilla. Turns out everyone else rolled a mage too.
---
Gooooooood luck getting groups. Or winning rolls in groups (welcome to 3 x mage dps parties - but don't worry because the healer will also roll - "I'm shadow"/"I'm ele"/"I'm balance").
---
Maybe you should quit browsing /new if you get triggered so easily.
---
This is my first post on this sub.. I can't share a moment like this? I'm new to WoW entirely I had no idea this was a sin..

If i could flair this "classiccirclejerk"  as an edit i would do it just for you &lt;3 I hope your luck improves!

Unfortunately "walk in a bit" isn't enough. I've seen so many people say "nah, didn't find him" when they really didn't go far enough to be able to catch him.
---
I tell people to go right up to the UBRS door, and target from there. Works pretty much every time.

I don't manage anything, but my officers use it. If you're asking about any technicalities, no idea how comfortable the addon is to use. If you're asking about people being biased when distributing loot while telling you it's for the greater good to make sure you follow an optimal curve while advancing as a guild, I'll have to remind everyone that people are clearing the current raids in green gear with little to no wipes.
---
There are tons of priests at 60, can confirm.
---
lets say you have 4000 hp. If you get crit once its like you had 4120 hp. Or an extra 12 stamina. twice, 4240 or 24 extra stamina. Its not awful. And the choice is between that and spending those 3 points in improved battle shout. Depends what you think is more useful. More survivability or 20 extra AP in improved battle shout.
---
Oh poor you. Classic is always about watching and reacting to market. Wherever it's devilsaurs, essences or whatnot there is only a limited opportuinity window after which you should move on.
---
IIRC Night elf priests can shadowmeld at the top of freewind outside the aggro range of the guards.
---
Wait for someone to come up and send em right back down
---
DMT ring is better than Mara ring so you can skip Mara all together actually
---
Oh my epenid
---
Hey. I let you know, I am combat dagger specced, dinged lvl 60 yesturday with 50% pre-bis, joined MC raid and was top #2 dmg dealer for half the fights over several rogue players/warriors with dual rend swords and full pre-bis. I use 2 BoE daggers at 3.7 dps with slow mainhand and fast offhand. I have 50%+ crit on backstab and do a lot of 1.3k crits in MC. A full dagger rogue WILL out-dps sword rogue, depending on the targets (I just proved that, and of course did a shitload of screenshots for proof). I also stomp people in PvP with ambush and backstabs while other rogues spam strikes with swords and hoping for a crit that really can't match my crit-chances with backstab at all. PS: before you gonna say "the must have sucked then since you did so high dmg", I hold over 400 dps for most of the fights. No mage or hunter can do that over time. Thank god for energy, eh?
---
Such a good early hit chance too with the set bonus, you’re gonna be a beast in dungeons
---
That's probably a temporarily inflated price for blue sapphire, which should probably be more in the 10-15g range.  However, the arcanite is about right.  I haven't sole an arcanite bar for less than 50g since DM dropped.
---
Because they are two different groups of players where one group made a choice to be subject to world PvP since release, and the other group for the most part opted out of PvP
---
If it makes you feel better as a horde i also usually repair at nessingwarys camp since its usually closer to the quests than grom'gol
---
Your English is terrible.
---
I rolled a Hunter, and I like playing it in raids, but I hate it for solo content / farming. Rolling a mage now for those things.
---
Mages won't top meters past molten core. Warriors will be top DPS as soon as they get gear.
---
I think he/she is aware its a world drop, probly like me just curious of WHICH mob.
---
Terrain yes. Attacking a player where there is no guards is not. Go back to retail.
---
Mine dropped twice so far.
---
Both times, shamans in my guild rolled on it and won it. 
---
Sure, they've got eye of the beast and the shaman class trinket (DM book) is 10 fr/23 dmg, but why not, right?
---
Non dwarf priest, gross.
---
Lol what?
---
I unerstood that reference.
---
its probably the dungeon / raid / party settings somehow, then. Not quite sure how it works, but i know i can see other players debuffs in raids through the default settings.
---
Way easier for everyone to drop 15g on fire resist pots each raid than have everyone collect fire resist pieces, deal way less damage because they're wearing bad gear and still end up needing the potions because the lack of DPS makes the fight drag.
---
You’re wrong. Only abusing roofs so that guards evade is considered abusing. You can LOS guards, that’s perfectly fine.
---
Okay. That makes sense. Its Fire Resi Gear. I thought you were talking about general pre-raid BiS. I wont have too much time to grind dungeons, so I am always looking out for easy to get gear that is almost as good as the "best" stuff.
---
That's funny, cause after people answered me, I checked my healer set, and it uses that same cloak.
---
Got it the other day but my 2nd 60 will need it so i can start the fun again
---
Definitely the first thing that came to my mind lol
---
Less agi on new weapon?
---
The issue is that Ashenvale's proximity to Orgrimmar tends to make it Horde-dominated.  As an Alliance player, I never go to Ashenvale to level.  It's not worth the risk.
---
I had an uninteresting exchange with someone once too.
---
Unpopular opinion: Although I may die 5v1 occasionally, it’s more thrilling knowing I always have alliance to pvp against.
---
Did you figure out how to setup grid2 to for example show who in your raid doesnt have stamina buff? I can figure it out for just Power Word: Fortitude for example, but since there are two buffs (PW:F and Prayer of Fortitude) I just cant figure it out.
---
whup whup
---
I don't regret rolling a Warrior. I wanted to DPS but got somewhat coerced into tanking and now I'm also organising and leading raids. Got both bindings in 3 weeks. It's been quite good. I wish I could just be the warrior tank and I wouldn't have to lead raids and organise so much though. Feels like an office job.
---
I was just projecting my own insecurities onto you because I myself, don’t shop their D,:
---
Have you leveled your polearm weapon skill yet?
---
Rogue dagger spec is best in terms of single target dps, sword spec is better for leveling.
---
Wasnt very fun as a druid flying 15 min from Moonglade to Thunder Bluff over and over at low lvls rather than the short flight from Moonglade to Darnassus/Darkshore.
---
Redridge is heaven....so many (kill) quests. Same with Duskwood. Loch Modan is a bit spread out with little hubs and lot of running around the lake unfortunately.
---
Had to hearth and start back at hammerfall...
---
Anyone have a good Druid Mana Bar Weak Aura? I've tried a couple from wago... but they don't seem to load. Maybe b/c I'm also running ElvUI?
---
You realize you have 2 rings right
---
If you mouse over a macro by default it will just show you the name of the macroputting in #showtooltip has it show the tooltip for the spell you write in instead - so you see the name of the spell, the mana cost etc.
---
Usually you pair this with the ? Macro icon and then the game is smart enough to also show the correct icon for the spell. That way of you make macros with weird scripts, or with multiple spells, you can still make it show you it's tooltip, cooldown, icon etc.
---
I made a post for this question:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dl3od0/for\_anyone\_with\_the\_question\_how\_much\_is\_my\_boe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dl3od0/for_anyone_with_the_question_how_much_is_my_boe/)
---
No, it’s not even against the rules. Ignore anyone saying so. The only thing that IS agains the rules is when guards are in range but can’t reach you (roofs etc.). Ranging guards is not an “exploit” and isn’t against the rules.
---
Zperl if im not mistaken
---
Interesting right before release I thought someone confirmed it does work against grenades.
---
I'd like to alt a healer basically to pocket heal battlegrounds down the road. I was sold on UD Priest but are there better horde options? I just want to enable someone to win stupid fights they shouldn't.
---
Makes sense. So the limit would be how many mobs you can pull and survive. Probably still real good in Ony and speed runs then. Pretty crazy.
---
I don't know about the history of the weapon and if it changed during any vanilla patches, but I played a warrior for most of vanilla and don't ever remember people taking advantage of it. IDK if it's a late-vanilla version or what, but IDK why I don't remember anyone using it long after SM. Maybe we were all just real dumb back then.
---
I mean. It's not my screenshot but if the numbers are feasible, why isn't it classic? I definitely 1000% out dps the warlock in the meter.
---
Lance represent!
---
Till you play with game sounds. They're un bearable, I wish I had money rn to finish my darnassus rep and then epic mount.
---
I want to know this as well. I already disabled glow and reduced the lighting and gamma but its nowhere as dark as in that screenshot. I love the athmosphere that darkness provides but i cant get it to work. It's frustrating :(((
---
That's such a raw swedish accent lol.
---
Do you have the exact same weapon skill for 2h Axes and Polearms? This is probably the reason for the missing crit :)
---
one is just butthurt that you did not get the item.
---
Let this person enjoy sharing their epic Drop with those in a community based around the game we all enjoy, you know a place where we can share experiences and hype around good or bad things that happen in game for us.
---
Shaman here, so afraid not! I just make sure my totems are down on the ground.
---
I think there's "Buffwatch" or a similar add-on for this though. I guess you want to track Renew and Weakened Soul though, as well as everything (important) you can dispel.
---
Engineering is a pvp and a minmax pve profession. 
---
If you farm maraudon princess solo, herbalism could still net you a decent amount of gold with ghost mushrooms.
---
English is not my native language and I’m done with higher education, something you don’t have, else you would understand that most people don’t speak English as their primary language. I am also reflective enough to know my English is not the best but it is far from bad. Your life sucks, in case you haven’t figured that out yet.
---
900 DPS in tbc as a hunter is quite bad.
---
Complete opposite of pointless. But whatever
---
Gratz. What's the addon the gives you the market price?
---
This reminds me I never did get the Whirlwind weapon quest done ...
---
Yeah hopefully it gets serious later and we will need to assign people to tanks and try at least a bit in raids.
---
You realize that Elven Tarnished Ring is A. Not unique and B. Most BiS lists will suggest a Hit ring and a Crit ring.
---
Casting rank 7 doubt
---
It's actually boring...You do GR once at level appropiate and you never have to upgrade your pants up to 60 :D
---
Feral druids get their bis weapon in there even.
---
And btw nice vanish while faerie fired. ;P
---
Classic tooltips aren't known for consistency, as they don't differentiate between **Incapacitation** and **Stun** mechanics clearly enough.
---
According to Wowhead.com, [Iron Grenades](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4068/iron-grenade) apply a stun aura but use the incapacitate mechanic. This is very similar to what [Gouge](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1776/gouge) and [Repentance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20066/repentance) do. Yet, both Gouge and Repentance debuffs clearly let the target know that it is, in fact, *'Incapacitated.'*, while the Iron Grenade debuff reads *'Stunned.'* with the annotation that *'Any damage will break the effect.'*
---
+1. Best part about dps feral is that it allows for some insane clutch plays every now and then, b-rezing the healer, taking over the tanking and kiting the last few mobs till they die. Feels really fucking good.
---
I think it is. 
---
Pretty sure I skipped to the Wetlands from the Dwarf zone and then flew to IF.
---
I think you're just trash.
---
So, you are saying that you want my HS to a place where I go once a week for 2 hours (and can actually be summoned more often than not), rather than the place I go to for solo-farming 4-7 days a week, possibly multiple times per day?
---
Haha okay bud, keep telling yourself that to make yourself feel better 😂
---
Have a good one ✌🏻
---
You're not filthy, homie
---
No one wants the headache or the blame for a wipe I'm guessing. Even if it's not the tanks fault, it's seen as the tanks fault.
---
So solo is not really worth it to farm gold, still decent if you wanna farm the gear.
---
But I guess with a decent duo setup you can both earn almost as much as hunters, since you are just faster and get more runs in per hour.
---
I'm 52 now. been sword the whole way so far, but as soon as I get a pair of good daggers I'm gonna re-spec. This was my first sword rogue and it definitely made things easier, but its just not nearly as fun as a dagger rogue
---
Theres a huge fucking difference between that and sitting in blind spots in bizzaro locations, lol.
---
I clicked on the post because I care.
---
Transmogging
---
NeatPlates does it.
---
Imagine taking the time to make a reddit post flaming a few people who killed you in a video game on a pvp server that you chose to play on yourself knowing the implications.
---
If you don't already have one, this is time to build your altar to the RNG Gods. They demand the altar as compensation for their blessings upon you. You must also spread the gospel of RNGesus.
---
 
---
My brothers and sisters, harken to me. In the times when your polymorphed avatar meanders aimlessly and the pyroblast is casting.
---
RNGesus hear our prayer.
---
In the times when the Tauren tires from his 327th Stratholme run for that damn mount.
---
In the times when you and the Warrior bearing down on you are low on health and you need to use Gnomish Death Ray
---
Our Lord, you are the hand of fate. You create the Freezing Band and deliver it to those in need of expert riding skills. You give us the Windflurry proc on the cloth wearers and the resist to the Fear.
---
You giveth and you taketh away.
---
And so in our darkest times and our weekly Molten Core, we beseech you, we beg you, we cannot *live* without you. We prostrate ourselves in humility. You are the Alpha and Omega. The left and right Bindings of the Windseeker.
---
You are all we need.
---
Go forth now, brothers and sisters. Preach the Gospel of the Church of RNGesus.
---
Go forth with this blessing:
---
May RNGesus forever guide the Teebu's Blazing Longsword to your chest.
---
\*Modified with credit to /u/AirDrawnDagger\*
---
I figured out everything for dispelling, renew and Weakened Soul just cant figure out how to set it up for a simple task "who needs stamina buff" because there are two buffs. I will check out the addon you suggested.
---
Baja here too...
---
I’ve been clearing MC+ony as 30/0/21 since I got 60. Just be grouped with melee and down-rank CH. HW is only used for a couple bosses and is still viable even with +0,5s cast.
---
As long as 1-2 other shamans got mana tide you really don’t need it when progressing. 
---
Also, many of the ”healing” items are pretty much bis for ele PVP, such as T2 head/legs, aurastone hammer, rag shield, T1 chest/bracers/gloves etc.
---
0 gold respec cost. All content on farm and a beast in PVP.
---
No you dont
---
Congrats! That was a good day :D
---
Yeah ill eventually get Krol itson my list after finishing up last hit for epic mount and onlya few remaining mats for Lionheart recipe. I also have come to love Thrashblade especially with HoJ. Can't imagine what its like to have WF ontop of those items. Sounds wild!
---
Thanks! In my understanding this numbers doesn't reflect scaling and stats, so I wander if they are accurate.
---
Interface -&gt; display -&gt; numerical value
---
Or something like that, those are vanilla settings and are most likelu not found in the addon setting.
---
Or you're just bad. I use details.
---
No mana for that left...
---
I see. Makes sense now. Thank you!
---
Yeah, playing Horde you have quests of killing peaceful Alliance members, like Dryads and Nelfs in Ashenvale, farmers in Hillsbrad\Arati Highlands, Theramore guards and Explorer League dwarfs in Barrens.   
---
Playing Alliance you have quests of killing Gnolls, bandits, demonic-controlled Orks in Redridge, crazy orcs from Twilight Hammer, etc.
---
And then people are surprised why Horde is so aggressive. Because they where taught to kill any human\nelf\dwarf on sigh from the beginning)
---
Ouch... Did you level as Holy?
---
They have moved on because they grew up unlike you
---
Is wild heart good for tanks; just asking because we recently had a boom kin:Resto quit the guild cause our bear boy took the t1 chest
---
Go on the twitch app &amp; search for "lfg", there are a bunch :)
---
Are you using LFG addon and if yes which one?
---
Why not simply play Tetris then
---
Barrens is also the 2nd zone for tauren, trolls and orcs. Horde only has 2 2nd zones while alliance has 3.
---
You can also do Darkshore+Wetlands, Loch Modan+Wetlands or Westfall+Redridge.
---
Horde barely have any low 20s quests in Ashenvale and a lot of quests in Stonetalon and Hillsbrad are obsolete due to horde spending so much time in Barrens.
---
Pretty easy to get into on the Phoenix server.  It is based on a classic ruleset but with some qol changes like a little faster leveling and easier/cheaper to build templates because of all the random drop gear.  The PvP system is the only reason people play DAOC.  Very fun.  
---
I can't speak much to the live servers, haven't played on retail in a number of years.
---
This, lol.
---
Healbot
---
To be fair, all they had to do was release an old version of a game and add support for modern hardware.
---
That's min-maxing, hence my original comment. Nothing wrong with it.
---
The only thing I didn't like about BC was the instant gear upgrades.  As a priest, I worked my ass for Benediction - only to get a quest reward that surpassed it by level 61.  A legendary shouldn't be replaced that easily.
---
Gz, and addon name pls
---
Anyone that says trinket doesn't know what they're talking about. Neck is the only choice.
---
Yeah i heard they are very rare. I might just bite the bullet and get it over with. Still trying to get into a raid group so this item will help me stand out a bit at least.
---
Another one of these "im playing on an old school computer" post huh?
---
&gt;Because of the population size alone. No other server even comes close to the same experience.
---
Seems Gehennas is way more populated if you look at those queue times.
---
It's a decent offhand, but you can just go into DM and get Distracting Dagger which is better.
---
"Spec the way that benefits me for the 2.5 hrs a week we play together, so i dont have to bring consumables"
---
Supreme logic.
---
YA, the latter steps of the Ashenvale chains are all "run to the utmost corner where no other quest hub is located, do something and run all the frikkin' way back"  for a lousy xp ratio compared to running time and even lousier rewards"
---
Im more surprised he was able to get the name Carlos every time
---
Just have to wait for content to catch up to itemization/class revamps.  So ~aq40 ish.
---
imagine pugging as a warrior lmao
---
@OP join a guild, warrior is not for solo play
---
It could be a macro, but who am i to ask you to use your brains
---
I can have fun no matter what in this game. Pvp and gold farming is my end game besides raids now since I have all my gear from dungeons. It feels good to log on now and just be able to do what I feel like instead of feeling the need to run certain dungeons for gear. Now I log on when I feel like, farm some mobs or do a few mining runs or maybe find some people to slay on blackrock mountain.
---
Rolled a priest because I like PvP. phase 2 will be fun.
---
Right. I bathed today.
---
If you are saying some positions where guards in a city don't attack you are permissible within the rules, you are wrong.
---
Got my tabart on first run :D
---
You can do that w a cast sequence macro
---
To all the peeps sayin this is not an exploit (cause they are probably abusing it) : I'll report and have everyone there of my same faction report you as well, everytime and anyway.
---
Let the GM decide that :)
---
Bahaha, nah we just laughing at you.
---
This is a very skewed view. Zones that have 'a ton' of horde quests but only a few alliance quest are put in emphasis but zones that have no horde quests at all (wetlands, duskwood, redridge) are swept under the rug. And I dont consider the amount of quests in many locations 'a ton'.
---
And questshub placement is questionable as well. Desolace horde hub is horribly placed for example. You have to run across the whole map to access it.
---
As a feral druid, I can not relate.
---
Was better before DM was released. All the dedicated ferals have it,  and Maul out of DM tribute is mostly as good
---
Still a nice pickup though
---
This is correct. I grinded to rank 11 and bought 2 rank 11 mounts (a horse and a cat), however could not ride the cat until I made enough goddamn morrowgrain (and troll ears? in AV?) to get Nightsaber riding. (did they always have the runecloth turn in thing? I don't remember that in vanilla.)
---
I get the logic behind this, but, honestly it just seems like warriors dont do pug dungeons. On my server they are the most popular class by a lot, yet they are nowhere to be seen when looking for dungeon groups. It takes forever to find a tank, sometimes so long that the group fails to form, but I also have almost never had a warrior that wanted to dps either.
---
&gt;I think the average playerbase is around 45 now
---
lmao
---
Any druids have a favorite mana bar Weak Aura? I'm running ElvUI if it matters (ie. it needn't connect with my "normal" character frame).
---
GJ, challenging them is nice to see.
---
I would say priest is your best option for this. On horde, psychic scream is more effective at defending yourself. Priest has the best variety of heals for every occasion and a ton of support spells. Mana burn to drain enemy healers is very nice.
---
Shaman is more offensive, with only offensive dispels so the person you are supporting can get CCd easier, or you have to get closer for things like grounding totem but that makes you vulnerable or they just smack the totem.
---
Druid has more variety but IMO the least potential to turn someone into a wrecking ball. Although I think their healing options are better than shaman, their other supporting options are worse.
---
&gt; true RNG is throwing a physical dice, or picking out a physical card, in real life, since there are no functions and seeds that have already predetermined the outcome.
---
this is debatable
---
But this is much much more attainable so the easy choice for people who don’t have a lot of money
---
Scared?
---
I’m sorry but you are not doing 800 dps regularly as a lock rn unless you’re game is broken and you’re getting nightfall procs every tick of corruption or some bs
---
This is prob gonna piss people off but yeah I got mine on my first UBRS run. ;s It was also the same with the Archvist Cape of Shadow Wrath. I'm been so lucky it's disgusting, but it has balanced out, I rolled 4 on a mageblade.
---
TipTac addon i think
---
Mouseover heals/dispel are two great examples for priests to have macros.
---
Looks like hes a tank. Pretty common. Tanks are rare and groups make the role fucking suck.
---
Ahh I remember that fight. That was hella fun.
---
Scrolling Loot Text
---
To add to this post, you can indeed use curse of recklessness (rank 1 to preserve mana) to stop mobs from fleeing. It helps a lot in places like SM, BRD,..
---
Only problem is when you need something within the hour.
---
Bank alts are great for selling on the AH. Less so for buying, which I do much more frequently
---
Hard disagree on a "dank rp set".
---
I wouldn't take anyone seriously on an rp server running with those two.
---
Krol seems to be around 300g on many realms, farming dm jump runs you can pretty consistently get at leeeaaaast 50g/h. Playing 6 hours in a day (weekend) shouldn't be a problem unless you have kids or something.
---
At level 38 or so I tried soloing scarlet monastery trash in the library.  I was able to do it, but it wasn't efficient at all and it was a waste of time.  I'm not sure what you're expecting in the way of soloing relevant dungeons with your hunter, but the tricks in Dire Maul and Maraudon are due to the physical layout of those places so they're unique.  As a 60 hunter with decent gear you can do these things, but not so much as a leveling hunter.  You could probably go into Wailing caverns at level 30 or so, and clear thorough there, if that's the kind of thing you're talking about.
---
This might be unpopular but fd+trap is actually much less buggy than before.
---
Strange
---
This guy's fun at parties.
---
Hell yeah
---
This is solid gold. As are the comments good info with a good laugh.
---
I went back to SM last night to farm a ravager simply to boost my alt. Can't beat ravager AoE when pulling alot of mobs. Well, you can but it costs more (oil / crystals/ Engineering items)
---
Easy access to grom gol for undercity and orgrimmar.
---
Easy access to BRD LBRS UBRS MC easy to get to Strat and scholo, the only thing it’s not near is DM
---
I got one from a heavy Junk box last night still shaking
---
People who want to go farm mining will go do DME jump runs: that's much better gold per hour income than circling thorium spots on well-populated server even with 1-2 layers added.
---
Hm I do via addon but I will try again, maybe I got something wrong. Thanks
---
Im orc, so no.
---
If you're going to drop LW, absolutely do not bother with leveling it any further.
---
Good luck.
---
“You re not efrective” of. Youre not; if you spend that low time; if you spend lot fo time in wow; reward is you become more effective in everything u do in that game
---
Agreed, only reason I bought epic gnome mount is because I couldn't be arsed to grind/buy more runecloth without having an epic mount lol
---
Actually, druid tanks have a really easy time getting gear since you have near-zero competition for your best items---So much so that a lot of good guilds run a feral tank in place of yet another warrior since it means they get 3~4 fully geared tanks faster than if they were all warriors
---
For example, the trinkets you will be using until the servers shut down are both currently in the game and can be obtained without RNG and without loot competition
---
First is Mark of Tyranny which comes from the UBRS quest to kill Rend and the second is the Smoking Heart of the Mountain which comes from Rend.
---
Your best defense weapon is the Warden Staff which is the BoE epic staff with armor and Defense and your best threat weapon is a bag full of Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomeregan
---
And then most of your best armor pieces are random pieces of leather that no one else can make use of in any meaningful fashion.
---
Use it on the Mage and have him try to Blink out of the effect to see if it counts as a stun or not.

&gt;BLasted Lands is far better for Alliance, Horde have no quests there.
---
But that's kind of the point, isn't it. No horde quests means horde don't have to bother going there at all. Meanwhile the alliance have smaller amounts of quests in practically every zone with small hubs dotted on the edges of most zones.
---
Our resto shaman is in the tank group. "But we need windfury". Ok. Fine. But don't complain if you get no heal.
---
It's raining orcs!
---
What era?
---
What
---
This is the right answer.
---
In addition, vanilla wow contains hints of quests, events, and raids that were either abandoned, or evolved into something new.
---
The uldum gates, Mount Hyjal, even Varian without the ponytail and scar.
---
That's situational. If you're above the yellow cap without them, then I agree with you.
---
Especially how he censored his own character’s eyes
---
Also you can see the talent builds of other players using details; very useful if you want to compare your performance.
---
Bring demonic runes instead. They don't share a CD with your mana gem.
---
I care so much I came back to say it twice, prove me wrong.
---
Yeah...I never really understood the kargath hype. I'm in the West most of the time anyway
---
It depends on how quickly you're wanting to have it sold. I'd start at 500G and if you don't get any takers over a week begin lowering the price by 50G weekly. Mainly though I would check the link that /u/Fattens left. It's a good read.
---
Don't clog GM tickets with begging
---
Versus Rogues/Pala yeah, but vs. SP und Warri Wotf is maybe even better.
---
Spam sunder armor, it doesnt hurt the mob, triggers a weapon attack, and will net you 1 skill point per second for the first couple of minutes.
---
I first educated as an electrician and then studied mechatronics engineering and learned C-programming and from there I did courses and am now working as a fullstack developer.

Now go back to your english dreams of one day becoming what I am. Now fuck off.

It’s not bad at all if you like the class, it was smooth leveling actually because of how many press this button to save your ass buttons you have and your ability to flex to basically any role in dungeons for quicker grouping.
---
Go ret for seal of command while leveling, then holy tree for conc for aoe, then whatever else you want and at 60 you can respec to full holy if that’s what you want to do.
---
It’s a fun class and don’t let stuff you hear stop you from playing it. It was super fun in my experience because you got to basically do a little bit of everything in dungeons. And people that say you just auto attack...it’s none of the classes are really mechanically intensive.
---
I have to say I am glad I no longer have to lead raids/organize so much.  Did pretty much ground-up organization/leading of MC pugs for 2 weeks or so followed by co-ops with a few guilds after that.  Was really starting to get burnt out from that but then my guild finally was able to do in-house runs where a lot of responsibilities are shared (and main raid leader isn't me) and it is so much more enjoyable.  Gratz on the bindings though.  Ive seen 2 but 1 was outrolled in a PUG and the other went to our MT(I switched from MT -&gt; OT for guild runs).
---
Yes Annihilator's better than Mirah's Song for solo tanking. It's one of the best weapons available right now for tanking, and definitely the best for boosting your raid's DPS. Use this and chug a Gift of Arthas and your raid's melee will love you.
---
That never made it into release. But yes, they were supposed to have plainstridng, and it would have been terrible.
---
thats what i thougt...
---
Nothing
---
20 should be enough to atleast resist 1 with a 30% Chance i guess..
---
Well you're pretty sure, but I'm 100% sure because I literally just did it yesterday and can guarantee you that when I got to ratchet, I had to walk to Orgrimmar anyway because there was no FP already. 
---
Now maybe it's different for Dwarves for some reason, I have no idea. That would be kinda strange, but given all the other weird things in vanilla wow, I suppose I wouldn't be surprised either.
---
True. I'm talking about complexity of gear choices and amount of options, though, as well dps. I guess I should've made that clear.
---
I agree, but it's the Legion client, along with a host of other things.
---
I used to do that all the time.
---
Which quest ? For the belt?
---
Cool story bro.
---
P.S. U mad bro?

There is an exception to the Tauren rule, they can ride the following special mounts (which are neither Kodos nor Wolves):

---
Hmm, good point! Haven't even thought about that. I'll buy one when I see... I currently have 25 silver and some copper, hopefully that'll get me some gear.
---
Yeah, it's like if you play the cup game and you get told where the ball is. Sure you can pretend to not know where the ball is, but it's going to be hard to not choose the cup with the ball under it.
---
This link here seems to cover the best routes through instances you mentioned but not much on strategy. That you'll probably best checking YouTube for individual instances.
---

---
Also I apologize for the unhelpful people in here.
---
The dice throw, I'm not sure. But yeah, a person is unlikely to pick the first or last cards from a deck of cards, as is much more likely to pick something near the middle. But it's still true RNG, just not a uniform probability distribution.
---
Don't let it discourage you. As a warlock, with some experience, you're the one owning.
---
Retri paladins in TBC was so damn fun though :O
---
I'd suggest move the points from Imp Shred as well into Feral Instinct as well as move from Blood Frenzy to Primal Fury.
---
why=
---
Thank you for this.  I was unaware since I mostly played wotlk.  I don't remember this limitation.
---
how do they compare to vanilla-questing.me ?
---
Okay dude. You do you.
---
Delirium on Mograine?
---
This fight was a crucible to highlight how good players really were and how they could work as individuals as well as a team. Peeling for your healer like an arena match whilst focusing their healer and dispelling crowd control were keys to victory which broke many a tank-and-spank-think group. I love how BC dungeons actually started featuring mechanics that would wreck you if you didn't do them properly. Tank and spank is fun in it's own ways but turns into little more than a gear check and spam fest for damage and heals.
---
Ragnaros does physical damage. Like 30% of his dmg is physical.
---
Implying I’ve managed to decide on a main
---
I don't see it anywhere. I'm now level 10. Currently I'm free roaming in Origammar or whatever the place is. I'm supposed to get an antidote here but I can't get where the game points me wtf. It's very high up.
---
If your healers dont go oom in current content, and all healers are bored, you could ask to spec shadow for the current content tier. One less healer, one more DPS, speeds up the run. Win win.
---
Yeh the rune cloth turn ins existed back then as well, as the maintank of my guild it also took me quite a while to get it, but the mechanostrider was worth it :D
---
Riposte is all around good spell - low energy cost, no global CD + good damage that doubles it with BF and can reduces dmg taken by melee mobs significantly (disarm).  
---
Argument that riposte is not worth it with rank 6 eviscerate is just dumb. Oh well dont really need premed in subtly cus you know with hemo spam you stack combat points quickly enough - type of argument. Its a free boost to your dmg, no global cooldown is super nice ye. And improved evasion/sprint, my god no comment... ¬.\^
---
Do his 'if you can't kill it, return later' tips not work, where he mentions quests multiple times in the guide?  I usually can't kill the harder mobs the first time around without help.  I've also noticed some are virtually unkillable solo as a priest without help (e.g summoned Naga in desolace, was red and resisted virtually everything).
---
Yeah, I should have mentioned that the restrictions only apply to the racial mounts :)
---

These high level priest players sum it up pretty nicely. Shadowguard is just too good.
---
have you ever looted a purple item? Is it something I can hope to see or is it just like winning the lottery?
---
I'm a big fan of Neat Plates for tanking.
---
3 sec cast for 10 water. 120 water (one full trade) = 36 seconds. But the problem is that this is more than two full mana pools. So then I have to drink twice, another minute, which makes it necessary to create 130 water since otherwise I can only give 118. 
---
We're spending closer to 3 minutes to provide you with something we don't have to, if you don't appreciate it enough to give a tip, just buy your food from a vendor. Sure, you'll get free food and drinks in a dungeon anytime but you really don't deserve it for free in a town. BTW, this is coming from someone who gives away all his conjured stuff to levelers before logging off so they have some free snacks for their session.
---
Don't hate on the switch.  It's a perfectly good console.
---
What about tanks that roll on dps gear? It's not their roll in the group but It is their spec if they do that hybrid shit
---
It's pretty safe but super boring. You have heals, good armor, bubble hearth, lay on hands. It's just offensively you mostly auto attack.
---
Is that a warlock with Krol blade?
---
Greetings brother of the light!
---
I too main holy paladin. Solo play can be one of the most aggravating experiences for a holy paladin. Really any hybrid class for that matter. We can make it a little easier on ourselves at the expense of bag slots. Carrying around at least two full sets of gear can really increase your productivity. Those HoTW druids know what I'm talking about.
---
For example, my solo set consist of tanking gear centered around mp5, stamina, defense and thorns type damage. With this gear I go into Dire maul east and solo farm the non elite lashers. I damn sure don't do it as fast as mage, but I get it done with ease. I will typically earn ~30-50G per hour from vendor trash alone. 
---
I commend you for choosing the righteous path and I know Uther does too.
---
It's even worse imo. Every raid I go in has around 10 mages.
---
It does on PvP servers
---
It’s clearly overall DPS for a kara, so no not really.
---
Better tip, spam rens on a ghost/skeleton/elemental. It triggers a weapon attack, but they are immune so it consumes 0 rage.
---
Right, the Tesla stock has been going down for the last 3 years. Not very volatile either. Doubt you made 300k USD. To make that money on TSLA you must have a lot, which I doubt you do. I make that money in 3 years, you did it once and probably spent it all or losing it on bitcoin when I'm making that money ever 3rd year over and over again. I'm not working as an electrician, I love an awesome life as developer, something a little 300k usd can't buy you. I have also been high warlord, you need to know your audience and stop assuming you are better than everyone, because you're not and you will get shut down by others than me. Enjoy your 300k, in my country that is not a lot of money, but for an american without free healthcare that money is as close as a broken bone, lol. I should say "peace out" but "war out" is better suited for you.
---
We use monolith dkp for open bidding, not sure what issues you're having with it
---
"n-no u"
---
Good response.
---
Could be worse at least its 50/50 drop rate on a hunter-only item.  Our poor DPS have gotten shafted on weapon drops.  0 Brut blades, mageblades, OEBs, no weapons off Rag.  Got a few of gutgores/CHT's/vendorstrike/earthshaker though lol.
---
I'd have similar screen shots, one from wrath till now, with my buddy...only issue is once transmog started youd see my bud forever in heroism set and me in deadly gladiator
---
they cant ride horses either i believe ... apart from the strat undead horse
---
I main a warlock.  I regret not rolling this class in OG wow.
---
Yeh awesome feeling popping wings charging into the enemy and then a mage steals them off you
---
It didn't work for me, I think the one I ended up downloading was Weapon Swing Timer or something like that.
---
even though a hunter has a pretty good flat damage in tbc, it definitly depends on the gear, 900dmg in kara, especially in a group like this without a retri or enhancer that twists, is good
---
No it's not. average 1-60 for someone is around 10-15 days of play time or 240-360 hours  
---
10% of that time being 24-36 hours of difference.
---
But that's just the quests.   
---
Horde generally have more FP/Inn and better locations. Which bring their average play time down.  
---
If you're on a pvp server all these averages go up due to world pvp interactions.
---
as for 'most of your xp doesnt' even come from quests... actually, if you're following a leveling guide (no, not just rested xp) a huge chunk of it does, and a bigger chunk if you're horde. 
---
I get it if you never rolled the other faction, but there's no reason to make up shit in some imaginary defense.   it is what it is.   Alliance have better endgame positioning and better story/questlines.   Horde quests, to me, felt like a lot of kill quests with very few chains, but that's fun in it's own way.
---
Which days are considered as raid days?
---
This isn't correct, Ragnaros does physical with his melee strikes as of tanking him last night.
---
So who's going to tell him it's not worth anything anymore..
---
You whine but what you have blizzard do.
---
People are always gonna go to servers with a high pop of their faction nothing blizz can do about that.
---
you seem to post this on all drop related posts.
---
you must be a very angry person who has bad luck to care this much to post the same thing on all drop posts.
---
Thx I did not know that weapon skill factors in :)
---
Oh c'mon my 15 year old cousin still had Lan party's
---
It's not all bad
---
I'm not saying someone should go full resto. I'm saying typically raids will bring a couple of full resto shamans for the caster groups. Whether or not you spec full resto certainly doesn't hinder the other 39 raiders, more like 10-15 raid members. In reality even less though. If you plan your ability to cast spells off another raid members 36th point ability, you're the problem, not their decision to respec.
---
It's not so much the damage of grenades that matters as it is the incapacitate - another source of CC. Add to that a number of situationally useful trinkets and gadgets, it's something you probably will want in PvP because so many seem to be getting it. It evens out the battlefield a bit.
---
So a LFG system?
---
/BRO HUG
---
Thx yep it was the weapon skill ^^
---
that has nothing to do with quests though.   
---
that was aoe farming...   
---
we're talking about quests.
---
Your parses are against other enhancement shamans, not against other dps.
---
Your DPS is by average only 30% of what I do as a warrior with just a little bit better gear.
---
It's not too late to respec, I was a mix of disc and shadow but respeced late 40's to get to shadowform because I felt like even doing dungeons it was a slog, and everything took forever to kill. Getting the next few levels after shadowform was smooth as butter. Plan on sticking with this to grind out some enchants / felcloth / gold, before speccing healing (although I intend to spec a pvp healing build, so if phase 2 comes out sooner rather than later I'll switch to that.)
---
Oh I see, well damn. Guess I was wrong lol
---
Classic isn't the game you go to for high difficulty gameplay. Retail raiding fits that definition.
---
Just from random drops when doing quests? It is rare but not unbelievably so. I think seeing one random epic when leveling to 60 is about average.
---
OK, so while **I do agree**, I’m not sure what the point of this post is. This is how it was in vanilla, and that’s what we asked for in Classic. 
---
So, welcome to 15 years ago, I guess?
---
its a 50:50 between guild bank and instant alt mail.
---
Keep in mind they are not used in anywhere near as many things as something like arcane crystals.  I don't even think stronghold gauntlets will be in the game until phase 5 maybe?  So basically its just lionheart and freeze reflectors ATM I think that are actually useful.
---
To have 800 dps your shadowbolt has to crit every time, which is unlikely.
---
Atlas loot is pretty nice to browse gear
---
Zero danger there though. I agree that it's annoying.
---
Can you elaborate on this? 
---
Are you talking about some backdoor to the inn in Kargath or was there a path to Searing Gorge behind Kargath that was on the map?
---
my experience is that people are rushing the game really bad. Can't tell how many times I've read "BIS" in chat. Everyone in my guilds have epic mounts and all professions maxed.
---
Dont mind him just a mad nerd doesn't speak for everyone. congrats!
---
Where do the downvotes on a newbie asking question come from? Lmao.
---
Oh yeah the massive threat posed by the Zhevra and Plainstriders.
---
Personally I'm shocked we didn't get a quest to kill those dumb giraffes running around. You can tell by the mob types that Blizzard didn't have time to give a shit when they threw together The Barrens.
---
The Venture Co. quests could have been cool, that chain even works its way into the neat Forsaken chain about the plague, but then they get dropped rather abruptly.
---
It happens. Yes, it's rare, and you shouldnt count on it, but it does happen. I got a purple dagger in Fellwood once and on a private classic server I got a Kang the Decapitator in Tanaris I think
---
Somewhat, there's a ton of priests.  At this point I have been focusing on my alt because most groups need dps.  I'm probably going to keep my priest as shadow for pvp even though I do enjoy healing.
---
I had this moment when I respecd to daggers 20 minutes before MC and was wondering why I couldn’t hit the Molten Giants at the beginning. I hit 295 skill when Rag died.

Playing priest 60.. enjoy it a lot just really annoyed trying to haggle a mage for water every time I log on. I love pvping shadow since it’s so strong but gotta respec for raids.. don’t really like the farming options of priests either . I’m currently lvling a mage alt
---
You also need a lot more tanks in a dungeon setting than raids, tanks get geared right quick in 5 mans and then move on to raids where they have a lot less competition, get geared faster and don't need to do 5 mans.
---
Somebody's jealous
---
I’m a rogue so... no lol
---
Honestly, none of those are significant advantages. It's a couple 
---
minutes of shorter flight path or a minute mounted travel here or there.
---
What's Pathfinder grind? I haven't played retail since wod
---
In p3 those will be worth more. If you're into investing start buying some low price twink equipment.
---
What addon for those nameplates?
---
Man another paragraph, I really got you riled up. I’d definitely enjoy seeing a screenshot of your rank 14 character then :).
---
Also I suggest googling what ‘stock options’ are, I know they don’t actually teach you useful things in those free schools because I suppose you get what you pay for but if you think I’m buying stock straight up you’re really as stupid as I think you are.
---
I can’t imagine being someone like you and taking yourself this seriously, holy fuck man.
---
When I last did it, it was in TBC so I may have forgotten but the way I remember it is you get a certain number of points for each boss kill you're present for, and then when you bid on an item, a percentage of the winning bid is split among the rest of the players present for the kill. 
---
The master looter had an addon that tracked points from week to week.
---
Yeah, you can spot him from there. But people don't wait long enough for him to patrol in my experience.
---
It takes 30 seconds to check at the door and pretty much every class can do it safely.
---
&gt;	This is coming from an Alliance rogue.
---
we can tell
---
Orc who didn't do the Undercity quest. Took about 700 stacks
---
Why are people calling alts twinks? I've literally never heard it before classic, and now a bunch of people are using it wrong.
---
Rolled ret and I don't regret it at all. I can DPS and tank dungeons, farm gold and my guild even lets me raid as our only ret paladin. I like the very versatile set of spells too.
---
seems like you're crying a lot!
---
Thrall was attacked at my realm too; around 30+ ppl came to defend only to fidn themselves in other layer; so gj really
---
Usually you get DKP from attending a raid regularly and sometimes by donating to the guild bank, killing bosses and some other stuff (Depends on you guild really)
---
This is all documented in an addon or an Excel sheet which is usually visible to everyone so everyone knows who has what etc. 
---
Then when an item Drops you start bidding your DKP. The System I know of is:
---
You whisper the Lootmaster how much DKP you are bidding for that item.
---
The one that bid the most wins the item
---
So you don't know how much the others have bid until that Person won and the Lootmaster tells everyone who won it and for how much.
---
There might be slight differences from what I explained. I don't know if it always is a silent bidding or if some guilds do it openly.
---
I never heard of a MC pug using DKP though. That is usually FFA (just rolling for items)
---
I’m leveling a rogue, currently at level 26. I elected to go Engi / Mining. Predictably, I’m not making much money. However, I’ve maxed all my skills at 225 (including fishing, cooking, first aid). I’m finding the best cash I can make right now is grabbing copper / tin nodes and fishing anytime I see Firefin Snapper or Oily Blackmouth schools and flogging them on the AH.
---
Are there any other methods to gain gold while I’m leveling with maxed professions that you’d recommend (for now)?
---
I had some of my vanilla screenshots saved to my album on xfire. 
---
Never expected to randomly find the entire service GONE. Figured they were safe there until my next rebuild :(
---
We have the opposite problem. Everyone has a leaf and our priests are getting upset, but we get no giantstalkers. I have Rhok'delar and 1 piece of giantstalkers from clearing MC 5 weeks in a row. We have also never had any giantstalker boe pieces drop. 
---
Tribute runs are legit insane. I made over 1200g by doing them on Saturday/Sunday.
---
Most guilds that use dkp use addons to store and tally dkp points. Points are usually give for being at raid on time, each boss kill, and for completing the raid. When items drop the points are used to bid. 
---
Our guild used loot council which requires a bit more trust but can be more efficient if everyone has the same "for the benefit of the raid" mentality
---
For the Alliance bruv
---
Was tempted to try constantly farming the Blue Dragons in Winterspring. Sinew dropped after 50 minutes, and that's 350g right there! Although assume RNG plays heavily into it.
---
Demonic runes share a CD with mana gems tho.
---
Wtf lol
---
East jump runs like 10ish mins (normal run with key probably like 30ish).  DM tribute 15-20ish, non-tribute 20-25ish.  DMWest like 45-mins-1hr.  May get a bit faster than this but also very possible with a bad group to take much longer as well.
---
*hunter pets exist*
---
Oh ok yeah good idea.
---
Why not The Tigers or would you include these in your farm? :)
---
Someone in the guild is normally assigned a the 'admin' of DKP.
---
How it is awarded is generally up to the guild, but most go along the lines of:
---
XXX points for being on time/raid prepped/at raid entrance/etc
---
XXX amount of points for each boss kill, normally with additional points for a new kill/1st time guild kill
---
XXX points per hour or per raid completed
---
When an item drops, you then 'spend' your points, mostly done by auction with the player offering the most of their points getting the item.
---
Some then have a DKP degradation, to ensure someone can't just hoard forever &amp; always been top of the spend capacity
---
That's amazing.
---
nice! which piece took the longest and why was it ravager?
---
Kinda blows my mind that there are people who are 60 already and yet haven't figured this out
---
Ya... No.. The mitigation stat stick is not the stand in second for the person that acknowledges threat (because they're farming mcps)....thank you for proving yourself wrong in your own argument.
---
[Shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm) says they are very close to each other with Barman Shanker being slightly ahead. Also paging /u/TravVdb
---
Not classic numbers. In fact, that screen shot comes from TBC Recount Client version 2.4.3 and here is a link to it.   
---
 [https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-addons/recount/](https://legacy-wow.com/tbc-addons/recount/)
---
Keep in mind that this is also *way* more than the average person will get. I've leveled multiple chars to 60 between vanilla, pservs and classic and have not gotten a single one. Seen one drop in an instance, which I didn't win.
---
So dkp is a point system.
---
When you are in a guild and sign up for or are a regular to a raid or event you gain points(dkp) those points are then used to purchase gear during the raids. 
---
So instead of rolling on the gear and being really unlucky it let's people get gear equally. 
---
In most cases if you miss a raid you signed up for you could lose dkp as well. If the reason isn't good enough.
---
As a side note most guilds that run dpk will sometimes give gear priority to regulars over casuals in the case of a tie in points being spent.
---
It doesn't, you just have to read the spreadsheet more thoroughly
---
If you get kicked into the whelps, you lose 50 DKP.
---
Basically your character is still present on the server. Give it a few minutes.
---
Salty
---
Nope, not taking the piss. BWL wont be out for months, plenty of time to overstock your guild's coffers. Not to mention the fights are all figured out anyway
---
With 5 min CD \^\^
---
Fair enough.
---
Except much like the later expansions, it's pitched as expansion but you move to new zones only to find pre-existing camps/villages happily existing in the zone.
---
Good, that will make them stronger.
---
Yes, P5 will introduce the relic items.
---
Cmon, everything you said apart from spending time with family (could be argued)  is basically a waste of time when you are on your death bed anyway. Unless you research things to improve lives for other people aswell. I know myself that its so stressful to live like that, exercise vs family, research vs meditating, friends vs research etc. As soon as i got kids i realized that i dont not have to optimize my free time, i can sit on my ass and just stare into a wall if i feel like it, my day is stressful enough.
---
I play because i think its very relaxing and want to escape for a little while. I also play the AH because i think its fun and challenging. Balance is key.
---
I was suggested that! from a guildmate
---
Druid can solo dm:north first boss and insect packs for 20-30g/hour.  
---
Ebbnflow has a video on it on YouTube, its very straightforward
---
kinda, not as useful for both raids and dungeons, probably going to get warrior to 60 then start on my resto shaman
---
Have 0 dps because the boss is immune to fire. I'm sure no one will notice.
---
I've been there for a while without luck. Was going to buy the sinew bc it's more efficient for me, but it's never in the auction house. I think if you wanna farm an epic quest item, better farm the demons for the eye, they have a higher drop chance than the sinew.
---
On my server there are low-level wands on the auction house for 10-20 silver, so you should be able to afford one :)
---
Try not to buy too much gear, though. Often, you'll end up replacing it quickly with a quest reward, so it can be a bit of a money sink.
---
As far as valuing items, guilds usually one of two systems. The first is a set system where each item costs a specified amount and they give it to the person who has the most DKP, (from being at the most raids, rewarding commitment) assuming they want it. The second system would be more like an auction, everyone knows how much DKP they have and can bid whatever they'd like on it. As for keeping track there are add-ons or a simple spreadsheet would work.
---
It is written on the mount. Look em up on wowhead.
---
But I would mention that Tauren can use all drop and PvP mounts. So they can use Stratholme horse and ZG mounts. And PvP mount as well. These do not require "race riding skill" (i.e raptor riding) so they can be used.
---
I honestly thought he was a paladin until I noticed the helm he was talking about was Priest Tier 2. Then I noticed the cock jizzing on his chest and forgot all about what I had been thinking about.
---
Just like you could flip a coin 100 times and never get heads, you can do a dungeon 100 times and never see a specific item drop. It can happen, it's just very, very unlikely.
---
I didn't realize how much I need this until now

If you have herbalism/alchemy, start at Mara purple entrance and run to Gizlock (goblin) picking ghost mushroom/blindweed along the way. Takes roughly 12min a run and nets about 6g to 9g. I either sell the herbs outright or make them into shadow power/limited invulnerability. I don't bother with princess because killing her takes so effing long and my +sp is only like 120ish atm. Maybe in the future.
---
Can also do DM east jump runs with a fury warrior (who are usually miners). 2man if geared or 3man.
---
Once geared, can also split loot with a rogue doing Tribute runs since you both can stealth past everything.
---
A lot of people think WotLK was good and CATA was downhill.  I liked TBC and WotLK, if it were re-released I would prefer to see less dailies (psychologically tiring) and no flying mount (probably not possible).
---
I did it in ElvUI. You can add it to and of your bars with custom text.
---
by raids he means ubrs lmao
---
A Wastelander Assassin \~ in Tanaris  
---
luckily i was solo questing! so didn't have to roll
---
My main has been a Warrior since Vanilla. (There was a time in WOLK where I mained a Paladin but shhhh). I rolled a Warrior in Classic. I got up to 45 and pretty much abandoned the Warrior. I became too accustomed to the QoL changes they made for Warriors over the years.
---
I now have a 32 Shadow Priest. I got her up to level 20 in 22 hours played and then took some time to level fishing. I'm still a loooong way from 60, but I'm enjoying the grind this time instead of dreading it.
---
I grinded from 28-30 this past Saturday on Centaurs in Thousand Needles. I just threw some YouTube videos on and never had to drink. I could never get myself to do that on my Warrior.
---
Thunder Bluff is the most efficient though...Inn, AH, bank, anvil, general goods etc are the closest together, few seconds walk to everything.
---
Azshara alone, being important in lore, deserves a lot than it has.
---
Grats mate.
---
Saw someone offer 300g for it after I had sold it for 274, hue hue...
---
Don't sell it for cheap!
---
Short answer:
---
You get awarded Dragon Kill Points ( DKP) currency for participation (i.e. killing raid bosses, showing up on time, etc)  that can then be "spent" for gear.  
---
These are tracked by the guild/raid leader using an addon and spreadsheet/website.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points
---
Did we ever find out who really told him to make Sylvanas warchief?
---
Druids gotta kite her as well with Moonfire.
---
**Dragon kill points**
---
Dragon kill points or DKP are a semi-formal score-keeping system (loot system) used by guilds in massively multiplayer online games.  Players in these games are faced with large scale challenges, or raids, which may only be surmounted through the concerted effort of dozens of players at a time.  While many players may be involved in defeating a boss, the boss will reward the group with only a small number of items desired by the players.  Faced with this scarcity, some system of fairly distributing the items must be established.

I have 2 level 60s and working on my 3rd.   
---
Exclusively using Joana's Guide, I love it!
---
You just gotta play the way you like!
---
Wait I’m confused. I thought Mara has no BoE loot?
---
Cant they ride the ZG raptor as well?
---
The server still thinks you're logged in on that character.  Just give it a few minutes.
---
The chestpiece can only drop from Scarlet Champions, and it has a 0.5% dropchance.
---
The boots has a 0.7% dropchance.
---
It’s basically an out of game currency players gain by participating in raids or guild events, often kept track of on the guild website.
---
It’s up to the guild officers to reward and track the points, which are used to bid on gear drops auction style. It’s basically a way to reward the more dedicated guild members with first dibs on raid drops.
---
They’re called DKP(Dragon Kill Points) because the system originated in even older MMOs like Everquest, where most big bosses were dragons.
---
Using a quest addon isn't exactly figuring out yourself
---
That's pretty much it.
---
Obviously make sure you pick up any grey/white items you see, people don't realize how much those add up; especially once you get in to the 40's, some of those items sell for 30s-50s.
---
You've maxed your mining? Hell I'm lvl 50 and not at 225. You'll be making a mint once you get to areas with thorium and truesilver, as most of the people in those zones don't appear to be able to mine it and are stuck at mithril.
---
At this point, I would just concentrate on leveling, as the resources available to you are more limiting than your skills.
---
But he clearly has a PC. He doesn't need to use his phone.
---
Go for herb, mining is only anout getting crystals, the rest isnt profitable.
---
Hence the 60 40 split
---
If you're not interested in fishing/cooking/Herbing put on your spellpower gear and do SM library with dots/wand/shield
---
Only kill things you can't skip (with or without mind soothe) on your way to bosses and chests (and herbs if you're doing that)
---
Should be able to get about 10~15g per hour from that depending on your luck with chests.
---
You can also farm SFK with holy nova for cloth/greens/boes/boss drops/greys
---
None of these will get you mage/warlock/hunter money but they're fairly reliable/consistent and you can even sell party slots for those dungeons to people who want the gear for their alts but don't want to do a "proper" run of the dungeon with competition
---
Not in classic
---
That truly is an awful tattoo. Putting aside the fact that it looks like he's getting titty-fucked, it's just really shitty looking.
---
Check the warlock trainer in Razor Hill, that's where the low level class quests usually start.
---
In Orgrimmar, there's a tower in the middle of the valley of strength. If you enter it and go up the staircase, you'll find a bridge that leads over to a path above the valley of strength... That might be where you're going?
---
&gt; that warrior I'm looking at in the area is finishing his second mob
---
arms warriors have the same when they get misses/parries and they're waiting for rage.
---
On the other hand, when nothing misses and you get some crits, for a moment you feel glorious
---
I've bounced through  a lot of alts now, every class except Druid who I mained in original vanilla. 
---
I started with a Mage, hated it - boring.
---
Tried a Rogue, stealth felt too slow - got bored.
---
Tried a Warrior, absolutely adored it, but tanking sucked - got frustrated.
---
Picked up a Hunter, Warlock, Shaman, then Priest and ended up just wishing I was playing my Warrior again after I got each of those to 30-40. 
---
I've had such an overwhelming compulsion to go back to the warrior despite not enjoying the tank role because at the end of the day... I want to tank, I like just hitting things with a sword, I like shields... I don't need fancy magic or anything like that, I just want bandages and cooked fish. 
---
After I got my priest to 'just short' of 40 I decided enough was enough. I hated my main, I hated all my alts, all I wanted to do was be a Warrior.
---
I rerolled last night, deleted everything and couldn't be happier.
---
Wish I didn't let my friends talk me into playing horde
---
Neat!
---
Its worth a hefty penny, think hard about if you ever plan to level a druid in your wow career, because it's one the best items in the game for a bear tank for a very long time!
---
You’re just a run of the mill jackass mate
---
I'm not sure which unit frame addon it was but while playing on Elysium my pet's happiness was reflected in the colour of his health bar. Green/yellow/red accordingly. Perhaps it's the same with SUF?
---
This guy knows whats up
---
Okay then roll an undead. You asked a question and I answered it.
---
Everyone is telling you that Orcs are the great. Roll an undead if you think they are better
---
Huh. Why didn't warriors get a hybrid tax? They do more damage than rogues.
---
Huh, I didn't realize I typed that it came from rend I thought I said enchanting.
---
I blame the fact I wrote that at 5am after getting home from my graveyard shift.
---
It's not fast, and not slow, just really boring for the most part. If you want more interactivity, and don't mind spamming dungeons, I recommend you go protection and start tanking :-)
---
Got a screenshot ?
---
I don't know where you'd put it, but the storyline around Deadmines (before and after) is miles ahead of Ragefire Chasm or Wailing Caverns or even both of them and some other dungeons combined.
---
Oh yeah, now I see it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-leveling-classic-wow#best-weapons-and-gear-for-leveling-a-warlock
---
Here is a good guide for Warlocks. Guides can be a little overwhelming if you're new to the game, so don't feel that you need to follow it, but they show where you can get wands throughout your leveling.
---
Always good to have some stamina
---
so much that my new main is 31
---
I’m all over the place in classic. Had a frost mage main in vanilla, so I thought I’d go frost mage again. Hit level 41 on my mage and hit an absolute wall, so I started a rogue for the change in playing style.
---
Got the rogue to 45 the other day, and then started a warlock.
---
Lock was Orc, got him to 11 but couldn’t get into the animations (wanted that damn stun resist) so I started a new Undead one.
---
I’m having a lot of fun still, but damn I wish I wasn’t like this lmao, I want to hit that 60 content already.
---
fire resistance potions are selling for 1g 60s here, 2g 50 on good days...
---
No not really as Speed minmaxing isnt AS prevalent AS in bfa. Also "try and learn" has a much higher punishment so people tend to stick to the conservative way
---
At this point, I feel like it might be easier to get arcanist or netherwind pants than those pants from omokk...
---
Yeah man it's completely useless in those BGs right now
---
Private servers didn't let tauren ride raptors....
---
Takes ages longer to get there though.
---
No, just root/hibernate rank1+starfire
---
Peggle Classic
---
Your boomer is showing
---
Yes. Hunter sucks. The game wasn't meant for kiting. It's not a mobility game. Hunter is just a gimped mage.
---
So edgy you might just cut yourself on it
---
Started a warlock main, switched to mage, then druid, then hunter and atm pretty sure i'm going to be main'ing a Shaman to 60, yes, also have a warrior, priest, and rogue between level's 5-7 .
---
What i'm finding is i'm still working on the other classes, and plan to bring the priest and rogue into the mix eventually but, all in all i rotate seemingly between 3 toons at a time, but Shaman has remained in all the rotation, can't beat the rest xp playing this way either.
---
I'm not going anywhere, if anything i'll be main'ing classic, unless another mmorpg comes along with some challenge, outside that rocking some SWG:Legends ( a f'ing amazing mmorpg) here and there too. Man was i tired of bouncing from mmo to mmo and just bitching and qq'ing on sites about that fact, and worst reading the constant negative, bitching, and moaning, i just want to f'ing play and have fun so tired of the negative whining. All i know  is it's so nice to have a decent challenging mmorpg to call home again.
---
Ultimately why play something you're not happy with? Try them all till level 5 or so and you get a pretty good feel for the class, and by 10 you know more about the class and the feel of it, and if you stick it out till 20 you become pretty positive it's a class for you and you'll find you love the game even more.
---
What are the worst places to die and have to run back in spirit form?
---
I died in un’goro and the run back was awful, didn’t realize how big that zone is
---
You don’t kno what dkp is?? 50 DKP MINUS!
---
Set one of your reputations to your xp bar
---
you will want strength agi attack power gear for solo questing.
---
Hell no enhancement Tauren has been a blast. I have a 1 in 5 chance of loving my character at any given time.
---
I am not a big gold farmer honestly, but I did level to 60 with herbalism and from that experience it seems like a complete waste. To me it seemed pretty much every farming method would give more g/h. But again not really an expert on herbalism farming.
---
I also would hate doing it wrong.
---
You should definitely have a shaman in the tank group. It doesn't have to be a resto shaman.
---
We haven't yet, last we heard of Vol'jin he was going to delve deeper into the Shadowlands to try and figure it out
---
if that happens it will be announced next year at blizzcon. this year seems to early
---
There's a different one (all with similar names) for each class.
---
At what point do I switch to int gear for healing?
---
I’ll agree especially with the part about higher level means we can speed thru it. 
---
The one benefit i have is that as a pally tank, is i can Bless salvation on the higher level party member and that seems to help up until it drops off and they are shocked they pulled aggro.
---

---
There is no simple answer, it all depends on how your guild has decided to implement DKP
---
ask in guild.
---
Have you tried leveling with triple mage though? You literally blast everything before the second nova needs to come down. If people knew how easy it was they would’ve done it back then too.
---
Get riposte early. You will have to respect out of it later on, but it makes face tanking mobs so much easier, and does pretty great damage to boot. Rest has been beaten to death in this thread.
---
the name for a hypothetical extension of classic after we have done all historic raid content (Naxxramas is the last patch)
---
What will Blizzard do?
---
Nothing?  
---
make new content?  
---
Restart servers, back to the beginning?  
---
launch TBC?
---
What the actual shit??? 😂😂😂
---
Sorry, someone else trasnfered and now have that name, you will have to delete the character and start over. /s
---
I've leveled a druid first with the intentions of healing/tanking/dpsing whatever is needed for my friend group. But I'm also a big try hard and really dislike healing and tanking raids so I've become the resident feral cat dps in my guilds raid group. 
---
Combined with the obscene amount of work it takes to be a competitive dps as a feral cat in raids as well as farming prebis for 2 other specs, the respec costs of wanting to be able to perform all roles at a subpar level feels really bad. I wish I had just leveled a rogue.
---
Haha.. Our guild has two druids total with 2 raid teams. One feral tank (me) and one resto. They rarely ask us about gear, we just get anything druid the other doesn't have and ferals use weird items anyway so I get those as they drop.
---
Druid is great.
---
Led a 25man ony last night, I was the only druid so I got t2 helm. I didn't even avoid other druids.
---
Tell that to my guild who has now gotten 5 leafs in a row lmao
---
You are correct, the items value is entirely based in what people bid on it. There is no pre-determined price of an item. So x item is 0 dkp for some and all of their dkp for others.
---
Correct me here if I'm wrong but Method is the top guild in retail, yes? Doesn't that mean they are tryhard? And if they are being the top guild, shouldn't they also be tryhard? And what's wrong with being tryhard if you are aspiring to be the best?
---
Cool everyone. I also have a career, and a wife. And I play wow. And I’m pretty sure I’m not wasting my life. But thanks for the claims to the contrary. And thanks also for the downvotes.
---
Also, if you’re so busy and successful, how do you ever find the time to browse and reply to threads on the classic subreddit? ::eye roll::
---
I distinctly remember tanking Scholo as a shaman in vanilla. I had that engineering shield.
---
Whenever im in a group I like to see the intent of the group. Ive joined groups where xp was the main goal so we rush the dungs. Then ive been in groups that want to KILL everything so we stayed the extra few mins to get the kills. I would suggest letting everyone who you invite to the group your intent. Its saved me a headache a few times.
---
That describes my vanilla experience. I was on a dead server, and no one was raiding. Everyone was in pvp gear, and almost no one had anything from MC and beyond... that still logged in, anyway.
---
i like posts like this cause im always curious what dropped the item, so yea i do care
---
Sounds like you're trying to justify yourself.
---
Very cool. Not quite as visual as the bar, but very clean. Thanks!
---
Warden Staff is not a twink item, it’s the BiS weapon for druid tanks for a very long time! So there’s no need to wait for later phases as this is already worth the same as it will be later on.
---
Yeah you are right, I just took at look at my screenshots and it's not hard to pass 1 mill.
---
It's cheaper but certainly not better.
---
Did you mean Rip? https://classicdb.ch/?spell=9896
---
Eviscerate is a Rogue ability, Rip/Ferocious bite Feral (Cat) Druid.
---
You need to consider that Eviscerate/Rip can't crit. On the other hand it's also not reduced by armor, so a lot depends on the circumstances (armor debuffs on the boss, your crit chance). Generally Rip will do more damage if the mob lives long enough for all ticks to get applied. 
---
This  changes when you get the new Rank of Ferocious Bite in AQ.
---
Further convincing me to stick with passive income from mooncloth. Haha. Thanks man!
---
Are you sure? I've been told the demonic runes don't share a CD, while the dark runes do. Regardless, even if they share a CD, bringing dark/demonic runes is better than using a mana gem. They restore more mana.
---
That's a fair point, I didn't play wrath so I forgot they re-released Naxx as 25.  Maybe move the raid schedule up, shift the Naxx loot to the dungeons?  It's all hypothetical since this won't happen anyway lol.
---
BANG BANG BANG BANG
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu7wYcpsjgk&amp;list=PLC1MOsmmMggMBliv5mFzH_tlJugRJssWT&amp;index=871
---
Yeah i know, thing is, i only gonna aoe farm until i get my epic mount thats all. Going enchanting for my guild and such!
---
Why is that? Gold icon = greed is for gold is not a good argument lol. The system was designed around bops dropping.
---
No addons
---
Currently in the process of Felcloth &gt; Mooncloth 4/10
---
The only reason you bring a non resto Shaman to raid is because you don’t have anyone else to fill that spot so yeah it’s most likely going to be Resto.
---
No, you're spot on.
---
At 60, I see all the time in LFG: "3 GEARED dps and healer LF tank", and I immediately know that they will have threat issues and the tank will get blamed for the wipes.
---
On the other hand, my first group into BRD took almost 5 hours, we only made it to the bar, but at the end everyone thanked each other for being so patient and not trying to rush things just to grind through faster.
---
Ultimately, the tank is in charge of the pacing. If he's not comfortable going faster, nobody else should force it. That will just lead to many, many wipes and frustration/anger.
---
I'm pretty confident this is 10% imposible 
---
Even as a orc. 
---
If you look at the quest in wowhead classic that actually gives troll reputation you will find out there is a lot less of what this guy says
---
What days are typically raid days?
---
I’m 23 and have more LAN parties now than ever before to play WoW/League.
---
MY BOY!!!!
---
Well it's always up to personal preference, but I heard how much of a bore warriors can be, and I actually love them. Once you start getting your different stances, you have to stance dance to use them effectively. Berserker has berserker rage, whirlwind, and pummel, Battle stance has sweeping strikes, mortal strikes, overpower, thunder clap, and execute (both of these have hamstring), and defensive stance has the damage reduction &amp; threat generation, as well as a few nifty shield specific moves. On top of all this, all forms get the shout, the rage generating shout (bloodrage? I forget), and cleave. To use a warrior effectively you should be utilizing all of these things, it will significantly up your DPS and overall fun, in my humble opinion.
---
Not to mention they're great at PvP once geared out, and useful for both raids &amp; dungeons, although while leveling you'll have an easier time in queues as a tank, although you can easily DPS tank with a 2hander.
---
Probably questing or running dungeons
---
DKP is worth whatever you decide its worth. People bid on the item auction style if they want it.
---
A lot of people complain about "getting bid up" but the only person who can take that happen is you. If someone bids more DKP than you feel comfortable with, then they win. 
---
It's pretty simple but people overcomplicate it
---
that comment completely misses the point...
---
Fury outperforms Arms in a raid environment almost all the time. Now, Arm's is also a good spec and if you enjoy arms and want to stick as arms, I would. You just have to use other abilities in place of Mortal Strike. Don't be forced to play a different spec to what you enjoy, because then your not going to enjoy it. If you don't enjoy something eventually your performance will suffer and eventually you won't feel connected to the game. That said, you need to reach an agreement with the guild.
---
He's saying that you're happy because you got an item. If epgp hadn't given you an item, then he thinks you wouldn't be happy. So you're not happy with the system, you're happy you happened to get loot.
---
Np but better wait for some more replies and maybe check some gold farming guides or whatever before making the decision.
---
"properly" Fuck off, lmao. It's a fucking video game, let people enjoy it however they want.
---
A big one at that
---
I regret rolling my race ... I rolled UD Warrior for "flavor/style" and can't stop regretting not rolling orc for that sweet +5 axe ...
---
I'm stuck having to buy edgemaster to be somewhat optimized ... sucks really hard having to pretend you don't have a glove slot because you'll be stuck with the same pair of gloves ...
---
I don't know about my class selection, perhaps about my realm.
---
It’s only for aoe mob grinding. It sucks at everything else lol
---
Honestly it depends on the guild. Usually you'll have someone handling the distribution of dkp, via an addon or a gdoc or something, you get dkp for presence/boss kills/other things your guild might decide. You bid dkp when an item drops, highet bid wins and he loses his points.
---
Any healer who takes reed over a DPS now that DM is out is a chucklefuck.  Get your book and farm your MTT. Don't be clueless.
---
This is a good practice. People will be butthurt if you leave because it's not the type of run you are interested in but that's ok. Others' emotions are not your charge. An easily avoided headache is worth it.
---
\*#sadmoo*
---
Probably Gruul's Lair.
---
I rolled a shaman for the first time ever, not really knowing what to expect.
---
Until about level 30 ish I still had no idea what the fuck I was doing but it was working out fine. After then I played enhance and found a spot on a raid team as enhancement and have been fucking loving it.
---
Now, I have an Eye of sulfuras, and am kind of in the dumps because I have no idea how to farm ~7k gold for the mats so I'm levelling a mage. I've been doing some jump runs (usually as a trio or quad) but they just dont seem to be as good of money as people say unless you get super lucky with arcane crystals or the quelserrar book.
---
Paladins are legit the best class in the game as they can do anything Solo. Yes their damage is "low" but they make up for it in survivability and utility.  
---
I rolled a Horde Warrior with friends but everyone quit, so I re-rolled my original main, a Human Paladin. Yes, I know, "Dwarf" Paladin is better for PVP, but I like the Reputation bonus, and Spirit bonus Humans get, as well as the + to Maces/Swords.
---
The biggest issue with Paladins is the different sets of gear you need, which I'm okay with. You can have any combination of "Ret Plate" "Holy Healing" "Holy Spell Damage" "Tanking Protection" or "DPS Protection"
---
A quick Run down if you're Spec'd Holy - Equip a slow 2H and use Seal of Righteousness/Ret Aura. Judge Seal of the Crusader on your main target, and use consecrate. Anything should die to this fairly quickly. Do not use your Holy Healing gear when you're out soloing.
---
Even if you collect some plate/mail/leather DPS it will be very beneficial to you.
---
Over the past 15 years and through Cataclysm I mained a Paladin. I have well over 500+ Hours on Paladin alone. If you enjoy being resilient, Paladin is for you. If you're looking for big numbers and fast DPS and quick mob clearing, Paladin should not be for you. Your strength is your survivability. But you can make it work with the right abilities and understanding your skills.
---
I love my warlock.
---
&gt; Also everybody does SFK on horde not sure where you got that notion.
---
Maybe in Vanilla, right now SM ate all those players.
---
I'm right there with you.  I just mentioned to my friend how even the latest General Sam video got me thinking this way.  Plus I'll see people advertising their guilds that have been playing together for 15 years and I used to have that.  People move on, find new guilds, find other things to occupy their time and it sucks.  Gaming is still one of my favorite pass-times but it definitely can feel lonely.
---
That’s how I know you’re gay
---
Does wotf make you immune to mind control?
---
Is there an add-on that tracks loot distribution from raids? I searched a bit and only found some dkp or loot council addons. I just want to see the loot history of each guild member.
---
And you get ported to your hearthstone location
---
You are the one whining because people are enjoying the game in a way they want.
---
I put it in the information panel. Haven't really had a chance to fool around with it to check if I could get it to fill and empty based on mana, but atleast it displays it.
---
Hey, it's more about the player than about that one time where he advertised something in the /2. But hey if that's what made you happy and you liked I don't mind. Have a great day!
---
&gt; Uh, Undercity?
---
Have you even been to Undercity? Do you realize how long it takes to actually get outside?
---
&gt; Ya know, your major city that Alliance have to run past after running through 2-3 zones to get to the best 30-40 dungeon in the game?
---
It's not like the outside of UC is dueling grounds, like it is in Durotar outside Orgrimmar. The only people running out of UC are lowbies, people going to SM and people going to the Zepp. Two of those aren't really much of a threat, so you are left with the Hordes actually going to SM themselves. 
---
Once in a while someone is going to be moving towards WPL, but since there are so few actual quests at the Bulwark, they will be gone before you know it. 
---
I'll agree that it can be seen as inconvenient not to have a FP near SM, but the comment you replied to specifically mentioned access to WPL, where the Alliance have a definite advantage. Having UC nearby isn't really an advantage in that regard.

Why? That shows I could be telling the truth. What the fuck is wrong with you people? If aoe'ing trash is more than a boss fight and I consistently have 600-900 dps on boss fights, overall dmg can be 900 dps. You're a twat. A stupid one at that. You proved yourself stupid.

That was only possible in the later stages of WoW and trust me when I tell you it was shitty.
---
You put in sooo many hours to get your gear and some of the items are extremely rare. You really don't wanna look like everybody else.
---
Well, I don't at least. I can't tell you what you want :)
---
Kargath because obviously
---
Fish every pool of wreckage/debris you see.  They are much better than Firefins and Oilies.
---
Yeah only items I feel lucky about is my shadowcraft shoulders because I didn’t have to farm strat live more than 2 times. Everything else I haven’t gotten a damn thing for how many times I’ve ran the instance.
---
I've been leveling with ghostly strike as well. People will rightfully tell you that missing out on so many of the strong combat talents early on will really hurt your damage output but I find it worth for how good of a spell GS is at low levels and the quality of life the stealth talents give in making quests easier and world pvp. It may not be the most optimal but it's certainly fun and still effective which imo is more important for leveling
---
Probably feigned death mid fight when he realized he needed to take a piss. I hear he watched a Hunter do it and learned how to do it with a 0% resist chance. Either that or he's a big theater fan.
---
If it's so simple, why not explain it?
---
Look, I could understand feeling proud if you top the charts as a feral druid, enhancement shaman, etc. But when a mage tops the dps meter on a fight where mages have topped the dps meter for 15 years like.. good job, I guess?
---
but first set the graphics to 320x200 ultra low
---
Stop stop stop stop
---
Not in classic, that feature didn't come about until one of the later expansions.
---
Well, you're wrong.
---
Man... some of you are really the kind of players that group up with their 6 level 60 friends, jump on one level 40, and then act like you’ve accomplished something when you didn’t even cast a single spell, huh? 🤔
---
+ saving for later
---
My guild have got the sinew every onyxia and the leaf every MC so far now, and we started raiding on week 2.
---
We’re now just inviting randos to take the leaf and sinew because we don’t want it to go to waste because all our hunters got it already. :&lt;
---
Man I don't have any wow advice for you but you gotta not work that much, holy hell.
---
You dont have to do damage to level your skill. Miss, dodge, parry all count.
---
Played on Catskills also!
---
Godiva/Perrin on Cats.
---
what's RvR?
---
Lol exploit
---
There was a gnome lock doing the same thing on Herod Saturday
---
Uhhh no? Alliance has more quests in those areas than the other way around. Also even if I said sure that still doesn't remove the overwhelming horde bias in this game.
---
If you are really absolutely terrified of Warlocks (which you shouldn't be as a Priest), then undead. Otherwise, trolls are god tier.
---
I rolled a Paladin too and regretted it. Rerolled to a Druid and maxed that, now I get the Hybrid feel and don’t have to suck at it. Much better gameplay wise.
---
can we all agree that going into an actual dungeon (like MC) and training weapons kills is a dick move? go swing your axe at boars.
---
Nope, it is part of the design so you can tell the gear your opponent is wearing. You can make a macro to equip all the gear you want while in cities and such. There is the option to do this from I think Mists of Pandaria onward but we aren't quite there yet.
---
From reading multiple horde comments trying to argue against OP's point it seems like they forget Westfall, Loch Modan, Duskwood, Wetlands, Darkshore and Redridge are ALL the alliance equilavent to The Barrens. Where you can just steamroll The Barrens from 10-25ish we have to play ALL those zones just to get from 10-25. How is that better for Alliance in any way? Having to run and fly to a new zone every 5 quests is not very nice you know
---
&gt;When I played horde, I realized that I met so many nice people, and everyone tended to be not as bad at the game or toxic. Even questing I notice how different the alliance community is; people rarely help me when I get ganked, but on horde I remember almost every time (unless people were actually busy) people stayed and helped and it was fun. I have met nice people, and not everyone is mean, but the majority of the community on my server is awful, and I remember horde being so much better. I'm not saying one or the other is better, just in my experience, horde was generally more friendly and better at the game.
---
I also was 'forced' to roll Alliance, despite wanting so much to go back in the Horde. I'm 60 now but I don't feel attached to my toon, it may be deleted tomorrow I would think "meh, let's roll Horde". ALways /cry when I meet a tauren :D
---
Sadly since dire maul being released, rod of the ogre magi probably made this staff pretty useless in my opinion...
---
Bag space, what’s that?
---
/cries in hunter
---
I remember this feeling.  By the end of BWL you looked badass in full T8.  By the end of AQ40 and start of Naxx you looked like a fucking clown.
---
If you're a shaman or a paladin competing against a warlock, I can see this logic. 
---
If you're any healer competing with a mage? You're a clown. Go farm second wind for 6 less spell power. And MTT is strong for many people, and will be very strong in BWL for most people.
---
How many grumpy assholes are we going to get making this comment in every thread?  It’s a subreddit about classic wow.  Expect people to be excited about their achievements in classic wow.
---
He's wrong. Sword spec is a very nice dps boost for leveling.
---
I bet you use your own definition of "random" too.
---
It is an exploit if he's literally killing players in the town where npcs/guards don't aggro due to where he is standing.
---
Nah, just need to know how to play and have a solid pre-made.
---
ya mon
---
That is a feature in retail WoW that was introduced in the cataclysm expansion but I don't believe it's going to make it to classic.
---
The crazy good itemization for casters is a little crazy. Makes them a bit more powerful with all that +spell power that didn’t exist at this point in the game.
---
Loot is not a goddamn reward that officers bestow upon rest of the guild based on personal feelings or whatever.
---
If you don't base loot off attendance (data) and maybe raid comp needs you have corrupt and garbage loot council.
---
If you have members who are raiding but do a bad job that and don't want them get loot your guild itself is garbage.
---
Your devils advocate argument is triggering me a little.
---
but you can´t level weapons in pvp (duels) right? thanks for the clarification
---
What is even the point to these posts....
---
Report them in game if your annoyed.  Posting this does nothing to stop it and simply encourages more ppl to do what you're annoyed about and fills the sub with shite.
---
Dude this shit has been a hilarious element of pvp for 15 years. Go to dusk wood and watch it the other way around, then level up and pvp youself
---
The pixels fade with time
---
My god.
---
how is this possible i see a bruiser right next to him literally in this screenshot you're telling me thats out of range?
---
In retail I have always played a healer (Resto Shaman/Druid.) I rolled a warrior this time around. I don't hate/regret it but I do dislike tanking very much. I mostly play him as DPS but the amount of dps warriors is insane and I can't fault anyone because I'm playing dps myself. I also find getting specific items like HOJ trinket from BRD to be a huge pain in the ass because every other warrior and rogue are looking for it. I've been in groups with 4 warriors/rogues and a healer. I love the class but dislike the popularity. I have always been a shaman/druid so I'm not used to that.
---
And you’re lying.
---
Funny, the guild I joined has more rogues than mages. In fact I was the only mage in the trial run for MC to the point where we tried to kill Lucifron and literally couldn't because not enough decurses.
---
take a close look at the npc name
---
No he's right. Guards not being able to path to you =/= guards not being in range. Is it an exploit to wpvp because guards cant see you?
---
What does that matter? It is still an exploit lol
---
COooool thanks man I'll try it now
---
Ran a Paladin healer in PvP, was extremely good.
---
Fromy my own experience most of my xp comes from killing stuff not turning in quests. I haven't done the math so i could be completely wrong and it could be slowing me down but on my mind its speeding me up by getting those extra stragglers in dungs. I have been grouped with people that will skip Pats just to get to a boss for a specific drop.
---
Yeah, I should've rolled a warrior because none want to actually tank.
---
I never used to be an altaholic, but in recent years, I've become one.  I leveled a Shaman to 24.  Then a warrior to 28.  Then a priest to 33.  Now I'm thinking of starting a new toon.  I had fun with all of them, just want something new for some reason.
---
Undead warlock better for mirrors than orc warlock fwiw
---
If that’s your way of having fun go get em!!
---
Just sounds like you’re crying honestly
---
Shadowmeld Mind Control is 50% of why people choose the race/class combo.
---
KROMCRUSH REPRESENT
---
+daggers counts as hit, essentially. Iirc every +5 is equivalent to 1% hit.
---
If you're at hitcap already, Scarlet Kris is an easy to get offhand (it's crafted).
---
If it's for raiding, so solo Plugger in BRD for a Barman's Shanker.
---
Yeah that’s something I’m starting to learn as another priest, I love being mana efficient but it’s hard when your getting heal sniped by others just spamming flash heal lol.
---
It shows you are telling lies, you said you were doing 900 overall when the single target is giving you less than your overall in general. 
---
Then you assert WARLOCK FIRE-BASED AoE is going to make up the difference... you have a few dog packs and imp packs to AoE and then your back to a single or 2 targets, you don't even know how the dungeon works and you are making shit up. 
---
I am not stupid I am just reading this, like the other 99% of people watching you try to make shit up for what seems to be no reason than to only get mad and call people names when people called you out on it. You need to grow up sir.
---
Just rogue things haha
---
I’m slowly not logging anymore because of this. I rolled a rogue but I find getting groups for dungeons more difficult and takes more effort and time that I actually have to give it.
---
EVen better...root, let it tick out, root... just takes 20 minutes, but 100% safe.
---
Yeah the lack of group play viability outside of following whoever has the fastest build around is annoying, luckily the game plays so horribly that it's not really worth it anyway simple due to lag.
---
Just realized you might have meant rogues only, the little class flair doesn't show on my reddit :( rip
---
Great advice. I’m sure he doesn’t need to support his family with this job and does it because it’s so much fun /s
---
It depends on the raid/tier.
---
900 DPS with that kind of group composition in Kara is pretty good. 900 DPS in Gruul's/Mag's is kind of low. 900 DPS past Tier 4 is pretty bad.
---
It does. You can get the higher level buffs fairly low though. So you’re just seeing big impacts from them at the very bottom of the level range that they can be applied. This is where it’s still hugely impactful on someone out there leveling.
---
I tried this fix already and it didnt fix it. I think someone said it was a recent graphical update that impacted some of the wow classic graphics.
---
Yup, I can see it on wowhead now. 
---
My mate's been talking shit about the runes. But he's also an absolute min/max'er. I can see the usage of rune vs mana gem.
---
I actually want to get this set for my Troll Warrior. Though sadly, I don’t think there’s a single helm in classic that actually looks good for them.
---
My holy priest has briarwood reed, sublime wristguards, and crimson felt hat. AMA
---
Its always nice to go deep prot and try other more unorthodox specs as you can skill and confidence, 11/5/35. Tanking dungeons without tactical mastery is honestly awful.
---
There is two types of gear, mitigation and threat. So you should take all pre raid bis mitigation gear but also get bis threat gear like brigam girdle, painweaver band, hoj. Tanking a dungeon in full defense gear can suck since you dodge,parry so much that you can feel rage starved from not taking damage. 
---
But honestly just dive in their and spam away shield slams, revenge and sunder armors, make sure you pop berserker rage for extra rage.
---
T2.5 is way better.  My guess is these guys didn't clear AQ40, not many people did.
---
&gt; it’s assumed you’ll clear 10/10, even with a pug.
---
I can really safely say that most pugs don't do 10/10 in one go on my server. And i honestly doubt there are servers where it's the norm.
---
Take a shower
---
I know that stamina scrolls don’t stack with power word fortitude and isn’t scrolls don’t stack with arcane intellect but that’s all I can speak for.  
---
I know that’s not what you asked, but hopefully it can  at least help someone else in a google search down the line haha
---
Yeah I know, I'm a Hunter and run it frequently. It takes a decent amount of time as a Hunter, and doing it as a Druid just sounds significantly more time consuming.
---
A horde crying about unfair ganks LOL
---
 if i had a penny for everytime i got ganked by a horde exploiting the roof in duskwood I could buy a bucket large enough to collect all your tears
---
&gt; That ravager will only last mid-40s probably and then be gone forever.
---
thats wrong, we had a guildie whip out his ravager for brd torch room in a full 60 party last night
---
Been running DME lashers with herbs and I'm seeing maybe 35 to 45g per hour. I'm not lvl 60 yet tho so pulling more then 2 packs is dangerous for me and not worth it so I've been just pulling a pack at a time.
---
Assuming a stable raid group ( &gt;80% of the same members every week), I don't understand funneling gear to a select few people other than tanks. 
---
Assuming identical raid attendance.
---
Bob needs 1 more item to hit his raid BiS for phase 1.
---
Sam has been there from the get go and is 1-2 peices off his pre-raid BiS with a couple sub optimal raid pieces. 
---
Bob's last item drops. Why shouldn't Sam get it? Why does bob getting the piece benefit the raid more than sam?
---
Really the only other option is ZA, but these numbers would be very low for that.
---
So yes, clearly.
---
there's about a 1% chance of 20 grenades hitting in a row with a 30% chance to resist. So, possible but unlikely
---
DARKSPEAR NEVA DIE... except when stabbed
---
What level do I actually need to tank Zul'Farrak? Every source I see says the dungeon is level 45-54 (which I tend to read as "be 52\~ to make sure"), but I keep getting random whispers asking me to tank it as a barely 45 Druid. Are these people out of their gourd and so desperate for tanks that they'd have a pet rabbit tank it if possible, or am I reasonably expected to be able to tank it?
---
if you don't have Aged core leather gloves from MC or Muggers belt from DM then Distracting Dagger from DM is best (the one with +daggers on it)
---
If you have either of the + dagger armor parts you only need 1 of them, and at that point Bonescraper is the best dagger to use in the offhand (from UD Strat)
---
technically Felstriker from Rend is the best. but its droprate is so bad i would not really consider it
---
what do you mean buy it? Like pay someone to go with you or?
---
Way to not at all understand what the dude was trying to say.
---
no BC no changes go to BC reddit
---
I've done it below 60 but you need your mana gem. 60 should be pretty easy. I have like 5.4k mana atm.
---
Grats Molson! saw you runnin with it in BRM last night :D
---
Right, I forgot. I remember mana gems and HS being separate cds was so I added that second part
---
The rest is a front-flipping priest.
---
What about Thunderbluff...
---
You sure do carry a lot of soul stones.
---
It's only 12.5 hour shifts, it's the commute that makes it so bad.
---
Known as “safe spotting.”
---
Just report them.
---
With the release of DM, the ring is no longer BiS.
---
Just do tribute runs once you get to 60, and get 2 copies of that ring.
---
&gt;If they could somehow rework Outlands and make it entirely accessible via land mount and get rid of flying mounts, that would be amazing.
---
Why?  People like to argue for the sake of WPvP but as we're seeing *again*, WPvP becomes the exception rather than the rule with faction imbalances becoming evident with every passing day
---
Yes, that's out of range of the guards.
---
That was part of the fun in Aion. Some nice-looking sets were sold by NPC in the opposite faction's town, some were low to high-lvl world bosses exclusives, or crafted with a chance of 1% with extremely expensive/rare resources. And since in Aion mobs don't drop if you're 10 level higher than them, there was a new reason to keep twinks to do world bosses of lower levels. Skins could be sold for more than the item itself, and some were not tradable to make them appear like "an achievment".
---
&gt;You put in sooo many hours to get your gear and some of the items are extremely rare. You really don't wanna look like everybody else.
---
Didn't you have to have the item in order to transmog? If anything it allowed people to use newer gear, but have it look like older teir sets and things, not to be able to make crap gear look like high end stuff.
---
i feel this a lot. i am a prot warrior in a guild one with one raid team. i sign in and most days immediately get asked to run a dungeon with a guild group. im full prebis and have some MC loot, so i dont need anything (except forors but screw that drop rate). generally i feel bad asking for extra loot, so lately ive been just declining and playing an alt. then i feel bad when they need to PUG and struggle through. i've been thinking of telling my friends that im not going to play warrior outside of raids. i love raid tanking, but not much else i want to do on the warrior at this point. would rather level my pvp alt otherwise.
---
I am guessing there is a long commute involved and he ins't working 14.5 hour days, but I may be wrong.
---
you said it man.
---
If you need 19 hours a day to support your family then something is wrong. Simply looking out for his well being.
---
Horse mounts have great sounds. I love how it seems to be tuned to the same BPM as some of the music.
---
* laughs in warlock while crying inside
---
Big up chromaggus crew!
---
/davetheone
---
Meh, still going oom during fights plus drinking less during trash means were moving faster. The MP5 is just better over the long term imo.
---
Funnily everything but Priest gear is regularly dropping for us lol. At least the leaf/eye ratio has been pretty balanced so far.
---
Blizz literally Said exploiting like this can result in a ban.
---
Fairly sure PvP raptor wasn't made available for tauren until 2.0
---
Humans are competitive by nature, topping the Dps charts is a competitive thing. Even if mages are “supposed” to top it, you still are competing against other mages etc. basically humans like winning things and dps meters shows them winning that race.
---
SCURR BURR SHEEESH
---
I love my Druid and leveling it was a blast, but I’m always no nervous to go heal dungeons because of the no Rez aspect. When every DPS seems to have to be a pure DPS class it’s hard to get a shadow priest or a ele/enh shaman to join and not roll on your gear. It’s mainly just my feet of everyone getting angry when they die and have to run back no matter what. It feels shitty and I wish they’d give us a normal res, but that’s the classic experience so I’ve just learned to cope. I barely run dungeons now cause I’m not a fan of tanking at all and my guild where all my fiends are in it has six fuckin druids mostly resto spec, so raids are even an issue for me.
---
The system we used in vanilla was a modified zero-sum version, I don't remember the name now however.
---
We had one person administer it and run the addon (a thankless task!).
---
Each item dropped had a value, usually associated with its item level, but could be modified in the code (vendorstrike comes to mind). The values were searchable on the database that we used.
---
When a boss died, the total value of all the items it dropped was shared amongst all the players who participated in the raid (if an item had a value of 40 points, each player in the 40-man raid got 1 point etc.). There were ad-hoc points awarded for being benched, supplying consumables etc. You could see your accumulated total points (as well as everyone else's) on the same item database as well. I seem to remember a full clear of MC netted you \~25 points with most items that dropped being worth 30-40, with Raggy being the exception.
---
The distribution process began after each kill. For each item, you registered your interest with a /roll (or if you had the addon running, a / command I cant remember), the player with the highest points got the item and immediately paid out the full cost of the item from their own total (this could put people in negative points, a down side we lived with as it was abusable). I don't remember how ties were broken, but we very quickly diverged from players having the same totals and you could "game" the system a bit by "donating" a load of flasks to the raid, or smelting a crapload of dark iron for the guild bank if you really wanted the bindings and all the warriors were on the same total as you.
---
&gt; Scarlet Kris is an easy to get offhand (it's crafted).
---
its not crafted its a rando world drop
---
I mean I play cat right now and im completely geared but this is a TBC meter and rogues/warriors will outdps us
---
9% hit is required with 300 weapon skill  
---
6% hit is needed with 305 weapon skill
---
Yeah, but they have avoided it for months while the other group opted in.
---
Bis is Bis, I wouldn't pass on a bis item and go farm a lesser item so a mage can take it. Unless it's an agreement among guildies
---
So, no.
---
exactly
---
I think there is still space for you to make some new friendships and you can even meet some people you know from long time ago and not even recognize them. In all fairness i also miss the ppl from back in the day. Point is theres always a room for everybody to make friends, thats classic. I've met some great people so far.
---
That's actually ridiculous. And so many horde complain when alliance wants to get a TP into SM as well. wtf?
---
It will certainly not be included in classic.  This feature (though it is a lot of fun), dilutes the identity of gear and runs contrary to the spirit of classic.  Example:  Give me 10 names of items from classic.  Now give me 10 names of items from BFA.  I'm full epic on my retail character, and couldn't tell you even what my weapons are called.
---
Thank you!
---
Just a question based on the answer above. As he writes that +dagger and hit % are basically the same. If I am at 9% hit without any +dagger gear does that mean I dont have to go for Aged Core Leather or Muggers belt?
---
Tuesdays when they all reset
---
for endgame hunter mining / engineering is pretty much given
---
the main should always be engineer anyway, but hunters get extra profits from the crafted ammo
---
and mining will make you a fortune once you can solo dm for guaranteed thorium veins + it synergizes with engineer
---
But still, every day? I honestly think you're doing what you can, just get rested experience and burn through it in an hour when you can. Not like you have time for dungeons or too many quests. Just gotta find someweak, low hp mobs that you can rip through.
---
Tuesday when they all reset

Kill them Molson...Kill them all...
---
I "tanked" it on my 2h fury warrior at 46.
---
Last online: 763 days ago
---
Well he is a male priest
---
Most deep prot tanking builds put 11 points in Arms to have 5/5 Tactical Mastery and Anger Management.  These are such incredible quality of life talents that they are very hard to pass up.
---
The fury prot spec does not have any points in arms as it is a raid tanking spec not as well suited to dungeons.  It also assumes you are incredibly geared and without it your raids dps is threat capped.  Additionally you need +6% hit with racial specialization or edgemasters handguards to even make this spec worthwhile.  
---
No matter what spec you tank in without the arms talents you will miss key near instant abilities as you are forced to dump all your rage when switching stances.  Without rage you simply can't tank.  No charge into WW, no quick intercept to catch a runner or a mob going for your heals.  
---
Outside of raid tanking, you will have a hard time convincing me 5/5 tactical mastery and anger management are not required talents to tank with.
---
I'm a lvl 47 priest. I did a run last night with a lvl 44 bear tank, and I was able to heal him no problem.
---
I’ve been leveling an alt with full arcane damage gear and I can kill about 2 1/2 mobs before drinking.
---
Not really the inverse, its the same idea.
---
It's all about the time spent in the dungeon and xp rate.
---
Bosses obviously have a buttload of more xp than trash so if your group can get to said boss quickly, kill, and reset then in some cases you would net xp at a faster rate rather than clearing each room.
---
It's really dependant on the group and dungeon or run.
---
I understand that, really. But feeling any sense of accomplishment at all from that is a little sad. I wish there was a way I could word that that didn't sound aggressive or mean, but it's just very strange to get anything beyond the mildest sense of satisfaction (to me.)
---
While I dont dissagree with all your points you are focusing on finding faults with Ali and not applying the same ones as faults for horde.  An example wld be your stressing of how good the horde zepp is in STV, you even block capitalised it, yet you don't mention Ali boats in a lot of zones at all, just ignore them.  
---
Like you are not wrong but if you are going to this amount of effort you should be objective.
---
I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that weapon skill doesn't matter in pvp. It's possible that was added post-vanilla and pre elimination of weapons skills though
---
everyone that rolled a tank at launch is 60 and full prebis. wont catch me in a pug even for all the boe drops.
---
&gt; fire pot
---
potions don't give fire resistance. they just absorb a set amount of dmg. for a tank it's not so useful
---
Runecloth bag is way overvalued. You can get runecloth boots pattern from Darnall in Moonglade without contention and level tailoring with that instead.  
---
Runecloth bags don't sell for that much over mats at this point since now hundreds of people have the pattern.  On Faerlina mats are 2.15-2.40g mostly depending on runecloth (6.00-7.15s) and bag can be had for 2.3-2.4g at most times of the day.  There are often times of day the bags are selling for less than mats even.
---
I hate playing my mage, and it's even worse now at level 60. I have been leveling a warrior on/off for a while now, and it's level 32. I have to say that playing a warrior is TONS of fun compared to mage. 
---
Just wanted to put this here, so people don't stop playing whatever they're leveling because others hate it, we all like playing different stuff I suppose.
---
Deviate Delight and Grobb are both RP- PvP servers that could use some Horde.
---
48 unless your doing the hydra boss. Then use consumables and hold on for the kick. 
---
Only reason for 48 is so you dont get over taken by the pyramid event/no true CC in group.
---
If you have a mage 47 and dont move from the top of the pyramid. The NPCs help a ton.
---
So with precision adding +5% to hit, does that mean I technically only need +1% from items at 305?
---
Damn you sound fun to play w/
---
Put some highlights on YouTube!
---
 At 60, I see all the time in LFG: "3 GEARED dps and healer LF tank" 
---
Yeah, a level 58 or even fresh 60 is going to have a bad day trying to hold aggro.
---
As someone who has never played on a pvp server I am thinking about starting an "alt" on a pvp server. I want to play alliance, I'm thinking about gnome rogue, Is that a good class choice considering it will be my first pvp realm experience and i will have no help from a main with gold?
---
Remember to remove that honking tabard for your next gear update screenshot.
---
Do you have a source to back that up? I feel like that is incorrect. I thought it was only if you were exalted or w/e with the goblin races that you could freely pvp in their city.
---
Rogues and +Hit: I'm started to get some nicer pieces from MC/Ony, and running into quandaries about +hit. I'm a human, currently swords, and have 5% from talents + 9% from gear + Human Racial. 
---
I recently got the Bloodfang Hood. With that amount of hit, is it worth replacing the Mask of the Unforgiven? I also got Nightslayer Pants, is it worth breaking my 2/2 Devilsaur bonus (for that +2% hit)? 
---
If not, when? How should I know? I keep hearing that basically there's no amount of "bad" +Hit as the white cap is &gt; 20%.
---
Been happening a lotto me lately as well.
---
I have the game on a nvme drive that’s horridly fast but wow locks up all the time.
---
And here I am over here, playing this game since 2006, and I have never had a BOE epic drop.
---
You do understand that the worlds top PVE guilds choose horde for ehaman over pally right? Due to the amazing aoe heal plus windfury . Not only that but pvp they're better as well. Also, enhancement shammy is better than ret even though both are absolute garbage specs and should never be played.
---
You should have said hi!
---
What in tarnations are your keybinds? Enter, home, insert?! This is madness!
---
Hah, gayyyyyee
---
As do the healing crystals from ungoro sadly (health stone)
---
It's not really practical to stay in Barrens until 30. I guess you could just farm mobs but that's just being masochistic. Realistically you'll need to do Stonetalon and Ashenvale.
---
Even if you do stay there the whole time, what's the point? You may as well roll on a PvE server all you're doing is slowing your own leveling to avoid Alliance.
---
Yep.  Actually split because some play on Benediction alliance but majority on Herod as Ally.  They also don’t use their original guild name but I won’t give out their new one due to privacy reasons.
---
Boy, the reality of the loot structure in this game just hasn't set in for some people yet, huh? I know for a fact that I didn't finish 8-piece tier two until we were in Naxx and I did not miss a BWL reset in early 2006.
---
Echoing this, I didn't play any private servers but leveled 3 60s back in the day and only recall maybe 2 epic world drops ever.
---
Healer haz mana? I haz mana!
---
Right it was a normal not epic one don't remember exactly and when i hit level 40 and got my free mount there was one guy chasing me with epic mount made me accelerate the lvling process.
---
45 is fine for the dungeon - only Gahzrilla, the final bonus boss, might pose a problem. Any lower is dangerous for aggro range. 
---
It's 45-54 because that's how long people usually stay in there. Good dungeon for getting exp
---
If you have a higher level agi buff vs the scroll, it will/should give you the message “a more powerful effect is in use”. 
---
Agi scroll I VS Agi Elixir and what not.
---
This makes me doubt my decision of rerolling horde on this server...
---
I just had to vendor most of the set so I could have some actual bag space in my bank but some day I'll go back and get it all again.  Such a cool set.
---
I'll agree his explanation wasn't very good, but generally dungeons that are geared towards getting XP are ones where you don't necessarily clear all mobs, you clear the RIGHT mobs to maximize your XP. Some examples that come to mind are Cathedral and ZF, both of which require at least one mage to do well in. This is why it's called a spellcleave group, but just so you know, most of these groups wipe for the same reasons you described.
---
I give away free food and water all the time as well. You just shouldn't expect a stranger to give up their time in order for you to save your own.
---
Blatant display of favoritism from the Auctioneers.
---
How my guild does DKP 
---
* 10 dkp if you are online 15min before raid start
---
* 10 dkp per boss kill (10 bonus if its a first kill for the guild)
---
* 10 dkp if you stay till the raid is over
---
* when a boss dies, the master looter posts a piece of loot in chat and everyone who wants it whisper him how much they want to offer, the one with the highest wins the piece.
---
we use a addon called MonolithDKP to keep track of peoples DKP
---
&gt;If I am at 9% hit without any +dagger gear does that mean I dont have to go for Aged Core Leather or Muggers belt?
---
No, you should absolutely go for the gloves and readjust your hit.
---
Nope - that will be released in Phase 6 according to Atlas loot.
---
Yeah sometime weird glitches happen. 
---
I have a screenshot saved somewhere from vanilla where my beastial wrath was glitched for infinite duration. No idea what caused it. Could never recreate it but it lasted for hours.
---
Make history remember your name for the next 3000 years.
---
Summoning Stones
---
Help others achieve the same feeling
---
Damn right it’s a nice dress, brings out his girlish figure.
---
I did but then I didn’t. Started levelling a hunter at launch(long term hunter retail player) levelled to 36 and then thought bugger it I’m going to try something completely different so went priest got to 44 and decided I didn’t want to carry in hopes ship to shaman and got to 38 loved it but I couldn’t help but feel like I was missing something ..... my trusty sidekick so I went circle and went back to hunter. In the middle of all this me and a friend have hopped server so I’m currently levelling s new hunter level 27 atm, spent all day yesterday camping humar and now I feel whole again
---
The best part is most of those bis lists are wrong anyways. Hunters going around trying to get dalrends for example. It was awesome when people saw gear they wanted and went for it. I remember for example in vanilla when Earthshaker dropped wed have warriors stoked for it. Because an epic 2h was an epic 2h no matter what. Well unless it was Shadowstrike which was a meme. 
---
Now I see warriors pass on OEB because they want a rag weapon. I don’t blame these people, I just miss when no one cared about these things. The game was more enjoyable when everyone was a little dumb.
---
Thanks! Glad to have something official
---
Any hunter passing Tier items because of Devilsaur is an idiot, and probably shouldn't be raiding.
---
I have some I could play with, some who I even played with back in vanilla. But they take winning too seriously, so... I don't want to
---
Some of my friends work 15 hours a day (they live in Eastern Europe countries) to support their family. It’s not always so easy
---
Just replace hobby with WoW, problem solved.
---
so?
---
Yeah which sucks because I swear back then in 2005-2006 barely anyone liked to heal -.- 
---
But I did it toward the end of my vanilla raiding and loved it 
---
and now oh there’s a shit load now shit
---
We had that kind of system in 2005 and people just abused the system. bidding lowest amount of "5" on tier sets. maximum ammount of like 1000 dkp on good items vs other classes. It's not any better.
---
I think the correct name is healing wave? Sorry English is not my mother tongue :/
---
But basically, the heal is bouncing to the most “endangered” person in the raid... which is insane...
---
&gt; You think AQ is far away on the opposite side of Kalmidor? My guy it’s the opposite side of the damned planet for us.
---
Yeah what's the route there? IF to Menethil to Theramore to Silithus?
---
That’s pretty cool but I 100% know you didn’t clear it with that gear
---
Good lord how dare you ha, this took me weeks and weeks first time around, solo'd it with my 60 Pala all day every day.
---
Love the set and the instances in general, they've got their own little mini lore that really appeals to me.
---
its also been a banable exploit for 15 years
---
They would probably be the best 5 man tank if they had taunt. 
---
They're the only class that can reliably hold aggro against mages and warlocks dumping aoes. (+50% RF threat vs -30% aoe threat, so they only have to deal 35.9% as much dps as casters to maintain aggro.) That's enough for consecration to provide more TPS than blizzard. They could afk and hit consecration once every 8 seconds and hold aggro.
---
Priests are in higher demand than druids, it's just that everyone had the same idea as you and oversaturated the class. Meanwhile Raids want like 1-2 druids max and yet I still get whispers all the time because they can't even find one.
---
Well, to be fair, I'm pretty sure a good portion of those Horde you are speaking of likely don't even know the transporter exists to begin with :P
---
Then I don't understand how it dilutes the value of high-end or rare pieces if you need those pieces in order to change your gear to look like them.
---
They're not called trolls for nothing
---
Are you fucking kidding me? You disenchant hunter t1/t2? Just leave this guild asap because ppl don't know what they are doing..
---
I know it's not practical, obviously, but it can be done. Alliance really has no such safe zone.
---
Thank you :)
---
Bf hood is an upgrade because its tons of ap and crit. I doubt ns pants are, though, not because hit is amazing but because devilsaur just has so many stats...by using ns pants over devilsaur, youd lose 2 hit 3 ap for 1.1 additional crit and survivability, and I doubt its worth it. Bf pants + ns gloves beat it im pretty sure, though.
---
Did it turn out well ?
---
Oh boy, even the lorde Voldemort himself could not resist that cloak.
---
Yeah I once healed someone and the guards destroyed me.
---
This is exactly what I did. The nice thing about the boots pattern is that it uses basically the same mats as the bag pattern, so if you already bought bag mats, you aren’t SOL.
---
All those fuckers with their children and family lives. It's so disgusting. Yes, I am happy that my parents decided one day that they should have me and I am grateful for that, but I personally will not give up on my computer for children. Thankfully I still have some IRL friends who organise 25 people LAN parties with and who meet up in Discord voice daily to play various games on a competitive level.
---
(I am 33 and in a long term relationship)
---
Blocked a long time ago but thanks tips.
---
Is this on alliance or horde? The raids I've been in have usually had 1-2 priests and like 5 paladins, making me wish I rolled priest
---
yeah it is useless so best thing to do is have a hunter buy their way into the raid if you have spare spots and give them the leaf.
---
Hi pot, meet kettle. Stop being toxic and maybe others will stop asking you to no longer be toxic?
---
I tried using ClassicLFG but it's terrible. What I ended up doing is putting a separate chat frame that just has /2, /lfg, /lookingforgroup and /classiclookingforgroup, all of which are active on my server. Seems to work better than any mod, honestly.
---
Yes, yes, yes, yes. no.
---
Warlock, mage, shaman, warrior. Hunter. Hunter is level 52. I feel so behind being 52 a month in. I have 4 Alts that I decided at around 32-42 it wasn’t the class I wanted to main for then rest of classic. Love the hunter though. Once I get the hunter to 60 and to the point only raiding will improve it, I plan to “main” a Druid on a pvp sever.
---
Yep, Sulfuras is amazing balance-wise as well as high population. You won't have to deal with NEET sweaty's and 10 man gank squads when honor patch comes out like you will in Faerlina, and you will still be able to enjoy high population and strong faction balance in Sulfuras.
---
This is my hope, I want to know the future of classic wow.
---
My rogue just hit 60 yesterday, solo the whole way in 7 days playtime. feel free to DM me questions if you want.
---
Update : we just cleaned MC and Onyxia ! 
---
The guys who left and created a new guild are feeling a bit jealous since they didn't kill Ragnaros =)
---
Yeah I hate playing rogue. You can’t 1v1 a majority of the classes in the game if they are half way decent. Seriously. 
---
Can’t kill a lock, priest, mage, warrior, paladin, hunters is hit and miss, shamans are hit and miss. 
---
Pretty tough without shadow step and cloak.
---
Why they're fatter than most of the world? Probably poor dietary and exercise choices. I don't really get what you're asking.
---
Warrior here. I leveled bow skill from 34 to 274 on MC trash and Shazz. My guild thought it was funny because MC is easy and doesn’t require anywhere close to maximum levels of effort. Tomorrow, I’ll be punching all of the trash to level unarmed skill.
---
I had a Freezing Band drop for me in felwood as well, off one of the Jadefire mobs. Sold it for 450g and got my epic mount the same day :)
---
This becomes real toxic real fast. I remember watching my bro upbid another mage on an item he didnt even want just so later on he wouldnt have enough dkp to outbid him on somthing else.
---
Dkp systems turn into you vs everyone else in the raid. Instead of your guild vs progression
---
Or other classes got the t2.5 helms. I know my guild gave it to anyone without a priority over who got it because we didn’t know better. Even me as a warrior, I replaced my Lionheart helmet with t2.5. You’d think it would have been obviously a bad idea but I went for it. Most of us didn’t value hit at all back then at least not until Naxx.
---
i am almost lvl 60 with my warrior ... the warrior is lucky
---
If your guild kills Rag in 1 minute then it's not a meme, it's the only way to hold threat. But yes, for 95% of guilds it is absolutley not needed.
---
Free drood gear.
---
+5 expertise (which you get from talents) makes the hit cap for yellow attacks 6% (you get 5% from talents).  Against a raid boss 40% of your white attacks will be glancing blows.  If you have 5 expertise from talents and 5 dagger skill (preferably from Aged Core Leather Gloves) these glancing blows will still do about 95% of their damage.  Weapon skill beyond 305 doesnt further reduce the hit cap.
---
There is a guard inside that building. 2 actually. So...how are you outside the guard aggro radius?
---
I've been tanking a ton of BRD lately, still not quite 60, and I stance just about every pull.  The simple fact is, all 3 stances have their merit and there are times each will be the best stance to be in.
---
And Horde structures are generic orc brute appearances taken from DND and Tolkien.
---
You can’t call Alliance generic and defend Horde in the same sentence lmao
---
&gt; Easy access to grom gol for undercity and orgrimmar.
---
I'm a Mage, that's not needed. 
---
&gt; Easy access to BRD LBRS UBRS MC easy to get to Strat and scholo, the only thing it’s not near is DM
---
I take it you didn't actually read what I wrote? Otherwise I don't know why you added the second half of your reply.
---
Perfect explanation. I finally understand haha
---
The sub gives you classic and retail up to legion.  The level 20 accounts are for people with lapse subs or free trail accounts.
---
Or just stick with Thrash, not sure if you're fury or a rogue but for fury warriors it sims 10dps less than krol, not really worth 300g for 10dps imo.
---
9% is the minimum for you to not miss your skill damage(yellow damage), your sinister strike or backstab.
---
However a rogue dual wield and need a much higher hitrate (can't remember how much) to make your offhand miss less frequent. Afaik dual wield hit rate is not high for vanilla gear to cap out, hence general advice is for 10ish% hitrate and then go for crit.
---
In short, with 9% hit, you will not miss your yellow damage but ur white offhand damage will continue to miss
---
Single wielding class just need 9%. Spell hit is another thing.
---
Gross, my healers drink that water.
---
Yes the player in this picture is exploiting, but some people here seem to call “avoiding guards’ sight” exploiting too.
---
that looks epic though
---
That sucks, sorry to hear.
---
Do yourself a favor and find a group with loot rules that explicitly forbid item trading or selling. That still won't necessarily prevent all the collusion, but it should help. If your raid is /roll 40'ing for the Onyxia head, tell the Master Looter that everyone should be rolling on it instead because otherwise it can be awarded to someone who already completed the quest.
---
Not quite.  If you, and they, are IN RANGE of the guards and the guards don't react the person is probably exploiting a safespot.  This is against TOS.  
---
There are however some spots in some towns designed with holes/gaps in guards routes.  This is not an exploit it is intelligent play.  Think BB Inn stairs.  
---
Essentially if guards cld reach you if they were to come in range it's not an exploit.  If they cannot aggro despite being in aggro range (roofs, ledges ect)  it's an exploit.
---
it's not that simple. they didn't even think it was possible at first. poor oscar slaved away for 2 weeks trying to get a working proof of concept build running and even when he got it working it was a buggy mess. this thing was in development a minimum of 2 years before it was ready for launch.
---
Not clearly no, but probably is. 1.2m damage, 900dps, 10 man raid. It's almost definitely Kara in TBC.
---
Hi, I also set up Grid2 + clique this weekend.  
---
I think at first its enough to use the blizzard raid frames for partys. You can use Grid when its time for it on max level.  
---
Clique is very nice for Mouseover bindings. My mouse has 5 buttoms on the left side and I bind Healing Touch with the different rankings on these 5 buttons. I also did this with Regrowth (shift modifier) and Rejuvenation (CRTL Modifier).  
---
I recommend two more addons:  
---
\- Fivesecondrule (to see when your manaregeneration starts)  
---
\- Druidbar Classic (additional Manabar to see when you are shapeshifted)  
---
One more important life saver is Barkskin. If you got this skill and you are in an emergency dungeon situation where some mobs attacking you then use it. Not because the less damage, primary because when the mobs are attacking you and barkskin is activated you have no extended casting time.
---
Also, body builders getting tattoos are playing a dangerous game.
---
It's not because they dont think its good. It's because somthing else is better and they are saving their dkp. It's one of the main problems with a dkp system. No one is gonna spend points on a side grade or slight upgrade if that means potentially losing a Rag weapon or better epic loot
---
Fair enough to trade with a friend
---
I will never join a group that reserves stuff. People should be happy that x items drops and hope they feel lucky on the roll.
---
Does the AV wolf require wolf riding?
---
Except you can tell by the picture quality it was from vanilla. Not to mention others in this thread remember the guild. Weird insult there, as if it’s impossible to have done any of Naxx in vanilla.
---
It's basically a fact at this point that Blizzard purposely makes Druid gear drop more often than any other class in the game in order to incentivize people to reroll Druid.
---
We had TWO Druid helms drop off Onyxia. There was only one Druid in our raid and he already had the helm.
---
Pickpocket can resist which will ruin your opener.
---
i was ~3k/21k with Darnassus as a human before i started turning in cloth. and that was doing 95% of the NE quests. its not possible to do it without turning in cloth
---
That makes sense, thanks!
---
what addon are you using for the auction info?
---
Didnt read the whole post got to lbrs gems and i mean its just for the key to lbrs not needed for ony attune js
---
Eh, would fit pretty well with a slightly unhinged scientist type of deal.
---
The final path to Princess is literally a 5-man version of the Molten Core entrance.  It's definitely the first real gear check in the game.
---
As long as your an Eng you can solo DM. Have a few hunters selling chest drops on my server. They are just in Pre-raid BiS. 
---
Some inv pots and a little pet sacrifice FTW
---
No. You can do all of the extra work outside of raids that you want. It is not a paid position and gear =/= a salary. You still can't down the bosses without 39 other people there. Your guilds corrupt as fuck and entitled officers are using 30+ other people to gear up yourselves and your friends. Kindly go fuck yourself.
---
Yes, loot in classic/vanilla is that "stupid". It will not adapt to your group. The only thing I know of is that Blizzard made a tweak for Classic that Shaman tier sets can't drop for Alliance raids and vice versa.
---
The leaf however will still drop and sadly you can't do anything with it. Some random person will have to pick it up and destroy it, if you want to empty the corpse.
---
This is only relevant on Onyxia thou: if you want to skin the boss, you need to loot everything, including the sinew which has no other purpose.
---
Yes. I switched from Hunter to Mage the day before launch. My goal is to PvP at the highest level possible and playing a Mage is making it much harder to get geared than it would be as a Hunter. Should have stuck to my guns! (pun lol)
---
A day in a half as in 36 hours in game time?
---
Why in the world did you keep running with casters?  Find a melee group that just wants Dal'rends and go with them.
---
Go daggers. Only daggers 1 to 60. Don't listen to those sword loving jerks. Real rogues use subtle yet deadly daggers. Easy to hide under your clothes and apply in tight and dark corridor on naked skin. Cut deep, make'em bleed. Get's the job done.
---
Oh and join RP server.
---
That's the one thing I don't get about wow classic. Play however you want ofcourse, but I do not understand what's enjoyable about deleting someone with the help of 5 buddies.
---
There are 2 guards inside this building in winterapring. Attacking the player exploiting this will cause immediate aggro. Hell, I've even spawned on top of them and thrown a death coil and had the guards aggro. It's a specific spot you need to stand to get it to work. I spent a long ass time getting camped here and reporting a lot of people on my server. Oddly enough, they stopped showing up after a while...
---
Also gonna leave this since this is technically outranging guard aggro: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6nusu/suspended_for_ganking_in_booty_bay_on_a_pvp_server/f0uxk55/?context=3
---
Purification potion : https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17572/purification-potion 
---
I always have some for those 30 mins diseases or annoying poisons.
---
What? Are you saying everyone who's played wow started as alliance?
---
absolutely!  That's the only shortcoming of druids.  HT takes so long to cast.  I'll be half way through casting on someone, and BAM!  They're at full health....so gotta cancel casting....
---
Barman's is main hand only FYI.
---
Yes but who is gonna spend their dkp on a potential upgrade later when  they get better gear when they could save their dkp for an epic weapon drop or better upgrades right now. This is the problem with dkp systems. No one is gonna miss out on a huge upgrade like a weapon for a few stamina or agility on a helm
---
True story
---
Thinking about leveling a hunter but scenarios like this is making my social anxiety spiral out of control even when it's happening to someone else.
---
For those of us who don't know what's going on, could somebody please explain this?
---
If you don't like it, don't join.
---
Yeah, but that makes complete sense.  If you're guild is hosting a raid then of course you reserve items like the bindings/sinew/eye.  I've seen guilds hosting a PUG and basically reserve everything but a few drops for their members.  What's the point in that case?
---
97% is how well you're doing vs other people playing that class and spec. That shows you're in the top 3% of the enhancement shamans on warcraft logs, which is respectable but in no way indicates anything about the viability of enhancement shamans, which is... meh. Your 98% parse was a respectable 400 dps on Gehennas, but that's...basically nothing compared to the top parses. 
---
Fortunately you've found a guild that acknowledges that the current content (and let's be honest, the rest of the content) is easy enough that you don't have to bring a completely optimal team min-maxed to the eyeballs, but that doesn't make the spec any better.
---
In retail, it's more or less worked the same way since its inception. You get an item, and you can now transmog that appearance. Hard stop. 
---
Some restrictions apply: has to be same type or same category (plate mogs to plate, etc), some items are not moggable (holiday items), and so on.
---
There are 2 guards inside of this building in Winterspring. How are you LOSing the guards that are right in front of you? Also: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6nusu/suspended_for_ganking_in_booty_bay_on_a_pvp_server/f0uxk55/?context=3
---
AoE groups work great in dungeons that support it.
---
Any dungeon with easy access to many smaller mobs and room to kite them.
---
SM Cath and ZF are very popular because a group of mages can pull large amounts of mobs and just CC/AoE them in circles. It's low risk, high reward.
---
It doesn't work as well in other instances like Mara or Uldaman.
---
Many people see top raid tanks use fury/prot for tanking, and it's a great spec for getting threat - but it is squishier, and requires good gear. That's not 50% of pre-raid-BiS-good, but mostly-BiS-good.
---
Windfury totem
---
That sounds about right for Karazhan progression raiding.
---
Though you should have 1K dps spriest,mages,locks there then, because shadoweave set is fucking busted until t5.
---
Gotta love people saying "You should not have joined that server..." Well, I guess you haven't joined an English Server on EU yet, right? There's a bit of everything and I don't see people whispering others saying "Spiki inglish or liv, cuz diz server is inglish" piss off, seriously.
---
Raids generally hearth to Kargath and travel as s group there.
---
Not horrible, but your hearth is stuck at Kargath for a long time.
---
It's absolutely not correct.  When she was completely new, my wife right-clicked on some level 15ish horde and got wrecked by guards.  No way a character that low was anything but neutral.
---
Eh, undercity feels like it's in a pretty shit location too. Darnassus has dark shore, ashenvale, felwood, and winter spring close with everything else super far. Undercity pretty much just has silver pine, arathi, hinterlands, and the plaguelands nearby with everything else a really long flight. 
---
Pretty comparable, but Darnassus being an island off the coast just makes every flight slightly longer to even the areas in the close vicinity.
---
recently got an Underworld Band from a mob in STV. Kinda conflicted what to do with it. Should i sell now for the quick gold? hold it until battlegrounds are out and twinks come into play? or maybe... try to trade it for a Krol Blade
---
any advice would be cool, for reference i am a level 45 rogue with just the normal mount.
---
I just iterally made groups this morning with  "no res bullshit" tag.  I guess im not the only one who despises it.
---
This is the right answer I shoot everyone I meet irl  so they can't shoot me first, it's hard to make friends but at least I've never been shot.
---
That sounds like a whole lot of fun! Good vid, thanks for sharing
---
Same. I wanted a raptor and as soon as they made the PVP mounts usable by Tauren I farmed the shit outta PVP to get it.
---
On a separate note what ui addon do you use for your health frame
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
Funny story, I see a guy has a hand of Edward odd posted. Started at 1000g last week down to 650. I’ll buy it if I can get it for 300.
---
Why Darnassus? Wouldn't you take the boat from Menethil to Theramore?
---
I don't see the problem here. I have tanked DME for over +100 groups. Most people just get their bis items and leave the group right after.
---
People get their quests/items whatever and I get mats for my lionheart helm.
---
If I dont need anything else from the dungeon and I would have to share the ore with dps, why the hell would i run the dungeon? You will just leave after you get your items afterall.
---
You are just as selfish, you run the dungeon till you get your items and then you don't bother to help anyone else.
---
One bid. Anonymous. Officer run.  Done through tells so other officers can bid.  One person receives all bids. Top bid wins, pays second highest bid +1.
---
Johnny bids 10, Bruce bids 15.  Bruce wins, pays 11.
---
Johnny and Bruce sent anonymous bids to Gary the guild leader and master looter.
---
I would like to be able to hold my own in solo PVP and a smooth leveling and questing experience, my only concern with gold is not picking a class that would be more painful to level without being able to funnel them gear etc. My understanding is that rogues are pretty gear independent and will be strong with whatever gear i pick up questing and running instances,
---
I've had a set of tank gear, dps gear and heal gear since around level 20. It definitely sucks for bag/bank space, but worth it when you can fulfill any role
---
Agreed. Joined a guildies group, summoned the last two, heard they wanted reserves on righteous orb, left. Apologized to guildy but I avoid that reserve shit every chance I get.
---
All our warriors have one.
---
Levelling is a nightmare.
---
Back in vanilla the full servers were the exception to the norm but now it's rare to be able to level in the evening without having at least a dozen other people competing for quest mobs.
---
Blizz purposely waited until everybody had joined servers and guilds and made friends *then* offered transfers to ''help''.
---
Basically, blizzard aren't the company they were back then. They're always going to push the line between saving money and pissing us off, as far towards pissing us off as possible.
---
Yea that's horde, undead get WotF, I was just saying if you're below 30 and want fear ward and alliance anyway it's worth rerolling just to get it. Not necessary, just worth it if you want it. I've seen people reroll because they ended up not liking the hair they picked so why not for fear ward lmao
---
Mine just gives a message that the player level is too low. I had to make a macro to manually downrank.

Killing Magmadar prevents the patrolling Ancient Core Hounds from respawning.

The patrols do not despawn when the boss is killed, but if the instance is empty for X minutes (I forgot what this number is, sorry), it will soft reset and any patrols linked to the above bosses will no longer be there upon zoning in.
---
Geddon and Golemagg are not tied to any enemies. (The Firelords and golems are all static spawns, not patrols.)
---
It’s easy when you can reach the key board unlike those gnome mages
---
No that’s not the issue, it’s a bug and known exploit, it’s in range. Just shut the fuck up if you don’t actually know what you’re talking about
---
I can heal some ass and melt some face. What more could one need?
---
I couldn't have said it better.  Less stress.  Just everyone playing a video game.
---
I'd rather take some rest/small exercise/water then toilet break with 5 jump runs per hour. Non-stop playing without any breaks is unhealthy and definitely doesn't worth it for simple farming.
---
I still dont understand the backlash about this. Yeah its shitty but if it doesn't interest you dont join?  It's like getting mad people are doing Strath but you need Scholo. It doesn't apply to you, move on
---
Although I have to say just building your group around your needs makes far less waves.
---
This is why DKP is just flat-out stupid. Same with 'loot councils'. Best to just use the in game system with Master Loot, with a 'round robin' in place to prevent someone getting all their loot on the first run.
---
Roll for main spec; winner gets the item. The winner then can't /roll again unless everyone else passes or it's for off-spec (that again, no one needed for main spec).
---
...also, not being in a dick guild. - Just to be sure, not implying this guild is one of those.
---
I do, however, suggest using addons like Roll Tracker or RC Loot Council just to keep track of rolls and who won what....especially if you have to pug a few slots.
---
Should be around:
---
900-1.1K  Karazhan
---
1.1K-1.2K SSC  
---
1.3K-1.5K TK  
---
1.5K-2K BT  
---
2K-3K SWP  
---
The actual progression varies on classes ofc. Only rogues/warriors/hunter can hit 3K sustained in SWP.
---
Again, thank you for confirming that you didn't know what you were talking about in regards to the example you tried to use to support your claim.
---
I do not disagree that higher level players can cause issues, but I would also encourage everyone and especially tanks to use a threat meter because if you don't, even if the dps has a threat meter, they'll have no idea when they're going to pull aggro.  Everyone in this thread may use a threat meter (either ClassicThreatMeter or the Details plugin - I understand they can read each others' data), but I've grouped with many tanks already that do not have one, and it makes everyone's life a lot harder.
---
How much plus healing did you have before 31-20-0, before I got like any plus healing at 60 I did that spec and hated it but now I’m around 450 (with talents) and I kinda want to do it again just to round out as a priest in the world.
---
Not sure what do you mean. If it's a joke, I don't get it.
---
Oh man I feel so sorry for alli once pve hits. You're probably deleting healthbars in a heartbeat with that gear.
---
Get rank 14 or quit
---
i saw 1 drop in vanilla, in dropped during the AQ opening event from the elite Anubis statue dudes in silithus. they actually have a slightly higher drop rate of like 0.0000000002% vs 0.0000000001% like every other mob in the game
---
you can not farm it
---
This is me as a Feral Druid when I try cancelform and dont have mana.
---
As a Mage I legit thought about rolling a proc Warrior just because of the shortage I noticed. It's not all our fault though. All I run into are Warriors that only want to DPS. In Vanilla if you were a warrior you were tanking in dungeons. The game had enough DPS and plenty of melee DPS with Rogues being prevalent.
---
No corrupt loot council sees itself as corrupt. It's not like bunch of assholes get together and take all the loot for themselves consciously. Sure it might happen but is really rare.
---
Corrupt loot council is one who is not transparent and "rewards" loot based on personal feelings of value or attitude. It's absolutely not about what some people in LC value more.
---
You make very clear and transparent rules and assign loot according to those. Loot council only helps with it. There should be 0 personal judgements.
---
I’ve had plenty of orcs resisting my nades. 20 isn’t a good sample size to start crying about bugs.
---
Oh of course. As I said I don’t blame these people. I just miss when we all had different mindsets. Back in early vanilla we thought DW fury was hot garbage. It wasn’t until late AQ/Naxx that people had their eyes opened. Well it also helped that the class changes made it competitive. 
---
As for dps now, OEB is actually amazing for 2h Fury and as horde 2H Fury is no joke. Windfury is &lt;3
---
i remember the one in hilsbrad thats a pretty rare drop off the spiders
---
Could all the whining and ranting about dungeon shit lately be a symptom of the fact that the more skilled players have already flown through that content leaving the less skilled players to bitch and moan about their current difficulties?
---
Also, THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR FLEEING TO HEARTSEEKER. /sarc
---
Come back to Skeram plz. We need more alliance
---
Deep prot is really the only way to go for a fresh 60 warrior, 11/5/35 is the standard. You really NEED Tactical Mastery from the Arms tree to be able to tank with a sword and shield. 
---
Once you get some gear (and your guild gets some gear) then you can go Prot/Fury and dual wield tank, but this is not a viable build for everyone, and I've seen a LOT of people trying this build and having it fail. You need good gear, you need good DPS, you need good healers, and you need good consumable buffs. It's a pretty big time/resource investment to dual wield tank at this point in the game, so I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Rank down your heals
---
If you're sitting in a city you're not doing anything with your time.
---
I was about to make the same. EXACT. Post. Lol! Warlock regret (slight regret)
---
I'm level 60 and my buddy who started playing later than me is at 43.  What level does he need to be so we can play together without his xp being nerfed?
---
/s is key here, watch someone actually just drop game if that happened.
---
Is this true? So why does everybody take Whirlwind Axe over or sword or mace? When the only difference is weapons speed?
---
I carry two sets of gear, one for world pvp and one for pve. I'm still going after Tooth of gnarr for world pvp. 14 Int and 8 Stam would make me survive better in pvp.
---
Except Sentinel Hill is a level 12-15 hub and by WPL even the brokest of shitters will have their mount.
---
yeah man, AV and WSG are so much fun
---
Done and still bottlenecking on mana using R3,5,7,10 Healing Touch
---
They aren't yet, but that's the joke.
---
Why are you running a dungeon you don't need anything from? Why are you ditching groups after you get your drop? You sound like a fun person to play with
---
You kinda hit the nail on the head. I was so gung ho to play a feral tank. And I still often do, but generally when it's with guildies.
---
Pugging as a tank is a test in futility. Honestly, having to babysit a group of people who are just trying to do as much dps right away gets very tiring. It's like they are actively trying to get themselves killed and then blame the tank for not holding aggro.
---
I won't lie, first visit back there after a decade and I'd forgotten the drop was lethal. I did remember that landing on the platform at TB was just short of lethal so I figured, "hey! this is probably the same!"
---
Aye true story. The final few months were really tragic. Aside from the burnout and challenges the game offered, you had people who played together for years who looked forward to down  grading to  25 man raids and everyone dreaded saying to part of our guildmates "sorry, we will probably have 2 or 3 Kara groups... but just one 25 man raid group." It's kind of how gearing a tank and healer core works, and how social dynamics play out.
---
That was the absolute worst time in the game. I hate remembering those times - I even basically quit playing my main and many just rerolled throwaway alts with friends on a "Fresh" server which was coming out to fiddle with and not have to every day relive another few people saying they're quitting the game. Even if the more casual could climb back up the progression in TBC over the months, the guilds would be completely shattered and likely not have space for them by the time they got 70. 
---
It was too painful for a lot of em who were finally in MC/BWL gear, but now learned that all that effort was going away now, and next time we can't assume a 30 man core who is glad to carry 10 due to new raid sizes. You used to be able to not mind helping guys gear in your farm content, and really enjoy seeing those guys finally raiding. I felt bad how the game design now basically carved those people away, and those who saw the writing know the wall just threw their hands up and left.
---
Some of us started there. As a human player, why be a human when you can be a minotaur?
---
Gotta fight for your right to grab that recipe man! They way to get rid of that spot is hit 60 and kill them in that spot.
---
A thousand low level alliance noobs will suffer in hillsbrad today, for those words. Thanks.
---
So this is the problem with dkp. Such a simple problem that will happen results in numerous rules. And there are dozens of these problems. For dkp to work the system becomes overly complicated and convoluted which results in people being frustrated. 
---
Imagine getting anonymously outbid by someone who is supposed to be a friend in a guild. It would be great if we could think these people would be happy for each other. But let's be real. There is gonna be so much salt when that one mage keeps barely outbidding you and you end up with nothing
---
It's not the spec holding aggro it's the player not pressing their buttons
---
I do see what you're saying, aoe farming executed well is good xp. But my main question was wondering why groups doing normal runs would prefer a mage over a melee, since mages need to stop for mana and don't have the benefit of using their aoe to it's full potential. But as others have said I guess the free water is good for other mana users in the group.
---
Still, id rather take a full melee dps party any day.
---
Good to see new players coming into wow. Keep up m8 wont be easy at start but when u figure how the game works ull get better. GL!
---
Report online with screenshots.
---
Chose Alliance because Tauren, Troll and Undead can’t use intact shoes, and Orcs have stupid shoulders.
---
i have no problem joining a group that is reserving something if i just want exp or have a quest for that run. If it’s total bullshit then i’m not joining.  Rolling in gear that wasn’t necessarily tuned for your class, for instance a piece might have spirit and as a warlock i don’t necessarily need that where a healer might, and i KNOW it’s not my pre/bis so i’m not rolling need on that bitch even though it has +2 stamina and +4 armor than my current equip. some people are greedy assholes and don’t know their crap IMO and that’s why they roll on gear not specifically tuned for them. Yes spirit might assist me but that’s not something i really need over stam or int or spell damage
---
No, yes, and yes.
---
Good for you, that doesn't mean you're allowed to talk down about other people for having different values then you. Can you be more productive with your time instead of playing WoW? Yes, but you can say that about anything. Instead of playing WoW clean your house. Instead of cleaning your house go volunteer, instead of volunteering get a second job and donate your money to a cause you believe in. Point is, everyone's experience is subjective.
---
Yeah they’ve banned people for it. Source: one of my Guildford retaliated when they did this to him. 
---
So shut the fuck um and inform yourself
---
Fire does far more burst dps which is important for princess. Also the trick for princess as a mage is firstblast, fireblast, fireblast to keep out of range since you won't have time to cast anything except for the initial pyro-&gt;fireball and the occasional scorch. Whenever she gets close/casts boulder you blink away.
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE...
---
Oof, the hunter tier set is really good and absolutely better than the Devilsaur set. Full 8/8 T1 is pretty much BiS until BWL comes out in phase 3. Your hunters are fools if their T1 gear is getting disenchanted while people are still in blues. 
---
Devilsaur set stats:
---
74 AP, 21 stamina, 2% hit and 2% crit
---
Giantalker Gloves/legs:
---
50 agi (100 AP+~1% crit), 27 stamina, 6 int, 8 spirit, 2% hit, 1% crit (so just about 2% total with the crit from the agi).
---
It sounds the prices are perhaps set too high and people are getting discouraged from buying items. This is why I've always preferred a bidding system with minimum prices. Someone might be more inclined to buy something for 20DKP that they wouldn't pay 100DKP for. Either way, you guys need to rework your system if useful upgrades are getting sharded this early.
---
Don't do that. Literally not an exploit lol
---
Slow isn't fast. If you want to do slow dungeons, say so in the LFG. Most other people find efficiency enjoyable.
---
Am I bitching? Am I complaining? You tell me.
---
This largely depends on your level. E can be done as 56~ maybe, but will be more painful and slow than on a 60. I would not even try jump run before 60 as you gain no advantage from it; a sub-60 will have a much larger aggro radius there and can't really skip much of the courtyard. Tried healing a DMW with a 56 tank since I got pretty decent gear, but never ever again. Missed too many taunts on last bosses. Absolute minimum 58, but would recommend 59-60.
---
SIX spellpower yes. That's what min-maxing is. there's nothing else to do after you've cleared MC and Ony for the week. Go farm Briarwood
---
&gt; EVen better...root, let it tick out, root... just takes 20 minutes, but 100% safe.
---
You might as well dot it up with Insect Swarm/Moonfire before you root, it's not like you can't kite them forever with travel form anyway.
---
I wish that at least one of my friends kept playing ... Years go by and one by one left, each formed his life out of the game, (and me too), but for World of Warcraft there will always be time. Oh God, all of this sounds friki.
---
Portal to IF from wherever &gt; fly to Menithil Harbour &gt; wait forever for the boat &gt; fly to Silithus.
---
There's no waiting for a zeppelin (which like boats can bug out at times) or taking multiple stops.
---
They’re are completely different level ranges.
---
Auctioneer
---
I've seen this system work with no animosity whatsoever multiple times, across multiple games, even EQ where gear is tougher to come by given no instances.
---
Could you expand on what you mean by customisation?
---
People do use basic consumables overall so there is always some demand for mongoose, arcane elixir and so on. The bigger need to measure then DPS/HPS the bigger demand for this suff (and people tend to like measuring their stuff). Key for alchemy is to no spam one potion but to make few of many so that every sells and you can do another herb run. 40g flask price is something we weren't expecting to be as low but the "common" pots have more in-line prices and are worth making.
---
I was selling thorium bars close to 1g/bar while now the price is like 20-40s/bar and only arcane crystals are 30-40g. If you need mining for second proff then it's ok if not then likely it's time to switch after you get crystals for future personal use.
---
HAHA, Who are you!   Thanks!
---
My bet is on rogue since warriors need leather also and especially hoj.
---
Gear is what makes fury tanking better than prot tanking. But in a standard 5-man, gear doesn't matter (as long as he isn't wearing leather). Spec barely matters. As long as you throw on a shield and tab sunder/revenge, you can tank a 5-man.
---
The problem is you're running into bad players, not that a fury spec is not good for tanking. The question of if their gear can support fury tanking has to do with raiding, and there is a baseline hit and crit necessary for fury to out threat deep prot.
---
Just stop already.
---
Wrong sub, this is for people who take photos of their screens with their t-mobile sidekicks
---
OP why are you being so defensive in this thread. Chill out dude.
---
It’s not that much. I farm it together with a friend. 8x Ingot 300-500g each. 50 crystals(farm in DM E) and some little stuff 300-400g. It’s okay to farm if you do nothing else rn
---
I don’t think we’re going to agree that leveling weapon skill on trash in MC equals not taking the raid even remotely seriously. In fact, it’s the 200 IQ move for time efficiency.
---
I love how you could see his shadow before his body hit the ground.
---
Hardly ever see troll shaman/rogue
---
Counterweight actually DOES affect attack speed while in form.
---
What’s there so I don’t have to click?
---
Wow that’s fast. I did a lot of walking and business for my professions so it probably slowed me down a bit. Thank you for the tip.
---
Hah you think you have it bad with dungeon groups. At least that shit is spammable and you can grind out what you need eventually.
---
Wait until you start raiding and there's literally 9 other mages and you will never get a piece of gear ever
---
Have any other hunters on smaller servers struggled to find a guild that needs hunters for their core raid team?
---
Until Blizzard shows me that they still know how to make a good game in 2019/20, I don't want them trying classic+. TBC is fine. Might not play it, because my brother is still burned out by Sunwell 12 years later, and I'm not playing without him, but there are people who would enjoy it.
---
Leave Classic as a time capsule, and try to bring us back to Retail is what Blizzard should do imo.
---
I've never seen my book drop in DM, and the cheapest I've seen it on the AH was for 300g and it was gone within hours. Usually 400G-500G if I see it listed.
---
I don't know how it works. All I know I had a bunch of nines in my bag. Why would I lie about something like that? Not even the most interesting story in this thread.
---
you hit 60 a month or two ago? so you hit 60 by release? sure mate :D
---
I mistrust any healer with this mentality. You want to convey how seriously you take your performance, but most of the actually serious healers have much more perspective than this. 
---
Let me ask you this at least, for my own sanity. Would you roll against a mage on Reed even if they're a guildie?
---
Blame the alliance that left when they had server transfers. The alliance who stayed on Skeram are awesome. Fun pvp targets.
---
* You need to have your pet active and summoned to train it.
---
* You need it to have some free pet skill points (number in brackets behind skill).
---
* Your pet needs to have the proper level to learn that skill.
---
All three of those are dumb answers I know, but sometimes it's the little things that one messes up.
---
Still playing, blissfully unaware of whatever drama you're talking about, wouldn't care even if I knew about it, been waiting years for classic and enjoying every minute.
---
Deviate Delight it ally favored iirc
---
Paragraphs are our friends.
---
I will start with the obvious "easy" (not always so easy, really) solution: find an active guild, and group with 1-2 of those and fill out with pugs as needed.
---
If not that, then make a habit of befriending and adding good healers and DPS and let them know you'd like to do more runs with them in the future. I did this as a healer, and still at 60 I play with some of them! This way you can turn the "4 others" into "2-3 others", which is a different numbers game. Especially if you and your friend are tank+healer.
---
And I feel you. I spent my time leveling up trying to keep those idi...players alive. Finding a guild, more friends of your own level and catching up with your friends should hopefully make things better.
---
Wait, do you think I'm mad just because I cuss a lot? I mean, that has to be it, right? Because, once again, I'm not mad. I just have zero tolerance for morons like you. But please continue to try to troll me.
---
Gone are the days of pugs letting you slap things to get them in line.  Here are the days of mages bitching that you can’t hold threat on 5 mobs 1 second into a pull.  
---
News flash DPS:
---
It takes me 3 melee swings at 1.6 speed so 4.8 seconds for one single sunder.  One single sunder will not hold aggro from a blizzard immediately. I only have 3 taunts on a 9 second/2 minute/ 10 minute cooldown. All of which can miss AND be resisted.  
---
Count to 10 before you AoE is all I’m asking 
---
-signed your very reluctant pug tank.
---
I'll be honest, if I saw a LFG post like this, I would avoid it even if I were prot specced, simply because if whoever is leading it thinks spec matters for tanking 5-mans, than he's obviously an idiot and I wouldn't want to tank for him anyways.
---
But good luck.
---
WTF
---
Don't mean to repeat an often asked question, but I keep finding different answers.
---
I'm a 60 orc fury warrior trying to accumulate pre-raid BIS. What hit% should I be aiming for? My gear currently has me up to 10%, which I think is actually too high. I've seen 6% and 9% thrown around, and several pre-raid BIS lists that actually add up to 10%.
---
I main a Priest and your group observations are pretty spot on. I too have rolled Proc Warrior alt.
---
If It was just the ingots I was receiving for the hammer that would be great! But unfortunately I have to come by them myself. But the server just crafted 2 hands of rag last week so the ingots are scarce.
---
Ya too fat richmon.
---
Yeah no problem! Message me and we’ll both roll a character together
---
Wow, the pattern regularly sells for 25g+ on my server. Qia regularly has 3 people camping her.
---
In PvP both enhancement and elemental are viable. If you get interrupted while casting try to fake cast
---
Yea I use them when I have them. Elemental just has no way to regen mana. Mages have evoc mage armour and gems, locks tap, even feckin boomkins have innervate. Shamans got nothing except fishing for a 10% chance at clearcast.
---
Then you lose 2% crit or 2% hit of you only have the pants or gloves. Wasting lots of dkp on something that's smarter to bank until you get both pieces is just worthless.
---
To me it sounds like the OP has a shit system of minimum dkp bids being way too high. I'm going to dish out the bare minimum (which is 1 boss kill worth) for my hunter tier 1 gear besides a select few pieces that actually are standalone upgrades.
---
Bidding high on tier pieces I wouldn't even equip would just be stupid though. But those items shouldn't be getting DE'd. I'd wager their guilds dkp system is just bad.
---
Surely you used this power to become king of the mountain.
---
U can hit big as a warrior with a sham healer late game you'll be grouped with one for raids but I don't see why you can't play enh sham in end game. We have an enhance shammy or few and they do fine at raids
---
If seal of command is supposedly 7ppm, why does it proc almost every other hit on my fast two hander? Hell, it seems like it actually procs MORE on it than my slow 2 handed axe I had before. I went from the 3.8 speed axe from RFD to a 2.8 speed blue sword, and it seems like it's procing way more per fight. 
---
Also, I've discovered the importance of getting as many hits in as possible that can crit, and fiery weapon crits all the fricken time. Can lifestealing crit also? My friend thinks it does but hes a rogue and theres a million numbers flying up so hes not sure.
---
UBRS is not a real door. You need to bring a special ring. Hence, you can't lockpick it sadly :(
---
We’re not talking about the same thing. I’m talking about the probability of seeing the item at least once in a series of runs. Check out this website for clarification:
---
https://xplainthegame.com/dropchance-calculator/
---
The pants are a bit of a different story because they do lack the hit%. The example given in the OP was talking about the gloves though. And the gloves alone give you the same hit % as the full Devilsaur set. It's easily one of the best single pieces to get.
---
I get a good amount of time to play on my days off, I was just looking for something to maximize the days I am working.
---
They're a very large company and for whatever reason it feels like we're permanently understaffed. Unlimited overtime is their primary employee retention tool. I'm one of maybe three people here that refuses to work overtime. 
---
That being said, it's funny, I'm at work right now (Mondays are my day off) so I can stay home Friday for Blizzcon.
---
Oh I was talking about Brightcloth cloaks. The bag pattern has dropped to about 25-30g, was sitting at over 50 for a long time.
---
Loot council is the best system for any core raiding group. Just be upfront and transparent about where the items  are going ahead of time so there is no confusion when it drops. Obviously officers and people who contribute more to the raid group outside of raids should be put ahead on the drops. 
---
The raid should see progression as them against the raids. Not me against every priest so I can get my gear. If players dont have that mindset then raiding wont be pleasant for them in any system. If they just want their items for themselves or pvp they should pug and roll for loot
---
I got into "tank reserve every orbs/BoE/recepie" strat run. I thought he would take random blue BoE that not a 100% drop chance and random recepie that I don't need. I was freshly 60 so I gave it a try. He actually took every fucking boe green (he said I'm not mage to aoe grind), i decided to stay as it was my fault I didn't understand the rules but when he said on last boss it's going to be master loot as some people like to need on items they don't actually wear ( I'm a mage and last boss drops nothing for mage but rarest epic mount in the game and as he had guildies in this help, it was only me as a pug) I was pissed off. I worked my ass off to run through the dangeon, made close to nothing out of it. Put this guy on ignore list and never party with him again.
---
I wish I had a friend lol
---
I got a new polearm in Stratholme.
---
That's when I realized I hadn't even learned the skill yet.
---
I will take twitch speak every day of the week over “ghetto” stuff I see on Facebook or memes.
---
The entire population of classic is massively horde sided.
---
Has anyone seen Old Cliffjumper? I have a friend trying to tame him and she's been camping for days apparently!
---
It does work.
---
&gt; The other 4 people in the group will surely rather put up a dickhead dps than run the rest of the dungeon a man short. 
---
Negative. You (the tank) takes 30-45 minutes to replace, the dickhead DPS takes 30 seconds to 5 minutes to replace. They will do what you say or they will find another group, you are the leader.
---
The fact there is a shortage of tanks means you have the control and set the expectations.
---
The reason they’re so expensive is because 2 days ago, someone got the second horde side pattern for Lionheart. They refused to work with the person who had the first pattern (and who has already made a ton of gold), so instead the person who got the first pattern is giving away crafts for free now to punish the second person.
---
So everyone is trying to get it made right now, and there is a shortage of materials.
---
Troll Priest, Undead Warrior, Orc Rogue, Tauren Hunter
---
You can go into the "Social" menu, click "Raid" Tab and check Raid info. It will tell you whether or not you have a raid ID locked and when the reset is.
---
Im a resto shaman.  I wish i had the farming ability of a holy pala. Would AOE grind all day long. Im sick of dm e jump runs :(
---
Coke is better than Pepsi because it dissolves nails faster! 7 days compared to 8!
---
*Sir, please step away from the Tauren...*
---
Ok thanks for this info!
---
imagine calling a 85/15 faction ratio server “healthy”
---
Oh that sounds like a broken system. You should suggest people bid on them tbh, because pricing on goods should never be set by the government. I mean the dictator. I mean the raid leader.
---
&gt; but it's very good for the alliance.
---
That's very far from truth :)
---
All of the mitigation talents are early in the tree and don't make a huge difference. If the tank is taking a lot of damage then it has nothing to do with the talents.
---
Fucking hell which book? Priest I assume?
---
People who boycotted Blizzard for their decisions are most likely not frequenting this subreddit.
---
This is a poor attempt at stirring up drama.
---
How is it ok for a warrior that's tanking to roll on DPS gear but not for a druid that's tanking to roll for healing gear? Obviously as long as both of them state it clearly before starting the run.
---
it's easy but slow gold. I can make much more farming Strat than running around looking for plants.
---
DKP decay is essential I think, so you won't have people saving up to get all the loot from the last boss only.
---
We have 20% decay every week, so you are just better of spending them since you are losing points anyway.
---
Seems like confirmation bias.  There are going to be really good and bad people on both.  Though I would say that it isn’t too late to reroll.  Personally I prefer the alliance zones, but that is what I played before.  Basically the same situation as you but reverse.  Ultimately though do what you want.  You shouldn’t need a reason for that.
---
On horde, there is zero competition for plate, so warriors have no competition for loot, get geared up very quickly, then stop tanking for people. It's a serious problem. It's why I love druid tanks, they are far less spoiled.
---
I’ll wipe my tears away with Felstriker
---
You're playing the haunted version of the game. Throw out your computer before the bankers start bleeding out of their eyes.
---
people keep using that term, but don't understand what it means.
---
Feral is hit by the hybrid tax the least. They're actually the best scaling dps in the game in classic, just the itemization doesn't exist. if there was ever a tier 4 gear set that was just pure agi/str leather, you'd see feral druids on top of the meters consistently aside from rolling ignite mages.
---
Yes, he is likely going to wait for a very long time to the point other DPS start leaving to look for another group. Still, that's the only solution aside from "play tank yourself" which is mildly trollish imo. Maybe after long wait he will be more tolerant to fury specced tanks.
---
Unyielding Maul is better because you can put a counter weight on it and most of the time outside of MCP initial use, tanks will just use Bonecrusher for more threat in dungeons and fights where you don't need high armor.
---
Lol what? It's always just been another 5 man to me
---
I totally disagree with you. An easy raid like MC when it's already on rotation is a good time to level up those kinds of skills. And it gives everyone a laugh.
---
It's rude to not discuss beforehand. Whatever your group decides is the only right answer.
---
Why are you puging a ony run bro, join a guild trust me, when you do join one you will fucking love how nice and understanding everyone will be. I was in a big one at first but felt excluded, left and joined a bit smaller one and everyone there is really nice and wants to help me out with my leveling and if i need any gear. Good luck on finding a guild i believe in you.
---
What server are you on? On Herod, plaguebloom/gromsblood are like sub 5g a stack. I do think herbalism is better long-term (as those herbs will go up in price as new elixirs come in and as people tend to use flasks more in BWL/AQ+), but for a short-term gold grind spamming DME jump runs mining might be better.
---
You are spot on with exploiting reset day though. Gfpp prices and their mats skyrocket on teusdays when everyone buys their missing consumables last-minute.
---
Yeah, kinda sucks that scared little babies roll Alliance just to leave. Oh well.
---
There is nothing wrong with Fury tanking as a concept. There is, however, plenty wrong with people playing as Fury tank with no understanding of how or why beyond hearing/reading clickbait headlines about it being popular, or how X private server guild cleared Y instance in Z minutes.
---
Fury tanking is utilized when the entire raid is bringing consumables, the healers are geared enough to spam big heals on tanks until they go OOM, and the DPS are geared enough to kill the bosses before the healers run out of mana-restoration consumables and cooldowns. This is at the very core of why a tank would choose a Fury variation over the more traditional Prot/Arms or Arms/Prot variations—to output more damage at the expense of mitigation in order to allow the DPS classes to go ham.
---
The vast majority of people don't seem to realize this. The healers aren't geared enough to heal Fury tanks. The DPS aren't geared enough to warrant the extra threat from Fury tanking. The tanks themselves aren't geared enough to make Fury tanking worth it. On top of that, none of the current content demands anything that Fury brings to the table.
---
What we have now is a large population of semi-casual players trying to be hardcore hipsters without doing the research first, and groups are suffering for it.
---
First time getting a Jed ID last night, and I win the roll against 3-4 people. Nice feelings all around.
---
Is that why you deleted your post? There are 2 guards inside this building and you need to be on a certain spot on a ledge to avoid the aggro. You cant just freely attack inside of here. Obviously if this were intended, there would be zero guards inside the building (again, 2 guards inside the building) and you could attack anywhere inside but you can't because there are two guards inside of the building. 
---
Two guards.
---
inside the building.
---
you understand yet?
---
Someone was trying to delete the lollipops but you ran in front of them at the same time you clicked on the Auctioneer. Just  UI bug I think
---
You Sure it was only Orcs? After my extended research i think you can resist the nades damage with fire Resi and the stun with it
---
&lt;Tribute&gt;
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)
---
Our main goal for &lt;Tribute&gt; is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.
---
Expectations
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.
---
Raid schedule
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
Leisure time is important. Seems like a lot of people spend an hour or two a night watching Netflix. Most people could be doing better things.
---
Ah right got you. Not been to upper since vanilla so can't remember it tbh
---
This is not exploiting. 
---
Out ranging guards is NOT exploiting, using terrain to gain access to an area guards cannot IS.
---
Depends on the group. Most decent players will only need if they actually need the item, but depending on the dungeon you may not know/trust everyone, so needing has become common place to prevent ninja looting. I don't like that logic, because it's basically advocating ninja looting yourself in order to prevent others from doing it, but to each their own. 
---
Any group I'm in and/or leading, I fully expect everyone to greed unless they plan on using the item. We had Flask of the Titans recipe drop in UBRS the other day, and our lone alchemist was able to snag it because the rest of the group (myself included) greeded, despite the recipe being worth 300g. To me that's the way it should be, and I promise you that when an item YOU need drops, you'll appreciate that philosophy even more.
---
I have to say I agree that this Windsor fellow is an impressively rude man.
---
I had an audience with the king, and the entire court ignored me for what felt like hours. When Windsor finally decided to show his ugly face I was glad to see he got his just reward for delaying my audience.
---
Yes. I have 4 on my bank alt. 200-300g later maybe more depending on demand.
---
you sir are correct, rogue mainhere. But im also currently leveling a war tank.(50s) 
---
and hoj was ninjaed by a resto druid for offspec, of all things. sigh.
---
Id love a classic+ but I don't think we will hear anything about that until NEXT Blizzcon. Maybe this years Blizzcon they will announce more details about p2-p3 depending on questions people ask. But as far as an expansion or classic+ I am positive we wont hear anything until next year.
---
yes definitely. Hold on to it till Phase 3! You could easily get a couple hundred gold for it by then.
---
As stated check the cross faction AH.  It shouldn’t be that much.  The price on the regular Horde AH is almost nothing.  It’s common on horde side because everyone kills a boat load of mobs there.
---
As alliance by the time it is easy to get there all the mobs are grey.  They don’t drop really anything else you want.  Etc...
---
I guess my question was more of, will classic be discussed at all or will it be like the last update video where they touched on it for 90 seconds and then proceeded to spend the rest of the video talking about the newest BFA patch.
---
\^ This.  
---
People form groups with loot in mind, so while they may not be explicitly say "X is reserved" they are functionally doing the same thing with the composition of the group.
---
Tbag is superior
---
How does a warrior get invited to a dungeon and not have to tank?
---
This is how I'm running my raid group, and I've gotten nothing but praise from people about the fairness of it.
---
Upvoted for “suicidal Mages”
---
There are situations where you don't want to take that risk, and for that reason I've never used a macro and have just pickpocketed manually when it's alright to do so.
---
Also what is easier, to state the veins are reserved or have to whisper every dps that wants to join if they having mining. 
---
 It is very simple for me to organize a run where i am the only one who even needs the item i am after which is basically the same thing as reserving, but you cant do this with things like proffessions.
---
Why would you alt tab back in for a bonus 75 damage lol every 10 sec
---
I play alliance on Skeram and regret it every single time I play. The ratio has to be around 80-20 favoring the horde, and they still just sit at BRM instances with 20+ people camping for no reason. Hopefully they aren’t shocked when everyone on alliance transfers off
---
My personal gripe is lvl 60 priests mindcontrolling you to suicide, either by running into mobs or by jumping off a cliff.
---
I have tons of bag space as a hunter. Quiver for ten arrow stacks.(usually 14). My pet eats conjured bread. I have about 40ish slots left.
---
More of an impactpredator.
---
This was me last night.
---
Ooh new weapon, can finally replace the shit I've been using for 13 levels. This will be a huge boost.
---
I can almost kill grey mobs without using consumables.
---
couldnt care about politics, playing the game I love! :D
---
I'm conflicted on your response but I don't want this to come off as me just arguing with you.  You made the choice to be prot warrior, nobody forced it on you, you prot for whatever reason.  Yeah that makes you less pvp viable, but that was your choice to make.  But as a result, other players have to pay the price of your decision to spec as prot in one way or another.  In this instance, it means they can't mine any of the thorium veins.  Another way of saying it could be "if you play with me you don't get to be a miner, I'm the only one allowed to mine anything unless I grant you permission because it's not something I want".  Is that how it is? The counterpoint could be that people who are miners just don't have to play with you, but that's kind of my point.  That sounds kind of selfish and shitty doesn't it?  "I come first, I get what I want otherwise don't play with me".  What if you don't need anything else from the dungdon, all you want is the mining, and YOU'RE running THEM through, then your payment is the mining.  Why would people want to have you as the tank?  Is that how it works? Either you claim the veins or you find a tank who doesn't care about the veins but might need some gear.  Basically, you only do something if it is guaranteed to benefit you, right? What about those people in a group who need to roll against other players for something, and they lose the roll, and then went through the entire dungeon without getting a single drop.  That was just a complete waste of time.  But that's for those lesser people, not for you, right? You dictate what you get and if anybody has a problem with that, then they don't get to be in your group.  That's how it sounds when you break it down.  Maybe you're OK with that, maybe it's not an issue because there's technically an infinite amount of groups being made for X content.  I don't know, it just feels very different fr how it did back in vanilla.  It definitely has a "me before you" vibe rather than a "we're all in this together" vibe.  Maybe I just need to find a more wholesome guild and exclusively play with them, I don't know.
---
It ain't safespotting
---
I found the butcher, how much will that go for in the future?
---
So, uhh... Y'all recruiting?
---
It is 2019, report trolls for racism, that is what people do all day on twitter anyway.
---
Assuming you are playing a pug there are no general agreed upon rules so I'd suggest to agree on rules before starting the run. That's the only safe way to not get ninja'd or have people get mad at each other.
---
Horde OSHA sucks.
---
Flipping Vulpera!  *Vulpera!*  They are barely sentient, for Pete's sake!  What next?  Playable Gnolls?!?
---
No it doesn't.
---
Not sure you CAN pull the dogs in packs of 3.  There are two groups linked together of at least 5, maybe 6, and they often pull each other.
---
I've tried to do this without relying on ice block and had zero success.  They get too spaced out and occasionally sprint through blizzard so fast they don't get slowed, or only get one tick of damage.
---
It would take change that a lot of people consider radical these days, but Legion was headed in the right direction for me. BfA ruined all that good will Blizzard had gained, though. I'm gonna need to see a lot of change for sure, and with Classic here, I'm definitely not playing it until I'm full Naxx bis if that ever happens, but I could see some things that would bring me back.
---
Whether Blizz will ever do them is another story.
---
Yup. I have 60 alliance and I skipped STV entirely.
---
Sounds like you gotta be assertive bud, if they don’t like it, let them find another tank, tanks are rare, DPS isn’t :) you’ll always find another group
---
Explain how killing a player in a neutral town in a manner that won't get you attacked by the guards isn't safespotting.
---
Luky :)
---
No one boycotted blizzard, some just pretended they did for internet points.
---
I go with Theramore, because of the faster access to Onyxia.
---
Yeah, it's mostly in response to that guy that thinks mages just gets #1 dps as a class-given right, and has no idea how competitive it is in a guild setting where you don't have 25 deadweight dps. (While, if you're a healer in a competitive guild, you can go braindead afk spam flash of light or flash heal as MT and get through any encounter, since all the bosses die in under 45 seconds.)
---
From the bottom of my tank heart, thank you.
---
Too often I run into healers who will keep misbehaving dps alive out of some sense of obligation. You need consequences in order to reinforce good behavior and stop bad behavior. Repair costs and dying are those consequences.
---
Tbh, Westfall is a bad choice for 10-20 levelling. The only reason it's popular is the Deadmines, which you have to come back for after spending some time in Redridge because you ran out of quests at level 16. 
---
If you're after a linear questing experience, the best choice is Darkshore. It'll take you from 12-20 without losing a sweat, and leads you straight into Ashenvale for some sweet 20-30 questing (although 1-2 levels in Redridge is still a good idea). The only downside is the Wetlands run.
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/SilkyGloriousEggPJSugar](https://clips.twitch.tv/SilkyGloriousEggPJSugar) this one
---
? but why? lol.
---
Shaman. Shaman gear always. Two tier 2 shaman helms at only last night. 1 shaman in raid.
---
I started Horde and stayed Horde through cata, came back to legion as horde.
---
I'm alliance in classic.
---
thats exactly the mindset that ruined wow
---
You open a Molson Dry.
---
Also monsters pvp healing wise
---
It will only list the raid you are locked to under raid info. If there is nothing there you are not locked and are safe to enter a new grp. 
---
There was a bug that could make you locked previously by killing thrash (on a fresh ID), but they have recently patched it.
---
It is the one spell you're always waiting to use when it's about to get off CD. When it's off cooldown before an aoe pack I will drain my mana with double flamestrike w/ presence of mind then coc and finish with arcane explosions then get all of it back with evocate. Favorite place to do it is before pyroguard in UBRS lol.
---
Main is either mage or druid, love it. But mages during raids are kinda boring, it's literally just frostbolt. For this reason I've focused mostly on pvp and raid healing as a resto druid.
---
Well, the GM asked me to do a repair, which I did, but he seemed to do something on his end before. And 99 999 is possible, silver and copper were both 99 so I just remember a bunch of nines.
---
He got it shortly after he got here, according to a post here.
---
Had a druid dps tgis past weekend who didnt want to wait. We were doing a maraudon run and were at the govlin boss. I start readycheck while the other 3 members are drinking. Druid charges in before the other members selected ready, so i watch him as he dies, then start tanking his mess and trying to clean up. Would have kicked him if it wasnt the last boss we were doing.
---
December 2020!
---
What? Devisaur is better than t1 for hunters? Check again...
---
They don't want to waste their combo point s
---
Made my first ever Char as a Tauren Warrior Tank to play with my friend. I like axes and want to make an annihilator. I wish i rolled an Orc instead for their passive. That is my only regret.
---
I just felt really old hearing "when I was young during cata"... but then again I tell my 10 year old that I've been playing this game years longer than she's been alive. so Maybe I am old.
---
The point is you shouldn't give him input that implies it's in any way efficient as it is not. It's a time waster to be a herbalist at this point of the game. I am saying it as someone who tried making money of it. He is better of just farming ZF as you say instead of running around wasting time to get herbalism to 300 anyway.
---
On the add-ons screen on the main character selection page, you can select each character from the drop down in the top left corner and enable/disable whichever add-ons you want to said character
---
As a noob feral druid I spent long time re-up ping my new weapon class every time I changed Eapon before realising it was usuless
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe my server, Sulfuras, is about even. Last I checked it was and it certainly feels that way.
---
Depending on exact level Ashenvale or Thousand Needle.  Make sure you do BFD for the wand that is reward for a quest there.
---
Have you got an example dungeon which this happens? I could explain how I do certain things.
---
&gt;No, it's two groups who have fundamentally different ideas of WHERE in the gameworld they want PvP to be limited to.  
---
&gt;Players are still the same when in BG's.
---
The players from the PvP servers will have more experience with PvP than the Players on PvE realms. 
---
If you end up in a BG with 9 people from a PvE realm, against 10 people from a PvP realm. You are likely at a disadvantage.
---
Heartseeker is where most of the Alliance went in my experience. Heartseeker was a pretty balanced server before they opened up the transfers and now it's 70/30 in Alliance favor.
---
also the issue is 40 man raids. our guild raids with 2 tanks, 10-12 healers and rest dps. divide these to 5 man groups, and you get what you tought of: 2 group get tanks whule 6 are without it. ofc you could ask a dps warrior to do it, but either the aggro/survival wont be the same -youll blame him / burn out. our you could let a feral raid, but most guild ls doesnt let it. but thats just 1 more tank. this is one of the reasons Idont like 40 man raiding.
---
&gt;How is it different in the context of a battleground lol?
---
Even mitigation it is not that much better than maul, only 46 more armor and defense is garb, not until phase 5 with 25 agi ench will staff be marginally better for mitigation. By then I'll probably just use AQ/AP weapons.
---
In the 20+ runs I did to get ravager I must have seen at least 10 helms drop
---
I’m switching back and forth too! Loving my lock but damn, the warrior feels like it just has far more potential.
---
Or players need eyes
---
Their argument is valid. No serious raid guild is bringing arms Warriors right now because above reasons.
---
However, content is also super easy so all of that is not neccessary (yet).
---
You should be talking to your guild mates and not us :)
---
LFM BRD, fun on reserve.
---
I’ve looted 2 from the ogres in burning steppes, it’s all random but this was my experience.
---
Turns out thrash blade is actually better anyway
---
It's easy to say this and that, but until you try both factions, which I'm sure you have, it's hard to dispute the fact that horde has much better/easier time leveling up.
---
I’m having the same problem, I figure that dungeons are pretty anemic for gold even if you get a group so it’s not so bad to not be able to get groups on demand.
---
You should look into solo/duo farms, for instance DM:E can be solo’d/duo’d, and provides a good return, despite taking some skill. 
---
Another spot is Tyr’s Hand, with a good dps or even a hunter you can generate 20+ gold per hour no problem and if u get lucky you can hit 40 ish
---
I farm it too rn (alone with a friend). It takes a while. we need 4 more ingots and some arcanite bars (we get 3-4 each day)
---
What a scandal, this guy deserves a life long of losing rolls.
---
Yeah, I don't want BC. I don't want to evacuate the cities.
---
I want:
---
* an instance in every zone
---
* Monthly quest chains that you can complete in 10 hours of play designed so you need to read and explore, quests that take faction and guild communication and co-operation to complete. Put quest material drops on Instance bosses that only drop if everybody is gaining XP in the battle.
---
* Put in quests that take a lot of long searches. There are tons of little location details, but add more. With hundreds or thousands of possible spots but with a specific spot for your character so looking things up online will give you a  list of possible locations (can't just stand next to one and wait. If that spot doesn't have your item, move to the next). Give reasons for a class to explore another class's location, etc.
---
* Give us more reasons to constantly comb the whole world and all it's amazing sites.
---
As someone who plays on the server benediction I swear it's priests all the way fown
---
I’ve killed this asshole 30 times and haven’t even seen the reed drop one time. I have three level 60 accounts that I use to fish for him and a bunch of helpful guild mates to clear to him when I get him up but I think all of our patience is wearing thin on this farm.
---
As I said in my comment, funneling gear is pointless in classic because content isn't hard enough, however, in retail, if the best player completes his set with the best traits, that could be the difference between 50 and 400 attempts on a raidboss, potentially saving the entire team 50+ hours of constant wiping, and that's where the idea of funneling gear came from, when people actually had a hard time completing content.  
---
As I stated in my comment above, I think a LC+Roll system is the most fair, as every player should be pulling their own weight and have a fair shot at getting loot. If Sam and Bob are rolling against eachother and Sam loses, that's just the way it is, and you know what? Next time the item drops, since Bob already has it, Sam knows for a fact that he's getting it, keeping him very motivated to keep going to raid.
---
I didn't see your flair lol, I guess I'm a dumbass.
---
I smell alot of treachery with this mace so early..
---
For me and I want to believe most people are this way. DPS meter is a good way to measure your performance.
---
Best way to experience classic is to take it very slow. Thats how you find fun in classic, im about to have two characters become lvl 50 soon, and im fucking having a blast, extremely fun, funner than any other game i played. The reason you’re bored as fuck rn is because you decided to rush to 60 all because you saw some whale get his epic. Thats how you truly killed the fun of classic. What i suggest of classic is to probably make a new character, if you dont want to be camped than reroll on a pve server.
---
If you are constantly having issues maybe you are the problem. I only had great experiences so far and I only had like two-three dungeons total end in a disband before we finished it.
---
Nah ravager only good in group pve or farming. You need the stats from WW
---
Whats wrong with opening with ghostly strike?
---
Really agree with the sentiment of your post. Tanking doesn’t feel like an easy job and one that people want to do for the reasons you’ve mentioned.
---
I often think about rolling a tank but don’t out of worry (prbly misguided?) that I’d get a load of crap and grief, and who wants that in their spare time?
---
Self own there, but its my mana AND I NEED IT NOW!
---
Hmn interesting,  I thought  you could use the Staff of Jordan  until 55 or even 60.
---
I'm having a hard time seeing a situation where it'd be a game over. I don't macro it to sap so for pulls of two it's a non-issue. The idea is to save time when you're leveling by making it one button seeing as you grind thousands of mobs on the way to 60. To each their own.
---
Same, got mine last night. First thing I did was charge a turtle to show off my shiney new axe and ended up needing to be saved lol
---
This only works in a nonscarce environment.  If push came to shove and you wanted to form a group for X whilst also excluding certain classes so you have a guaranteed roll on a drop, and nobody BUT those classes are willing to join your run, would you just forego the run entirely and not risk rolling for it?
---
Worst dungeon in the game. By far.
---
But speaking of, I need to farm that bomb ass water breathing staff from there.
---
I have a guildy that keeps letting me know when new Shadow Wrath meme greens are on the AH.  Its like, nah I'm good.
---
So, it was 99g 99s 99c. How is that even a big enough amount to warrant getting in touch with a GM?
---
I smell BS.
---
Honestly you're coming off as someone who is extremely butt hurt and sound like someone who is probably a carry. 
---
It's not sad to feel a sense of accomplishment after putting in time and effort to be the best you can be, since in a raid environment even with a brokenly OP class you still have to put in effort to be top or near the top of the meters. If you are up against people with similar classes and gear it makes it even better, especially if you can top meters while dealing with the mechanics.  
---
Not all fights will be friendly to certain classes, some fights the melee have trouble, some the ranged, some classes with poor mobility have trouble, so having a meter you can gauge how well you're dealing with everything. 
---
At the end of the day, more DPS is better and helps the group overall, and while DPS is a dime a dozen, good DPS that tops the charts and handles mechanics (aka doesn't tunnel) is often hard to find.
---
As elemental those 5 points in cheaper totems is great, when the grp you are buffing move and I'm starved for mana anyway. Good post.
---
he got bood
---
cus he pood
---
in the nood
---
(how crood)
---
Why? He should be punished, this is strictly considered exploiting. They even made public announcements about this not long ago. If you’re in an area with guards and attacking players from a spot in which the guards can not reach you to defend the area as they are supposed to, it’s a ban-able offensive.
---
This image gallery has been really useful for me in picking grinding spots:
---
[https://photos.app.goo.gl/QngnsykrAs5iGV2S8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QngnsykrAs5iGV2S8) 
---
It has all leveling zones with detailed pips showing the level of every spawn point, so you can select areas within each zone that have the ideal +0 to -1 vs. your level spawns for grinding.
---
It doesn't unfortunately have the flight paths marked, but you can check the zone map on wowhead to see where that is in each zone you're looking at, so you can get an idea which are closest to a hearth or landing spot. In general anywhere that has a FP also has an inn, but there are some anomalies like Un'Goro Crater where the nearest hearth is in Gadgetzan and in-zone you only have a camp with the FP.
---
For weekday mornings before work I choose a reasonably close inn in a town or city with all the facilities to hearth to and then fly / ride to wherever I am going to grind. But I have a little more time than you and my short sessions usually are 45 minutes to an hour.
---
As you level up in order to minimize travel time you will need to focus more on what are the best spawns within a minute or two ride or very short flight from your hearth, even if that means green mobs. Fortunately the green range gets much wider as you get into higher levels. Normal XP for green kills falls off sharply, but if you're always only grinding on rested that will offset it enough that you should still do ok.
---
For your specific level, I did all my grinding at 40-41 in Badlands (Cats / Wolves) and STV (Raptors). They're nice easy to fight mobs and reasonably spaced so you can always get them 1v1. Badlands is not ideal for you since it has no FP or hearth and you have to ride from Loch Modan, which is not short. You can find plenty to grind on in STV at 40 as an alternative.
---
From 42-48 I spent all my time in Hinterlands, which starts out with level 40-41 mobs just steps outside the hearth spot in the Keep. The dash will get longer as you move west for higher level spawns. You probably can stay in Hinterlands all the way to 50 or 51 if you want, ending up with Snapjaws on the eastern coastline. Generally its a very quiet zone especially at off hours so you should not have much interference.
---
Beyond that, Un'Goro Crater is probably your best bet for the 50-55 stretch. No hearth, but the flight from Gadgetzan is not long. It's a big zone, but the only major obstruction is the big hill in the middle, so you can beeline straight from the FP to your chosen grind spot each trip.
---
Alliance 1-25 feels very well tuned for difficulty-if-you-want-it, encourages grouping because camps consistently have 3+ pulls or are just otherwise ridiculously dense.  But those same quests can be done solo if you wait around picking off the couple solo pulls.
---
Horde 1-25 feels way more relaxed and solo-friendly cuz most quests are in areas where you dont have to pull more than 1-2 mobs if you dont want to.
---
I also greatly enjoy the lack of "go run to 17 inns delivering mail" quests, horde ftw
---
Huge difference between pandering to one persons likes/dislikes vs making the same humble brag post over and over again for months on end.

Getting Crit by Bosses Sucks: A Feral Druid Story
---
The reason feral isn't very good is because they can't block. When you don't block an attack, there is a chance you can get crit. If you get crit a couple unlucky times in a row, there's not much a healer can do to keep you up.
---
On top of no defensive cooldowns and very little scaling through the tiers, feral never comes anywhere close to warrior for tanking. You can try it, but it will always be subpar.
---
They aren't and they aren't.
---
What did you do now? You stand outside of orgrimmar and enjoy all the attention!
---
You don't understand one simple thing. Let's say there is 15 groups fotlrming dm:e right now. Just regular groups with standard roll. This guy said I'm going to sit in Ogrimar doing my business or I can tank DM:e with some shit on reserve (tanking is not always easy as you have to work harder than average dps who can slack or afk for some pulls, even if I understand your point that he chooses to be a tank). Basically he can help 4 other people to start a group faster as tank are always hard to find. If you have mining don't go with him. It's pretty simple. I don't know if your server is that bad with reserving but I only ran one group like that and said myself never again. I don't want to be part of this kind of group but I have many options. Why complain?
---
Oh I'm not trying to downplay how you feel about playing warrior, it's just that I only saw comments agreeing with you that playing warrior sucks, so I wanted to come with a positive side, if someone scrolls past and read the thread :P
---
Different servers/fractions can defiantly make this really easy or very difficult. I'm Alliance on Skeram and finding groups for dungeons lvl 50 and below was becoming a pain. I'm lvl 50 now and couldn't be happier. It was getting way too quiet.
---
I re-specced to Prot so I could play with my friend who was also a Holy Paladin.
---
Paladin Tanking really brings a whole new level to please give me a second for aggro lol. I’m still new to it, but if something gets pulled off me odds are it ain’t coming back
---
And the guy who got both Bindings got downvoted into oblivion.

But Scarlet Set is always top of the reddit.

300 weapon skill 9%
---
305 weapon skill 6%
---
310 weapon skill 5.5%
---
Long Answer:
---
The "soft-cap: for hit is related to your abilities and not white attacks.  After abilities are "hit-capped" the value of hit goes down somewhat.  It still has value because it will increase your auto-attack chance to hit, but it's about half as valuable.
---
8% is the hit cap with 300 weapon skill when attacking an enemy 3 levels above you.  THe problem is if your weapon skill is &gt;10 level below the arget defense, your first +hit is ignored.  Raid bosses are all considered Level+3, so they have 315 defense.  You will not miss your abilities more than 8%, but te first +hit % is ignored meaning you would need 9% hit to be ability hit capped.
---
If you make it to 305, you are no longer &gt;10 weapon skill below the target's defense so the first 1% is not ignored.  Also weapon skill increases you have to hit.  Those first 5 weapon skill are effectively worth 3% hit since it gives you 2% hit and no longer ignores the first, meaning you only need 6% hit.   If you manage to get to about 310, then you need about 5.5% because weapon skill's values diminish pretty quickly.  I think people have determined 308 weapon skill to be the magic point, but anywhere from 308-310 is fine if you can't get it exact because you can get the weapon expertise talent for +5 and then one item with +daggers to be in that range.  If you are swords, you can hope you are human or wait for Maladath.  There is no reason to have more than one +weapon skill item as the value has diminished massively by there.
---
Wasn't WW (I'm a few levels past that point), but some things never change.
---
To be fair though, an hour later my weapon skill was only 15 points below max, and I was killing same level mobs just fine.
---
That is correct.
---
This is SO dumb.. I'm a Rogue and my server is DEAD! Sul'thraze Brazil.
---
Players, specially ROGUES complain about not doing dungeons ALL THE FUCKING TIME.
---
Dude. Stop.
---
You're a dps, its hard to find a spot, specially in a dead server.
---
So... WTF do you do?! 
---
TAKE FUCKING ACTION!!!
---
Wisp one of your guild tanks/wars/druid and ask this simple question "Sup dude, WHAT DUNGEON DO YOU NEED?"
---
THATS FUCK IT!! Now you have a Tank for the X dungeon, find a shitty healer and even shittier dps and FUCKING GO!
---
Take action, don't sit around in Org/SW complaining in Trade or LFG that zomg server ded plz blizz fix it!!
---
Be the change. Stop QQ.
---
Only thing I regret is NOT rolling mage/hunter 1st and THEN my main, so I can buy 100% mount without any effort at all.
---
That's why I wouldn't bother putting points into sword spec until 60 or atleast around 50 when you know you're set with swords.
---
I can't find groups for hours as a healer sometimes. It's nuts. Makes me want to alt a tank.
---
Having played both alliance and horde in vanilla, I constantly confused quest amounts in zones. Playing horde now, this makes me realize I wasn't crazy ... Burning Steppes + Searing Gorge are basically Alliance Zones.
---
Pat is that you?
---
Dear tanks,  
---
This might scare you. Sit down.  
---
Are you ready?  
---
YOU GOT THE POWER.  
---
There is a giant shortage of tanks. Do the scary thing and talk to people who perform well, make friends with them and invite them once you need their roles.  
---
As a healer I have around 8 non guild tanks and 6 guild tanks who I can wisper. We kept in touch, sometimes they even ask me!  
---
Invest in your reputation and all your troubles will go away :) I find myself running dungeons I dont even need for gear, just for the gold (drops) or helping a friend/guildie.  
---
Now that Im leveling an alt these people are Always there to kill an elite, ganker or boost me trough an instance.  
---
its a social game, play it.
---
Except it's a reportable and bannable exploit.
---
If I get invited I’ll tell whoever whispers me or who advertises. I’ve never been denied because every LFG request seems to be for tanks. Then once the dungeon starts I’ll remind them. It’s worked out well so far.
---
I edited it in probably after your post, but even one Mage is enough. There's just so many fights that favor them over a Warrior, Hunter, or Rogue to a high degree, and few that swing the other way.
---
Yes, because DM has a SP Trinket for Mages...
---
Honestly as **great** a place as warriors are in at this point, a part of me does regret it.
---
I rolled fury warrior again because I played a fury warrior back in vanilla, played it for years in between and still think it's the most fun class and spec to play once you get gear. But it's also a pain in the ass to level and all the things I already know I hate about being a warrior are still there. Then there's everyone and his mother rolling warrior and making it harder to get in groups with more competition on gear, as well as acting like complete knobs because they've seen the warrior logs and think they'll be the second coming, if only they could get that gear they need (which they definitely deserve because warriors are the best). Being a warrior is starting to feel a bit like being a 'gamer' where the shameful actions of a loud minority makes giving myself the same label feel dirty.
---
I've spent more time as a warrior than I have at some jobs, and I'd be lying if I said I don't regret starting it all over again at all, but at the end of the day it's still my class. I don't hate it, I just...have regrets.
---
I think for most solo farms your pet does not really do damage. You kite and do damage.
---
It's been so long, what was the global nerf?
---
What does this information mean? Someone dropped this data into chat this weekend, and I couldn't figure all of it out.
---
What head piece is that? Surely not the epic one from ambassador flamelash in BRD? If so, I’m jealous and want it on my mage. 😑
---
Difference is that Onyxia is the only real attunement as in MC and later on BWL are only quests so you get a shortcut to the raid instance.
---
Without doing the Onyxia attunement, you straight up cannot get in.
---
If you get efficient groups and do all BRD/LBRS/UBRS quests and/or elite EPL/WPL/winterspring quests then it should be "fast".
---
Its even worse for Paladins as they have no melee abilities to spam.
---
It's not wrong to have fun the way you want to. But I am not wrong in any sense.
---
Hunters &amp; idiots name a more iconic duo?
---
Big grats from &lt;caffeine&gt;! Funny that both you and Pookster both have the mace and helm :)
---
I mean, other companies and even politicians formally came down on blizzard for their decisions as of late, so I'm not sure why you're being insulting and misleading.
---
I was, lost almost all to healers ;)
---
None of the relics for Paladin/Druid/Shaman arr in the game yet.
---
I got you beat on that, rolled 1.
---
You're gonna need 7000-12500 gold depending on the server, phase 2 is out in december, so you're looking at 200-250 hours of farming in 1.5 months, so it will pretty much require the same time as a full-time job, assuming you're paying for all of it yourself.
---
Seriously, how does everyone have this weapon now? I thought it was meant to be difficult to get???? Like 6+ months of farming and shit
---
Are there even enough Ingots available on your server to do so? I fully expect P2 to come out before the end of Nov.
---
One mage runs winter's chill, no one mentioned it in this thread so I assumed we were talking about a regular mage and not the minority of mages. 
---
At the 99th percentile, melee dps outdamage ranged dps on rag. If you look at the logs of any good guild, you'll see that melee dps is stronger than ranged dps, even on rag, most of these rosters only bring 4-5 mages and 3-4 locks. They're easily one phasing rag. 
---
Either way, please stop giving advice on shit you know nothing about. This is not how you maximise damage on a mage. This isn't how you play a mage in raids at all. If you find yourself using health potions (??????????), bandages and wasting GCDs on defensive abilities regularly, your raid is shit. This is the definition of a dps loss, not a dps gain. 
---
I don't know why I open these threads. Mediocre players giving mediocre advice to mediocre players, and then acting like they're some kind of authority. Get good, for the love of god, please get good.
---
All my resto shamans end up in tank and melee grp, healers don't get tide...
---
Damn, man. I'm impressed you have had the time to play on every server.
---
Is it worth rerolling to a different server in my situation? I'm a level 32 alliance druid on Thunderfury, and it seems that I rolled on a strongly horde-tilted server. I definitely want a server where I can make sure that I will be able to find a good guild and raid groups endgame. Should I reroll to a more balanced or even alliance-favored server, or it's not a big enough deal and staying on Thunderfury as alliance won't hinder me?
---
I'm holding up really well. I decided to use my extra time to start playing piano again. I can honestly say that I would rather be doing this than playing a Blizzard game.
---
1. Ok, sure. unless you have made this clear before hand or while forming.
---
2. LOL.  You are clearly a Arms/Fury warrior. Pro Tip: tank your 5 mans.  You can do it in Arms or Fury with a shield and 1h. Its not as hard as you might think.
---
3. Valid.
---
4. Valid.
---
You know I've considered that. When I was arms tanking and had trouble with threat, I took responsibility. Now as prot, idk.. I've had a bunch of people invite me to their guild or just add me to their friends list cuz they thought I was good. But I have a busy schedule and can't keep up with them so I'm constantly having to pug.
---
I also think I'm pretty good... :)  I've been tanking since bc, it seems to me to be mostly just a shift in relative power of the tanks and these dps are not adjusting.
---
&gt;Usually someone will help lead.
---
Hahaha good one
---
Only arcane crystals that are usefull throought Classic lifespan. If you aren't target-farming them then the loss is low.
---
In Vanilla I played warrior and I tanked dungeons and I DPSed dungeons as well depending on what was available.  I play a warrior in Classic and I won't tank now unless I'm playing with guildies. In a pug where I'm expected to know the ins and outs of every single pull and skip and everything else the first time I ever lay eyes on a dungeon in 15 years? No thanks. I don't mind the suicidal DPS, that's a fun challenge, but getting called an idiot because I didn't know that I could hump the shit out of a wall for five minutes to skip a pack I can do without.
---
I rolled a Mage, didn't care for it. Rerolled a Lock, I enjoy it but I really wish I would of just rolled a Rogue from the start.
---
Stars align and you get the drop, I agree. Sometimes. But if you don’t kill someone in your lock or have every cd + prep up (I don’t because pve spec) it’s not great. Burning 2x vanish 2x blind and getting 3 resets with that many cds sure it’s nice. Feels bad popping all that shit just to decently stand a chance against frost nova though lol
---
Onyxia is freeloot, so they had to put the challenge somwhere. We are running triple-splits on Ony already with 15-20 people per grp.
---
That’s what I’m gonna do I just wanted to see the communities opinion
---
get downvoted on reddit
---
Theres two ways to do it.
---
1. You have a bid system, meaning players are rewarded a fixed amount of dkp for participating and can use these points in a bidwar for items (like an auction). 
---
2. You have a static price and players are rewarded dkp based on how much dkp was spent (zero sum). In this system the amount of dkp you get for participating is dependent on what loot ppl need. In a system like this there should be some sort of chart determining the value of each item. And the player that gets the item are the player that have the highest amount of points.
---
Noticed that aswell. How did you gather the data?  Is there an api for that on wowhead?
---
It is more efficient at one thing. Gearing your character the way you want to. It is not more efficient at helping your raid team progress through content. Dkp cant stop a warlock from spending all that precious dkp on staff of dominance cause he wants to be destro for pvp in his free time. 
---
And what does that do? Now a resto druid lost their bis and warlock didnt spend his dkp on gear that will help the raid. All the time spent getting that weapon will benefit only the warlock and not 39 other people. 
---
Loot council can obviously fall to favoritism. But that can be stopped by being transparent before hand about where items are going that way the raid can agree or disagree. All loot should be designated before it even drops. 
---
If everyone in their raid has the same idea and goal "progress through raid content" then loot council done fairly shouldnt be a problem. If everyone or even half of the raid only shows up for dkp so they can get the items the wont without regard to whether it helps your raid then you wont progress past MC. And if that's the case you might as well let everyone roll on whatever they want
---
I've tanked 10 years straight from vanilla and then 10 years straight (until i got that statue).  Quit about 5 years ago.  Those rules apply to all tanks.
---
I'll never understand making the decision to level a character on a PVP ream and then complain about PVP.
---
Kind of a depressing way to look at things.  "You're dps, you're disposable.  I'm a tank, I'm the commodity, I decide who gets what because YOU need ME. If I don't want you I'll just kick you and find a other dps in seconds, fuck off if you want anything I want."  that's a hyperbole obviously, but am I alone in thinking that's kind of a fucked up way to treat people?  Shrug, when I form groups I just invite whatever roles need to be filled and do the dungeon.  Does that mean I'm stupid for wasting my time rolling against other players? I mean, they see what class I am when I make groups.  They know Im probably rolling on X item, and yet they still join.  Does that make them stupid?
---
This isn't entirely accurate.
---
&gt;Fury tanking is utilized when the entire raid is bringing consumables, the healers are geared enough to spam big heals on tanks until they go OOM, and the DPS are geared enough to kill the bosses before the healers run out of mana-restoration consumables and cooldowns.
---
It's almost all about the DPS tbh, even a dungeon geared healer can spam big heals if the bosses is dying in 60-90 seconds.
---
&gt;why a tank would choose a Fury variation over the more traditional Prot/Arms or Arms/Prot variations—to output more damage at the expense of mitigation in order to allow the DPS classes to go ham.
---
By prot/arms I assume you mean 11/5/35, and by arms/prot I assume you mean 31/5/15.  You actually don't lose any mitigation talents by going fury/prot (0/31/20), since the mitigation in prot is in the first 20 points, after that, it's just threat.
---
31/5/15 is pretty much worse than fury/prot in every way for both threat and mitigation in a raid setting. The only advantage is sweeping strikes for dungeons, and being able to pvp more effectively than 10/5/31 or 0/31/20. It's traditionally an offtank spec.
---
You simply don't take more damage just by going fury/prot. You take more damage by putting on more threat gear and less mitigation gear, which is up to the player in the moment. 
---
There are some fights where you DW and some fights where you put on a shield. There are some fights where you swap back and forth depending on the phase. There are some fights where you put on full mitigation gear because threat doesn't matter, and you have the exact same damage intake as a deep prot warrior (and still output more threat if your mitigation gear has enough crit).
---
&gt; The healers aren't geared enough to heal Fury tanks. 
---
False. A healer in dungeon blues can handle a fury/prot tank as long as the tank is playing correctly.
---
&gt;The DPS aren't geared enough to warrant the extra threat from Fury tanking.
---
Also false, some DPS are more then capable of putting out more TPS than a deep prot warrior with average gear can sustain at the moment. 
---
&gt;The tanks themselves aren't geared enough to make Fury tanking worth it.
---
Also false. You just need to get hit cap and  15-20% crit to make fury/prot deal more sustained threat than deep prot.
---
&gt;What we have now is a large population of semi-casual players trying to be hardcore hipsters without doing the research first, and groups are suffering for it.
---
You're making way too many sweeping generalizations that aren't entirely correct. The key here is bad tanks are bad, and deep prot has a lower skill floor/ceiling than fury prot. That's it.  
---
All of your claims about tanks/healer/dps not being geared enough are demonstrably false and can be disproven by just looking at classic.warcraftlogs.com. You'll see lots of fury/prot warriors in dungeon blues being healed by healers also in dungeon blues.
---
See i wish people would get this.  Alot of people on this website seem to think following BiS list or whatver ruins the game or the idea of "it's an upgrade  so im going to need, fuck off if you think that's wrong."  That just makes you a selfish asshole.
---
Could i of rolled on the 3 HoJs ive seen drop as a Hunter because "it is an upgrade and my Pre-bis" 100%, but i also know i would replace it with the DM quest trinket so i always passed.  I passed because warriors and rogues dont get to replace it for alot longer as well as it is a huge upgrade vs a minor for me.   Passing on that trinket has neated me good karma from some of the players who helped me later on.  
---
No one wants to see someone win an item that is a minor upgrade for their class when they have plenty of other pre-raid items that they will eventually replace it with but is perfect for another class in the run all they way to BWL+ .   This is why reserve runs exsist.
---
End of the day talk with your party, communication can help solve alot of loot drama.   Show the hunter he has 3 or 4 options better then dal rends and he is more likely to understand why he shouldn't roll on them.
---
I care
---
"Oh my bad I didn't know! Let me go respec prot real quick for you." /s
---
Tell me I am good.
---
Note, I'm alliance playing on a hord dominant pvp server so slight bias. Hord have much better town locations in alot of zones giving a noticable advantage. Ex: STV, Arathi zones, badlands. Makes the 30-45 grind somewhat difficult.
---
Apparently shamans playing on private servers did a technique called "Earthbind Kiting".  Using Earthbind Totem, the enemies were slow enough that you could kite outside their hit-range, and only come back in when your next auto-attack was ready.
---
I read about this countless times in the few weeks leading up to the release of classic.  Almost every leveling guide I researched mentions it as a core gameplay mechanic.
---
Then when classic was released....you couldn't do it.  Mobs that are chasing you get a small bit of extra range on their attacks making this sort of kiting impossible (not a lot of info on this out there, the only mention I see is random comments on youtube, and they call it the 'leeway mechanic').
---
I Got a Freezing band farming in WPL.. so lucky!!
---
Horde specific meme
---
Hinterlands has a decent handful of quests for alliance, though some of them are not obvious(picking up the beacon, for instance). It'd be nice if the rep thing meant something, but the zone isn't terrible. 
---
If memory serves, Alliance has a higher number of quests overall, but it's fair to note that Horde has some better town positioning on average.
---
Meanwhile hordes got SM, SFK, RFK, RFD, and Sunken Temple thats closer to horde towns or is horde friendly.
---
I rerolled holy at 58 mainly to keep the dps alive. It's just faster and easier on my mental health to not get into groups that break up when the dps leave. Maybe if they learned after a death or two but they don't so it's simply easier to handle it myself. Plus they start taking cleve and aoe damage in the 56+ dungeons that makes everything so much easier as holy.
---
Eh, I get that view, but as a counterpoint if I’m in a sorta shitty group but it’s still capable of clearing I just want to get it over with and get out.
---
If healing a dumb DPS means we can do that without people throwing a shitfest than it’s what I’ll do.
---
If the tank wants to call people out I’ll support him, but at the end of the day dungeons are easy and if everyone stays alive every fight it is what it is.
---
She'll take you to the auction shop.
---
Let you enchant her lollipop.
---
Well when you didn’t know dm was coming out so soon and you already bought your skelly horse..
---
Yeah, doing it once for a laugh would be entertaining. Doing stuff like that regularly would get old, especially it a lot of people are fucking around and raids are taking longer than they should.
---
Kinda what I was thinking as well. Thanks, I think I'm going to switch tonight!
---
Then they all want improved totems if they are in melee grp! Extra 19 str!
---
I believe people are motivated by Reddit points, otherwise Reddit would have 90% less content so expect TONS of useless threads only looking for attention.
---
&gt; Westfall - 35 horde quests, 0 alliance
---
I don't think that is correct
---
Think there's a difference between a spot where guards can't attack you due to limitations in the system and a spot where there just simply isn't a guard nearby to attack you.
---
It's ONY and a pug. We one shot. Even had to wait at the last 5% HP for the guy to get his quel sword off a breathe. The leader just recruited with whoever pmd. Still had 8 slots to put players too.
---
Trolls suffer a bit with how armor looks on them.  T3 hunter armor looks good on trolls though (I was alliance so this is from memory on the opposing side).
---
if everybody else is saving their dkp, then the best way to use yours is to not save it. like if there are 4 hunters in your group and 3 of them are all saving for a weapon, you should be the 4th guy who is getting every other hunter item for as cheap as possible. at the end of the day, you only need the weapon to drop 4 times before you win it by default. so just wait for that to happen while you grab everything else
---
It is confusing though - I actually bought Stone grip before I realized I needed the edge masters. The weird thing is that they have human/orc/other sections for weapons but decided not to do that for the hands for some reason
---
I haven't read all of those guides but the ones i have are tuned to speed running on the "fresh server experience". The idea is to get ahead of the pack and stay there. Leveling an alt is slightly different. You'll be outleveled in a lot of pvp scenarios, but you'll also be able to feed yourself gear from your main, and the guides just stunt account for either of those things.
---
Honesty though, any of them are probably fine, as a template for clustering quests, which i guess is the important part.
---
Pro tip for Ony, the best way to play is to not play.
---
I am the only Prot warrior in my guild that is 60.
---
We have a LOT of melee in my guild. HOJ runs have become a daily thing. We are no longer pugging them because we kept losing them to pugs. I’m talking Hunters and Druids rolling need for the AP... I have a warrior in guild that is at 150+ runs trying to get his. Seen it drop 6 times and has lost the roll every time. We are now just running in house so that at least if it drops it stays in guild. We’re running 4 DPS and no healer on some runs now which are pretty fun. Rogues are doing 3 man stealth runs. Most of them have their HOJs now. 
---
We refused to reserve items in pugs and it has hurt our progress as a team but it’s better than being loot whores. After that warrior (who has done way more runs than me) gets his it’s my turn next. If you do arena also the runs can be okay gold per hour. Our stragglers are now hitting 52ish so we will be bringing them along on the runs for XP and gear. They get to go to the back of the line though for HOJ heh. 
---
When we pug at this point it’s for quests and stuff that the drops don’t matter. Reserving gear is for guild runs IMO not for pugs. If you want to run for a specific item get a guild group together that is willing to help you. Don’t have a guild willing to help you? Find a better guild.
---
Thanks for correcting. you a real one
---
They will become aggressive for a while, but won’t attack you if you’re not in range. There’s loads of spots in every city, especially in ratchet.
---
I mean progressive minded not progress/hardcore guilds.
---
Yee yee join the grobsquad
---
Female Undead have a front flip melee attack animation, it's boss
---
Sevenleaves &amp; Tactics Horde leveling with guideline got me to 60 in just over 8 days played. It’s made for rogues, but you can skip those parts with relative ease and I did it as a priest. There are a couple of other hiccups but if you’ve already leveled all the way you should be able to work around them.
---
Stopped reading the post in rage and came to post exactly this haha. Literally the best part of T1. The key to wearing so many other pieces.
---
'moral direction...'
---
Lol
---
Ignore him -he’s clearly playing dumb in an attempt to troll or something.
---
I think hunter with thunderfury is even more rage inducing
---
This is the answer.
---
I believe this is exactly the right mindset. By letting someone die out of spite you'd also punish yourself after all. As a tank I love running with DPS that pull aggro all the time from me, as long as they do in a smart way. It allows us to finish the run so much faster.

Some tanks seem to get frustrated when DPS don't support their perfect world of having aggro from every mob, even when this is not the most efficient strategy. Of course there are also many cases of DPS simply being stupid and for a healer it can often be the most sensible option not to waste mana for them, but deliberately underperforming just because someone doesn't act exactly the way you want would be childish. Thank you for considering the best option case by case.
---
yeah i have a 60 shaman, went enhance. did my first mc pug a few weeks ago, we got to rag but didnt manage to kill it. everyone told me to roll resto and i havent found a raid since. rerolled warlock.
---
That's literally what I said.
---
It’s a population issue, there’s a greater presence of horde. Why would alliance always know they’d be underdogs without census reports
---
Warrior is totally okay for rolling on that when replacing a green.  Warrior can use it, it is clearly an upgrade, he needs on the roll, nothing wrong with that.
---
Which really bums me out, Mechanostriders are my favorite mounts. I want all my toons riding into battle on mechanical doom chickens!
---
Fury tanking sucks for dungeons because they lost most of their AoE tool box to generate big threat on a single target.  Past that, you take what you can get for dungeons because either the tank is new, or doesn’t need anything tank related and wants their Off-spec stuff, or you get a DPS warrior trying out defensive stance because it’s better than waiting for a tank to pop up.
---
I'm putting together my 19 twink, it's a lot of fun and can't wait to finish it up
---
I hear you loud and clear.  OP just proved Alliance is the superior faction for a fulfilling and holistic Classic experience!
---
It's a 3% drop rate off Ragnaros, which seems really hard, until you realize that the other 2 weapons he drops (bone reavers and Spinal) are 4% and 5% respectively.  
---
So while this does require 300 BS + a bunch of sulfuron ingots to buy, ingots have no other use right now (or ever?) and anyone who get's eye becomes super motivated to get the legendary hammer.
---
World first hand of rag was almost a month ago, it's a great achievement, but not as hard as a lot of people are making it out to be.
---
I think consumables can be the problem! Thanks for the advice.
---
I would have left that group so fast...
---
That escalated quickly.
---
I'd be behind TBC all the way. Best xpac or not, it is definitely my nostalgia train. Never made 60 before tbc prepatch
---
Idk if you're sarcasm but that was blind.
---
Their issue is downtime because no self-heals, so overpulling is a death sentence.
---
Even though bloodrage can sort you out for initial aggro/rage, it's not always available at every pull. Particularly if you had to firefight overaggroing or mis-targeting dps during the last pull ;)
---
The absolute minimum that aoe could reasonably wait is 1 GCD per mob, to get 1 sunder on each mob. But a) rage might not be there, b) parries/dodges/misses happen, sometimes several in a row and c) as you say 1 sunder per mob doesn't necessarily hold off much AOE
---
With AoE, mages have a little bit of an excuse because if they're any good they can frost nova to mitigate their overaggro. But warlocks don't have much they can do if they overaggro from aoe
---
It WAS difficult to get.  Now we have 10+ years of data available online and COUNTLESS guides and strategies and to be honest a much higher skilled playerbase.  
---
This is why we are now seeing all these guilds/PUGs clearing Onyxia and molten core at level 53 and people hitting level 60 within a week.
---
Hamstring spam and begging int buffs off mages has taken me far in weapon skill leveling
---
Don't care for it, but I do care about annoying guys trying to push politics into gaming. Actually I applaud Blizzards decision and hope they keep this up in the future. It's pretty much the only way to keep esports active.
---
&gt;exactly 168 kills on Rend
---
First of all, I don't believe that for a second. Second, DBM doesn't keep track of UBRS data so you'd have to keep track yourself.  And lastly, I don't believe you.
---
Well, regarding your PvP statement... I'm full on PVE Holy, I think 21/30/0. I got jumped by a 60 rogue yesterday and killed him. Halfway through a 59 rogue jumped in and I killed him too, fighting both of them about half the fight. They were obviously garbage but it does show the kill potential and survivability of a holy priest. If I had PvP gear on I'd be even better off. You just have to play the long game. Don't focus on spamming smite, just get your DoTs out, keep bubble up and Renew, flash heal rank 4 when needed, when you get a fear off throw out a mind blast and a smite. The fights already over by then. I'm out here getting 800+ smite crits which is about 33% of the health of average level 60s.
---
You wanna see?
---
Why not just make a rule that forces players to purchase an item if it's an upgrade for them.   
---
Also adjusting prices to items that goes for de woud be good. If not enough people want them then the price might be too high for an upgrade they give.
---
I wanna play a Paly healer but I wanna be self sustainable and do some grinding every now and then... is this spec gonna be decent for that? Or should I go a differnt route?  
---

---
I noticed it's people that are impatient that cause wipes.
---
There is something in Live for tanks...ORBS.  Thats why he is there.  Demanding first orb is douchebaggery...plain and simple.
---
I tanked one last night.  The only rule I apply is that if you get an orb,  no more rolling on orbs until everyone gets one.  4 orbs dropped that run,  I was the only one who did not get one because you know...my shitty rolls.  Being entitled is just a shitty way to go about your life.  Doing so from a point of "because they need you" is as entitled as it gets.  It's wrong.
---
Part of the problem with this is mobs often slow the tank, making it take sometimes over 10 seconds to walk over to the mob. Then we have to taunt it and interrupt it, all while hoping that a dps didn't peel a mob off while we were moving. It's possible, but annoying. Best to line of sight pull if at all possible. 
---
That said, in a situation like you described, try to LoS the caster and/or interrupt/silence them to help bring the mob to the tank.
---
That's -25%
---
That was the point
---
&gt;My ass Is burning help - Thh
---
You are correct in that regard, and I agree with you.
---
I still want to reach out though, and this is the best place to find the few people who feel the same way about the current state of the game as I do. What's the harm in my one topic that no one is obligated to post in?
---
Yes.  About 50g usually, I think.
---
I rolled a shammy cause I never played one before. Started playing a priest on a different server with a friend. Fucking hate my shammy now.
---
I don't HATE it but I really wish I had made my mage undead instead of troll, I'm on a pvp server and fear is my bane :(
---
Was that not a thing back in the day?
---
Idk if you're you're but that was that.
---
Yep, very true. I have a feeling the "fury tanks" everyone is complaining about are 17/34/0 dps mains in dps gear trying to tank in zerker stance because WW.
---
They are going to hold off on any TBC announcement for as long as they can for this simple reason.
---
I, and many others, joined to play Classic simply because there is nothing better to do at the moment. If they were to announce TBC, I would simply prep the chars I wanted to play in TBC, cancel my sub and wait until TBC drops. In order to maximize their revenue they will keep us waiting and idling until it is much closer to a theoretical TBC release date.
---
&gt; Did you do anything aside from work and sleep?
---
I was recently divorced, living alone, and deeply in debt. It honestly wasn't that bad because it was a 4x10 schedule to begin with and I was adding 8 hours only 4 days a week with a break in between.
---
* Monday 0630-0030 (sleep 6 hours in car)
---
* Tuesday 0630-0030 (go home)
---
* Wednesday (wake up play video games all day)
---
* Thursday 0630-0030 (sleep 6 hours in car)
---
* Friday 0630-0030 (go home)
---
* Saturday (wake up play video games all day, sleep 8-10 hours)
---
* Sunday (wake up play video games all day, sleep 8-10 hours)
---
Rinse repeat. It was an extra 32 hours a week at overtime rates, so like $720 bucks and I still had three days to just game and chill.
---
I'm re-married and have more kids now, so I have significantly less time to game. I'm actually going to school "fulltime" and working fulltime right now and it's super manageable because a lot of school have night courses once a week now, so I can go to class three days a week after work and take one online course and still have time to be home with my family and do stuff on weekends.
---
I mean, if the rogue didn't out dps you even without WF he was terrible. Or were they stopping for you to drink to full between every pull so you could spam your mama bar empty on your trashcan spells.
---
Go get your costume again from the gnome. If he isn't there someone else is on the quest, you'll have to wait.
---
It's part of the game. Why not just roll a pve server to avoid these scenarios?
---
makes sense, ty
---
I don't disagree with the things you are describing, but the problem is you. 
---
Stop trying to accommodate all the asshats. Form your own groups, tell them how it's going to be, if they don't follow the rules, kick them and get new dps. You are the tank, lead that shit.
---
&lt;Tempest&gt; - Horde - Benediction
---
Raid time Sunday at 8EST (server time) till 11
---
Hello, here are a few reasons to join Tempest:
---
1. We just finished our first guild led MC raid last night and went 9/10. We still have a few slots to fill, looking for 1 or 2 of most classes so get in as a core raider now!
---
2. We have a totally awesome Strat to one shot Ony.
---
3. Cool name/tabard.
---
4. Super chill guys to raid with, no annoying spazzy types.
---
5. We help our guildies with whatever they need when we can.
---
Come join our discord https://discord.gg/gENWmS !
---
Right now we are doing MS&gt;OS rolls but will swap to a zero sum dkp once the guild fills the entire raid.
---
You can also contact Orctank in game or at Revidy#1346.
---
Good luck guys!
---
I rolled mage and I regret it because my raid team has 10 mages total so I never get any loot lol
---
nope, that was 2.0.1 from December 2006
---
As masochist as it may sound, I loved leveling as warrior. When I finally hit 60 and started running BRD, I lost interest in the game. Maining a tank in Tera for 6 years and switching to WoW tanking left me disillusioned. The tanking is so cumbersome and annoying with very few aoe aggro abilities and constantly being rage starved. DPS'ing is still pretty fun though but makes finding groups a bit more challenging.
---
There's a lot of reasons Classic seems easier now, some to do with the patch, some not, for example:
---
* Patch 1.12 had the most "complete" builds for all the classes.  In earlier patches, classes like Paladin were absolutely abysmal.  This patch was the best all-around class balance Classic ever achieved
---
* We have way, way more information now, both from playing the game for so many years and due to the plethora of guides out there digging into all the intricacies of your class and gear
---
* We all have better machines with better connections playing on servers that are much more stable than they used to be.  
---
So really I dont think the dungeons or raids are in a "nerfed" state, its more than our PCs are much stronger than they used to be.
---
Ah
---
That's Mind Blast. A healing priest should never use Mind Blast.
---
1.They shouldn't be doing damage.
---
2.If they want to do some damage, then they shouldn't be using MB, because it is inneficient.
---
3.If they are still using Mind Blast, they are probably still specced into Shadow Priest.
---
No. But we're playing on the last patch, which had vastly improved itemization and talents. In the early patches (1.0 - 1.7), when most guilds raided MC &amp; BWL, the gear you had was vastly different to the gear we have right now. 
---
For example, the Tier 1 priest gloves (Gloves of Prophecy) used to give you +shadow spell dmg, instead of +healing. They only started to give +healing from patch 1.5 onwards. 
---
Most blues didn't even had +healing or +spell dmg, just didn't exist yet or were buffed in later patches.
---
You can still mostly do it as sm/ruin, just pick up fel conc (which can fit into sm/ruin as there are a lot of floating points).
---
The current version of feral druid that’s in classic is about 95% of what tbc druid was. In taladrils treaty of feral tanking he lists the differences and there is barely any at all.
---
Ah yes, fuck dps, tanks and healers are the golden child, dps only get the scraps left over from them after they get what they want.  Silly me for thinking otherwise.
---
I'm the same with my hunter. We have like 8 of each hunter and mage. Went a month without 1 upgrade while others were in 5+/8. I lost complete interest in the game quick. It's one thing getting some upgrades pretty steady even 1 every 2 weeks or so. Show that you're steadily climbing but man do you lose interest fast when week after week it's just nothing.
---
I’m prot specced and farmed SM with a bunch of casters so I ended up getting every piece of mail gear and the ravager. So then I went into RFD as a dps with a warlock and mage. Topped the damage meter by a margin. The tank had no chance of keeping aggro. Luckily the healer was fantastic.
---
Make sure you are downloading the right version of the addon. On curseforge for example it might say its classic compatible, but you still have to go to files and select the classic version.
---
Some classes benefit from it. 
---
Shamans can lightning bolt - chain lightning - earth shock and get all guaranteed crits if timed right.
---
Paladins can holy light + holy shock with guaranteed crit for both whle using divine favor.
---
Idk about other classes
---
You very clearly didn’t read this post at all
---
As 2h Fury. Try to get into the WF group and use a lot of Harmstring for WF procs

**&lt;Morning Coffee&gt;**
---
We are a casual leveling guild that are active in the mornings. Right now we are focused on: leveling, helping members with gear, questing, and growing the guild. Once more members are able, we will organize morning raids and dungeons!
---
I'm recruiting officers, recruiters, and any members that would enjoy a casual fun atmosphere. Our goal is to create a comfy community of casual players that play in the mornings and keep each other company while leveling/questing solo or together. 
---
You can message me on reddit or ingame: Christopher
---
Hope to see you ingame!
---
Yer I wouldn't want to play on a server with such a huge faction imbalance. I'd happily play against the faction with huge numbers, but being on a side that has such huge numeric advantage takes away the challenge.
---
I started a shaman and wanted to level as resto. Ended up switching to enhace late 40s then quit at 55 and rolled arcane mage lol
---
Not a direct answer but Classic has reintroduced me to the concept of loot drama I’d forgotten about. There are so many obscure items, stop gap items, such a large disparity among specs that there are too many scenarios to cover where someone doesn’t feel bad about an outcome. Even guilds with super structured systems will have odd scenarios where someone receives two weapons in a raid and it can make others resentful.
---
I played a bit on private servers and while this concept existed there, it’s definitely much more amplified in Classic because so many players are unfamiliar with the idea of being placed in a priority list for items or seeing a certain member get all the loot funneled. We’ve lost a couple of recruits that were unhappy to learn that they wouldn’t immediately be eligible for items.
---
I guess my point is that itemization in this game isn’t so straightforward, but as a member of the raid you need to trust that your guild loot council is doing what’s best for the raid even if it sucks for you at times. And if you objectively look at the council and feel like it’s unfair, biased, or routinely making poor decisions then you just need to leave. It’s so easy to get into a guild that can clear MC right now that you don’t have to be that picky.
---
Either some disturbed or maybe Lincoln park.
---
No because then they blame the healer (me).. and I get yelled at lol
---
I think your idea of being a “jackass” is warped, maybe bring the attitude down a notch.
---
It's not a "good time", since it wastes time.  The stuff is already on farm, no need to make the run longer.  Level your unarmed skill on your own time.
---
I love Loch Moran so much. In vanilla my first toon was a dwarf hunter and I’ll never forget getting to LM and thinking “holy crap this game is so beautiful and cool.” I used to farm the spiders ands bears outside the town thinking I was making so much bank haha.
---
No, it's easier because of 1.12 itemization and 1.12 talents. MC would be very hard with old 1.0 gear. Imagine doing MC with almost zero +spell dmg or +healing.
---
Find a decent healer and do 2man jump runs in dme
---
Can't shadowmeld in combat (so it doesn't drop you out of combat), but very nice for surprise opens with a warrior/hunter.
---
This is beautiful thank you for sharing.
---
L-l-l-l-l-lick me like a lollipop.
---
Been playing a lot and have only seen a single one, which I did not win (Strat UD). From knowledge it's supposed to be any 50+ mobs yes. Not much Idea on end date, we told me to look at the Candy duration (which ends in 4-5 days from now, something like that)
---
You can enter MC without attunement?
---
Death metal???
---
No way gotta be Bodies.
---
1....nothing wrong with me..

2...nothing wrong with me...

Natural Selection
---
You could benefit from taking a step outside of your own perspective and rereading your response. Also, understand that you don't have to play this game, it's a recreational choice, not an obligation.
---
Your words suggest that you lack a few key understandings.
---
1. This is classic, not vanilla. It's similar, but it's not the same. The game has a different culture and no matter how much you kick and scream, it's not going to be exactly what you remembered.
---
2. You are completely free to form your own groups with your own loot rules. If you aren't comfortable leading and forming groups, then you won't get to determine the rules for that party. 
---
3. My rolling a tank does not make me beholden to the community at large to serve them by organizing charity runs. For friends and guildies, I'm more than happy to tank something for them if I have the time, but not for total strangers.
---
Yeah I totally sympathize. But outside cases of extreme stupidity, i.e. mage blizzard as tanks attacks, the reason DPS is pulling aggro is likely because they’re doing big dick damage.
---
I’m willing to make the tradeoff of faster killing for having to heal everyone, so long as they don’t get the group wiped and understand that if I let them die to heal the tank it’s in them.
---
Sounds like you've got these spots mapped out. Maybe try out some actual wpvp instead of just camping people inside of towns while being "outside of guard range"
---
Also, if the guards become aggressive, chances are they're supposed to be attacking you. Especially if you're in a neutral town. If you're trying to argue against it, you're probably abusing it. Go kill players outside of a town, stop hiding in your safe spots.
---
Yea our guild has gotten 5 leaf's and only a single eye so far.  We have started giving leaf's to alt's.
---
I love these comics, dude. Please keep ‘em coming.
---
Probably best to just run around with a dagger + shield on the battlefield and swap to HoR when 3.7 seconds away from melee range.
---
You're level 44 lmao casual dumbass gamer dad
---
I’m happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but rogue and paladin T2 are some of the greatest looking sets of all time.
---
The people defending this type of action are likely dirtbags who abused terrain exploits themselves.
---
Elvui
---
The advantage is that MC is fairly easy. If anyone really wants to do it, they can.
---
I'm usually opposed to split days off, but the 4 days working 3days off schedule sort of beats that argument, since I'm still getting a full weekend. I guess it comes down to when the shift hours are in the day. I wouldn't love a 8am-6pm shift. I feel like I need to have a conversation with our HR department about offering more diverse full time schedules.
---
no way you are really the hockey player right?
---
Came here to say this. It's because they're part of the social media generation that believes everything they do is interesting and noteworthy.
---
&gt; Same goes for people rolling on tier 0 gear that's not for their class. Warriors rolling on lightforge, beast stalker and shadow craft, casters rolling on any tier 0 piece that they can equip regardless if they are a priest and it's dreadmist or a mage and it's devout. Yeah, maybe that is an upgrade for you. But you're going to replace it much sooner than the player whose class it was designed for. 
---
Funny thing, tier 0 isn't class restricted.  And Dreadmist has really good stat weights for priest PvP.  There are a lot of angles for gear, solo/grinding/dungeons/raids/pvp.  Raid BiS is only one and not everyone running dungeons is going to use said gear in a raid.  Do I want a full set of high stamina/int cloth for Phase 2?  Or do I want to say nothing as the warlock needs the piece and replaces it in a week at MC?
---
As for restricted runs, it depends on the reason.  If it is restricting gear for my class, I'm less inclined.  If it's rogue gear being restricted, I don't care.  Or if it's a high geared tank and dps that are just farming mats or BiS items, I'll take the reduced profit for a faster run and less issues.  Do I want a MT or a fresh 60 when I have 2 hours and need to run Scholo for the 10th time?  Do I care if the tank gets the first nth orbs from strat when I am just trying to grind out reputation and quests?  Restricted runs flourish when there are a glut of players.  If you can be choosy on who you bring and not suffer consequences, why wouldn't you?  Do you want to run a dungeon for ten drops of your BiS item or one?
---
[The man, the legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MzqS1tCh-0)
---
I feel bad for whoever takes you in a guild. Jesus dealing with you in a raid must be a pain in the ass
---
We aren't talking level 60 dungeons here, getting a new appropriately leveled dps to uldaman in less than the time to finish the instance would be incredibly lucky.  My schedule doesn't allow me to keep up with the horde of players so there aren't nearly as many people looking for a particular instance at any particular moment as there were closer to launch when everyone was bunched up
---
Yeah druid is amazingly underplayed, kind of amazes me given how fun and versatile they can be during the levelling phase, and even in end game content they aren't too shabby.
---
20s. 1 gold is the standard tip rate though. It's simply the polite thing to do
---
It’s like getting a new cable or internet service. It doesn’t seem like it’d be too expensive outright but little did you know about the hidden sales/service/lease/maintenance fees.
---
To my understanding no, only stats will help druids.
---
the (weak) joke was that she might be expendable
---
&gt;good DPS that tops the charts and handles mechanics (aka doesn't tunnel) is often hard to find.
---
Not really. The content in the game is very easy at this point and \*someone\* is always going to be #1 dps. Usually a mage. 
---
I'm not butt hurt (Why would I be? I'm a healer.) I just can't understand the sense of pride/entitlement some people get from doing the most damage on a particular encounter. Did you pass all your classes this year with honors? Be proud. Did you help an elderly neighbor rake their leaves? Be proud. Heck, did you and your guild finally down Ragnaros after weeks of trying? Be proud. But doing slightly more damage than your fellow mages? I just don't get it.
---
If needed ask for help.
---
&gt; you have to incentivize it for me.
---
  You have a chance at an orb like anyone else...
---
Fucking ego's...the worst.
---
Strat Live last boss does not drop rarest epic mount in the game.  
---
He does drop a neck for a mage though.I dont know what you are talking about.
---
I mean hasn't horde out numbered alliance on the majority of servers for every iteration of wow? They also have better pvp racials. Blizz has also come out and said that horde attracts pvp players..
---
I also
---
Paladins are another plate wearer, so they definitely fit into my answer. 
---
Cant say I remember the rogue T2 set off the top of my head though, I'll have to look into that.
---
If only I was lucky enough to get these drops 😓
---
Wow that’s wild! I remember being jealous of far sight because it didn’t have this functionality but apparently I was missing out. Tracking working with eagle eye is busted. Thanks.
---
not when you run out of mana bro, helps to keep it up, maybe not full but up
---
I think the main benefit is psychological. The loot isn't given to you by the loot council, but RNG.
---
The loot council just makes sure its guided along somewhat intelligently.
---
I'm level 42 on my warrior and I have died more times so far on him (not including dungeons) than I can ever remember dying as any other class all the way to max level. 
---
It's not for the faint of heart
---
I play other games in between raids. Also a bit offtopic but why do you spend money on consumables? They seem not needed at all.
---
You pay the healer or dps?
---
First off thanks and great work with this Bot.
---
My group is looking at making a switch from Band to Discord so i'm trying to experiment with some features in Discord. One of the things we used in Band was a combination of a Sign-up and a Poll. For example we'd like to have people sign-up for a raid (assuming the time fits them) but also cast a vote for which raid they'd like to run. I know they can be done individually so just curious if they can be combined somehow?
---
&gt; ye ole 8 bit integers. 
---
Fixed.
---
MC resets every Tuesday, onyxia resets every 5 days. I’d give you a link to track onyxias reset but I’m not at my computer right now.
---
I really don't know how to feel about my Holy Paladin. I get into raids for simply having a pulse but my farming and world PvP chops are close to non-existent, and getting my pre-BiS is fucking suffering because nobody's looking for a healer for 5-mans.
---
The hard part is getting to SM, once you can tank all day with your 2h it'll go quick until you get to BRD
---
I was aiming more for the "hey, don't be this guy" but you two can believe what you need to believe I guess?
---
This. It is the polite thing to do and I always whisper mages for a 1g port and never get turned down. Dicks being cheap as fuck don’t want to buy a service they can’t do themselves.
---
Have fun camping FPs in Phase 2. You can talk about what brave heroes you are while sitting around for hours hoping to be the first group to tag the stray Alliance that flies in.
---
 &lt;It's Always Sunny In Azeroth&gt; \[Fairbanks-PvE Alliance\] \[Social+Raiding\]\[Raid Times TBD\]

Still, you are going against the peace horde and alliance have by doing those quests. You are betraying all the trolls, orcs and tauren in horde!

Sadly you're probably exactly right.  This isn't about extending classic, this is about retaining subscribers for minimum effort - so they'll go the path of least resistance and use "faithful to the original" and #nochanges as a shield..
---
The question is merely which TBC and which Wrath patch they'll settle on.
---
I would honestly be surprised and impressed to see a classic plus fork.
---
Glad to see none of your gear matches and you didn't even bother with an offhand item.
---
The enhance version of 'stealth' lol
---
You should have multiple sets of gear. You have one set for soloing/questing, and one set for healing.
---
I'm a warrior, I have a tank set with a bunch of +Def, high stam, high armor. And I have a DPS set with some mail pieces, some leather pieces, and a bunch of +crit.
---
I just look like a scrub and ask for summons every time for MC. The rest I just put in the footwork.
---
In Classic/Vanilla Shamans are much weaker than in BC and forward so you may find it quite challenging to pull competitive DPS without going the extra mile if at all. Both ele and ench will work overall in dungeons and open world but will faill short in raids.
---
Either you are lying about being a tank, or you're the same kind of person who thinks that an engineer and a burger flipper deserve the same rate of pay.
---
You sound like a shitty tank...wait sorry...i mean shitty person.
---
You're a jackass if your tomfoolery causes any significant reduction in the speed or efficiency of the run.
---
How much better is the reed vs the 2% crit trinket from the Onyxia quest chain?
---
No it's not, TBC is its own piece in time where we can carefully decide if the perks are better than the warts, and they are. What TBC brought to WoW is displeasurable to some but it stands the test of time as a well rounded game. Flying and the lack of world PvP is well worth the amazing class balances and raids that came out.
---
CoR -&gt; CoE -&gt; CoS -&gt; Coa/CoD  Forget Weakness exists.
---
Yeah. It removes a lot of interaction with both other players and the world. In vanilla, you experience the theme of each zone as you walk around it, and have to explore for clever ways to dodge mobs, etc. You interact with others playing, and stuff happens. With flying mounts, you go up, fly to waypoint, fly down.
---
Pat 2 or whichever one starts with him coming back as a High Warlord is pretty much peak Vanilla warrior. Grimm was  the go to guy for Rogue PvP bullshit, Drakedog made destro lock look good. TBC is where I remember more skillful displays came out since so much of Vanilla was gimmicks and globals.
---
I give a fuck about his opinion more than your "You're all wrong, I'm right" toddler like attitude.
---
Thye could do mroe frequent updates like msot games now adays liek add new towns n quests n such even small world events. That seem to be the trend these days
---
I got so much shit for rolling on this when I was leveling up but it really is so good for rogues around that level.  I'd argue a better upgrade for rogues than healers.
---
I’ve used it for a bit and I can tell you it has like a sub 3% proc rate. It barely procs.
---
&gt; Juju power
---
That's true, I'm kinda a mage player though and so not going deep into min-maxing for the warriors. Just wanted to point out the obvious(apparently not?) thing that elixirs can and do stack - at least the ones which boost different stats.
---
I mean, I would never put my HS in kargath until I was 60. Especially not with DM being such a big thing. But neat to know!
---
was this on pservers? or did you try the pvp trinket in beta?
---
Thankfully we have like 8 shamans in raid so WF is never an issue!
---
I never had any leveling to 60. If I ever felt like there was a bit of a gap between quest hubs I'd just grind out a level or two.
---
Look in the dkp modes window. There's an option to default to first or second bidder. You can also begin a second bidding round manually by simply hitting start bidding again in the event someone tried to snipe.
---
If he knew I worked at Comcast for 2 years, he'd have me strung up the gates of Org by my entrails
---
It’s a chicken-or-egg situation with itemization and BiS. People are absolutely mental about getting their BiS items to the point that you can tell the vanilla players from new.
---
I regularly hear people refer to some BiS gear as obsolete - as if the stats on the item disappear once a new item is released, even though they could have finished Molten Core with what they had two weeks ago. It’s genuinely maddening sometimes.
---
You will also have to deal with players who think they know better than you but who then immediately prove that no, they do not, and a lot of times they’re far worse. Like being told to clear the left side of the hall in Scholomance and not the right, but pulling more groups. Or the Warrior who told me that Fury Warriors were the meta in vanilla when literally no one went Fury back then.
---
The Robe of Volatile power is indeed holy pala BiS atm. Last two weeks we got two for our guild and holy palas all needed them.
---
Lucky bearstard!
---
Pretty much sums up the quality of this sub.
---
Don't like it? Take a zepplin, flight path or walk. It's a convenience fee/tip.
---
It's funny because everyone who read this post probably thinks, "hey, don't be like this guy" in relation to you, complaining about something trivial and posting it on Reddit.
---
Based on your rules I guess warrior tanks farm enough to pay for their repair bill and not much else.
---
Your #2 seems a little silly, why not just take the first level appropriate person that can fill the role? Seems odd to potentially spend more time looking for a group bc you think a class should only be tanking.
---
He said death metal, hammer smashed face by cannibal corps would be more appropriate to sulfuras, hand of ragnaros
---
Exactly. I was tanking and it was awful. People didn’t understand how roles worked in classic. 
---
So I finally said fuck it and rolled aoe mage
---
Ran ZF the other day and there was another arms warrior but he had a different weapon. He was 2 levels above me and I nearly doubled his total damage.
---
Its going to be a sad day when I have to replace it but I’m at level 46 and still haven’t come across an axe I like better. I’ve had my eye on Kang in the AH but I don’t think it’s worth all that gold at this point.
---
It's not "entitlement", it's incentive.  I don't need Strat Live, if you do and you want me to help, I need an incentive.
---
The alternative is that you just keep posting and hoping to find a tank that does need Strat Live (spoiler...way fewer dungeon runs will happen that way).
---
Yes, OP told them to put their cursor in the wrong spot after jumping
---
I'm a lock and have the same problem (although I am even class leader in my guild). Leveling a priest since healers are always highest in demand from what I see. Guess it always depends on the PoV...
---
Tanks are in instances mainly,  like all the time...thats their income.  That's how I got enough for my epic mount,  tanking instances.  That 'waaaah can't farm " shit is just an excuse.
---
Until the character is deleted i think
---
I'd say 3 to four hours per day
---
The guy is CLEARLY defending the exploiter in his first comment, and then in every other comment he proceeds to agree with everyone that the guy in the picture is exploiting... What on earth??
---
He actually states in his initial comment after saying "it's not against the rules" that it is in fact against the rules..
---
This is why I like zero still dkp. Since you go to 0 dkp regardless of how much points you have when you win it really punishes people for hoarding and allows people to gear up quicker if everyone else is waiting on one item
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
druids are bad everybody. Nobody listen to this man. Do not roll a druid. ;)
---
reddit is not google. did you expect like 5 or 10 people to show up in this post with a link to a guide for you?
---
I have a mouse button with skull, x, Moon and purple diamond  mapped to it with keyboard modifiers. I can usually fully mark the next group as the current group is being downed. 
---
And I'm the same way when I tank. I act as an it for the tank. Healer grabs one ill go bring it back. Mobs about to die it gets a hamstring, I pull aggro I stand by the tank but leave the mob clearly facing me and not him.
---
For locks +40 shadow damage green helm is better than nemesis
---
Charity is a virtue, I'll agree to that. But mindlessly whoring yourself to every group out there and never getting anything back isn't charity. Its stupidity.
---
Charity is when I went to BRD to use the black anvil, and took along two low levels and got them their quests done, just because why not?
---
Doing strat live for no reason other than to help people out is fine. Doing it several times a day is foolish.
---
Even with lowest settings I had only 10 fps in raids. And I guess most people played like that. 
---
I agree with you, thats why I upload my old screenshots, people need to see how it really was back then. Classic and vanilla are the same game but still so different.
---
Popping evasion as late as possible is a bad idea imo.
---
I'm leveling a combat rogue atm, lvl 48. Having spec'd into endurance, Evasion is on a measly 3.5min CD.
---
Popping as late as possible is dangerous and risking a death, whereas the sooner you use it the more damage is mitigated and at the end of the fight you're closer to using the CD again. Therefore not needed to use a potion, bandage or food after the fight.
---
Undead is also really nice to level as because Cannibalize is an amazing ability when fighting humanoids.
---
Just my 2cents.
---
So just quickly change layers? We gave you 1 hour notice, then attacked UC then attack Orgrimmar and then attacked saurfang. You had plenty of times to change layers when we did, when you attacked SW and Magni
---
True, just trying to stay high enough on logs to be a top performer in guild. It’s a chill guild, I just find the competitive aspect of that fun
---
Well I stopped playing sometime during TBC and when I reactived my account for Classic my level 70 was still there with the same name.
---
So we're talking at least 11 years?
---
I don't think you can take inactive names. Is there anything in any policy we know of that suggests GMs will do this?
---
Supply and demand is a real thing
---
I run my guild mates and friends for free. We all help each other out
---
I'm not doing that for a random when theres nothing else I want out of a dungeon. You need a tank,  I have other things to do with my time if you don't have an incentive. It's nothing against you, but I could be herb farming and doing gold farms instead of charity tanking your pug
---
? warriors have an easier time then  druids with aoe agro.  
---
Engineering, Battleshout, rage pots, whirlwind.  
---
Every single one of those heavily outweights the low threat you get from swipe. not even mentioning the target limit of swipe
---
They lost a roll to someone who wasn’t rolling.
---
Pretty much impossible
---
This could also mean the Battle-Stance-Charge infight.
---
oh yeah sure
---
if I you pull aggro you never run (it hurts to watch dps running and tank chasing, like wtf), you stand near tank, let him get the aggro or die for your sins, thats the way it goes
---
I would think that the 2 points in PoJ could be better spent if you are worried about sustain.
---
Lasting judgement is also not that useful, I'd probably move those points around too.
---
Yeah. Another opportunity Blizzard missed to encourage more people to roll Alliance on PvP realms. Even if they were concerned about queue dodging or whatever they could have announced no crossrealm BGs at the start and then switched up just before they actually came out.
---
How cute. "deeps" is just another word for DPS :)
---
What professions should I train early on as a druid that will be the most lucrative end-game to get my epic mount at 60?
---
Ironic. Because of my intolerance of bad behavior I am actually one of the more popular tanks on my server. That being said, I take care of dps and healers who take care of me and if I know they're good people, I'll tank stuff I don't need free of charge, just to help them out.
---
But a random pug? Why would I volunteer my time for no return?
---
You said you were in a strat live orbs reserved run. Did you do both wings of stratholme then?
---
Dwarves were awesome until Blizz remodeled them and made them run super goofy. The new models took dwarves from Lord of the Rings to Snow White.
---
I believe he means max deeps as in max DPS, or damage per second.
---
Over the course of 2 weeks I handed out over 100 Savory Deviate Delight to (mostly) warriors in Ironforge. It started as a joke to lure a tank into being my friend, but ended up turning it into a fun social experiment. I didn’t get the idea to track if the person ate the fish or not until after #15, hence the gap in data. Even though a lot of people didn’t react at all or eat the fish, the few who did seem to remember me and occasionally /wave or say hello when out in the world!
---
Only special attacks like Heroic Strike and Eviscerate though :) Nothing a priest can pull sadly.
---
Sell your account for a few thousand dollars, start a new one.
---
I'm a holy paladin and focus crit and have noticed that versus our three other paladin healers I can heal significantly longer than them. On domo, rag and ony i have yet to go oom while spamming FoL rank 6 the entire fight where they usually are auto attacking the last 10-20% for seal of wisdom mana. Therefore I am higher in the charts because of the pure number of heals even tho they are healing less per heal. So if you have any mana problems at all I would say it's better than robes of the exalted
---
Do the calculations and you will see, sweetie. It's right below this post :)
---
Just because its shiny, it doesnt mean its better.
---
But he didn't though, 7 days is already a pretty epic pace for level 60.
---
Depending on where I'm at and when I'm playing you don't feel the imbalance at all. 
---
But other times... it feels like a semi truck rolling over a tricycle.
---
Thats why I said prefer in my second sentence, I guess I expressed that wrongly. If I get only a whisper from a warrior etc I will ofc take him
---
Well they are there for orbs then right.  Thats the incentive.  High repair bills is just part of the role.  really,  it's just being a shitty person becasue you are using an advantage to screw other people over...that in a nutshell.
---
Its good for tanking dungeons. Its fucking garbage for raid and if you came to raid with it I would kick you.
---
Im leveling one in holy specc AS a twink ATM.
---
Level 32 in 1d 11hours. But with decent Gear straight from the AH.
---
And AS holyspecc its easy To find Gnome and gy groups
---
Spended about 35 gold in Gear until now and i think its Not To much at all
---
What kind of gear is required to farm it with some sort of consistency? 
---
As a fresh 60 I assume I'd be better off trying to find groups for this rather than to try and solo for my bis (barb blade, rings, etc)
---
shift+right click for insta loot
---
Thank you for being the voice of reason here.
---
It's almost like tanks can look at their party members for half a second and glance at the little blue bar below their healer's health bar. But you're so right. I'll drink every chance I get, whether I'm at 40% mana or 70% mana, because I've had way too many runs where a "small pull" turns into a mess from a runner or chain pulling happens (whether by accident or not) and sometimes 50-75% mana still isn't enough in those situations. I won't ask the tank to stop and wait for me if I'm at 50% mana and just giving myself a little more, I can catch up easy enough before things go to shit, but if I'm at 10% mana and the tank starts pulling...enjoy that graveyard run while bitching at me in chat, buddy.
---
Good tanks out there that notice their healers, I love you.
---
Well don't do strat live.
---
That seems like a convenience tho, surely most warriors are dps for raiding and simply don't respec multiple times a week.
---
Yeah you and your loser friends spent your whole sunday griefing alliance in BRM. Neat. And then you chased a warrior to your own death in the lava. Neater. Cant wait to watch you guys get smoked in BGs.
---
It is, because when it procs it costs 0 rage. It's not like you lose your rage, you can still dump your rage once and if the proc finishes. When it procs, it essentially replaces your white attacks with a permanent cleave that attacks all mobs in range at a higher rate. And it costs 0 rage.
---
Even against one mob you gain a 23% dps boost compared to regular white damage because of the quicker attacks.
---
You lose nothing. You can cancel it at any time if it's inconvenient. Either by right clicking the buff, or hitting any ability. Like execute. The proc is free, increases your attack speed by 23% and attacks all mobs in range. What's not to like.
---
Disclaimer: i assume it goes without saying that it doesn't work very well if you're a leather wearing warrior that suddenly has all the aggro, or if you use it after 3 mobs in range have been CCed.
---
Some things seem to be a lot easier than i remember.
---
The Rend event in UBRS for example: in Classic you are out of combat between the dragon waves - making it a piece of cake for the healers - i think i used quite a few mana pots there back in original vanilla because we stayed in combat the whole event (but that was 13 years ago, so i might be wrong there)
---
Shocking that friends of awful people are themselves awful
---
Ok here's how I would do Loot council, rough draft since I have never set one up or ran a raid so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Everything should be based off of Bis lists. As most classes will have the exact same bis lists except maybe a couple opinion pieces.
---
Main tank get prio followed by off tank obviously.
---
Every other class should just run down a list for bis items. Officers and long time members should be at the top of the list. Everyone else roles for their spot in line. 
---
Reroll and reset class lists every other month based on attendance and performance if anything needs to change. The rest reroll and get their spot in line again.
---
When an item drops that is on their bis list the first person in line has the first dibs of that item. If they pass for better gear later on, then it goes down the line till some one takes it. Once you get a piece of gear you go to the bottom of the line. 
---
Off sets or sidegrades that arent really wanted should be offered to roll for people who can use them for pvp or offsepcs. The rest should be DE for the raid. 
---
All of this should be open and transparent so no one is suprised when loot drops and the council suddenly decides where they think it should go.  The gear should basically be planned an distributed before it ever drops
---
Well the bad ones I guess.
---
Man, this is a gold mine for exactly what I was asking for, thank you so much!
---
We. Don’t. Care.
---
As a healing priest that mostly dungeon leveled from 30 to 60, all three of these points are wrong.
---
You want to maximize xp/h, which generally means minimizing total run time, which generally means maximizing dps under the constraint that you don’t let anyone die (since this costs time)
---
In that sense, priests absolutely should be doing damage, and a good chunk of it. Every global should either be damage (sw:p, mind blast, or wand) or healing (generally whatever your biggest rank of heal is to maximize time to dps or regen)
---
Mind blast is still efficient - a lot of mobs aren’t living for the whole duration of sw:p, and finishing a mob for spirit tap is huge.
---
I've seen his video. We might have to practice the los of boscasts.
---
Well, I like being a dick to others on reddit.
---
That does not make the post any less moronic though.
---
Yeah not greedy at all when there are probably 6 other people that got nothing
---
Fuck Uldaman. Everyone does it twice because there's like 6 quests and one requires you to do it again, but it's a shit place. I hate that place.
---
Oh and enchanters go there once. 
---
It's almost as bad as gnomer.
---
IM MOWIN THE AIR, RAN! IM MOWIN THE AIR
---
*piano intro* Dun dun dun dundun dun dun dun
---
Meh. It's really not as bad as you make it out to be. Sure I've seen hunters opening a pull with Multi-shot, or mages who open with Frost Nova into Cone of Cold and then spam AE. But those are the exception, not the rule. And even then, by properly utilizing Concussion Blow and Mocking Blow you can usually keep 3-4 mobs off of even the most suicidal mage.
---
Never had any. Always made green Q. Went dungs only once for Q.
---
what?? cannot be teachin ? wtf!
---
Crafting bandages is also a brain-dead easy way to make some gold. You can do something else while your character is making them.
---
It’s kind of a pain at level 60 even
---
What are you talking about? There won't be any time for sitting around Org during Phase 2. Horde PvPers will be too busy sitting around FPs for hours at end trying to be the first to tag the stray Alliance that flies in.
---
Exactly. I don't. The problem is that when most tanks find themselves in this position, people get desperate for tanks. Therefore, they are willing to pay for a tanks time.
---
A few hours with a Servant of Allistarj and you have all weapon skills at Max :)
---
I remember kiting one of them to SW in vanilla to let people level their skills.
---
What zones do you go through from 1-40?
---
such a thorough answer, thank you a lot mate!
---
Tanks can do what they want because they’re needed. If people don’t like it, roll a tank.
---
I planned on making resto, but after a run with my guild in LBRS they asked me to feral tank (I was obviously tanking in the dungeon). Glad to see those years of warrior did some good. Feels good man.
---
Ret Pally is a meme class regardless of level.
---
Tank are an exception, because 99% of tanks are furies doing the tanking to gather DPS gear.
---
Therefore it's more likely that this warrior will roll on DPS gear than not. 
---
You cant expect an enhancement to be healer or tank.
---
I do this over on Atiesh!! It has been amazing and I make more on tips!
---
Also I am shocked you only had one person attempt to tip you!
---
That's what I'm doing atm, it sounds like this doesn't work in OPs guild just because the minimum must be way too high.
---
You’re not competing with anyone but yourself. Different classes can’t be compared; that’s why they work together. You benefit from a Rogue’s expose armor but someone has to roll Rogue. Mages benefit from Warlock’s Curse of Elements but Warlocks won’t reach the same level. I always liked being useful in an almost unidentifiable way. Like buffing or debuffing.
---
But I’m not condemning your interests. This comes off as bad. I just hate when players beat themselves over a game they’ve already won.
---
I wonder which of his 73 youtube accounts itll be on
---
I've always been told to not even attempt BRD till your lvl 55.  A couple levels lower if your the healer.
---
Sell the account for 1000+ dollars.
---
i regret rolling rogue and wish i took a warrior so i could tank and not have to wait 5 hours to find a dungeongroup
---
Haha. What?
---
Have you played? At all?
---
Ever consider that I might be a good player and the other people maybe weren't that good, and thats why I was good enough to be over them in the DPS-Chart. Btw.. in dungeons I am almost always on Number 1 Spot (sometimes a Lock beats me, depending on the boss) as a Boomkin... The only PvP I lost against somebody, were shadows btw. I have beaten every other class in duels/pvp until this day. - Yes maybe Boomkin isnt good as dps for raiding, but they bring 3%spell crit to the group, Battle Rez, innervate &amp; as I already told, the dps itself isnt bad either. Place 10-12 from 25 dps is quite good! And btw - mages &amp;  rogues are a class specifically designed to deal dmg, a druid is a hybrid and therefore can everything but a bit worse than classes that are actually build to deal dps :)
---
Blasted lands is the same for both factions, 5 gather quests and the fallen hero of the horde.
---
Alliance also drops quests off there, but it's basically a flight path you jump down from and talk to a guy so I'd hardly call that a quest.
---
Stop crying and don't join runs where you don't agree with the loot rules.
---
It's really that simple, crying on this subreddit won't change anything.
---
If they reserve all the good loot and manage to fill the group in a reasonable amount of time, more power to them.
---
Yes, it's perfectly fine to reserve HoJ because you can still fill the group up with people who need other stuff.
---
There's nothing wrong with people voluntarily forming a group and all targeting different drops - *it's ideal*
---
My Shaman goal. Congrats
---
Begrijpend lezen is niet je sterkste kant neem ik aan.
---
You cannot put a counterweight on a staff
---
So, I will tentatively agree. Being a tank doesn't make you any better than anyone else.
---
However, tanks are in demand. Healers less so, but still somewhat, and dps are abundant. Therefore, tanks can make certain demands. Up to the group to give in or not. And honestly? Tanking is hard enough, and expensive enough, that the tanks have a right to be compensated for their work.
---
Yeah I agree with you on all your points. I said "IF you want to filter..." to the OP,  but I didn't stress that part enough in my comment to imply that while it's their prerogative to do so, it's probably not the best idea.
---
Grind mobs from 38 to 40. 
---
With skinning, I did Gorillas in a secluded part of STV. Made about 7-10g/h and about 25-30k exp/h doing this. Never died once.
---
If you need a guide on what gear to use for fury tanking, you probably shouldnt be fury tanking.   
---
Like, I am not trolling, its true. Fury tanking is meant as a last resort to push threat when you have exhausted all other options.   
---
You shouldnt be going fury prot till you have maxed out your threat in prot spec and your dps are still ripping aggro in raid.   
---
You don't go fury prot to farm easier on your own time, or because it sounds cool, or because you want to steal dps gear.  
---
A prot tank can hold aggro over a 1k DPS fury warrior. If you don't have many people pushing that kind of DPS in your raid, you SHOULD NOT BE A FURY TANK. In fact, I would call you a shitter for going fury tank and stealing fury gear and not even knowing when or how to use the spec.
---
Twinks was the term typically given to geared up alt characters who competed in pvp battlegrounds. E.g. “my level 19 twink”
---
Personally I'd say Herb/Alch.  Gives you a prof you can farm with and Alch offers a good way to make gold in the way of transmutes/making elixirs from your mats, etc.
---
I think the more common options for gold making, like skinning and mining are pretty heavily favored on most servers and thus heavily farmed.  For example, since DM release the cost of Devilsaur and Thorium bars have dropped by almost half on my server.  Blacksmithing/Leatherworking/Engineering/Tailoring/Enchant simply wont make you much money at all.
---
All of this means literally nothing actually real
---
&gt;By now I'm used to all kinds of tanks and, especially if I have mage water, I'll sit down to drink every moment I get, even if it's for 2 seconds, just because the pulls are usually so unpredictable.
---
This is the move. The second a pull is over, just sit down and drink. If I'm crazy low on mana I'll yell in chat about need to drink, but I just assume everyone's going to keep moving so I drink when I can. 
---
One thing that also works as a priest is throwing a renew on the tank right before the pull, and then immediately starting to drink. The renew gives me time to get almost to full unless it's a really big pack.
---
Your ability to make a lot of money with professions comes mostly down to you acquisition of rare recipes.
---
You can make good money with professions by grinding for materials with, for example, herbalism. But is is a heavy time investment, so it competes with other forms of farming such as killing mobs.
---
Recipes give you the opportunity to make large amounts of money by advertising services. But that's obviously dependent on being in a guild who raids and can get you access to rare drop recipes.
---
Other than that, you will make more money by effectively playing the auction house. Buying items when prices are low, selling them when they are high. Professions can play a role in that, for example buying cheap mats and selling more expensive crafted items, but the margins are quite small because other players can do the same. You make a larger margin by predicting what will be valuable, for example maybe you think PvP potions will be more valuable in phase 2 so you stockpile them now.
---
Professions are an important part of wow, but for the average person they aren't a gigantic money maker on their own.
---
Tanking dungeons in classic is a JOKE if you have a half decent group. A shaman can do it. 
---
That being said, I respect your decision, too many speed runners and retail players that have the mentality of "I saw this happen once, it works" but not knowing WHY it works, and wiping their group again and again and again.
---
Anything troll haha.
---
Congratulations on being a larger fish in a small pond where you're capable of doing a tiny fraction of the dps of other classes on your best night.
---
Please do me a favour and mouse over your percentile rank on warcraftlogs. You got 97% for Enhancement shamans with an ilevel of 58-60. That's the 77 I'm looking at and the parses it's counting when you look at that number. The rest of the time you're in the mid-60's even in that small pool, and most importantly even if it were all dps shamans, that's still an insignificant sample size. Enh + Ele together make up about 400 logs out of tens of thousands. The classic belief that everyone seems to have of "everyone must only play the best DPS classes" means they're just not common. Because they're not good.
---
I'm not saying this just tear you down and call your accomplishments meaningless, I'm saying this because your ego is clearly growing out of control from looking at that meaningless number and your expectations for the performance of enhancement are... somewhat delusional. That spells bad news for you and your guild when reality sets in and you realise that it's just not good. I've seen this sort of thing happen before where  the leadership has a meltdown and starts screwing up loot distribution and benching people because they feel bad when the rest of their group steps up and starts demolishing them on the meters. Because it's going to happen.
---
Also, please tell Tankasaurus, Ironmanfan and Baguette to use heroic strike and cleave occasionally, that's a huge part of why they're doing so poorly because a quick spot check didn't show them using either ability... at all. Probably afraid of threat far more than they need to be.

How does he get the image quality and borders so high using a phone?
---
I'm pretty much done with gear on my Holy spec so I specced hybrid to tank dungeons and it really made me miss the role (my main role in retail). Tanking without a taunt is so difficult though and people, even guildies who know Paladins have threat issues, will not hold back on dps. Almost makes me regret not going Warrior or Druid.

 **&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; | North America | Alliance | Pagle (PvE) | Semi-core Raiding**   
---
At The Tail End, we raid at the tail end of the week. 
---
We are currently hosting PuGs. We have downed Ragnaros and Onyxia.
---
**Who Are We?** A Semi-Hardcore raiding guild. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW. We currently have \~60 members (25 of them raiders), with 15-35 on at a time depending on time of day.   
---
**Guild Culture:** We help each other out, getting gear and attunements and class quests done for each other, and we chat in Discord and /g. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either. Camaraderie is more important than loot. Joking and joviality is encouraged, including NSFW humor. But toxicity is not tolerated. No culture war stuff either. 
---
**Class Needs:** We need a couple of everything except tanks. We are in particular need of a restro druid and a dwarf priest. We expect to have enough people for guild-only runs soon.   
---
**Raid:** Sun/Mon 9p-12 EST  
---
  📷 Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)  or contact RASPUTINA in game. 📷
---
arms sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind is quite a lot of threat generation on multiple mobs and you can always have a 1h+shield to quickly throw on for more spooky situations.
---
may require saving a bit of rage between pull it cannot charge to start
---
Ah yes, the Ad Hominem attack. Since you don't have a logical argument against my own, you'll attack my person. Very well, it's the equivalent of giving up in a debate, so I suppose /thread.
---
Even more pro-tip... just go smack the immortal ghost mobs in Badlands for a while and raise ALL your weapon skills to max while you watch Netflix or something.
---
Ran Ulda yesterday, two dps had to afk for 5 mins at the same time, no problem, we'll just clear some easy trash while they're gone, we have a tank warrior. Problem is, while clearing out a bunch of non elite dwarves, tank accidentally pulls boss, healer gets silenced, and we all wipe, other 2 are still afk. He immediately blamed healer, and rage quits. Keep in mind, this whole group was doing pretty well up until then, and we had zero wipes until that point as well. Despite that, he still raged and left, blaming everything but himself. Then a dps left, probably because he didn't want to wait for another tank. Luckily, someone got two 60 friends to help us finish, so we finished nice and quickly. 
---
Most experiences are good though, only other negative dungeon experience was first time getting a group together for deadmines, warrior tank got really pissy all the sudden about what classes I invited for dps and heals, claiming we'd never be able to do it with the setup. He then ragequited, keep in mind, this was all before we even started. We then got another tank, finished it in under an hour, and went our merry way.
---
No one said all alts are twinks. Neither are all twinks alts either. You can get help from another player to gear a twink that you main.
---
There is a shortage of tanks because tanking isn't everything tanks do.  I'd love to just attack and keep threat on things every pull.  
---
But unfortunately, a tank has to know every pull and boss encounter in the instance, the layout of the dungeon, how to accommodate lower level players so they don't aggro unintended things, how to LoS pull groups with casters so you aren't fighting right next to another group, mark kill order so you take out the most dangerous mobs first, know what CC will work on what mob, know what mobs need to be faced away from group, how to pace the group so the healers won't run out of mana mid fight, all while being mindful of every fucking pat that blizzard put in.  Oh yes, and know how and where all the quests for every dungeon are completed.  
---
This is on top of the fact that raiding in vanilla needs only 4 out of 40 people to be a tanks to cover 99% of all raid encounters, 1 in 10 ratio, while dungeons require a 1 in 5 ratio for tanking.   This leaves 50% of tanks unable to raid as a tank ever and need to go dps.
---
I still do it. People talk about Dwarf Priests being the best.... but not when it come to PVP!!!
---
SM + MC is great in neutral cities too to get them to attack their own faction, or on the boats to make them jump off the boat right before the load screen. Always pay attention to who is above you ;)
---
Nelf Priest FTW!
---
I got HoJ on my second run...as ret...and honestly I’m just waiting for karma to fuck me up in order to balance everything out.
---
Yah, the move to TBC was rough for some guilds. But I think it's one of those things that guilds likely should have gone to 2x 25s so you gain 10 raiders rather than lose 15.
---
Windfury brings all the tanks to the yard
---
Damn straight its better than thorns
---
My son (the other voice in this clip) sits right behind me, and sometimes our mics interfere with each other.
---
Just go in the spot next to them and fear them.
---
Uninstall and go outside, you finally beat the grind.
---
Streamers are better than us mere mortals. It takes a greater human to watch other peoples reactions to things and give commentary that runs exactly 10 minutes
---
That must be a mistake, I've seen one drop from NON-undead mobs.
---
I'm mainly thinking aesthetics tbh.
---
I use numbers 1-6 then all the keys close to WSAD and then combinations with shift for more hotkeys.
---
It take around 10-12 in-game days to reach level 60. So 240-288 hours, and if you play 3 hours per day - that's 96 days :)
---
Check your playtime with /played to see how far you are.
---
There's some cool stuff stuff on the blizzard gear store, or you could gift him a blizzcon virtual ticket if it's before the first of November.
---
Fishing/cooking is something different, u can make gold with it but i don't know if that's something for you
---
Just report for exploiting.  Blizz will take care of it.  There's a spot in the inn in Gadgetzan, saw an alliance mage doing the same thing.
---
RemindMe! 1 hour
---
In my experience I haven't had any "dead spots" - but I do usually go to areas with green quests all the time. The only quests I've abandoned so far is the king mukla one and Mai zoth both in stv
---
I always bring food and water for my healer.
---
That robe is so damn ugly
---
Looks like for some raid bosses(core hounds, the Beast, Onyxia etc) you need 310-315 skinning. There's a glove enchant that gives you +5 and 2 weapons that give +10 which drop from the Beast in BRS and High Priest Thekal in ZG
---
Why only ZG/ony/MC? Was it because those were so easy, or because they had gear that was better for pvp somehow? 
---
Just curious, since I hate pve and will only pvp once BGs come out.
---
**3rd** best feral weapon. 
---
Unyielding is better because it can get both elemental sharpening stones and counter weight currently. 
---
Even once agility enchant is out, Unyielding is still better because it can get elemental sharpening stones. =P
---
Can be, usually depends on the guild. My guild does speed clears so many of the cobsumables are mandatory
---
EDIT: Actually, I won't answer because I'm not 100% sure.
---
Try collector editions, wow figurines, wow lore books (their cheap and every wow fan loves them)
---
A few od my ideas
---
Goodluck
---
Shaman starter pack:
---
Some form of the word "shock."
---
Bonus:
---
As a Tauren, add some form of "beef" to the name.
---
You can do the early parts like the Jailbreak area, Arena, Houndmaster etc.
---
If you're fully enchanted and twinked out, you can probably clear all the trash with careful pulling and pots.
---
But don't think you can solo Herod unless you spam hp pots and bandages while he blades of lights.
---
You can definitely 2-man it though.
---
yes, 1.12 content is actually nerfed
---
in addition to the itemization, talents and player skill
---
Haven't leveled up my fishing or cooking at all lol. I guess I could zone out for a few days and level up fishing, though.
---
What spec shammy are you?
---
Currently rolling a druid.
---
My priest is great and all, but about 30% of the player base are already priests somehow
---
Can you post it?
---
Standing in the city afk seems to be popular.
---
That's the exact reason why I didn't roll a tank.
---
Tanks will defend their healers if the healer is not doing anything OP listed :)
---
The Raptors deserve better! Their poor spines! Have you ever compared the weight of a Tauren against a Raptor?
---
If the elevator goes down a split-second before you reach it, you miss the platform and die.  A railing on the elevator platform would be nice.
---
What you are hearing is your own mic through your sons computer, which is then being picked up by your mic once more only slightly delayed. This is how basic delay works within one system. If your son wears a headset or turns his volume down low enough it should fix the problem.
---
A little over 7 days, that being said, there's some AFK time in there from logging in to avoid queues.

And here I am leveling a mage to farm with instead. What have you been farming?

Thunderbluff and my extension mulgore are the prettiest zones, for sure. But my love of ironforge overtakes all lol

Joana's Guide only does it a small amount of times. Also, don't follow it to a tee. I would always go do the dungeons and all the quest for those dungeons when I hit the respective level. Did that and I was always 1-2 levels ahead of the guide.
---
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME
---

---
There’s a secret to the calc you’re missing
---
There has been a bug going around where people are locked upon entering an instance, even if no bosses have been killed.  You can check your raid IDs in the "raid" tab of the social menu, if it shows an Onyxia ID, you are unfortunately locked.
---
As a fury warrior I find myself in this exact position all the time. I just make sure to make it clear up front that I am in it for dps gear and most of the time they are cool with it (sometimes they are spectacularly uncool with it though). Either way I'm glad to clear it up before investing time and doing the group a favor.
---
Skeram-Horde between guilds and pugs probably clears at least through Golemagg 20 times a week or more, which means there are a lot of ingots floating around.
---
The ingots were the real bottleneck before, aside from RNGeezus on the eye itself dropping.
---
What do you mean? Now you can finally play the game.
---
It looks like you either have a great idea or a quest to give out
---
I almost always run back after a wipe, though I must admit, I recently waited for a res. The reason was that I told the group I needed a 2 min break to bio. I came back to find a dps had pulled for me out of impatience and wiped the group. I decided I would just wait for the res.
---
As for not taking other classes, I refused to exclude people for a while, but after the third brand new 60 warrior I had geared out in UBRS with not only the bracers off Rend, the belt off Drakk, but also the shield off Drakk, I got a little tired of losing roll after roll. I refuse to reserve loot on runs (not necessarily against it, but I prefer not to do it) so I simply don't invite fellow warriors, or I ask them if they intend to roll on something, and if they do, I won't invite them. Call it selfish, but said warrior could just as easily lead their own group.
---
OP's entire post is about *questing* (ie leveling) experience. Not raiding experience. Lost the argument so you resort to condescension, nice.
---
that was the data a month and a half ago
---
He's a druid so it's fine. He just goes cat form unless there's more than 3 mobs.
---
how about you use your brain lmao
---
PoJ is insanely good for solo content. The speed difference saves you much more time than any other 2 talent points
---
Lol...right "fuck tanks and their needs".
---
Let's be clear, I've been paid exactly ONCE to tank, usually i just tank the things i want.  I'm not trying to profit off of it, so don't go calling me a shitty person.
---
But how entitled does someone have to be to think tanks are obligated to spend their time tanking for a dungeon group with no guarantees they'll get anything they need.
---
That's just plain greed on his part. No other way round it.
---
AHHHGGGHHHHHHGHHH!!!
---
How much g/h can you make with herbalism? I just lvled to 60 with and then dropped it. I didnt check any guides how to best use it but it just seemed bad compared to things you can do even without professional.
---
The chance of them releasing paid transfers eventually is very high, I’m just waiting for that
---
Gott'emmmm
---
Wow that’s amazing, thank you!.   
---
Sorry to ask I’m having trouble following here, can you lay out the steps for me using the alt approach?
---
Well for what it's worth I never resubbed. On the Destiny grind now, that game is really good.
---
 [https://prnt.sc/pp90me](https://prnt.sc/pp90me) 
---
That's my setup. This will return 1 if target has 1 debuff, 2 if target has 2 debuffs etc.
---
If i were u i would go farming jade oozes or do something that relates to your profrssions (welps if u LW for example). Dungeonsruns soloing is not worth, def not at your level.
---
Okay well you wont make much money pre 60. Its some, but nowhere near the amount you can at 60. Try Swamp of sorrows farming, whelps drop flame sacs used for different things. As well as the Tigers/cats in the area, they drop greys that vendor for a lil bit, same for the crocs. Biggest advice would be lvl to 52/53 and start running brd. I make a lot of money from BoE drops and BoPs people dont need inside dungeons.
---
Go hit 60, then 2-man DM  or solo mara.
---
If you're burnt out, just play a different class. Trying to force a square peg in a round hole isn't going to work.
---
😎
---
The Hippogryphs in feralas drop decent gray vendor items about 20s-45s and each one is stackable. Their loot table is also pretty good in terms of random world drops. You could just mindlessly grind them if you don’t feel like running around questing. You’ll make decent money and maybe if you get one of the super rare drops you could make a shit load of money on AH.
---
Respect to that.  Some old shooters used to be that way, I actually reconfigured an old 3d space game called Descent to be controllable with the right side numpad plus WASD on the left so I had two hands on my keyboard.  Took awhile but the game had SO MANY keybinds it was impossible to do it with one hand.  You moved in all 3 dimensions and had multiple "spin" options too (lateral spin, vertical spin)
---
Forward
---
Backward
---
Strafe left / R
---
Turn L/R
---
pitch nose up
---
pitch nose down
---
Strafe up/down
---
Plus all your various weapon or status keys =)  Fun game.  You do you.
---
I tanked in Vanilla and absolutely feel your pain. I decided to roll mage for classic though because I'm just not putting myself through leveling warrior to 60 again lol. I had someone ask me why I wand so much in dungeons and had to explain that if I open up with frost bolt and fire blast like they did I'd be dead half the dungeon, like they were, because the tank can't out aggro heavy burst hits right off the bat. He started to use his wand for the first few seconds of the fight and wouldn't you know it, the tank had no more issues and he didn't have to drink every pull...
---
Mages have high QoL utility with mage food/water and ports at the end of dungeons. They also cover several functions that melee dps can’t, such as large-scale AoE and ranged attacks. Some dungeon rooms are annoying or almost impossible without high AoE dps (ie the torch room in BRD).
---
Most importantly though, mages are not competing with the tank/melee dps for drops.
---
Congrats bro!
---
IIRC Druids get one tool to help with AOE threat at the start - regrowth/rejuvenate on themselves right before. If it actually makes a big difference, I can't say for certain.
---
You know there are PvE servers where this isn't a problem. You rolled PvP, stop whining.
---
Relax, it's never been a secret
---
Yeah.
---
If you're not allowed to use corruption to fish for nightfall procs and he's allowed to sac succubus he's going to do more damage pre-spellpower. 
---
I've noticed though that at this amount of hit/crit makes for a pretty wide variance in dps. Who crits more, who gets to use up the most imp. shadow bolt charges, etc. My dps varies wildly depending on my luck
---
But if his average non crit SB was around 1k, he had to have been using consumables, because 200 spellpower won't get a max rank sb to 1k.
---
If he was playing sm/ds, maybe.
---
I am a fury tank and I don't have any problems. I DW when it's appropriate and put on a shield the rest of the time. I have points in all of the dmg reduction prot talents. When I wear a shield my healers get bored. I also pull way more threat than deep prot tanks while maintaining the same survivability. 
---
I think blanket labeling fury tanking as bad for X reasons is a tad off base. DW tanking is the term you're looking for. Fury tanking is much more than that.
---
Did you play on burning legion back in the day?
---
Yikes
---
At the moment I am. 
---
A couple of old guildies from back in the day reached out and put in a lot of work to get the old guild back together. This time around, we were split almost 50/50 on rolling Horde or Alliance. Ultimately, we decided to roll Alliance for the nostalgia.
---
Here we are two months later and 80% of the people either quit or jumped ship to a different guild that is clearing MC on the reg. I've got a 53 mage and 42 priest and the original guild is dead. During peak hours we can *maybe* get 5 people online. 
---
My brother and I are going to be talking later today about just switching realms to Horde. On the one hand, we've put in some work on our characters, and on the other hand we were both in the "Let's all roll Horde camp!"
---
At least I have a 14 shaman...
---
I ran BRD at least 100 times before getting my Naglering, but have gotten every other BiS for all druid specs in just a few runs of each place, including my Warden Staff dropping for me on my 3rd BRD run. It's been a lucky couple of months. Kind of just waiting for the next phase at this point
---
It's a lot better now with DM:East farm runs, that place is loaded with gromsblood, dreamfoil and ghost mushrooms.  As I said, most people are miners or skinners so getting into a 3man run should be easy.
---
&gt; seeing what you can accomplish in an hour or two of time in real life compared to an hour or two in WoW
---
I'm starting to feel like this more and more. I have tons of hobbies and I only really ever have time for one of them at a time. WoW isn't exactly the best hobby ever in the sense that... it's not as social as it should be for me, and the rewards are mostly, you know, digital. I'm at a point in my life where I'd almost like to cut games like WoW out, because I'd be better off using that time to do something else. One evening of WoW is a lot of house upkeep that could be getting done, and that won't get done if I'm sitting on my ass in front of the computer.
---
At the same time, I should have fun with my free time? I owe that to myself. But where's the line?
---
It's made a little worse by the fact that it's hard to get anything done in Classic without it taking an entire evening. Was grouping with my husband on my alt to help him get levels (he's a healing priest so questing is slow and dull) and by the time we got an SM group formed and to the dungeon it was like half our allotted playtime had gone by. Clear it once and someone leaves. Replace them and run it again and it's close enough to our bedtime that maybe we should just call it? After we walked all that way up there? We'd get like three runs in \*maybe\* and the evening was over and he might not have even leveled. It's all in the fun of things, I know, but dedicating all free time and not really getting anywhere doesn't feel as good as an adult as it did as a kid. I don't need my free time filled up; I have lots of other things I could do instead.
---
It's kind of like, at what point should I say, "I'm playing too much and I need to dial it back or stop playing."? I'm not sure. But I know a lot of people in this thread have had to make the call to stop (or dial it back) because there's just so much else in life that needs doing. The list never gets shorter.

Those five are essential IMO. The rest of my addons are for UI/Farming purposes.
---
Others have pointed out you're correct but I just wanted to say feel free to point this out to people because many don't have a clue that's how it works and they can help you complete quests. I don't know why people don't loot anyway but sometimes explaining it to them helps.
---
95% of guilds are not optimal.
---
Lol welcome to the free market
---
Interesting idea for a gift. Probably not a bad one.
---
I will add though, dont go with the intent for him to teach you, it rarely goes well. You need to learn yourself, it's better for both of you. Just dont be afraid to ask a question. Classic isnt complex but there is some weird stuff. It's a weird line between teaching and helping :)
---
Edit: aw come on mods... this is technically not classic related but at least it was pre-classic related &gt;.&gt;
---
My topic is about classic. I've stated several times now, and I'm sorry if that is too much for you to understand
---
The shorter the answer, the wronger it is.
---
Why are your guild not helping with Ingots?! what are they going to do with them!?
---
I do agree with this. I loved tanking on my paladin in BC. It was made viable with two small changes: % of healing done to the paladin restored his mana, and they got a taunt. Boom, Paladins are viable.
---
The main problem with this is that unless they appropriately reworked classic content, the changes in BC would make classic raids much easier.
---
nah you can get through 35-40 pretty fast with thousand needles/desolace/stv

I'm a Rogue that actively uses feint, and I approve this message.

This is the only answer. I made a “delete yourself” video after hitting Grand Marshal 13ish years ago. Make every mage you see regret rolling cloth. Every. Mage.
---
Also the best place to get your first taste of blood for pvp
---
Create a twink alt for when pvp drops.
---
That was what i tried originally but matchCount wasn't recognised.
---
As the comment below, if u use  aura\_env.state.matchCount instead then it works.
---
It's a method to figure out if someone has "earned" a piece of loot or not.  You gain points for things like attendance, being on time with consumables, etc, and you spend your points to "buy" loot that drops.  It's kind of the lazy method IMO of doing things.  You can get an add-on that does all the work for you so all you have to do is click a button.  
---
The other major method to hand out loot is "loot council".  It has the potential to be more fair, but also has the potential to be abused by those in charge.  This method also requires a lot more work.  There are addons to help with it, but you still need to keep track of a lot more information to make informed decisions about who should get what.  
---
Most of your more casual guilds will go DKP cause its easier to manage.  You tend to see loot council more on your more hardcore/progression guilds.
---
On a positive note, you can queue as a tank and reserve whatever you want. I just make my own groups and work towards my bis items tanking
---
There's a warrior on my realm with hand of rag and it's basically like wearing a giant target on your back.
---
Our first one went to a paladin :' )
---
back in original vanilla i was doing Battlegrounds on my pom pyro mage and some how after the WSG ended my PoM buff was permanently on and i could instantly cast spells as much as i wanted. I proceed to play Alterac Valley and just run around 1 shotting people as the ultimate 3-minute mage. When i logged back in the next day the buff was gone and somehow i did not get banned.
---
Use good old Darwin Brother. 
---
Let the “specials” fall were they may!
---
As a 2H Fury war with a BRE, it’s fucking fantastic.  Make sure you stay in a WF group and hamstring spam to pop flurry. 
---
Make a Weakaura that shows when you have flurry active to make flurry fishing easier.
---
I dare you to roll horde on Grobbulus.
---
Learn to heal dude. I heal our full fury specced warriors tanking through dungeons dual wielding and it makes runs so much faster.
---
I know it's crazy, but folks need to just turn off meters.   
---
Focus on playing the game well, not just "How good you push damage buttons", and I've found that tanks have fun, healers have fun, and you can even have the occasional hectic accidental body pull where everyone focuses up and just crushes it.   
---
Now, unpopular opinion, but if I used distracting shot on one of the other targets, I'm trying to trap. Stop dotting it. You don't need to taunt. I want that mook to beeline to me for a frosty time-out.
---
You didn't get a choice to roll real life lmao
---
Rolling on a PvP server means things (including yourself) will be camped by the opposite faction on occassion.
---
If you report him for cheating and list Terrain Exploitation  Winterspring Inn. A GM will whisper and warn/tp him.
---
Oh my god, that is hilarious, and accurate. Take my upvote, sir, I had to struggle not to burst out laughing at this.
---
If you want to reserve an item get a guild run together. Don’t have a guild that will help you? Find a better guild.
---
Supply and demand baby!
---
I believe you are right which also plays into why he would spend the gold to have damn near every buff in the game active for BG's
---

And then combinations with ctrl and bind side mouse button to ctrl.

This is the only acceptable course of action

The only thing I think it's fine on is the Ony head, because if somebody is organizing a raid, that's fair. But no other items.

Semi related but you seem knowledgable and I cant find a straight up list online. Do you know exactly which items are BoP that I need to make for myself before dropping gnomish engineering for goblin? Don't want to miss something.
---
Eh I just let them tank whatever they pull, after dying a few times they wait for me to establish threat before attacking.

You can always bring the elixir of greater agility (25+ agility) for the boss fight itself, but it's not really needed. Shortens the time by some seconds.
---
Simple magewater (55) (+ 45 food) and some superior healing/mana pots for your first runs is plenty. When you get it down, the chest contains major healing/mana potions for future runs :) Aside from that, all you need is lesser invis potions and large seaforium charges. Remember to bring some food for your pet as well, he'll be quite unhappy whilst learning this ;)
---
Good luck \^\^
---
Lmao I’m feeling this so hard right now. Just started a new 21 warrior on a friends server with no main support and it’s been brutal. Run deadmines a bunch of times and got smites hammer and my quest legs, but even so if I fight 2 mobs my level I’ll be at 20% by the end. If I fight 3? I better hamstring em all and run the fuck away cause that’s a for sure death lol
---
&gt;DPS will not let me build rage/aggro
---
Reading this reminds me of the casters that pre-cast their hardest hitting spell before the pull. Like jesus christ calm down
---
I love me a good mage don’t get me wrong. But much like hunters in vanilla it’s very rare to get a good one in any instance before UBRS
---
Druid here, endgame healing/tanking...sadly sounds like shaman is best in your situation.
---
Run Shaman if you want a non-priest pure healer build.  Run Druid if you want versatility.
---
Rolled a mage after 3 or 4 years on pserver as a rogue (been a rogue since launch).  Was super fun leveling but 60 sucks b/c I'm so used to itemization and gear mattering.  On a mage every item you have, including weapons, are literally just stat sticks.  So I sold my Azuresong Mageblade when it dropped in MC and bought a ton of BiS gear for warrior.  Officially switched to a warrior main and loving how much my gear matters. Long story short, don't be afraid to switch mains, the leveling sucks but it's well worth it if you have more fun end game.
---
You should not be using any healing gear as a warrior. Also your life is your healers problem. Worry about their mana, your rage, and threat mostly. In a solo setting all you need is well fed food, normal food, bandages, and health pots to stay alive.
---
It's so weird tanking her, she has frontal cone knockback ability (wing buffet), then instantly teleports you back to her face after knocking you back. Like where do you want me to be, dragon?
---
true, fat crits are awesome until you wait 3.7 seconds for a parry/miss and then know you have to wait another 3.7 seconds for the rage.
---
OVERALL .. the 2x 1h miss as much. I did a lot of dps testing with 2h and 1h and both are relatively equal atm for leveling (difference is barely noticable). and while I don´t kill the mob faster then with 2h it feels like a lot more is happening \^\^
---
btw, I switched to dual wielding at 20 and leveled as fury with 2x 1h .. for me 2h weapon is basically hit -&gt; make coffee -&gt; next hit -&gt; cook chilli -&gt; next hit \^\^
---
Or they blame the tank for not holding aggro
---
There's a way up to Arathi that only involves killing some non-elite Dark Iron Dwarves.
---
Still a lot of swimming though.
---
A nice alternative is to go to an underleveled zone and help some faction opponents on their questing, hitting their mobs. They'll be happy to get help and you're not leeching any xp. Being in an underleveled zone they also wont attack you. Just let them tag.
---
I wanna see a timer whenever I cast a polymorph on someone. And I want the timer to stay even if I target something else. 
---
Anyone know any mods that will make it possible?
---
Why do so many players roll horde on PvP servers? Or is there the same imbalance in PvE but it has little to no consequence?
---
dude... let the fucking rogue open on his own mob  
---
the dps should be with him, the mob will be stunned to death, and its giving you time to get full aggro on the other 4 mobs.  
---
not the mob you marked... maybe you didnt mark the correct mob. sry, dps is going to be on the caster, or the rogue mob, or the one that ran straight at the healer, as they should be.  
---
healer not drinking and telling you to hurry up... you ever think they might know how their mana holds up better than you do?  
---
some of your complains are valid(and very annoying)  
---
some show you haven't fully used your noggin
---
Then we disagree, that's my attitude and that's fine. If you don't think it's jackass behaviour to level up weapon skill during a raid then that's fine. Just don't be in my guild :)
---
IMO, if you willingly waste the guild's time on something as trivial as bow skill on a warrior. You're being a jackass.
---
&gt; Revantusk Village didn't even exist at launch and was added later
---
I'd argue they overcompensated by giving literally the best trinket in the game for melee until AQ off of a mid 40s quest. Alliance has no equal to ye ole guard captain.
---
As an Alliance Skeram player, this is kind of just the way it goes. I would say that there are loads of Hordies who don’t give a shit about me and just run by without engaging. Every so often there will be a corpse camping ganker, which is always a good time to hop off and take a break. Is it frowned upon to corpse camp low level ally on a server that’s probably 80% horde? Sure, but it’s part of being on a PVP server.
---
I just did this with polearms. Spammed wingclip had it up to 180 after 5 mobs and literally had it maxed just waiting for my party to gather at zf
---
They fixed it somewhat already
---
Just kill them
---
A transmute has a cooldown, it's not unlimited like any other crafting. A shield spike or w/e yeah you would never charge a guildy for. But a discount on something that actually costs you to craft is basically giving gold away.
---
That said I don't understand why people spam their CDs in trade when you can just buy an arcane crystal and sell bar for a greater profit margin than the CDs sell for.
---
These posts are getting exhausting.  I’ll admit I chose mage over prot war because of a shortage of raid spots for tanks, but I’ve tanked quite a bit throughout WoWs history.
---
I get that tanking is hard in retail, and a lot of DPS play like it’s bfa. I really do. I’ve also, however, seen plenty of tanks run in a power trip because they’re the tank, at the expense of everyone else in the group.  I’ve seen groups suggest we can skip mobs to speed things up, or AOE the next pack just for the tank to say no and we are doing his way. Now we are 10 minutes slower and wasting time because our tank has no humility.
---
As a tank you don’t need to hold everything all the time. There are plenty of pulls where the warlock and I can nuke them down, and I can frost nova/slow so nobody dies. There are a lot of bad tanks that don’t understand we are a team and can use each others strengths, instead of spending 2 hours in LBRS running single target on everything.
---
Honestly, playing a mage and hearing how stupid we are all the time gets old. There are good players, and bad players, tanks included.
---
30G?! I need YOU to help ME and I have to PAY YOU for YOUR time and efforts? *Scoffs in plebe DPS speak* Outrageous! Ill PST you in 3 hours when im still desperately in need of a tank.
---
Noob to rogue question - i see these hilarious videos of where rogues distract other players off bridges and mountains and stuff in PvP.  But whenever I use distract all it does it cause the person to turn towards the center of the circle.  I’ve never seen distract cause a player or npc to run in a certain direction.  Am I using it incorrectly?  I need to get in on some of this hilarious action!
---
Once I got to the high 30's I was looking at the Fiery War Axe on the AH for a few days, salivating over its DPS. A day later I'm doing Clamlette Surprise killing turtles and it dropped. Fucking Epic.
---

---
Didn't expect to see myself posted here!
---
Yah if I pull 3 mobs I instantly burn a 30 min CD. Also keep health potions around, level fishing and cooking and keep good food around. 
---
Also sweet talk your guildies into running you through SM when you're 30 and get all the gear.
---
Not that expensive to level alchemy tbh. If they have herbalism, it's pretty easy.
---
Pay a Mage to run her through dungeons.
---
Lol I bet you think it's entitlement when people post things in the auction house above vendor price too.
---
Thank you for posting this. Using this as a reference for tonight when I do the priest quest. :)
---
same. I have specced improve rejuv and regrowth but use lower ranks across the raid and it has dramatically improved my standings with low overhealing
---
I take it you’ve got no evidence then.
---
Not better than cloudkeepers with the buff active. 😫
---
As a healer, all I care is about keeping the tank alive. If dps gets aggro it's their problem to deal with.
---
mained hunter and definitely made the right choice. 29 days played, 3k gold farmed through soling mara/DM. Fully geared. Blasting gnomes left and right.
---
It's a social game in that it's designed so that you can't do it alone. You have to work with others. Each class/spec has its advantages and disadvantages. In this situation tanks have the advantage because there aren't enough tanks for 5 man groups. Part of the reason that is true is that there are too many raid tanks. It goes from one tank out of five in the party to 2 or three out of forty in the raid. So it's harder for you to get a spot in their little dungeon group but you have a hell of a lot easier time getting a raid spot as DPS. 
---
It doesn't make any sense not to take the good with the bad.
---
As a main tank player I can understand why it would go to people's heads, getting whispers of people begging you to tank or even offering gold can be pretty shocking
---
But when a group is looking for a tank for over an hour, they get desperate as fuck, had one group offer me 25 gold in total to come tank gnomer they were so desperate to get a tank, granted it was 3 AM on a medium pop server, but still it's crazy to think people would rather beg and pay for tanks than actually play one themselves :\
---
did i miss the update in which searing george was changed which led to lowbies being there? damn don’t play the game for 1 day huh
---
It was nice healing you last night at UBRS even though our run ended short! -Ahurakal
---
It's always Kargath.  Until phase 5 at least.
---
Casual elitism
---
A little yeah. Rolled warrior for the best dps. But you basically don't get to dps in 5 mans. Once you start doing raids it gets better but untill then you either tank or don't do anything. If you do get into a 5 man as a dps then the tank will reserve the dps items for himself. Doesn't help that tanking is horrible, even more so with full dps spec and bad gear since no tanking gear dropped. Should've just went with rogue which was my second choice. Only a little worse raid dps but you actually get to dps and is nice in outdoor pvp...
---
I've already grinded out epic mount and multiple boe epics for my warrior tho so rerolling at this point is basically a big no.
---
Someone posted [this](https://i.redd.it/q7la2dp77ai31.jpg) a while back, if that's something you're into. Handmade presents that have had time and effort go into them are the best presents.  
---
[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/culmur/finally_decided_to_finish_this_used_my_original/)
---
The best strategy as a tank imo is to mark a skull and then actually threat the non skull targets. The dps will kill the skull while your building aggro and then if the skull hasn't died already you taunt that one.
---
I understand that when nobody need one it can go to paladin because why not, but if you have casters that can use it, pally has no right to roll on it.
---
While those are good, the set bonus from Dal’Rends combined with the +Def on the offhand is a significant aid when you’re tanking bosses without a shield.
---
Cool. I, personally, have never griefed or camped anyone and yet the Horde has done so repeatedly, especially in STV or when trying to get to SM. I've been killed 1v1 exactly once, and the rest have been at least 2v1, but usually much more. And usually by 60s who are almost 30 levels above me.
---
Never have I ever made a Reddit post crying about it.
---
or are you the moron sir for failing to see the value in it...?
---
From the  looks of it, yes. 
---
Go be a dick to people who deserve it.
---
Well yeah, but if he's concerned about sustainability for grinding, speed doesn't really help you as much as say, bonus str, hit, or parry.
---
Because they’re jealous and frustrated. And then there’s that 1 guy who decided as a tank he’s the authority on how all tanks must behave.
---
The knockback itself causes a threat drop...
---
That moment in your day, you didnt know you needed something until you saw it!
---
Thanks dude, going to have to set this up!

Its the, as i call it, face rolling retail weenie complex. They have no concept of threat. Ravager warriors charge in as i pull and immediately spin to win. Tanking is aids sometimes but with a good group, it's very fun. This is my 3rd go round with a feral druid but this time no raiding. I get tells all the time asking if I'll tank for them and I've even started selling my tanking services. My mindset now is, if you're stupid enough to nuke right off the bat before I've got a hit off (or if the mob dodges, parry, etc) then you can pay the durability. I dont even try to explain it anymore. Retail managed to ruin vanilla.
---
2h and 1h (not dual wielding) get the same miss % for white attacks as you do for specials.  
---
dual wield has an additional miss % penalty on white attacks, but your specials still are the same miss rate as 2h/sword+board.
---
Theres also some wierd voodoo around heroic strike making your offhand white hits treated like a special for hit calculations, but as far as I'm concerned thats some big-brain 300 iq shit that doesn't realistically make much of a difference
---
I have a warrior tank, but i think it comes to how the person can control their toon. Druids have a decent AOE pull, but they can't generate rage the same way a warrior can nor can they use items while shapeshifted, which is a huge loss. The only thing warriors really have for AOE is Cleave. None of this helps either when you have a mage opening up w/ Flamestrike and Blizzard and your healer can only HoT you because they gotta use their casts on a idiot clothie that can't have a little common sense.
---
Yup I swapped to HotW/NS about a week back. I had been resto but got tired of seeing no requests for heals in LFG while simultaneously being whispered randomly to tank. I was hesitant at first, but after this weekend, holy smokes I am not going back any time soon.
---
Skeram on fire today on reddit
---
Do the math on how often its active.
---
This is a great idea. I've been struggling to get gold on my priest. I've tried mara princess farming, but I don't have the pathing down and it's incredibly slow with how little damage my SWP does. I most likely just need a little bit more practice to get it down so I don't die every other time. 
---
Spamming dungeons doesn't seem to get me reliable gold, especially as some groups are faster than others. My best bet so far has been 3 man DME jump runs, but those require 2 other good people to be there just when you want to farm, which is a pain if you only want to farm for an hour. My luck with orb farming has been pretty terrible as well, as I seem to make any group I'm in not get any orbs.
---
That is to say, a solid 10-15gph would be amazing for me &lt;3

&lt;Atrocity&gt; [H] | Sulfuras-PVP

&lt;Atrocity&gt; is a chill guild looking for more members.
---
A mix of past vanilla players, retail players, and newbs, we are a group of individuals gaming for stress relief from every day life (ie. work, kids, spouses) We are currently in the leveling process as we don’t feel the need to rush (most of our group is high 40s - 60), and will be setting up raids as our core reaches 55-60s. Our “prime time” is 6PM to midnight CST time. We are a PvE/PvP guild and plan to have nights dedicated to PvP once people have leveled and geared.
---
Raid Schedule : Planning for Sundays 7pm-? CST to start
---
Loot: TBD
---
If you think you’d be a good fit, DM me. Also interested in talking with other smaller guilds to raid with us or have merge into us, just shoot me a PM!
---
Sounds like you need to tell your lazy guildies to run to the instance just like you have to. There shouldn't be a reason to summon unless someone shows up at the last minute or forgets something in their bank (neither of which are really good excuses). It isn't fair to expect that the warlocks will just handle this. Your shards are better spent on healthstones and soulstones.
---
resto just has a bunch of talents that are really appealing to ele, mainly the 5% crit to lightning spells, the +3 hit, and NS working with chain lightning / lightning bolt as well as heals. Ele doesn't add anything to resto (except if you spec elemental warding), but the deep resto talents simply don't add much or compare well with the earlier talents.
---
Enh / resto (something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-500520210502305-5503330100001)) is equally fine, because the point still stands, that it's the early resto talents that are the most valuable for the spec. You will have to give up stormstrike for NS, I think it's too strong to forego. However, stormstrike is mana expensive and not that strong anyway outside pvp. You have +5% max mana which is nice. You can pick up the improved melee totems (WF + str), which is a nice bonus, although the math on them shows these are not as good as you might think. (You will have to give up parry to get both points in imp WF). There's a lot of space for a little tweaking here and there with enh / resto, any change with its own trade off.
---
Fundamentally I prefer ele to enh, I'd rather kill mobs faster and drink more when grinding, and ele does a lot more damage in 5 mans with preBIS. It's also easier in coming phases (not so much in p1 / p2) to pick up sp dmg gear from raids because it is our BIS - examples of this include the tier 2.5 set, which has the amazing 5 set chain heal bonus, but which is itemized with +sp dmg not +heal.
---
My comments are directed at raid healing as resto and being able to do other things like 5 mans and less painful soloing. However, it's difficult to make a x / x / 21 build for raid healing that's still strong in PvP. enh / resto finds it easier to work the pushback talent in, I would say, but I think enh is overall weaker for pvp than ele, outside of WF triple crit procs. But the ele / resto raid healing build isn't great for PVP outside AV / scenarios where you can go 'turret mode' because it's focussed around your lightning spells - shocks are much stronger for 1v1 / small skirmish scenarios, but you don't have the points for them. You can do a shock PvP / raid healing build, but I think it's a little strange and it doesn't have great synergies, unlike the standard ele / resto or the enh / resto build i suggested. The pvp talents are all over the trees, which makes it hard to pick up the different things you might want - [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/5503015003001-50002-5500035000201) is one attempt by me. This is weaker for raid healing as you must forego ancestral healing and you get less +crit on healing spells. But that isn't a huge amount to give up. However, this build only really juices up your shocks.
---
FoReVeRrRRRrRRRRRrrr
---
Costs way less mana but with RF still generates plenty of aggro. So you pop a real one for the pull but use the cheap one after to hold it and not run out of mana
---
Started with Lock and a vow to not make an alt until I hit 60. A couple days before launch I was last minute thinking of switching to Warrior. Well.. I hit 60 as lock and had a blast. Didn't like the raiding playstyle and rolled a Warrior. Now I have 60 warrior as well which I enjoy much more now. Having the 60 lock is fantastic for solo gold farming so in the end it all worked out.
---
I suppose your right....
---
That's what baffles me
---
Waters are around 20g now. They were 27ish in the week before and after Dire Maul release, but now the price is dropping.
---
btw Lotuses are 70g each on my server
---
1 wipe is too many.
---
*mouses over Devilsaur set to make sure you can add that flex in as well
---
MP5 is (edit: PRIORITY) healer gear, sorry, that's the way it goes. It doesn't seem like much until you stack more MP5 gear.
---
But level doesn't factor into it, if you're GOING to use that item in a few levels, go ahead.
---
I'm aware of how to do math, thanks for your concern. Cloudkeepers are bis on every fight where that buff is active for longer than 20% of the fight.
---
Which is nearly every fight in classic outside of nefarion, emps, cthun and a few naxx bosses.
---
Just check the AH
---
If you cant find it you can check older prices on:
---
https://www.bootybaygazette.com/#eu/venoxis-h/item/944
---
If this works, this is genius. Massive amounts of profit.
---
Well good luck, I tried the nova thing and I didn’t like it at all. I felt like it was high risk low reward due to the amount of things that can fuck you up. A lot of mage farming seems far more controlled and consistent .
---
The ring is best for healers since mp5. But if this was a out and not å guildrun you were 100% in the right.  Also if you can use the item it does not matter much about the level if your 50+ imo.
---
2 of the top 5 rings for healer are quest reward and this isnt good for a healer
---
It should be noted this is against boss enemies, not normal level 60s.
---
It's hard to prove favoritism(again it's especialy hard in classic where it's close to impossible to rate players based on their skill since there is no challenge) + dpk also keeps 39 other people happy. I was always a dpk or simply attendance% + roll+1 kind of guy. I don't see any benefit of using a loot council for guilds, whos main goal is to be at the very top, as most players in such guilds play for the sake of progressing their own character.
---
Right, my feral has two just in case I sell one to the NPC again. My warlock has one, just in case.
---
I'd expect it's the same cheese warlocks use, obviously harder with less instant cast spells
---
In an ideal world, you have aggro gear and mitigation gear, and swap them out as needed. So, whole 200g dropped is...expensive, it is not utterly wasted. Having both options on tap is best.
---
Plus, it can take the agility enchant when that comes out, which is nice.
---
I tank 60 dungeons and will admit that I might go too soon sometimes.  Some of it is due to the variance of gear between healers, and how well the dps manage their aggro.  I can pretty much chain pull scholo with our guilds best priest healer and dps who know how to not get hit, and force the healer to use more mana. 
---
Just make your mana preferences known and most tanks will happily oblige.
---
If everyone were to do it, it would be extremely detrimental to the run regardless of pug or guild. Thats how I classify it as a dick move. You are taking advantage of the group atmosphere.
---
You could meme it and make a joke of it with your guild. I think if you could somehow do that it would be fine, but that’s a rarer case than just leveling weapon skills in trash. 
---
Next thing you know, all the melee dps are trying to level unarmed and now the trash takes an hour instead of thirty minutes. No thanks.
---
It’s not your BiS and it’s much better for healers. Mages focus on spell damage above all else. Mages have the least mana problems because of evocation, mana gem, a ridiculous mana bar for short MC fights, and mana pot. Healers need the MP5 per 5 seconds because they’re spam healing their tanks or raid the whole time in raids. Shamans prioritize MP5 above all else, druids try to get 25 mp5 on gear, and priests could use it but with their spirit being so good it’s less needed. 
---
I’d say you should have given that ring to your healer. It might be an upgrade for you right now but at that level that healer is gonna be using that ring for a long time probably unless they get lucky with drops. You will replace that ring soon if you’re trying to maximize your dps. That ring won’t do you too many favors on dps.
---
Found the pug dps player hitting X while there is a mob actively marked with skull.
---
It's fine if you don't want to praise me.
---
Everyone else getting groups faster sure are. I like saving a group of people who've been waiting for a tank for an hour. I *am* a hero.
---
It turns out that yes, I am a special snowflake, because I can join a group for any instance I want in literally less than 3m
---
Hmm.. cool. I figured there has to be a reason people try to tank as one
---
&gt; So its not like everyone has one.
---
No, no - all the streams I have been watching and my confirmation bias have already told me that everyone has one.
---
Is it better to vendor the greens I find questing or to take the bag space and time to auction them? Lately I have just been vendoring them for the few silver which has been nice as I have over 1 gold at level 15.
---
Huh, its usually a group of Alliance camping that flight path. They must have moved to inside Blackrock Mountain then, because this is what I experienced last night.
---
I may be a bad tank but with 30-40 runs in brd I’ve only had one tpk. With that said I’m a Druid I am 57 with just shy of 6k hp and tons of armor. I never check healers mana. I assume they manage their mana and I pull big then small and I chain pull with innervate up etc. I don’t do huge pulls back to back but I alternate large and small pulls and I’m not afraid to hit myself. I feel for warriors. They are way less spikey but they can’t heal themselves. I probably take more dmg but I feel way stronger in dungeon settings.
---
I think he means rank one consc. 
---
I start with max then swap to rank one
---
Happened to me literally last night in Skeram @BRD. I've also been corpse camped plenty of times by gnomes. Sure, the majority of the time ally will leave me alone but I bet you can say the same about the majority of horde you meet.
---
&gt;They gank in parties of 5, never 1v1 classic horde
---
Alliance does this just as much as horde does.
---
Gotta remember this is a 14/15 year old raid. Lots of people in raids are better geared, better knowledgeable and have better addons to help them. Plus with a better social media connection we can hear about things like this a hell of a lot easier than it was back in 2004/2005. I know for a fact on Dragonmaw (My First server) there was a Fresh 60 Warrior tank that had both Thunderfury bindings drop for him and as soon as BWL was open he had Thunderfury in less than 3 weeks. It's all the luck of the draw.
---
Grind all the bis items? Farm consumables, get engineering and all the good items for pvp? Work on getting a new faction mount? Do pvp? Farm gold. 
---
If you can't find something to do, just take a break. There are a lot of things to do.
---
You could always roll the Druid and end up having him be the MT
---
So you won't take rogues, hunters, enhancement shamans, feral druids etc? If everyone had this attitude then no one would get into 5 mans since the tank wouldn't take any physical damage classes and healers wouldn't want spell damage classes.
---
As annoying as it can be to put groups together, the best way to pug as a tank is to put the group together yourself. THIS WAY NOBODY CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR DECISION MAKING. At least, this seemed to work for me when I levelled my pally as prot.
---
2070, sitting at ~100 on high graphics in most games
---
Eli5 what I’m lookin at here.
---
Problem is that if you do that you run the risk one one idiot causing the whole group to wipe.
---
I like satyrs in Felwood and Azshara, Yetis and Furblong in Winterspring, Undead in WPL, those humans in Azshara.

Very well put, time is money, and tanks time is straight *SCHMONEY* *cha-ching*

Took me exactly half a run of rfc on my feral druid to catch myself not paying attention to the healers mana because I was eager to use all my built up rage to spam maul on a new pack of enemies.  
---
Rage changes you...
---
Now you can play the game!!
---
Don't bet on it before P4
---
Lol at the other penguins like “wtf is he on”
---
Couldn't imagine doing it as a druid tbf.
---
I've got BiS Bow and a lot of T2/T1 gear and it still takes me 3mins on average to do princess.
---
It's not hard, but she wreckes if she gets close.
---
I think i'm gonna play the game of real life for a while. Just cancelled my account!
---
For every horde that gets attacked, 10 lowbie alliance will get camped.
---
Not at all.
---
Ah...PVP issues.  I run PVE, so...not a problem.
---
I'm mostly surprised how many people need to be told (on my PVE server) not to take the disguise off...so I assumed that was the issue.
---
Sure, but it also has spell crit which is invaluable to a Shadow Bolt spamming Lock. Looking at the pre-bis for healers, there are 7 rings that suffice and the only one that has MP5 also has increased healing too.
---
Dps -"shortage of tanks!!??1!1!1!1"
---
Also dps - "You can't reserve first orb, greedy asshole!"
---
I think you were completely in the right to roll. The ring might be great for healing, but it’s also great for damage, so it’s fair game. Argument 2 is just nonsense. You out in the work, you get to roll. Level is never a  limitation because you will get there eventually. Sounds like the healer was just crabby they didn’t win.
---
Ok, just please keep it small.
---
Let your bank alts hold your gold
---
Tanks got bigdick, just use that shit as a baseball bat to that frostbolt being flung your way
---
Prepare for phase 2. World bosses and the insane war that it will cause between horde and alliance.
---
and c) know every single pull in the dungeon (or have a group who can advise  or doesn’t mind learning as they go), know how to maintain threat, and don’t mind being blamed for all mistakes made in the dungeon by any of the 5 members. And all the other negative points in this thread lol. 
---
It’s easy to forget that tanking actually takes a lot of unique skills and a huge amount of game and dungeon specific knowledge when we’ve been doing it for 15 years.
---
I think that it's fine to roll on this trinket as a healer even if mages from the same guild are in the raid (I'm a mage) but you will have to come heal more runs after you get one, just to help everyone from at least core raiders group. It's fair
---
ah so getting killed, but just over and over again, its the same fucking thing. dont sign up for a pvp server if ur not willing to get pvped without consent. But what would someone do if they wanted to pvp but only on their terms? GASP, is that a function of pve servers???????? 
---
This whole thing is based of stupidity. Why are they not allowed to camp someone? If that gives them fun, why should they not be allowed fun but the other person should be allowed fun by not being camped? Its a game, if someone wants to have a fun in a way in which the game allows and pushes for, let them you fucking pussies
---
Now? Now you can finally play the game.
---
As a tank, i'll pull when my healer and other mana users are at around 75%, i figure i'm fine for a bit while they finish and it gives me a chance to grab some aggro.
---
One of the mistakes I made was trying to auction stuff for 24hrs.  AH takes a big cut in that case.
---
unless it has relevant stats for the type of item it is  I'll just vendor it.
---
Yes, thank you. Those two things right there are why the content feels trivialized, not this "we are better at video games now", or the "we have prebis lists now" bullshit. I love the hunter talent for "melee specialization" haha.
---
It sucks that in whole Dustwallow Marsh there's like 5 quests total for Alliance and you meet Jaina only once. There's a huge wizard tower in the dead center of Theramore and you don't ever need to go up there.
---
That's odd, I've definitely swapped weapon sets including offhands in combat. As a feral druid.
---
I haven't hit 60 dungeons just yet, so maybe this is just an experience thing among tanks. I'm 49, almost 50 right now, and I was spamming ZF all weekend with different random groups that I found in general chat.
---
There were some groups where I had to drink up from 30% every (or almost every) pull because I had to drop constant heals into DPS as well as the tank, and there were some groups where I felt like I wasn't doing enough because I barely hit below 50% mana except for on boss fights. So yeah, I have no doubt that there are many excellent tanks that can chain pull and hold aggro and the healer is doing just fine because they have the gear and only have to focus heals (primarily) on the tank.
---
This is the real answer. Smash some Alliance skulls.
---
Just curious...what's the point of doing that?  I'm horde on a different server and group camping graveyards/flight paths seems like a horrible way to waste my weekend.  With no honor rewards it's quite literally pointless. There's no skill or challenge in it because it's not a fair match against people prepared for a fight, and so it's not like it's improving your pvp talent...idk.  If there's literally nothing more entertaining or productive to do I think I'd rather turn off the computer and go to a movie, get some drinks, or do literally anything else.  Hell, if I just couldn't peel myself away from wow I'd at least go out looking for an entertaining fight. 
---
To each their own, I guess, but it's a bit ridiculous for you to complain about server pop when you're quite literally part of the problem. Kill people and then let them go on with their day/questing/whatever and maybe they won't all ditch for a less toxic server.
---
SC 6 piece does more dps than T2 / T1 on a rogue given the following caveats:
---
- Dagger Rogue
---
- World Buffs + Consumables
---
You don't need every buff in the game for it to be higher dps, but you need enough. Either way, they are very close to each other for dagger rogues at all buff / consumable levels.
---
50-55 is the worst.  
---
SM will get you to 44, ZF will get you to 48, and there is plenty of good quest hubs to do in between.  Once you hit 55 you can do BRD to level, and then all the end game instances after that.  
---
But that spot between ZF and BRD, it's pretty rough.  Also this is where you really start to ramp up hard on the amount of same lvl mobs needed to kill per level.
---
It's not a healer-specific ring. And not even a paladin, for whom the stats fit the best, would take that over the Rosewine/Fordring combo that is so incredibly easy to get.  
---
Being under the required level means nothing, everyone knows this, I have never seen a weaker argument in my life. \[give me this gratification because it's instant for me but a slow roll for you\] - wat  
---
Just NaCl overload. /ignore and move on.
---
And if a few minutes don’t work. Wait for server reset (tomorrow?). That should kick him out so you can log back in.
---
Hunter would have been better if you were wanting to do solo farming. Or a mage.
---
Also, everyone remember Drakedog as « destrolock » but most of his Vanilla PvP was SM/Ruin. He made the Seduce/Soul Fire popular, as SM/R.
---
But I agree that he totally went full Destro at some point and stick to that after Vanilla.
---
It's more of a damned if you do damned if you don't situation I was thinking about. I've had healers bitch for me when I wait for them to drink and when I don't. 5 seconds is a long time for someone to find the water on their bar. I'm pulling if you're standing after 5s no action.
---
In classic I rolled a Paladin. Rerolled a Warrior at some point to help out with tank shortage (DPS if our main tank guy is on, tank when he's not). Nahhhh. Healers are terrible and don't start queueing up heals until you're at 20% or lower, and DPS don't give an eff about threat. Warrior charged a group? Better go full AoE mode. A lot of getting yelled at, told how to instance, etc etc. Hard pass.
---
Yup we're trying to get all of our healers to download that. Turns out it's compatible with a few other healing mods too so you don't all need healcomm specifically. I'm fully capable of managing, my point wasn't that I don't know how to heal or can't compensate, the point is healing for these first few raids is really not challenging at all.
---
&gt;the Lock dotting up a second
---
The locks have been surprisingly the most frustrating to deal with for me. I think it's due to the way their class is organized (especially affliction warlocks), they feel like they have to dot up every mob at the start of the fight. Then, I feel like I'm fighting upstream the entire fight trying to stay ahead of their dot ticks for threat, while still keeping primary threat on the skull target that the rogues are hammering.
---
*I've been kickin' ass, since the dawn of time*
---
*I am just a killing man who's reached their killing prime*
---
Haha truuu
---
You have no clue how warcraftlogs work. Just check the rankings and you see that your 97% prse is only for shamans.
---
Besides 400 dps is whats your max, which is 1.5k dps lower than my max dps (Lucifron for example).
---
Your 97% log is 600 dps below my 95% log
---
Or wowhead homepage will tell you.
---
Yeah As a mage dieing doesn’t phase me or my gold at all ;)
---
Yea I knew it wouldn’t be for a while, but getting into a really good guild with my friends made it hard to decide to leave the server when the free transfers were out. 
---
Hence the only time I’m actually playing on Skeram is when i’m raiding because of how impossible it is to actually play outside of instances, I decided to make my alt on a different realm and have been enjoying it much more
---
60/40 is not fairly balanced. Skeram and Herod are both worse than that.
---
Obviously Blizzard should have wiped everyone's memory. #indiegamedev
---
Tanking is exhausting and I don't do it all the time, but a lot of this is really your problem.
---
You need to assert yourself. I try not to encourage a diva attitude but you are the tank and you can join basically any group, so ensure that your group is down for what you want.  New to the dungeon? Tell them, ask someone else to pull if necessary or to guide the way. Do you want to skip or clear all? Tell the group what you want and be willing to leave if it doesn't work for them, someone else will be glad to accommodate you. Tell the healer to drink if you want them to, tell the DPS to stop doing whatever annoying thing they are doing.
---
People don't like tanking because people are filling a role that requires leadership yet refuse to lead.
---
Also, losing aggro isn't the end of the world. There are numerous ways to control mobs and tanks aren't even strictly needed as AoE cleave groups demonstrate. The mage and warlock will get aggro if they aoe, but who cares? Both classes are always said to destroy melee PLAYERS in PVP so they can easily manage a few mindless trash mobs in a dungeon. the shadow priest may get aggro with its healing and mind blast spam, but they have great damage reduction and shields. Rogues can barely be hit when they pop their cooldowns and they have tons of stuns, hunters can feign death, druids have bear form, paladins have bubbles, shamans have a totem that can taunt and another that reduces damage, and have slows.
---
It sounds to me like his guild has no issues clearing MC so tell me why its bad for him to try to increase his DPS. I don't get your point but fun is subjective, especially in harmless cases like these.
---
He spared them CLEAVES
---
JESUS...guessing our server is less in demand because our server isn't as raid-proficient yet.  Finally filling out 60s and seeing multiple raid groups every week though.
---
At the moment I'm saving the lotus for the guild to use, but I'm sitting on about 500g on your server.    0.o
---
Damn I honestly feel like I could have written this. I feel this on so many levels.
---
I'm gonna be a dwarf on a swift mechano strider.

Not even 1 /lick?

Better have some way to break CC or you get sapped/polymorphed until honorless wears off.

---
I read that today as well. Not sure if that was in classic though or not.
---
As an alliance, go to the deeprun tram, IF side, to the back corner. There's a spot where two rats spawn every 3-4 seconds if you kill them. I leveled 2h axes in about 6-7 minutes from 1 to 150. I just got my ww axe and had no skill in axes, so that place saved me a lot of trouble.
---
One more plus, you're gonna crit the rats most of the time, so rage is a non issue. Pressing sunder as an opener for each rat will give you more attacks to increase the speed of the skill up.
---
At least running with 2 pallies you can have one blessing of salvation the DPS. 30% less threat saves a lot of headaches. I'm running holy pally right now and I've been making a lot of tank friends because of salvation.
---
Those are all nice if you have rage. My Warrior was herb/alchemy for that reason.
---
Oh for some reason I thought it was 5 &gt;.&lt; just looked it up Idk how I always thought that.
---
I rate it not as high because that rarely happens this early, maybe 1 or 2 times a boss fight, all the cards have to line up perfectly for it to happen. You have to have either gotten a crit last hit or another lock has to proc it for you, then you have to hit the boss while it being a crit. We also have the lowest amount of SP we'll almost ever have atm, with such a small base crit has less of an effect then it would in BWL, When you have a lot of locks, a crit dedicated lock, or locks with good gear (BWL)  all round then the usefulness of the crit skyrockets.
---
Tanks certainly need to wait for mana, however I would guess for 80% of tanks that "pull quickly" it is because if they don't the dps will and then you will still be low on mana but the pull will also be screwed so everyone will be taking damage. After every pack is killed I have an internal timer counting down to when I think dps will get inpatient and "help". So many players are trying to "speed run" classic.
---
I don't mind warrior dps that much when I'm tanking on my druid. I know that if they pull agro, they can take hits much better than a rogue or mage. Plus they can offtank if need be, assuming they know what defensive stance is (LOL).
---
My beef is when the group already has one or two warriors in there refusing to tank ... looking for yet another warrior who will. If I were that tanking warrior, I'd just say "Oh, it looks like you already have a warrior to tank this instance and you invited me in error. I'll leave now. Thanks for the invite and good luck on your run!"

It's either pinning or someone gets him a box to stand on so people can see him.

The problem is that server imbalances start to snow ball. I play Alliance on a PvP server that heavily favors Horde. I’m only level 49 so I’m not sure how life at 60 is. But in Gadgetzan there’s a 100% chance there will be high level horde camping the flight master where the guards can’t reach them. The last time I logged off I was literally the only alliance player in Gadgetzan. I counted 20+ Horde characters there. 
---
When there’s that much of a population imbalance there’s no reason for Alliance players to stick around. You could transfer to a PvE server where you’re not getting ganked and there’s more people to group with. 
---
I’ve always heard good things about world PVP and epic battles between factions but in reality it’s just alliance players getting camped  by greater number Horde characters.
---
Had to go to heartseeker, my name was taken on earthfury :(
---
...?
---
You're correct. I noticed that myself.
---
Hey me too! Horde in vanilla all the way through BfA, my retail main is still a Hordie. Rolled alliance because I never leveled one through the zones, especially not back then, and thought it'd be interesting. I was right and I'm happy I did.
---
I'm fortunate where most horde do leave me alone unless I'm near a dungeon entrance. I don't know what I would do if I rolled up to BRS and saw alliance on that balcony for once.
---
Some of that dry spot could be taken care of with Mara
---
Cant wait until full naxx gear so i can start playing the god damn game.
---
I'd tank if Shaman tank was a little better.
---
I plan to try while leveling, but I am sure that  unless I am overgeared there will be problems.
---
This one too! Thank you. About 1.5-2 gold profit with this in my realm.
---
I'm not a supplier I'm a buyer and I don't want to pay that much to levitate.
---
Druids can heal so it's not that big of a deal if you take damage.
---
You pay 4.16g-5g per stack of runecloth?
---
It's so good that DBM uses that guy's voice clips.
---
I would off tank on my sham is people were not butthurt about it. The few times the groups let me tank when we didn't find any shit went so fucking smooth, just had to drink a lot. The dps taking aggro were annoying but earth shock is basically a taunt and rockbiter give goot threat, biggest problem was making them understand drinking downtime. I don't even try anymore because people don't think it's possible. Good luck trying to find a tank in the next 5hours, im going to do something else. It got way harder in the last level though, it took quite a toll on the healers since I have 0 plate.
---
Now you can finally play the game.
---
I'm pretty sure to tank decent you have to skip all the cat talents which leaves you with 8 points to spread between the two. IDK if 4 and 4 or 5 and 3 favoring one would be best.
---
If you know someone that has the mats for the very last quest in the chain, you can save 250g (provided they don't charge a fee. I've seen anywhere from 50-100g, but if you have a friend or a guildy they might do it for free). You have to do all the mat turn-in quests, which will vary from server to server but will probably run you 300-500 gold, but depending on your professions or your connection to people with professions, you can save some cash. You also have to complete the quest that requires you to spend 150g,  so your total winds up being cheaper than a 900g mount, but not by a massive amount.
---
That's me,  but everywhere.
---
100% this, just incredibly (un?)lucky timing.
---
aoe mage is extremely easy compared to actual "hard" things in retail wow, or compared to pvp on any class in classic or retail wow
---
Love this
---
HELL NO

#2.6k DAMAGE WINDFURY PROC
---
9% is for 300 weapon skill. At 305 weapon skill you need 6% hit against a level 63 target. With more weaponskill than that the base miss rate decreases nonlinearly to a minimum of 5%. So you should already be seeing that you never miss when using a bow.
---
to each their own ^^
---
you'll be back for some of that WoW crack eventually :p
---
Personally, I also find it fun in a weird way if im in a group and everyone fucking hates eachother and its so tense.
---
I havent confirmed this but a wowhead article somewhere mentions weapon skill mattering in world pvp but not bgs
---
just do it in a 5 man, nobody will notice.
---
Twist:  Happy with my rogue but I chose the male/beefy character.  Wish I would have gone w/ the sleeker female so as to be less visible in crowds.  :/
---
If you play for the sake of progressing your own character and not for the raid team you dont belong anywhere but pugs. Dkp only keeps people equally happy if they can all equally attend raids. And if they can all equally attend raids then they might as well just divy up gear ahead of time to save effort and time. The best guild in the world right now uses loot council. They know who will get what before it drops and everyone is happy to show up and congratulate their raid members on the upgrade cause they know that it helps them as well. No top guilds use dkp
---
As for favoritism. The loot shouldnt be decided when it drops. It should be determined before it drops so we can see who's in line for their next bis item. After they get an item they should go to the back of the line. If someone keeps getting items it's pretty obvious somthing is wrong.
---
I think people dont have the right idea about loot council and they think it should be about feelings at the moment of an item drop. For every class they share the basic same Bis list. When an item drops the first in line has first dibs and if they dont want it cause they are waiting for better loot then it goes to the next in line. When you get a piece you go to the end of the line. For most classes there are only about 5 of each except mages or warriors probably. This means if the first in line for mages wants the mage blade but the t1 gloves drop first he will pass in case the mage blade drops. If the second in line things the t2 legs will drop after mage blade that night he passes and the third in line gets the gloves. He now moves to the end of the line. Let's say the mage blade and legs drop so the top two move down as well. Now mage number 4 and 5 are first in line for the next bis items to drop. 
---
Every gets gear at an even pace and the whole raid gets stronger. For items like OP was discussing that people dont really want or need but might use for pvp or offspec they should just be rolled off to the class group
---
This. The greed gives players entitlement. The entitlement gives players a sense of worth/reward. Thus, their time is worth more than others.
---
Tanks really aren't shit. That's why you play whatever class you want, and have your alt as a druid, or a warrior like I do. 
---
Why beg like a pleb and pay precious coin to some scum bloke who's wearing greens acting like he's a main tank plowing through instances like a speeding bullet, when I and others can hop onto your tank/heals alt and save the day. 
---
Play smart people. Solve your own problems by having a tank alt.
---
As a newer player I really don't understand the boner people get for topping a useless damage meter you can't even see without an add on installed. My buddy's a 56 warlock spamming LBRS / Scholo / Strat / Dire maul with us (all level 60s) and he draws aggro every fucking pull because he's obsessed with maxing his DPS and refering to the damage meter any chance he gets. He's not even a new player; he's played almost every expansion since TBC
---
I saw a post the other day of someone who wiped 3-4 times on Ony and ended up locked to that instance. So AFAIK it effects both dungeons. I’ve never seen the bug though because I remember it existing in Vanilla and don’t enter MC/Ony unless I’m in a raid that’s going to be clearing bosses.
---
The softly wheezing discord guy made me laugh.
---
Alliance having SW right next to Blackrock mountain more than makes up for any small amount of time spent in low level dungeons imo.
---
Most horde have to decide if they want to set their hearth to UC and fly to kargath for every raid or blackrock mountain dungeon, or set it to kargath and fly to UC any time you need to do something in a town. The amount of people sitting in kargath at any time begging for portals because the flight to a major city is so far away is nuts.
---
Noob question - the imp shadow bolt debuff is accepted in raids right?
---
Maybe that's because you're a resto druid. If you played a better healing class it wouldn't be a problem.
---
Well yeah, they finally made the dps specs of healers not laughable. Same for shadow priest, Ret pally (mainly for horde), and Druids.  It was very healthy for gameplay and spec diversity. I kinda wish they could somehow work that into Classic, but it’d break from the “authentic vanilla experience” and people would lose their minds.
---
Well ofc it's lower in crowded org/sw, havent set foot im a raid yet bht i don't expect it to be too bad
---
I do, but that is dangerous too, as you pass through some wolves and bears at lvl 50 to get to the road, unless you want to go through the ruins there (rip). Then there seems to be an horde town right at the edge of you have to run by as well. I find it’s more likely to die that way than the long run from SS.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s pre burning crusade bis. I don’t think they replace it in all of vanilla.
---
Missing band of acuria, dragon bloods cape and slaghide gloves. There’s also 10 feral tanks on our server.
---
&gt;The dice throw, I'm not sure how it's debatable.
---
How is it not?
---
If you could control all the factors force of throw, angle, weight of dice, dice orientation, surface material, wind/air resistance...etc you could get the same number every time.
---
The world is full of monsters. Why can't they be one of them?
---
&gt;  I know, but dedicating all free time and not really getting anywhere doesn't feel as good as an adult as it did as a kid. I don't need my free time filled up; I have lots of other things I could do instead
---
Damn, this right how sum up how I feel exactly. WoW was amazing when I had freetime with NOTHING else to fill it. I was a kid in school, not responsibilities, homework or anything like that. Now.. I have so much more I can / enjoy doing that WoW takes the time from those..
---
I also feel like at times I was trying to force myself to play WoW.. saying I deserve this and it's okay to have fun but I'm starting to think my definition of fun has changed over the years :/.  Going out talking to friends, having/cooking dinner, spending some quality time with friends / family, working on another goal is so much more fulfilling now it just sucks to admit it because I really want WoW to give me that feeling it did before.
---
consumes and skill
---
If you are playing sm you need to take advantage of your corruption procs, keep it up on adds and the boss always.
---
Typically Tuesday through Thursday. The best way to get an idea is to look at your server forum and inspect the recruitment ads for big guilds you've noticed on your server. The recruitment ads will typically list their raid days.
---
Exactly. The way I have been describing it is that we're all basically time travelers - we know where everything is already, know the fastest paths to everything, etc.
---
The imbalances are what makes it great.  
---
You get some cool shit that I don't get, and I don't get some cool shit that you don't get.  
---
That's the magic. Not every aspect has to be balanced, only the overall experience.
---
Help others get theirs.
---
Depending on the class, they actually probably could lol
---
I hated Ret Pally because I was getting shit for being a meme spec (dwarf too so no sword spec) but now I can't imagine rolling anything else (maybe rogue). The amount of freedom I get in the world is unmatched. And pvp I am like an unstoppable force. I've been ganked by corehound too wielding rogues at 70% hp and stoneform plus bubble and healing means they just can't win. I have done 2100dmg in one multiple times and the engi shit i have make it so fun. Rn it's a big joke but faerlina is a pvp server... Once phase two hits...
---
Why do people get mad when I win two items in a dungeon and act like I was supposed to pass on the second item simply because I won the first roll. Dont hate the player hate the game son.
---
Cast all the doubt you want.
---
I'm going back and getting my herb skill leveled up now because I didn't realize "find herb" was a thing. I was just like, well, fucking herbalism sucks!
---
Wat.
---
Why would I waste my time camping FPs. Who was talking about being a brave hero? You alright?
---
When I first played wow I never understood why everyone jumps all the time.  Then I realized the game is at such a slow pace, its the best way to kill time.
---
Congrats, me and my brother had freezing band drop 1/8000 drop rate. Sold it and ended up with 423ish gold after the auction house cutts. Ofcourse i split the gomd with him.
---
Nope, this was pre-halloween
---
Then go farm your own feathers? I'm a blacksmith and I don't want to pay 10+g per arcane crystal transmute but here we are. I either level an alchemist or pay the going rate.
---
I am not typing that though.
---
We. Don’t. Want. Safety. Nets.
---
*says the NE priest who hides in shadowmeld for the perfect moment*
---
This gets me. People below 60 who want help think they can just demand help and if they dont get it they tell you to fuck off and have a stink ass attitude like *you* asked *them* to inconvenience themselves for help. 
---
Supply and Demand is the name of the game, im sorry you get hate for doing what you want to do, i’d give you 25g just for this low level plebeian’s disrespect.
---
Tellmewhen
---
Then the buyer puts em right back up for 5g a stack and you lost money.
---
Also consider how many people kill rag. On my server (herod) there are at least 20 guilds killing it weekly, with at least 5 pugs that I know of that kill it weekly. 25 kills a week at a 3% drop rate is really not that bad - you'd expect to see an eye every few weeks on the server, and Ingots are all over the place.
---
Good warriors don't want this item (BRE is arguably better, Ashkandi and even Untamed blade are definitely better because Sword spec), so you're left with druids (hilarious for wep swapping and memeing, but not actually good), shamans (BiS for enhance afaik, but also not a great spec), and paladins (similar to warriors wrt value).
---
You make a good point. We shouldn't be talking about these dungeons at all; just the questing.
---
Don't PUG.  Group with guildies.  Problem solved.
---
Also i pretty sure drakky and the beast were boss level
---
Plains running should have been in the game. Even nerfed. Make it 10 seconds instead of 5 and still require gold. The training is so intense he needs gold to work you out!
---
Seriously.... an army of cows running at mount speed. Please....
---
The problem is, people know what their best % upgrade items are and will gun for those - so DKP gets skewed hard.  
---
Loot council is good, but requires ALOT of time and communication - which can be difficult.
---
The system we've adopted (and have been changing week to week to try and make it more fair) is a +1 roll system, which doesn't include trinkets/rings/necks/weapons. This way people won't hold back their rolls for the big ticket items - and are likely to roll on the smaller upgrades along the way.
---
Mp5 gear is for healers, but that ring sucks so who cares.
---
A bunch of people do it. There were two ally mages camping it when I was trying to get the runecloth gloves pattern.
---
I resorted to getting naked on my priest and jumping up there to fear them off, where they'd get killed by guards.
---
No. From 0/6000 Friendly all the way to exalted it’s like 650g max.
---
Other mages will be fire too though
---
That's how my level 40 war looks...wish i woulda kept him at 39 for pvp
---
When I get home I'll have to figure out if getting to the honored status is worth the time it takes vs just spending the extra 10g. 
---
If getting honored saves me 10g but takes a few hours, then it's not worth it b/c I can make that $$ up in less time than that.   I think.
---
I know that... it’s a shame Blizzard doesn’t know that.
---
It was more a backhanded comment directed toward Blizzard than anything else.
---
Thinking that they could or rather that they SHOULD try to control the experience by faking a content release schedule for the sake of authenticity.
---
Fake schedule to be authentic... anyone else see the irony there. Now the Honor system is going to be released and people are going to be running around in epics (and legendaries) killing people. More of that “authentic experience”.
---
Then BGs are finally going to release and people are going to step foot into them for the first time fully clad in Tier 2... authentic experience amirite?
---
I know that it’s foolhardy to have spent over 20 years with Blizzard and expect them to recognize when they’re wrong... but damn...
---
To add insult to injury as far as I can tell (since there has been 100% radio silence on their arbitrary phasing) it would appear that the ONLY reasoning for the phasing is centered around the ilvl of the gear that will be made available in each phase. ITEM LEVEL one of the most hated things added to future expansions, and their basing the entire “authentic experience” off of it.
---
Eat some chicken.
---
Thank you! If i can get someone to do last part for 50-100g It will be quite a bit cheaper than regular mount right?
---
Preach Brother, 
---
I just rerolled my druid as moonkin for meme spec goodness (btw I'm always #1 on meter even after getting trash talked before we start).  I keep a Feral set with me just to tank when they don't want a DPS, don't even tell the people I'm oomkin and still get compliments on how well I tank.  
---
The best part is when we get to the end of the dungeon and I pop moondeerchicken and /dance with the boss to make the jaws drop in my group.  
---
Have a zero shortage of gear for tanking, healing, and moonkin because I play all available roles for my class instead of bitching about how it's not fair that people don't honor my choice to be lazy.  The entitlement is strong on the interwebs.
---
Good money in 3 man farming with herb and miner. Just run a handful of jump runs to make your 50g an hour and you'll get the drop as a bonus.
---
How's shaman leveling and what's a recommended build to go
---
Inspect your realm forum and look for recruitment ads of big guilds that list their raid times! :)
---
Sorry to resurrect but this is what I wanted some clarification on. Thrash blade is quite slow at 2.7 for a tanking weapon, is there anything better to take me from 48-55 when I can try for Mirah's song?
---
Just returning the favor
---
I think he's just memeing dude
---
Its an addon called extended character stats.
---
Sounds like the  Rebel Camp in STV.
---
I guess by that logic the Alliance doesnt have anything in one of the most iconic zones in the game, and one of the best questing ones.
---
Can’t even sell this for 250g on my server. I got 2 loots in a single princess Mara run. Same run both dropped and won both. They literally can’t sell for anything relevant on smolderweb
---
I needed for the spell crit not the MP5
---
When he is using whirlwind and intercept?  Or when his health is plummeting on a standard trash pull?
---
My comment is that the stance you use and when you use a shield matter more than your gear.  A fury tank who is in Berserker stance 100% of the time is not tanking properly.
---
Raiding isn't serious business, at least for MC+Ony.  Especially since we get to start with 16 debuff slots.
---
Holy Pally in mostly Plate is more of a PvP thing, since in dungeons you're much less likely to take damage
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
This is the list I use. I have 8/12 bis items and cba to grind the rest as the dps output difference will be minimal
---
Find a weakauras tutorial for consumables and just adjust for the specific consumable you're needing.  Weakauras is pretty straightforward when it comes to things, it's just "When X happens/changes/doesn't happen, do Y".  After that it's just editing based on X and how you want the visuals to look.
---
Nice!
---
Whether it’s a large guild or a half guild half pug raid getting gear takes quite a bit of time In vanilla. Especially on a class like fury warrior. If you join a larger more established guild you will probably have to join a dkp/loot council type loot system which makes the gearing process even slower but raid times much much lower. The pug/half guild runs gives you a chance to get lucky with rolls and gear so it’s hit or miss as well. It really depends on what you want. I’m in an established guild and out of four MCs and onys I have received 1 piece of loot. Considering how unlucky our guild has been with melee drops I can see it start bothering people. We also clear mc in less than 2 hours and do ony right after so we are done in one day which is very important to my schedule
---
I appreciate the ideas and explanations. I would never think some of those schedules would be viable but I could definitely see weird schedules working here. I'm gonna talk with our management sometime this week.
---
Imagine being this fucking dumb and making the dungeon take longer because you are petty and a shit healer.
---
Like jesus christ you are the cancer in this game.
---
Sulfuras *was* even closer to launch, but those numbers shifted to something like 70:30 horde:alliance before I had enough and transferred to heartseeker.
---
Ive seen the guild name around! I play on Skeram. Not quite max level but I play enough to see people around Org and everywhere. Congrats man!!
---
I switched over at about 55 to SM, then final point in ruin at 60.  You could get Ruin slightly sooner by waiting on your last few points in SM, though. 
---
I ended up taking optional points in CoExhaustion instead of fel conc since I wasn't really doing at solo content past 52, all dungeon grinding for gear.  CoE can still be useful for kiting pve solo, though.  Also only took one point in CoA, it's not worth the debuff slot in any 10+ man raid.  Siphon life, corrpution, CoE, immo, run around for a bit and just keep the CoE and corruption up.  Or you can just fear juggle.  CoE is useful for pvp.
---
On Horde you want to stack as many shaman healers as possible, but my guild still runs 6-7 priests every raid for some reason...
---
I'm a dwarf, just drank noggenfogger to be smol :D
---
Thatd be hilarious. Supposedly there are a lot of guilds on the server who are charging a raid fee. I get whispers all the time, my deal is 25g per run (I don't need anything from the dungeon for heal or shadow) or anything not needed I get, plus the first orb or w/e material is in instance. Sometimes I try my luck with greens+blues and added gold to reach the 25g. Some people say nty, some invite instantly. If they ask why so expensive, I explain how I make 40-50g an hour with mara runs, and dungeon runs will take an hour so I need to recoup half that at least, and if I'm in demand it works for me.
---
I was able to solo all of wc besides the bosses at level 25 on my warlock. Not sure if that helps. You'll only know if you try
---
Edit: I used los and lots of fear so maybe not doable on hunter I dunno
---
This. I played horde in retail and alliance on freeshards. In endgame Blackrock alliance has best travel paths. However when AQ is open, horde is the lucky faction. Naxx is kinda equal.
---
I'm at 40 right now on my lock and I'm thinking about rerolling priest, but this thread has made me think harder about druid
---
It’s a real disappointment that it isn’t Bullshocker honestly.
---
Not a typo I'm just a moron and all the abilities kinda just sound like the same old timey church word
---
Imagine being such a loser that you necro a days old comment and reply to it three times in a row. You’re still wrong and no I’m not interested in discussing this with someone who is such a loser. Get a life.
---
Tail sweep doesnt. 
---
Knock away does (only mt should be hit by this)
---
the UI functions that show your position in X/Y coordinates show as 0 while inside a dungeon.  So there would be no way for the UI to know if you have moved and what your new position is once moved.
---
Relying on world buffs seems like too strong of a caveat imo. Nice when it works out, shitty when a someone fucks up a banish on trash and the raid gets AOE'd in the face and suddenly your buffs are gone. I'm currently trying to see how the top parsing rogues are gearing to see if it's a "hey we really should be trying this" rather than a "hey if you wanna try it, it's certainly viable" but my phone isn't cooperating very much.
---
That said, we're about to only have 1 rogue planning on going daggers, and he has trouble keeping SnD up so I don't feel like he'd make the most of it anyway.
---
Idk maybe a few hours and 500g
---
Hey don't badmouth my new ring :(
---
You could've just picked an alliance server lol. I think Westfall or Faerlina are.
---
How is failing on a laughably easy encounter for weeks until you kill it something to be proud of, but shooting for competitive dps rankings against other high end, or even world class, players not?
---
You need to understand that whether it's live or Classic, people like to see how they stack up vs. other players of their class worldwide.  Achieving top rankings is objectively more merit based than simply being present for a guild's Realm 13th Ragnaros kill.
---
A fury warrior isn't dumping on the rest of the raid to flex on them (seriously, mages? do people not pay attention?), he's doing it to flex on other fury warriors that are pushing rankings as well.
---
FROM HEAVEN AND EARTH WE SERVE
---
I get price history in Auctionator...
---
God this is so in line with 2007 PvP montages. I love it.
---
Uugh, I love feral tanks. It's much rarer for them to be entitled assholes &amp; they rolled bear to tank, as opposed to warriors, who are often forced to.
---
Alright.   I'll be looking for you.
---
Thanks for the tips. I hit 60 with almost 17 days played, but I have all professions and secondary professions maxed out and have a couple completed twinks as well as alts with all crafting professions at 300.
---
Never rolled for that ring as heals. There are far better rings that are just as easy to obtain. As heals, even if it is an upgrade, I will pass on loot that has spell crit or hit in favour of caster dps who clearly needs it more than heals.
---
My husband who plays a mage had a pally healer snatch Star of Mystaria from him. Boy was he mad...Luckily for Rod of the Ogre Magi, even though the healer (different one) wanted it too, the healer passed on it because the rod is just too crucial for dps.
---
So yeah, knowing the amount of competition caster dps faces for good gear, if I know it's a better upgrade for them, as heals I would pass.
---
For the calculation you should assume ur procs dont get eaten up by others. Its not true, but if you eat their procs and they eat yours it will sort of come out in the wash.
---
Cd isn't 30 minutes on classic currently, it's 15.
---
 Any hit past 6% on fury is greatly devalued especially with world buffs. You'd still want both items but if CK are off CD they are the best the game has to offer.
---
Later on with ony neck, lionheart, onslaught, you're looking for 2% hit on any of your pieces. Almost all late game pieces such as chromatic boots, 2.5 shoulders, t12/13 gear etc have hit too.
---
All in all raw AP is your best bet with world buffs, especially past 41%~ crit chance in zerker
---
Aw, i wanna see what he wrote about me
---
What was I referring to then?
---
Not even a little bit. I was dead set on my main class until a few weeks before launch and pulled a switch to Rogue and it has never not felt exactly right.
---
Yeah, I'm in a guild. DPS obviously isn't very high but I have my moments. Although as an enh sham in raids your job isn't usually to just dps but act more as a support class to your melee dps group. Search Idua-Skeram on warcraft logs if you're more interested.
---
For every thing you want it to show you you will have to do some slight setup. Otherwise it shows nothing at all.
---
Well, they likely have the items that pass fly past the equivalency, like \[Star of Mysteria\] vs \[Choker of the Firelord\]. If Mysteria was 2% hit we'd have a different story.
---
He didn't deny that either... Misdirection!
---
I'm on a RP low populated server, so other players are less of a problem. My wondering is more about possibility to farm them and plan on my farm. Thank you for an answer. I would farm those except for the water once coz i'm a frost mage.
---
It’s because healers are idiots. I play a resto Druid, my lock buddy would life tap to full (from empty), which is about 3-4K mana. All I need to do to get him to full is cast one max rank healing touch. Which cost 650 mana..
---
I don’t get how other healers don’t get that me giving up 650 mana is the warlock full bar. We save so much running Instances. If I didn’t heal him when he life tap, I wouldn’t be surprised if we spent another 20 minutes a dungeon
---
Approximately zero paladins are going oom in dungeons. Don't move the goalposts.
---
This totally isn't ideal, and was never my plan, but my guild kept saying "no we have too many tanks go dps" so that's what I did, and all our tanks quit and server hopped. Some server transferred early on with queues, others went to the Latin American servers, others moved to other guilds. So it got pretty stagnant. 
---
But leveling an alt takes time, and I want to help my other guildies gear up now, so I'm doing the sub-optimal tanking in the meantime. And despite what anyone will tell you, a shaman can totally tank end-game stuff. If you plan to use that Deflector, or that naglering, it's totally yours to need. That fury warrior will never wear them anyway.
---
Its not the appropriate time/place for it.  Go to a rally, call your congressman, make a youtube video.  But when you log into WoW, play the game.
---
Grey wolf got 2% more speed
---
How should I know what you were talking about? The original comment was a South Park quote
---
Leveling sucks. I have a lot more fun at max level.
---
I tanked up to 60 and then for a while after 60.  Any problem DPS were told "please discontinue doing xx behavior because it makes it hard for xx reason"
---
If they didn't listen, I just removed them from the group and watched them yell for a minute until their hearth kicked them out.  You are a tank and the success of the group falls on you.  We can always replace a DPS or 4 man a dungeon.  
---
The reason I'm not out there responding to "LF Tank for xx dungeon" anymore is because I've got pretty much all my BiS gear already.  I only tank now under two circumstances.
---
1) Guildies need help 
---
2) Someone is making it worth my time (wtb tank 20g , etc)
---
I used to run dungeons for gold but then my dice started to suck, and it almost became a thing where I would break even after like 3-4 hours of running dungeons because I didn't win anything.  So I started solo farming stuff instead and make much more money.
---
The tanks are still out there.. you just need to either join a guild or entice them.  It's so easy to find a group that a lot of tanks can get their BiS relatively quickly.  Not to mention a group only has 1 tank, so there is rarely competition for the tanking BiS items if they drop.
---
Instinct, thick hide isn't that important as you reach close to armor cap very fast with some items anyways
---
I'm seeing other comments too saying I'm too far from the boss but there's others that were just as far if not farther from Ony, plus I'm definitely in a reachable spot :P just seems I got unlucky
---
Whenever something like that happens, if someone says "all greed", they are an idiot or scammer.
---
"All need" is how you make sure nobody ninjas.
---
&gt;Why use signed 32 bit if you can't have negative gold?
---
Basically, if you think you'll ever need to represent negative gold. 
---
The designers early on probably took the safe route not knowing what future design decisions might use that feature. It's much easier to just work with the current gold cap, which is far more than anyone should be making, than to add a boolean "negative" flag everywhere one is needed.
---
They didn't ruin anything, but there are some mechanics and drop rates that pservers had that aren't in classic
---
Protesting it everywhere you go in a fantasy RPG makes it political.
---
Have you tested this? I'm not sure that's how castsequence works.
---
it may still not sell at 1.75g depending on the demand for the item. For pricing them at 75s, you're pretty much guaranteeing the sale without risking the trouble of reposting them. You will make your money, but the downside is the buyers might repost it at an expensive price which would only add to the problem.
---
Well ill be darned!
---
Well...sometimes like on my server which is very horde heavy...you pass allies all day long /wave and /lick. Normal aborde stuff.
---
You’re in STV leaving everyone alone, a skull Ally warrior is training his new axe and sword skills on the mobs you are tagging.
---
You keep frost trapping him to be silly.
---
You allow all the lower levels to do their thing.
---
Then all of a sudden a 60 Feral Druid comes and ganks you WHILE the 60 ally warrior is just standing there.
---
So when you run back, you’re pissed. So, like me, you murder every ally that you see until you get back to Booty Bay.
---
EDIT: Horde heavy, not Horse Heavy.
---
The worst part is that many people think this unironically.
---
Holy shit man thank you. This is 100% accurate.
---
I play DPS now (Warlock) because I enjoy it but have played both tanks and healers in the past.
---
I honestly think a lot of it is that people know tanks and healers typically get blamed for bad runs and can’t handle criticism.  On top of that a ton of folks don’t want to have any responsibility.  It’s the same thing you see on planes where people don’t want to sit in the Emergency Exit row because in the less than 1% occurrence something happens you might have responsibility.
---
So they are technically, well, were designed originally to legitimately tank if you talented for it?
---
Damn elemental fire is like 90% of the cost of the GFPP on my server
---
As stated, they are optional. The best part about this guide is before you get to the instance it mentions, you have every worthwhile quest for that dungeon.
---
I'm pretty primitive when it comes to modern technology.  But I started streaming on twitch under Matt_Molson.  I am going to try to update my quality and sound and ill advertise it more often.   In the mean time, here is a video about the history of our guild.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Cy6y7fO_g&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I got taren icebreaker.. Can't even sell it above vendor price...
---
Had a destiny drop last week i scholo on the mob our tank dinged 60 on. he won the epic too on a greed roll.
---
I'm only 46, so I can't say what works at 60.  All I know is that I stack spirit.  My regen is around 180/5 from spirit.  So getting max value from spirit tap is important.  Also, I don't have the 0.5 reduction on smite cast time, so pushback for me is much more critical.
---
I'm also on a pvp server, so staying at higher health and not having to use a GHeal every 3 or so fights matters.  It's more tempting to jump a caster when they are at 20% to 50% health than one at 100%.  Even if the 100% is oom, you don't want to engage for very long if you are just looking for targets of opportunity.  Does the rogue ambush the priest at 100% mana or the mage at 20%?  Not a very hard decision.
---
Resto druids are great. Only issue is lack of out of combat res.
---
I just looked it up to make sure I got it right and it’s the second one. 10% to all armor contributions from items and then when you switch to dire bear you multiply by 360% so yeah.
---
Yeah but because you can't it's true RNG.
---
Just a normal human dice throw. Not a robot doing something.
---
I guess they won't if they just passively stand there?
---
Nah man. Trying to get Aurastone mace as a shaman vs. the 2 druids in my guild using DKP have something to say about that lol.
---
Ahh yes. Sums it up perfectly. Thanks for that lol.
---
Coming from Rust as my main go-to game going back to WoW.... just deal with it! You don’t lose any loot. You don’t lose any durability from pvp unless you spirit Rez. You have a hearthstone. 
---
Seriously, stop whining if you don’t want to deal with the possibility of this happening then go to a PvE server. 
---
This is what y’all signed up for!
---
I thought the government subsidized solar panel roofs stop this? 
---
Or was it another government promise. Calis a joke state lol
---
What about rogues stealth-killing in BB? They do that shit all the time
---
I don't really, they are nifty. Most are smart enough to not use fear in a dungeon and they give me sweet health stones, also affliction seems to be a slow burn. Like you're aoeing, and it's good dps, but it's slow enough at start for my threat to win out, while still allowing you to do good dps.
---
I'm a 55 warrior, dispshit. I'm glad at least one ally annoyed you enough to whine about it though.
---
That ring is not a healer ring at all in the least regards. Rosewine+ fordrings are bis for healers. +Healing is 100x better then 1% spell crit. Ops is fine to roll, I've seen that drop 100 times on my priest and pass every time, that thing isn't even a top 10 healer ring (for priest at least)
---
It is, after you accept the Horde quest that sends you to Gnomeregan (Rig Wars) you can pick up another quest to talk to Chief Engineer Scooty in Booty Bay. When you do, he gives you a Goblin Transponder that sends you to Gnomeregan if you step into the teleporter next to him while holding it.
---
hunter will be better at gold farming, druid better at everything else.
---
That's my problem, i have tried to disable every plugin one by one, and coundn't get this frame.
---
Rogues get fucking free tier in every set all to themselves.
---
DPS warriors do not.
---
Non plate sets were created in Vanilla and meant for dps warriors still.
---
Savage Gladiator set is clearly for warriors despite being a mail set.Same for black dragonscale.
---
You are just selfishly applying the retail mentality, where leather=rogue.
---
Blizzard made gear for each class, they just didnt make plate , mail abd leather class exclusive versions. There is 0 evidence that warriors arent meant to wear leather or mail.
---
Stop acting so fucking hard done by. Gearing a rogue is 100% easier than gearing a warrior. You are just lvl 58 and havent raided yet, so you dont see it. You can solo your hoj runs. You dont have to farm sgc. You dont buy lionheart or black dragon. You can stealth to mining nodes only you can get and make tons of easy money. Hell you can pickpocket brd for the easiest 50g an hr youll ever see.
---
Rogues have it easy. Get in a guild, get geared, quit bitching.
---
And good on him if anybody actually buys that. I stick to the market price, which means my stuff sells or people either undercut me or buy it to jack the prices to ridiculous points. So, I'm either getting paid, or fixing the issue of mats costing far too much money. Incredibly annoying seeing stacks of large fangs or hides at 300-500% of what they're worth. Some people just wanna craft some med level bracers.
---
Enhancement shamans are extremely viable late game, and they're in an even better spot as we go into the later phases - who told you otherwise??
---
Well, a lot of people will reserve items they need, instead.
---
But I guess that is awful too?
---
I thank you for your service! The Alliance are so underpopulated that they're either non-existent or in a 40 man raid, just like in Retail. Its a real shame what happened to Skeram.
---
That ring is shit for healers the mp5 is nice, but rosewine with fordrings is better. +healing &gt; % crit
---
Slow is slow. Smooth is smooth. Fast is fast.
---
WTF is wrong with this community?!?!?!, people pitting against other classes like if they were heretics with other religions in a holy war. It's a damn game!!! the difference between you and the hunter is just a random choice a month ago on a virtual toon
---
Ugh i had a run like this last night and i'm still not entirely sure who the damn tank was, the guy with the shield i suppose but the guy with dual crusader enchanted big dick weaps pulled a fuckton more threat, jesus christ healing was a nightmare.
---
And then a lock/hunter that managed to bodypull 3 packs at once on a salty runback
---
Some runs just make you question yourself as a healer/player and that was one of them, jesus
---
I don't disagree with that.
---
You mean monkey (agi/stam). Tiger is agi/str, which does sell decently still, but not as well as monkey in my experience.
---
Wait there’s a server that’s NOT horde skewed? I thought they all were lol I’m on Kurinaxx and it’s stupid heavy on the horde side
---
The other issue is that healers don't have much else to do but dungeon at max level, so even though there are more classes in other specs, us healers are all out there looking for the same dungeon runs while other classes are sometimes farming gold or killing stuff solo in addition to doing those dungeons
---
All this and I'm just curious what in the hell a "numpty" is?
---
You have a 50% chance, it's between that or the Leaf. When a guild says something like that, it just means the next time it drops. There's probably a Hunter in your guild who was told the same thing for the Leaf.
---
Well it’s an obvious alt so take that into consideration
---
Either eye or leaf drop from domo chest every time. 50/50
---
Mostly. But more than anything, I realized how shitty of a tank I was. 
---
I definitely should not have tanked sword and shield. At least for leveling. They’re very slow tanks that can’t hold aggro very well. I was blown away when I saw 2h dps warriors maintain much more aggro than I ever could at those levels. 2h warrior tanks and Druid tanks are my absolute favorite as an aoe mage. 
---
But yeah I wait for aggro to build for tank, and I keep both a dps and threat meter active. Neither of which I would’ve done if I didn’t tank first tbh. 
---
Some tanks are slow shitty and entitled and I’ve talked shit a few times when shitty tanks have blamed their groups.
---
And now as DPS, I see how many assholes and shitty DPS’s I had in the past while I was tanking. It’s really easy to dps correctly without causing stress to the healer and tanks.

I understand firsthand how much more exhausting it is to tank vs dps. It’s like 10 times as much work in the same amount of time. Switching to dps, my hands felt better, and my neck stopped cramping up.
---
There's lots of other reasons, but one big one is it takes actual skill to tank.  When looking for tanks I would spam random people playing a tank class and tons would say "i don't know how to".  You don't ever see a dps say they don't know how to dps a dungeon and rarely ever a healer that can't heal even if they dps to level.
---
Well yes. Resto healing is shit, and shamans have massive mitigation, threat generating spells and totems, and wear mail. But Im sure you rather have that dual wield fury tank in leather armor because he's a warrior and you're blinded by classes rather than role because you dont understand vanilla. 
---
In the old world, shamans were meant to tank as much as prot pallies were. I mean holy shit what do you think earth shock, lightning shield and earthbiter are for? why can they use shields? Whats with the dodge and parry talents?
---
Whats a prot paladin have? Holy shield (lightning shield), consecrete (stoneclaw totem), and increased mitigation talents.
---
What are some classes that will stay viable during all phases raids and will allways be needed in them?
---
For warlocks, it's actually not.  They are pretty close, but skyshroud is still better, and gets even better the more worldbuffs you've got going on.
---
Tailoring unlocks the set bonus but anyone can equip the robes thankfully.
---
I solved this by having a spare dagger in my inventory. I told the macro to replace my off-hand first (slot 17) with the spare dagger, then told it to swap out the sword with my main attack dagger (slot 16) on the next line. For whatever reason with the "placeholder" dagger moved first, it doesn't try to move the main hand only sword to the off-hand in the macro and give the error. Then after the ambush, I have a second macro to put the sword back in main hand and swap the spare dagger with the main dagger for the off-hand.
---
&gt; And you think Swipe and pre-heals will be a magic glue that helps in that situation?
---
Please kindly point to me where did I say something even remotely close to this.
---
Because you're strawmanning.
---
&gt; Let me guess when your bored you go kill lv 30-39 players in STV? 
---
No. I rarely attack someone below 55.
---
&gt;I can for sure understand fighting on the brd Chain
---
I spent most of the time we were around BRM on the chain, while others were up top. All of the other horde were randoms who saw what we were doing and decided to stay around while waiting for whatever dungeon there were about to do.
---
I managed to kill 10+ of some alliance MC raid at the bottom, and I dont know how many died up top. Or been like a few of the smart ones, that came from Steppes and jump into the lava near MC and just lava jump to the zone-in below the window.  Several others dies trying to talk to Lothos Riftwalker instead of just sending it out the window.
---
Maybe they should have just grouped up and wiped all the horde in BRM.
---
Even the few UBRS groups could have killed us all if they had gone in together.
---
Merging them back would be a nice way to enjoy that weapon lol. Grats on it btw, add Bedhead if you ever want to go wreck some ally
---
Good to know. My bad then. In my defense, I only play melee classes :)
---
Prove it! DMB counts the kills you have on each boss
---
We all play the game to have fun, and fun for me is camping you.
---
This is the silliest thing I've read all day.
---
I dont think people truly realize how much better proper pre-bis is than all of us running around in our full dungeon gear set way back when.
---
Some of the Pre-bis items are better than raid epics or are damn close.
---
More dots!
---
I have a 52 warrior with full rested xp. I may have lost interest. I need motivation to keep leveling.
---
I should also add, I have a 27 hunter, 23 druid, 22 paladin, 10 warlock, and a 6 rogue.
---
Does no one else want it?
---
It's completely wasted on a Shaman, and I say that as a Shaman.
---
Couple of reasons:
---
You have the greatest list of prerequisites to effective farming in the game. Food, water, arrows and pet food are all mandatory, and running out of one cripples you. This is in contrast to warlocks, who can replenish soul shards on the fly, or Mages who can make their own food/water/mana potions in the field. It feels like you farm gold just to go right back and spend it on more necessities. And if you understock on something, you'll spend 20 minutes getting to your farm spot, farm for 30 minutes, then have to go back and restock.
---
Then there's pet aggro. In raids I can do a shitload of damage; in solo play I constantly have to hold back in order to not take aggro from my pet. If you didn't have a minimum range as a hunter you could kill things 1-2 times faster than you can now. It sucks to have all that power and not be able to use it.
---
I didn't miss anything.  SM is not that hard to run to for alliace compared to Gnomer for horde.
---
Actually, initially when they changed gold to be a 64 bit number, the hard cap on how much players could carry was manually set to 999,999.99.99. I honestly don't know what the current cap is, but there is still a hard cap that's significantly lower than 64 bit uint.
---
The problem ends up being the gear.
---
There is little to no endgame tanking mail.
---
With Chain lighting  to start pulls and get threat on multiple mobs
---
Earth Shock to generare double threat acting like a psuedo taunt
---
Rock biter generating extra threat every swing 
---
and the appropriate talents they make a really fun tanking experience.
---
Thou you gotta drink quite a bit
---
The crits actually give 20% shadow damage for *all sources* of shadow damage, including your dots. However, the debuff disappears after 4 non-periodic shadow damage hits. So it will last for 4 shadow bolts/etc., but all shadow damage is boosted for the time it's active.
---
it's safe with the intention that guards keep it so
---
again, the evidence that it's INTENDED to be safe is right in front of you. people get BANNED for exploiting and making it so guards DON'T do what they were designed to do
---
Ok. Got mine doing 4man Voone runs with some IRL friends, pretty quick with decent players and skipping everything we did not need to kill. Still did not win his gemstone though, so maybe not done with it yet. Why the Lower hate?
---
Your first comment misleads the reader into believing the proper way to play is to chase BiS items, instead of playing however you want, is that what you meant?
---
&gt;That's a weird price on bars you got there, haha. If I was an alchemist I'd go grind out friendly with furbolgs and do earth to water transmutes for way higher profit than those stupid bars.
---
Yup, super regretful that I am dependent on Arcanite for my transmutes.
---
Its the one thing about the economy that pisses me off...the Arcanite bars are pretty much always the same prices, so the alchemists aren't screwing with things.
---
But the miners seem to think they can post the crystals at 40g (and them some pile on and undercut slightly creating the 35-40g range).  It's the dumbest behavior i've seen...the bars aren't going up in price, so you're definitely not going to be able to sell the crystals at that price.
---
Aparently this is the new meta gold farming method
---
I'm more than likely switching to Engineering tonight, and I've seen people saying that you want to start one of the specialties first, make your items, and then re-start and switch specs. Can someone elaborate on this and why it's beneficial? I'm at work so can't really check Wowhead.
---
No stun resist. You played yourself.
---
I'm at work for the next 5 hours, can you add me so I don't forget.   I need lots of friends.   Especially rich ones.
---
This actually is my first character. And I guess I’m pretty lucky with rolls
---
&gt;Oh love, you don't know me      
---
      
---
Nor do I care to, you're top tier cringe material, now stop stalking me and go "guard" hillsbrad with your irl LARPER guild.
---
YESS!!!
---
but dont be surprised if you don't like the game, and don't force yourself to play it just for his sake. 
---
that idea is a good one and would work.  If you wanted one with less commitment there is also stuff from the blizzard store. You could just buy him his character class t-shirt or something along  the lines from  there. Chances are he'll wear it till it falls apart.
---
Maydie was the reason I made a warrior.
---
See my response below.
---
He said top 5; and it's definitely better than band of rumination. In fact it's probably top 3, only beaten out by fordring's and rosewine.
---
At times because getting a group seems to be a struggle. Been thinking about playing my priest
---
I got the enchant, which is a limited stock item, (and I ended up buying twice because I was just running in and buying it before I realized I had it already).
---
And the other time I needed the Mooncloth recipe which is unlimited.  That guy that's safespotting is not always there.  I was just saying, if he is, and you want to check, you can just bubble in and grab it.
---
This is the double mage strat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNArOz9kgxM
---
Basically did a derivative of this, using the ledge and dots instead of extra CC (though I used succubus a lot for seduce too).
---
I think mage/shammy it might not be possible since you lack the ability to CC two targets, or the ability to keep damage going indirectly (dots while the target is pathing around the ledge).  You can always try it, maybe the extra ele burst and then reset will work just as well?
---
I rolled a purple mage and haven't looked back. Sometimes I wish I were a rogue, but then when I raid and there are 8 rogues, 12 mages, and 7 priests, I'm glad my competition is 3 other warlocks.
---
Not to mention, half of those rogues are dead and getting ressed after every pull because topping the dps charts &gt; fire res
---
No other race can use shadowmeld?
---
This. I've leveled a prot paladin from level 42-60 and refuse to take plate dps outside of guild members or IRL friends for dungeons. It sucks if you just want to dps and get gear as a fury warrior or ret paladin, but tanking is difficult enough without worrying about losing a roll. Most plate dps I've encountered also don't understand that leather/mail is mostly the better gear for them too and insist on rolling for +defense items
---
Eh we got my warrior friend the same stuff, he literally ran BRD for like 2 weeks? Yesterday he got it and *both* HoJ+Savage Gladiator dropped. Hes still only 56 because he's been spending so much time there and hardly plays.
---
The drop rate is still like 8 percent if I'm not mistaken and the boss is 9 percent chance to spawn, that sounds pretty damn rare to me lol.
---
Warriors are always viable. 
---
Ranged DPS will always have a spot as well, but I think especially warlocks for their utility. Not to mention their damage in later phases of the game scales really well.
---
You do realize that people can be farther along on rep when they start compared to other people right...? 
---
I would say the average price I paid was 1.5g per stack - more at the beginning and less at the end. Most people need about 800 stacks. I probably bought around 700 with the other 100 coming from ones I put together farming or doing dungeons. 
---
700 stacks of runecloth x 1.5g = 1050g 
---
This isn't that hard to figure out.
---
Now these are the kind of analytics I like!
---
Right you are on the first account. Nowhere did I however claim rumination to be a top ring by far. Passed on it every time I saw it (well, greed).
---
Fishing
---
My highest level is 46. I have just been doing quests, very few dungeons. I have found monsters I enjoy killing and just go to town. I really enjoyed recently learning the Sprite darter spawns outside of camp. I'm having a blast, excited for getting into alt characters to do a lot of dungeon runs.
---
OMG what is that dot that constantly goes across the screen?  That would drive me crazy!  MAKE IT STOP!
---
That’s kind of the reason I went the other way. Hypothetically Robes won’t be replaced for say 6 months. If I’m going to spend money on it, I’d rather get 6 months of value instead of 4 or whatever. The big value for me personally with the epic mount comes in phase 3 when I need to be able to keep up with the team in BGs so there’s plenty of time.
---
thats very useful! thank you!
---
I rolled a Troll Shaman and regret it. I am level 56. I figured I would go ahead and finish it to 60 before rerolling again. I am having trouble figuring out which class I want to be next. I want a fun pvp/dps class.
---
What do yall suggest and why?
---
we only had BRE drop the first week, so it only went for 210dkp, and mageblade has yet to drop (im the caster with the most dkp, so i will get it then it drops :D) our most expansive item so far was brutallity blade, 420dkp :)
---
lol i love when people brandish their stupidity like a medal or a trophy. In raids everybody needs mp5, sorry, thats the way it gos. Plus, any healer that thinks that 5mp5 ring is their best ring (and meant for only healers) is laughably bad. Please find me the healer that would rather have 1% crit than 20+ bonus healing...no go ahead I'll wait. Spoiler: anybody you find that chooses that ring is a literal monkey.
---
This is a caster ring, good for both dps and healers but absolutely better for dps.
---
I’ll add you when I get home from work as well :P
---
sounds like you have a shitty guild. wtf else are they gonna use ingots? sell on AH for GM’s personal income it seems
---
Is there a way to clear totems? I have heard that there is a macro that will clear your totems. Is this true? If so, is it considered an exploit.
---
That also pops Blood Fury because why not, if you're making it a shitshow for the tank, why not make it a shitshow for the healer too?!
---
Thanks, now I want HOJ. Maybe I'll get that my next run :D
---
That’s the joke, they (Blizzard) are trying to artificially control the experience. The collection of a legendary at 8 weeks in proves that this plan of theirs isn’t working, and as such is going to an adverse effect of the entire experience for everyone else.
---
Personally I’d much rather have all content available now and see how that plays out than this phasing BS.
---
The problem with this is that very, very often, LoSing the caster mob also means LoSing the tank, and tanks very often are not actually spec'd for tanking so we literally cannot afford to LoS them because they will die. As a shaman, I will drop grounding totem and a rank 1 earth shock if I have caster aggro, but it's *almost always* just better to LoS pull caster groups.
---
I meant you, you were being downvoted xD
---
I'm your upvote
---
Are you seriously comparing the menethil to IF death run to getting on a zep and walking a considerably shorter distance across a zone thats lower level than you are?
---
If it was Legion we would be having legendaries less than a week in. :D  
---
"what a joke"
---
Shit you got me here, haven't done mara yet so I wouldn't know. Still such a waste of space
---
You don't have to agree, it really isn't a debate, it's better for a healer, but fill your boots
---
Stand IF dressed up like gnome  for 3 hours a day .
---
Fine. Yall know every bug there ever was in every patch, including hotfixes, of the game and how they work and behave; I'm just lying forever random reason in order to gain whatever God's know what. Sure.
---
Just because you know how the difference between an unsign and sign int, doesn't mean you're a software oracle.
---
What is this Windfury thing you speak of? I hear Shamans talk about it, usually while making sounds that people make while looking at porn.
---
Are you in tater thots?
---
I am alting a Tank and I have to say - its kind of nice to be needed :) It is nice to cherry pick my group. 
---
I chose a paladin with the only reasoning that it will be much easier for me to find a raid as a healer once he's 60 as raid tanks are already available in abundance or the spots are reserved. 
---
About the leveling experience: I have done quests till lvl 20 and ever since I have been dungeon grinding xp (now 29) and I am having a blast. I like to meet people, some I even am building friendships with. 
---
I am telling people that I need a few seconds to gain agro - if the dps respects that or not is his problem. My protection blessing is reserved for the healer, nobody else and my LoH is for myself should heals go oom in a tough spot. Plus - DPS come a dime a dozen - if someone doesn't like it, they are free to leave at any point.
---
I get annoyed when healed after a lifetap. I tell healers unless i go under 60% dont throw more than a hot on me. If i go under 60% usually something went wrong an im now drain tanking mobs.
---
I think it's other way around, but either way very similar between the two chances. The two combined is what makes it rare/annoying to get, but if you see the boss you've got nearly a 10% chance of seeing it drop, which for an epic item is actually pretty good. 
---
It's still a big gratz, that's BiS for... I'm honestly not sure how long, Phase 3 at the least, if not longer.

We are a pretty small guild right that is trying to recruit some more players! Most of us have real life responsibilities during the day, so you'll find a lot of us on in the evenings and weekends. We have a very small core group of guys that we are trying to expand upon. We've had some success pulling some awesome people to play with from Reddit, so I'm hoping to continue that trend!
---
Our main goal right now is to help each other level up, run dungeons, work on professions, etc. We want to get into raiding and more organized PvP eventually, but none of us are in a major rush. If you are looking for some laid back people to play with and enjoy helping other players, then come give us a shot. If you are completely new to WoW, come join us! We have members that are always willing to help!
---
Feel free to send me a message here or on Battlenet at SLUzer#1138. If I'm not online, I may have an officer send you an invite.
---
You just posted this 20 minutes ago, any reason why you keep posting it
---
Why, I never!
---
This roughly tracks with the proportion of tippers when I'm giving out free enchants, etc.   
---
If you tip, or say thanks for stuff, you're a good egg, IMO. Some people don't though.
---
I chuckled
---
Sounds like you’ve spent too much time in dungeons and not enough leveling up. Could be in half of your T1 by now.
---
Guess it depends on what you’re wanting. For me having an epic in phase 2 is a must since I plan on going nuts in wpvp
---
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Tanking is like babysitting 3 children who are actively trying to kill you.
---
It’s ridiculous how much people want tanks to carry the group but refuse to do anything to help them.
---
Make undead players shackleable but immune to sheep and charm?  I’m down for it.
---
I bet you're thinking of stratholme. Those groups are awful for that. And I sympathize with your position. Whole damn instance is just a bunch of garbage.
---
To be fair, Tooth of Gnarr is better than Triune and Animated Chain Necklace is way better for healers anyways
---
Sounds like you have your priorities right. (for PvP anyways)
---
Epic Mount &gt; Lionheart &gt; Stronghold Gauntlets
---
All 3 is the dream though.
---
It's extremely selfish
---
Hah, I'm lucky enough to have some good rogue friends that run a lot of dungeons with me. 
---
PUG rogues, definitely not as positive of an experience.
---
If your Ally go into deeprun tram. They non stop spawn and can have it done in minutes.
---
I guess it depends on what type of healer you are, as I am a Druid. I also am at the point where idc, the only thing that matters to me is people’s health bars to be full. Especially warlocks, I’ll just toss a high rank hot on them before I start drinking. Always does the trick. 
---
I should also point out it has been a long time since I’ve pug healed a dungeon outside my guild
---
Would you prioritize slam or WW for 2h fury?
---
Yep, even if Phase 2 released tomorrow, it will be weeks or even months before you get a rank where its worth buying any pvp gear.
---
People run dungeons to get gear. Once they no longer need gear from a dungeon, they no longer run it. I play DPS, and as I only need 2 dungeons, I only look for 2. Once I get those pieces, I won’t run any dungeons anymore (perhaps some Scholo/Strat later for AD rep). Good tanks reached this point in 2 weeks, and even more casual tanks have mostly reached this point.
---
Wow good for you man. That’s awesome, windfury hand of rag is always a good formula for entertaining pvp content.
---
The Kingdom of Quel’thalas was allied with the Alliance of Lordaeron during the Second War. Sylvanas was killed by Arthas fifteen years later during the Third War. So she doesn’t really have any affiliation to the (modern) Alliance unlike her sister Alleria.
---
How did he run BRD for 2 weeks and not level up?
---
After tanking 40 times I paid a farming lock 15g and got it on the third pass.  Go figure.
---
damn i had the same problem , but in my case it seemed i ran out of sync with the other players and i got ported to her rigth after the second fear ;/
---
And you can find 3 DPS and a healer faster than they can find a tank.
---
Hmm if you only off-cat, then shred won't matter, it'll either die too quick (as you point out) or turn and face you after ravage or pounce into shred (energy tick timer helps w/this).  So from the sounds of it, you don't need it and probably won't need improved shapeshifting either.
---
I have a few warriors in my guild and some of them are prot.  When they're in a dungeon group with me, they literally *can't* do anything but tank, so I let them tank.  If we have a healer, I go cat.  I don't do great dps, but I can sort of keep up with just 30 points in Feral and zero points in any cat related talents (neither imp shred nor blood frenzy), mostly because I put on wolfshead, burn down energy and cheese back up to 80 with a powershift.  I try and keep it to one powershift per mob so i'm not completely out of mana before it all dies.
---
I was specced into BF for a bit.  Super disappointing.  Only applies on generator crits, which means all those fast white crits are getting you exactly nothing.
---
My thought would be: your first plan - 5/5 thick hide - is best.  I don't have Feline Swiftness and don't miss it because very few dungeons are considered outdoors in classic anyway.  IIRC ZG is when we get to it?
---
I have no problem healing them. Only a few tanks had issue with threat and i had to fade and bubble or heal the dps more.
---
Damn, 650 on mograine. I'm jealous.
---
 /thanks everyone is probably just people using
---
/thanks
---
/thankyou
---
/ty
---
but while forgetting to target you first.
---
Join a decent guild. I haven't pugged a single dungeon at 60 because of this. Done MC 4 times, got perditions blade last reset. It is all about being social in classic.
---
Rogue dungeon set is out performing most raid gear
---
If you're getting corpse camped, the camper can literally make the game unplayable for you for as long as they want. For each rez, you have an increasing rez timer than can end up being a couple minutes if you rez repeatedly. If you're a druid or rogue you might have a chance of escaping campers but some classes literally cannot get away from someone who is sitting on your corpse on their mount. Hearthstone takes 10 seconds, which is more than enough time to get spotted by the camper and interrupted. So at a certain point your only option is to log off. I don't understand how someone could get any satisfaction from putting another player in that situation.
---
didn't play retail much at all, was a similar story with groups not being able to kill thaurissan and everyone just bailing before we got to him, quits for a while sounds like the only reasonable choice, can't even quest without being disarmed and reminded I REALLY want the gloves
---
My BoE was Scarlet Chest.
---
No one fucking wants it. I think I LOST gold from listing it so much, everytime undercutting for 1-3g.
---
It was going for 50g (4-5 on AH) when it dropped. A week later and I sold it for 9g outside of the AH to a mage. I told him “good luck trying to flip this piece of garbage”
---
No. They learned a lot about quest hubbing, quest flow, zone design, etc. Sure, some Horde camps are pretty obviously just plopped down into Alliance zones, but not significantly more than the Alliance hubs are plopped down in Horde-centric zones.
---
There's a pretty clearly visible evolution of quest design starting with the human starting zones (the worst) and ending with the forsaken starting zones (the best).
---
Naw DBM doesn't count arena.
---

---
I don't have the macro functionality in front of me, but I'd also include something to reset the cast sequence after gouge duration or gouge cooldown.
---
Congrats now you can finally play the game!
---
Hey man. Starting out, you really don't need to worry too much about gold. The early crafting materials nobody buys, so they are better off being sold to a vendor. I suspect 300 copper bars will yield enough to buy your skills. Keep questing, rewards and random trash drops will likely yield enough cash flow to keep buying skills. Don't worry about having grey gear either, it will be some time before you get anything better (don't buy the white junk from vendors).
---
Playing as a level 51 Feral Druid.
---
How much does it cost to respec at your trainer? I am about to respec to HotW/NS (0/30/21), but if it doesn't work out, I may want to switch back to my current build (14/32/5) until I hit 60.
---
hell yes!
---
Getting HOJ at lvl 54, rolling 100 when Dal rend MH finally dropped.
---
Weapon chains prevent disarm too and yeah the mechanic sucks but if you are prot you can still shield slam and bash.
---
Mount is 72g and riding is 18g when you are honored. I just bought my wolf mount like 2 days ago.
---
Against baddies or in hectic situations try to hearthstone. It's a green cast animation looking like a heal.
---
this is why, as a dps, I go out of my way to make the tank happy.   
---
Would that roll have been an upgrade for me? Maybe but I know that tank really wants it so he can have it. I get a tank on my friends list and he gets upgrades yay everyone
---
Yeah I honestly think it's just because of the BS spread on Reddit. Most hunters I come across are very skilled compared to other classes.
---
That's wrong. You buy pvp gear with gold in classic not with honor
---
I'd also like to know (although I'd only put points in this for the Benediction quest).
---
Thanks for this ice-cold take, Captain Obvious.
---
1 year from now this guy will post he got all his T1 BIS while everyone else is in BWL gear haha
---
Get int gear.
---
You can absolutely do raids as enhancement, and while they may not be the greatest in PvP, they’re certainly viable and fun to play. If you enjoy enhance you should stay enhance for sure
---
That worked fine in Vanilla. That's a bug exclusive to Classic.
---
That's only the case for special groups of roaming mobs that are tied together, such at the group of elites in EPL that's meant to be a difficult group quest, so you cant just kite the named mob away and kill it solo.
---
Guildies forced me to be here I'll complain all I want. 
---
Tbh I really don't understand world PvP it's not fun to me, having a duel with a same level enemy is fun every now and then but some people just keep coming back trying to fight for well over a hour.  Also one shoting lowbies isn't fun to me just a dick move even more so if you wait for them to respawn. cc'ing them or whatever is better imo not wasting so much of other players time while still getting your ends off.
---
[here](https://raidreset.com/) is a simple answer
---
oh man, that's it, I will go farm orbs tomorrow and surely it will drop from random trash xd
---
You won't hit a dry spot until around level 54-55. If you do a lot of grinding during your leveling though you won't really hit any dry spots since you don't only rely on quests for experience.
---
I bugged him about it a bunch and then he started dropping nature resist totems to troll along with some other useless ones. The group broke up not long after.
---
Letting them sit at low health is one of the best things about healing. Yep I kept you alive on that one bit you are own your own for a while.
---
Then they won't eat while I'm drinking. Yep, still on your own.
---
All your tips are garbge. The only way to actually level up faster is through int gear and int buff.
---
What raid gives both these items to one person in one run? Can I join? I already got the helm so I'd be fine with getting the pants and the staff for starters.
---

I love that reverb, but I gotta have more!
---
Go to war with Everlook and kill the vendor. Only -25 rep but now those players have no vendor to camp.
---
Her blink is a known mechanic that the devs used so you couldn't cheese or evade the boss. Its also why wardens spawn during the fight, to make sure you can't outside of the arena.
---
Honestly have never seen or heard of that guild until today.
---
By the release of BGs... and therein lies my point.
---
Your recollection of the experience is 100% correct.
---
Though I will add that most of those vids they had a hodge lodge of epics and blues, but for the most part you are not wrong.
---
The difference though is beginning stages of gearing through MC content, vs fully cleared/geared tier 2 content.
---
Originally BGs rolled out prior to BWL with WSG and AV.
---
In classic we will see BWL as part of phase 2, and won’t see BGs until phase 3.
---
By phasing they aren’t even maintaining a semblance of that original experience, they are creating a vastly different experience, and one that is far worse imo.
---
You’re wrong.
---
I ran BRD for three days and leveled up 5 times lol.
---
If UFC was 5 guys vs 1 would you still call that a competition?
---
People have problems with allowing others to use their free will to agree to contracts they themselves would not agree too. 
---
Look at politics. Look at real life. 
---
How many people would flip the fuck out if they heard that person A agreed to mow Persons B’s lawn for only $5? They would instantly go into an outrage on how Person B is vile and greedy while completely dismissing the fact person A found no issues and happily agreed to the terms Person B set. 
---
Its the same mindset. 
---
These simple minded people literally cannot fathom the idea that people have differences.
---
Its why you see **I don’t understand who would join this group** or **I don’t get why anyone would run that if they wont get anything** 
---
They self admit to their ignorance.

Hey everyone! We're a casual raiding guild looking to fill out our main raid roster. We raid on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7:30pm server to 11pm-12am server. We're currently running joint-raids with other small guilds to get our core members geared up and ready to farm MC on a weekly basis.
---
We're currently recruiting any and all level 60s who want to step into the Molten Core, whether it's your first time or 100th time! We're also accepting anyone still leveling in the 50+ range :)
---
Our guild atmosphere is laid-back and dedicated to helping members with activities such as attuning to raids and pre-bis gearing!
---
If you're interested in joining you can reach out to me via:
---
* Reddit pm
---
* Discord at Dotx#3315,
---
* In game @ Tankanoid
---
Prob guild by guild basis. My guild has a bad relationship with another guild leader, and we've both blacklisted each other. Doesn't mean shit to anyone not in either of our guilds though.
---
what happened to /r/AzerothNoob? It's private now.
---
oh man, I farmed that one for a while too
---
He must be a Heartstone subreddit user, its a common thing to do this there
---
That's what I did a few times while farming my Trinket off Jed. Instead of telling people it was reserved I just made my own runs and didn't invite another caster. Also I wouldn't invite healers unless they said they didn't need it or were willing to take a 50g bribe to not roll.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cpknJ2g.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cpknJ2g.jpg) Most I have is DBM I don't think it's not believable with the amount of time I play per day lol

---
Enslave Demon also makes it much easier for warlocks.
---
aaand they dropped right? :D
---
Yes, spam moonfire!
---
Expensive and time consuming, which would really eat into their profit margins, which is why they aren't even trying it. Also, I believe the fires and power outages are fairly expensive as well, just not for the power company unless they get sued.
---
RNG is RNG and this is one of many threads about it
---
Thanks dude!   I really appreciate the kind words, add me in game and we can go pick flowers or explore moonglade together.
---
Lmao what the fuck kinda question is that? Maiev is my favourite character in Warcraft 3. It's quite easy to remember names of people you've seen on the same server.
---
I’ve been playing since beta and he is correct. Once BGs existed “twink” has away been a character locked to a certain tier.
---
I see that you're alliance.
---
Maybe on horde side it's different, because orc is both the best PvP and PvE warrior race, therefore you hardly see any other race going warrior DPS (I'm tauren though as I love their style).
---
As an orc you dont really need edgemasters decreasing its value.
---
However on alliance side the best warrior PvP races are gnome and dwarf, whereas human is best PvE, therefore more people actually do need edgemasters to do well in PvE.
---
I'm on Venoxis though, maybe its different on both sides.
---
Yea, I am Ele / resto hybrid and I end up dpsing dungeons much more than healing.
---
350 on Westfall Alliance side. Might be more on horse side. Problem is 50% of the server is human, and a larger percentage, like 65+%, of melee are human, so they don't need edgemasters.
---
Coming from eve online myself and i find the amount of whining about pvp deaths baffling.   You don't even lose your stuff!
---
Fun aka its easy to steamroll with numerical advantage, because you're bad at the game so thats how you need to pvp.
---
Truth hurts :(
---
That's what I'm saying. Am I missing something here??? and since when running BRD for 2 weeks is 'hardly plays'????
---
I'm saying it's not the only zone available.
---
Undercut the shit outta them. Some guy did that on Pagle with Black Diaminds. Should go for just a few copper so he bought them all up and reposted for 5g. Little did he know our guild member had over 200 stored and posted them all for 50s each.
---
Glitch in the WoWMatrix
---
I mean, that's nice and all, but you rolled a cow.
---
From an efficiency viewpoint (if you want to hit 60 as quick as possible) it’s actually better to keep questing until you have the funds naturally. If handled properly it shouldn’t be too much after 40 (42-45 range) until you have it and Cheetah talented is literally faster than mount for the first ~23 seconds of uninterrupted travel. The entire point is to constantly being doing something since Hunter is naturally great at grinding en route to quests.
---
I’d say stopping quests to grind is a lot more valuable on Warrior/Rogue/Priest or builds without natural mobility and Mage as well since they grind more naturally and it helps for AoE pulls.
---
What rogues are you playing with that they aren't pickpocketing the whole group before doing any damage?
---
&gt;This is also why most tanks I know charge a fee to tank for unknown people.
---
Well that and the fact that tanks can't farm very well, they probably don't need the gear and they know they are in high demand.
---
Well I agree with the bit about the game being full of selfish short-sighted people, and I'll leave it at that.
---
You are actually right i checked the Logs agian and i missed 1 Attack in a Boss fight. Didnt see that
---
I was surprised how many people came back for vanilla. Feels like most of my classic guild.
---
I've been pretty lucky and a group of us never fully stopped playing together. Different MMOs, MOBAs, FPS etc but the same small group. When Classic launched it made it easy to build a good foundation for the guild for everyone to come back to. Most of us have met IRL, trips to vegas, blizzcon, crashing on their couch, and I even went to a wedding.
---
The only problem, is none of us really want to lead and recruiting is a pain. There have been a couple group pickups that have worked out but still holes in our roster. Plus we're all in our 30s, any sign of drama or bullshit and we immediately talk about booting instead of talking to the source.
---
It's how you keep members. If members see the guild assist one leadership looks good. Guilds who assist others in the guild seem to be closer and tight knit. They shouldn't be out there farming the entire piece for him, but ingots should get pushed to him, at a cost.
---
But on orc HS is offensive spell animation and not heal animation, could work on Tauren
---
The tank should always pull. Keep slice and dice up during multiple enemies being killed. Eviscerate when target is low or if slice and dice doesn’t need a refresh. Put your talents in combat and you should be good. Sword talent would be the best way to level out of the weapon specializations. Garrote is bread and butter opener. Kick, kidney shot, and gouge healers even if your DPS suffers a bit. Killing healer mobs helps moves the dungeon forward and faster. Those are some basic tips I can give for starting out.
---
the optimal time to stand up.
---
and optimally the tank also pulls at such a time so that you tick 100% mana just before you finish the cast of that first heal!
---
So  I should be wearing Robe of Winter Night over Felheart Robe?
---
Many Months. XD 4 Weeks is 1 Month :)
---
I was using wrong numbers from a wowhead comment. My baddddd.
---
Lol 
---
I’m not bitter 
---
I just don’t see the point in ganking lowbies 
---
There is no honor in it, 
---
Do you really have to show how great you are by killing ants, it only shows how pathetic you are.  
---
Normally if the server ratio had been 40-60 or better you could have provoked a counter attack. Now it’s just stomping down the few alliance players still on the server.  Thus elevating the problem.
---
The 2.0 patch was when you could purchase the gear with honor.
---
Not just long,
---
F U R B L O N G
---
I mean, they didn't say tail sweep... They said knock back, and asked about a way to avoid losing threat, implying they were the tank.
---
I think it's also fed into by the cult of BIS.  No one wants to run BRD 150 times or whatever it is that people are averaging to get HoJ.  DPS chasing BIS are doing instances absurd numbers of times.  It makes sense that tanks bow out after they've done the instance a few dozen times.
---
As a warrior I accepted the fact that I wouldn't get my money at 40 and just saved and didn't buy any skills that I knew weren't really worth it and had my money by like 43, I had way more fun playing until I got my mount instead of saving for it, but it's really your preference
---
Basically: Attend raids, kill bosses and receive points for killing said bosses. Spend said points on gear upgrades.
---
Guilds keep track of point distribution using addons or sometimes external tools such as DKP websites.
---
Go pve, bgs still exist and you can always opt in to wpvp
---
&gt;guildies forced me...
---
No, you succumbed to peer pressure lol
---
I do agree that it's not challenging at all. I just keep most of my mana incase a healer dies. Judgement of Light keeps most melees up and everyone's too eager to get heals out as soon as possible.
---
If I know horde, you'll want to head to STV and kill level 30-40 Alliance
---
I mean lets be honest, the real reason it happens is because whiners come and make reddit posts/threads lmao.
---
What are all those soulstone macros?
---
Tell me about it... 16 Darkmaster Gandling kills and no Bonecreeper Stylus
---
60/40 is not balanced at all. I mean obviously it could be worse but that’s still a 20% swing in population between factions.
---
You don't seem to understand that its selfish to expect a tank who needs nothing from a dungeon to come do it for a chance to roll on some ore.
---
Ah, yeah that happens :P
---
Does he play with you?
---
Where would you guys mob-grind between 49-50?
---
I was thinking the Ogres far south in Tanaris
---
On Benediction, I've seen several on the AH (mostly by the same delusional moron), but I think most of them didn't leave the AH until they were somewhere in the 1k-1.2k price range. 
---
I regularly see people offering to buy them in Trade Chat for 800g, but since that's their starting offer I'd try and milk them for at least 900g if you're going to sell in Trade Chat. 
---
Please note though, that this is highly dependent on your server. It's pretty hard to guesstimate an accurate price for this type of item without knowing anything about the server economy.
---
Wow, I apparently touched a nerve. Pointed out that the number of not-so-flattering-posts was pretty high, hoping for a "be the change you wish to see" kind of think - just saying that he was stupid for coming with such claims and insults would perhaps have sufficed. But I forgot this is thread where we should act like kings.
---
While on a topic you touched on, are you seriously paying mages every time you get water?
---
Haha, I didn't take it as such, just had the word on the tip of my tongue but it wouldn't come out!
---
What's your account login and password, I'll add you to the "Do not hack" list.
---
He was running it since like 52. I never said he didnt level up merely that purely doing arena/anger runs has stifled his leveling progress.
---
This plus hypnotic blade from SM is a really good combo even until raid gear.  There are a few upgrades, but they're not that huge.  The only big upgrade would be farming the Drakestone, but that's possibly dozens or hundreds of hours of farming.
---
This is very true, they honestly don’t really care about this right now. Was killed by the same safespotter in Gadgetzan two days in a row. When I opened a ticket about it I was told to use the in-game report system and not to open a ticket. Still run into this guy in Gadget to this day safespotting and killing lowbies. Blizzard just doesn’t care.
---
Yess I would love to see that ultra low graphic vid
---
Haven't done the numbers, but I imagine some combination of blood rage / battle shout / demo shout exceeds the threat of the first tick or two of the hot.
---
They're safe but if you want to be careful always download from a trusted site, or use the twitch app
---
Make some food, play an alt, if you’re in your 10th release with no escape in sight then you’re just providing free entertainment for them.
---
Cant wait for WoD so i can finally play the game
---
You can hold off AOE'ing until Skull is dead.  Or wait until the tank has WW'd at least once.  Or figure out the tank's rhythm to where you stop pulling aggro like this.  
---
Once or twice is fine.  If you keep doing it, you're not playing well IMO.
---
Again someone that doesn’t get it :) I’m not talking about the situation shown on the screenshot “dumbass”.
---
As troll with +5bow u only need 6% crit I believe. For orcs it's 9% I know. When I had 299 bowskill in mc I got 0% criticals with my aimed on all bosses. Might have been bad luck, idk. Anyway was back to about 16% as usual after I got 300 bowskill
---
Orc with 9% hit. 0 miss counted on details!
---
Because they love the beef
---
Been reading the OP’s responses. He seems really insecure and can’t take anything light heartedly in this thread. The one HE started.
---
Cool! Think I might have to respect afain
---
How often do you DPS dungeons you don’t need loot from? Just wondering lol
---
Just to take it off for Nightfall in BWL. Grats man!
---
Reserving is just the more polite way. Back in the day if you were target farming, you just didn't invite anyone that could use it. Reserving items just works better now. Your statement about "T0 class sets" is idiodic. Yes certain sets are semi tailored for certain classes, but the vast majority of them are terrible pieces. It would take a dumb Hunter to use beaststalker instead of shadow craft for example. If it is not class restricted, then all the classes should be free to roll. I feel like your arguments conflict.
---

---
Or just do what everyone else does.  Deal with the momentary disarm.  It's not that big of a deal.
---
&gt;Its literally coded in the game that we can wear leather. The intention is clear.
---
it's so clear we literally played classic for years and basically no-one did it because warriors had their own armour sets that everyone was happy for them to use and not dip into other classes gear for.
---
Have fun at 60 when you're rolling against 9 other mages and the warlock gets free gear.
---
Volatile Robes &gt; Robe of the Void &gt; Felheart Robes &gt; Robe of Winter Night 
---
Is what I go w/
---
&gt;Blizzard made gear for each class, they just didnt make plate , mail abd leather class exclusive versions. There is 0 evidence that warriors arent meant to wear leather or mail.
---
there is, why would they make armor that that class can wear and then think "oh yeah let's then make them dip into other classes gear too!". 
---
&gt; You are just lvl 58 and havent raided yet, so you dont see it.
---
reading comprehension is seriously a problem for you. 
---
&gt;You can stealth to mining nodes only you can get and make tons of easy money. Hell you can pickpocket brd for the easiest 50g an hr youll ever see.
---
how has this got anything to do with it? you can sell runs for a lot more than that. that's also irrelevant. 
---
&gt;Rogues have it easy. Get in a guild, get geared, quit bitching.
---
again, irrelevant, not that it's any harder for warriors in this position.

Addons can only do what Blizzard allows them to do. They're safe as long as you're getting them through reasonable websites and not some random dude on the street corner.
---
I seriously don't understand this.  Am I the only feral playing with competent DPS that doesn't have threat problems?  My guild's parses are ranked very well and I tank their dungeons on a nightly basis.  I'm basically running full survival with the exception of Devilsaur.  Hell, even when I solo tank Ony it's in full surv gear with only MCP for threat.  The only times I'm tanking in threat gear are for adds in MC so my DPS isn't dogshit when my add is dead.
---
I just see so many ferals using shit items purely for threat and I can't understand why, it was never like this on pservers.  Are they having TPS issues or something?  Like what's the deal here?
---
I posted as video but i think the quality is compromised so i took it down and posted as a link. Is there a problem with this let me know it is.
---
Yeah, there's sort of the aborted beginnings of a tank spec there, and some dedicated people make it work all the way up until raids. The real issue is mana - shamans can generate a *ton* of threat if they want to, but the more they generate, the more it costs. And in tanking gear, that mana pool is gonna be fairly small. So a shaman tank will likely end up drinking after every/every other pull.
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
I didn't have any problem with caster DPS rolling against me on this as a Paladin when I was looking for one because people should be rolling on upgrades, but I do want to note that there are a lot of comments in this thread that mischaracterize the value of the ring to Paladins specifically. Illumination makes spell crit very good, and many BIS lists do include it over Rosewine as preraid BIS, though which is actually better is pretty determinant on the encounter.
---
I've posted this elsewhere but here you go:
---
305 gives 3% hit, each point after that gives .1% hit. Glancing blow damage is 65% at 300, 85% at 305, 95% at 308+. All of this assumes a skull level target, as the value of weapon skill is much lower against regular enemies.
---
Basically, weapon skill is amazing up to 305 or even 308, but isn't useful past that point.
---
Every lock I talk to has this problem on Golemagg, I am almost sure he has some xtra magic resistances. Its that kinda thing where after the fight all 3-4 warlocks are all complaining at the same time, saying how much shit they missed.
---
I remember it being pretty negligible.
---
The gold is an afterthought compared to the honor requirement.
---
Yep, we quest and dungeon run together. I store/post our games together on my YouTube channel: [YouTube Bullgrit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyYrLoHmxuMQMO0ZZDYSWBw/videos)
---
Addons are essentially a core part of the game. Download popular addons from curseforge and there's no risk.
---
Rolled a paladin. 
---
Not entirely, the only thing I do regret is how many people want to force roles, I have no ambition of main'ing a healer, so I chose to level as a tank and had a ball. Quick groups, great aoe threat, never had any issues.
---
Now that I'm 60 though, I could still dungeon tank but I immediately found it harder since everyone is at different levels of gear; some with BiS, some still working on it, some with multiple pieces of T1. Because of that I've found threat gen to be a bit tougher, and with no possibilities to raid tank (for my guild) I chose to roll with Ret/dps.
---
I'm still having fun with my paladin, but I can see that I don't top dmg meters, and I'm fine with that, I'd rather be able to pull off and cleanse/offheal/repent or stun and have a bunch of utility that other classes just don't have on their own.
---
I just can't wait for PVP and battlegrounds now, definitely gonna roll prot again for that.
---
There are no trees in LA.
---
One change will be two changes eventually.
---
Lol dps complains ? God when I tank stuff I just boot any dps who is a dick and watch as they try to find a group for an hour. I love that power. I tank the way I want. At any given moment there are dozens of dps who will replace that dick in your group
---
All else being equal, if your healer has to do their first heal when they're at 80% mana, that means they're 20% lower at the end of the fight, so have to drink for longer at the next pull. Perhaps you don't save any time.
---
On the other hand if they're at 100% at any point during the fight, they're not getting the mana regen which means too much time was spent drinking.
---
It would be a fun addon that monitored healer mana and recorded how much of the instance they were capped out at 100%.
---
You mean the shoulders with a can opener on them?
---
I was feral Druid tanking but after hearing “why aren’t you a warrior tank” everyday. I only tank for the guild  and friends now, plays classic for the community but doesn’t get involved from how toxic the community can be
---
Big brain time
---
I bought mine for 225 about a month after launch. I think they are still around 150 on my server (smolderweb)
---
The shadowcraft 6 piece bonus is deceptively good. I don't know if his claims about it out performing raid gear are true, but that bonus definitely makes shadowcraft competitive with other prebis.
---
I consider my self pretty nice, Not sure what gave you that idea.
---
Can you copy and paste the profile from classic? the set up looks so clean and i really want to use this Interface
---
That's around what I was thinking...I posted a high balling price to start but not really expecting it to sell at that. Thanks.
---
good info. thanks bud
---
I accomplished the same minus the HoJ  :(  got my glad at 58.
---
Just takes persistence.
---
Now get your lionheart!
---
nah bro no changes bro i fuck dogs bro fuck
---
Yes, technically, anything with more than 7 int is better than Triune for a mage. That doesn't change the fact that he doesn't even want to use that amulet once he realizes DM is out. While Animated Chain Neck is better (I agree here), I'm 12 runs in on StratUD and have yet to see that piece of shit drop. Would have been nice to get something with actual useful stats other than my own Triune - and mp5 is pretty much the top valued stat for my class (rShaman) which makes it one of the top 2 pre-raid bis necks for me, whereas it's pretty far from optimal for a mage. 
---
Hoping that mage has to run a minimum of 12 runs for his BiS / 2nd-to-BiS neck.
---
If I saw you with that on, I would legit run.  Just run.
---
"Let me get 2 whole marijuanas and weakauras 2."
---
Sounds like my opener every pull lol
---
You have very clearly not ever played a healer. Stop trying to make this point.
---
If you're on Grobbulus, you've got it!
---
Typically speaking "blacklist" is an informal term, not a specific list that's shared between guilds.
---
What do you mean? That's one of my favorite aspects of vanilla.
---
I don’t really go out of my way to farm it but when I see a Jed run in lfg I’ll join and try it. I’ve gotten all my other bis buy doing this. Only need 3 pierces and I’m done farming  with pre bis mc
---
Hey hey hey... i understand your frustration, but you gotta understand, you got the meats my dude! Also, Tauren have the longest reach out of all the races, you can melee a dude from a clear distance, so it's not allllllllllllll bad.
---
Same with no dungeons
---
For me (Horde), its around 30. Not strong enough to go to shimmering flats or stv nesi camp, TN fully and hillsbrad is mostly complete. After 32, it gets better though, stv, desolace, and scarlet monastery is doable even if you dont wanna do hours in a shitty dungeon like razorfen kraul/downs
---
So who won the roll? Was it the Hunter or the Shaman?
---
What are you talking about?? Wow is a social game at heart why wouldn't I play with my friends?
---
So i guess all your rogues and huntards had cht already? D:
---
Yeah 200-400 gold is “not worth anything” lul
---
He should charge imo
---
Getting ridiculous. I’ve found two more people doing the same shit in this area since I posted this. Also, I reported my guy in the video like 4 hours ago, and he’s still going strong.
---
If im in a PUG for a raid or out and about and need it, if they ask for some payment im not gonna say “Fuck you, you should give it free because you make it for free.” Im gonna give them it if its not stupid. 
---
If a mage asked you for 50s for a few stacks of each, are you gonna tell them fuck off and get outraged at them?
---
I got one off a satyr in Felwood earlier today.
---
Thank you for your reflection and comment reevaluation &lt;3 we all do this, but not many will fix it
---
I've had people sit in UC afk, then ask for a summon when they get back.
---
they goto paladins, whats the problem there?  
---
its going to the gm, the person putting more into that shit than anyone else, whats the problem there?  
---
the last part is pretty stupid though
---
brings a tear of joy to my eye
---
That's um... Unique...
---
Thank you
---
Think about pvp too
---
People sold tanking services in vanilla, this isn't much different. Supply and Demand.
---
Love that strategy.
---
I've been struggling with anything other than transmutes because the recipes for things are stupid expensive.  (e.g. Elixir of Sages = 150g, GFPP = 250g)
---
I'm working on farming the ones i can (e.g. sages), but some recipes are hard to farm efficiently and I'm struggling to justify the price on the AH.
---
How'd you go about getting the right recipes?
---
There is no way to cancel active totems in classic other than replacing them with a different/new totem, in TBC Shaman got an ability to do that and regain some mana.
---
really no reason to wait for 100% before pulling. I mean I healed some runs yesterday as an enh sham and as long as I was already drinking already and over like 60% pull away ill get the heals off.
---
I switched at lvl 50 to do BRD runs as holy priest but I'm doing a lot less questing now.
---
Yeah and watching an addon which organizes the lfg spam into hoverable table results. Typically don't msg randomly though - I'll try it out.
---
Is anybody also playing Modern Warfare and have noticed this weird graphical glitch when you boot into either game, the opposite game's loading screen plays for 5+ seconds?
---

---
The approach platforms should also register as outdoors...
---
Mcafe pisses me off by how much I enjoy it.
---
TL;DR  
---
Also no.
---
I don't get that emotional. But I usually don't trade mages who ask for gold upfront for water - but those who don't ask for it always get a tip, unless they're in my group or raid.
---
Take a chill pill my man.
---
Yea I was so close to pulling the trigger but I think I will hold off for now.  I might alternatively get a Mass of McGowan for 25g until I can get a better wep at 60.  I'm a combat rogue but not sword specialization, running riposte at the moment cause I like to level by grinding mobs and its real good
---
&gt; and it grows exponentially from there.
---
5, 10, 15, 20, 25 is not "exponentially" ... it's arithmetic progression "+5". Also there's cap of 50 gold, so it doesn't even grow that much.
---
All I know is it had me laughing
---
As long as everyone agrees at the beginning it's a moot point. 
---
If the healer would rather share than wait for another tank, great. 
---
If the healer would rather not compete then the latter of the bear and the healer can find another group. Also fine.
---
If there's no agreement then I 100% agree with you. Only roll need for the role you're currently performing.
---
*Complains that people complain about entitled tanks with a superiority complex.*
---
*Makes a rant filled with entitlement and sense of superiority.*
---
You're not helping.
---
&gt;"Its objectively harder for warriors. We don't get a tier set. We have to spend 2500+ gold on our prebis. We have to tank every run and guide the group thru the dungeon.
---
&gt;You can definitely not sell runs for more than a rogue can make afk mining or pick pocketing. And selling runs is work, you cant even do it without a healer buddy."
---
also you:
---
&gt;"Get in a guild, get geared, quit bitching."
---
and yeah, surprise surprise, the guy who throws around "entitled" non stop is the guy who is super entitled. get a grip, not wasting any more time on this obvious bullshit.
---
Dungeons Dungeons Dungeons.
---
Honestly its the best with Cath-&gt;ZF-&gt;ST-&gt; then right into brd.
---
I've had too many of these while leveling and I'm still trying to block out those memories. At least I haven't had one since hitting 60
---
24 ap bro.  
---
twenty-four  
---
thats like a million
---
To much work
---
But rogues also laugh at me as they back stab me from 50 feet away :(. I’m a Resto Druid so I often don’t get to use my superior reach :(
---
The reason I stated I find healbot horrible is because of the UI.
---
The reason I find it worse than Clique is because it tries to do much more than what you need it to do. Click. To. Cast.
---
DPS deviating that much is probably consumables. Greater arcane elixir and Elixir of shadow power are raw +damage, while using mana pots and demonic/dark runes on cooldown saves you from using life tap GCDs.
---
If anything warriors should have priority, because rogues get 5-8 hit from talents, imo.
---
If the rogue doesn't have a comfortable lead on the e-peen meter, they will start getting their own targets so they have more time to build and spend combo points.
---
Better for the rogue's ego, worse for the goup. (don't worry they will explain how it's better to the group if you just let them solo it.)
---
Yeah dude, I really don't understand people going so nutty for BiS when it's gonna get replaced after a few weeks of running MC.
---
That's not to say you shouldn't try to upgrade your gear as much as possible before or outside of raids, but the obsession with BiS gear that's perhaps only a tick better than something else is just insane to me.
---
Now I do understand that for some people, the "chase" is the whole point - they enjoy it.  And if so, right on.  But it seems like some people do it because they think it's a necessary thing.
---
nice to do as a druid too because you have your own o shit buttons for heals. When i did a few low level dungon runs on mine I had to save myself a few times -- always nice
---
Id also like appearance changes, but I think guild vaults and that wouldn't be too terrible
---
Historically horde has been winning pvp. This makes pvp-oriented people roll horde, which in turns make pvp favor horde. Cycle goes on
---
Isn't it bad to cast HOTs before the pull?  Doesn't that just cause more threat to the healer?
---
What addon do you use to know what it'll be disenchanted into ?
---
Yeah, I'm not doing anything special either.  I use Auctionator, have a bank alt, but I'm not really farming...just running dungeons and selling the things I don't need.  I do have alchemy for the transmute, but nothing super rare or difficult.
---
And I'm out.
---
Troll is really underrated. Having a 20% MS debuff in premade PVP that causes the enemy healers to dispell constantly is very nice. Shadowguard too.
---
So the point of post was that you had to get more reputation via runecloth? Stop posting useless, misleading stupid shit then
---
For emp runs, sure, but the first half of the instance is all level 48-52 mobs.
---
Main draw of playing classic is that you already *know* the type of game it is. Doing some classic+ is definitely not appealing in any shape, way, or form as the team the developed vanilla/TBC is not the same team that is currently working on retail.  
---
I do not look forward to needing to run stratholme+ to get some gear titanforged correctly. Leave it as it is.
---
No changes is a joke and a meme that was shown to be horseshit the moment it came out that private servers *changed* things to keep the illusion of difficulty. 
---
That said the frothing masses here will about you down for daring to suggest a good idea.
---
If you haven't already, take a look at the slash four add-on. It's pretty good for cataloguing and filtering LFG. I definitely found peak time LFG basically unusable otherwise.
---
In his post he says the he did not use FD spec \^..\^
---
You 100% can switch offhands in combat.
---
it's only 84c a stack deposit so there is virtually no penalty for posting them.
---
Why you want to switch? Finding dungeons as tank is way easier.  
---
And you don't need to keep much gear to play as bear or cat.
---
Also HotW build is much weaker in solo leveling, as specific cat/bear one.
---
grid2 is wonderful but if you don't want to have to deal with setting up two hundred addons, just download ElvUI for classic and everything is done (minor some little tweaks to your liking)
---
Uldaman is a nightmare.  Get your quests done and get out of there and start doing ZF.  It's so much better.
---
Crack open a Canadian beer, molson.
---
Its actually part of the rotation
---
Nice I might try for HoJ one day lol.
---
 Right now I'm going after another Tarnished Elven Ring from DM Tribute, Hit% bow from DM E, and bracers from DM West. Got Cape of the Black Baron finally last night after 25+ runs. Farming Baron is so much worse than Arena/Angerforge runs
---
They are emotes. I chose a "bland" icon for the button so I could easily see the macro name.
---
Why would anyone put themselves through the hell of trying to organize a guild large enough to field a raid team if they don't get a benefit like this?
---
Sulfuras isn't that good anyway, let your GM have their vanity item.
---
Warrior tanks rolling for their fury/DPS set is completely normal. They should consider themselves lucky you didn't reserve the ring from the getgo. Tell that mage he can find his own tank if he has a problem with it.
---
Titan forging is from Legion and BFA. Basically whenever a piece of gear drops it has a chance of “titan forging” which increases its item level. The item itself has basically a range of values for its stats and the higher the item level, the more scaled up the stats are. Basically you can get your best piece of gear, but unless it titanforges it will have worse stats. Meaning you not only need to grind to get the piece of gear, but you also have to probably grind it out many times to try to get a titanforged version with the maximum stats.
---
I love that this post is separated by one from the guy that just got his Savage Gladiator after allegedly running it 600 times.  RNG is a fickle bitch.
---
Seconded.
---
Even the highly lamented Paladin is indispensable in a 40 man raid as a buff machine.
---
I drank melded in BGs so often it’s actually a really amazing ability
---
Don't listen to him. Any decent guild won't want them. They might have one token enhancement shaman, ours barely does more dps than the tank...
---
Overused shit song for a warlock pvp video where your interface is so shit no one even knows whats going on. If you’re going to make a warlock pvp video. Play destruction and go for high crits
---
I’m not talking aoe at the start. I was just bitching about mages doing this in a comment further down.   I’m talking about pulling the skull after you have moved to grab the rest of the pack due to some lucky white crits while I’m waiting to go ham.
---
&gt; I'm a warrior, my AoE threat is shite.
---
Battleshout. Spam it.
---
Did you not read the thread?
---
If it's an upgrade for your spec, roll need. Just because something "isn't BiS", doesn't mean you should pass as it's possible that you will *never* see that BiS item. This is especially applicable when PuGing.
---
This is a really alien concept to so many players and I do not understand why. Just understand that if you raid in a consistent team, snatching at every little upgrade will likely see you at the back of the line when one of the powerhouse items drop.
---
As far as "etiquette" goes, level plays absolutely no part in it.
---
phase 7 would be classic+
---
Healer threat talents lol
---
Does anyone have an idea roughly how much it would cost to go 0-200 Engineering?  
---
I've 300 skinning / LW but think I wanna try this, just dunno how much it's gonna cost me (plus engi has a lot of good perks besides this).  
---
Also, recommend dropping skinning or LW? I've already crafted my devilsaur set, and am not in a guild for any high end LW patterns...
---
Hardcoded code that interact with other code can still cause bugs. All the signed 32 int means is that my bug wasn't caused by the most obvious thing.
---
Or maybe you're just so smart and intuitive that you don't even need a debugger.
---
This is completely wrong. 8.6% was the pserver hitcap.
---
The hitcap is 9%.
---
I have herbalism and have tried this, but the lashers don't drop enough for it to be worth it (I hear they dropped way more on pservers). I feel like all the money I get is from herbalism, and that definitely gives less money that farming princess would once I get this kiting down. I could just be unlucky or doing it wrong, but it definitely doesn't net anywhere near 30+gph for me.
---
I mean all grats/no salt towards you (though if it was a guild decision, it wasn't a good one) but you wont for long.  Once the luls of you insta dying get old, you'll basically be banned from using it.  Happens literally every time it's given to a sham unfortunately.   
---
But good times will be had in pvp for sure Hopefully you arent a bad and I'll want to keep you alive /wink
---
You can't go from 10-25 in The Barrens alone. You will at least have to go to Stonetalon, probably Ashenvale as well if you don't do WC. I haven't levelled alliance in Classic, only vanilla, but from memory I didn't need to go to all those 5 zones between 10-25 - just between Westfall and Redridge and Duskwood, which isn't that great a difference. Between 20-30 for Horde you're going to have to go between continents and to Hillsbrad otherwise you have a gap at about 26-7 (not enough quests in Thousand Needles to cover you). Between 20-30 for Alliance from memory I don't think you have to leave the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
I think personally Horde is a preferable questing experience, but there's plenty of ways in which Alliance have advantages that Horde don't. Plus you have sooooooo much more story in the Alliance questing experience, which makes it all much more compelling.
---
I rolled a shaman and I kind of regret it because it's apparently the worst gold-making class in the game. Being forced to play healer if you want to get into any dungeon/raid also feels bad.
---
then\*?
---
This is super interesting.  I've been considering mastering the tribute run but haven't done it yet for two reasons 1)
---
1) I got my leaf last week so all of my free time went to my demons + farming my sinew. (pray for me, still havnt gotten my quiver after 20+ hours of dragon slaying) 
---
2) I was under the impression improved FD was a must so I was holding off on doing this for the sole reason of having to respec.  To me, the cost of gold to respec wasnt worth it to learn because I rarely have time to spend hours farming throughout the week but now that I know its possible in a normal spec I'm def going to give it a go!
---
They’ve already made one QOL change to mail. Having mail be instant among your account would be fairly innocuous and hard to use as a platform for making more impactful gameplay changes.
---
I'm not e-bullying you. I'm corpse camping on reddit. 
---
&gt;Duel me.
---
LOL!  
---
I can't imagine needing validation through a video game.  Especially to the point that I'd feel the need to post a screen shot on reddit so that everyone can tell me what I good job I did despite the fact that shamans are probably the most worthless raid class in vanilla wow and realistically you had less to do with getting those pixels than basically anyone else in your guild.
---
In terms of raw gold generation, definitely pick hunter or mage (whichever of those you could see yourself enjoying more). 
---
Nothing else comes close, no matter how many silly clickbait videos get made proclaiming otherwise.
---
Mage and then hunter
---
My concern is not getting loot as soon as possible. It's nice but I would rather spend less time raiding. My concern is raiding with a good group of people, can clear within 3-4 hours total for MC/Ony. Cause it just won't work for me to spend 10 hours raiding. I'd like to do other stuff too in WOW as well.
---
I don't get the fuss over Hand of Ragnaros. It's really only good for pvp and the mats are extremely expensive.
---
Don't agree with the GM getting Corrupted Ashbringer though.
---
It’s BIS threat chest until AQ, so may be something you want to try for anyway
---
Your real world example has no analogue in game. There are two clear rulesets. You can choose whichever you like. You don't get to choose the ruleset of real life.
---
More like 50-60 for my holy priest. 70% of my pre-raid BiS is in BRD and thank god it's an actual fun dungeon.
---
Doesn't the vastly outnumbered Alliance side already have one?
---
Then you're a good egg and tanks will probably remember that.  I throw good DPS warriors on my nice list because they are rare and do tons of damage.  You're just working against the well deserved prejudice that many of your spec have given us.
---
How to get your epic mount: win the lottery!  
---
grats tho
---
#Nochanges is a boomer shit post.
---
Yeah, but with AR it enables you to kill thev2 first ones fast enough to deal with the rest comfortably
---
Thats literally the reason to stop now. Yes guild banks would be amazing but then you just open that door and it will be impossible to close.
---
Why no leader of the pack tho? Nice value point I assumed
---
Damn, well I’m definitely no healer 😕
---
Get ready for pvp/battlegrounds and bust some alliance heads open.
---
Invisibility Potion? 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9172/invisibility-potion
---
Dkp caps? 
---
All this whataboutism...same things can be said for loot council, and loot council is the only system I've seen gone to shit over and over again.
---
Not to mention, It's not like that's the only accuria ring that's gonna drop.
---
I'm going to spend some time tonight to fix quality and sound.   But Twitch is Matt_Molson.    I Just don't like people being able to hear my friends in discord.
---
Link to the guide?
---
Was going to but there wasn't one on sale
---
We did joke about charging them 100g each for us not to pull Emberstrife when he spawned again!
---
Thanks, I'm trying to decide which professions should have each of my characters
---
Rare finds are dope. I also like hearing how people came to find things like this. On my first week I managed to snag some sorta crazy blue twink boots, and I’m psyched to hopefully find some more super rare crap! 
---
Maybe a warden staff someday ;3
---
Imagine being so entitled that you come to reddit to tell other people how they shouldn't be entitled to play the game how they want, but play it how your entitled ass wants. lol. You're an idiot. Good day sir.
---
lol then don't play on a PVP server... News flash, most BG's aren't fair either... I think you'd be better off finding a different game as it doesn't seem like this is for you if you want "fair".
---
&gt;she would use her knockback, put me somewhere too far back, teleport me
---
This means he was behind Ony.
---
You go into bear form, charge the boss, and taunt. Or cast Rebirth on the tank.
---
That's funny, I don't remember running zf and not seeing it drop.
---
He could go fuck himself with it instead.
---
It’s almost like both factions have trolls or something
---
WHAT?! 
---
NO!
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
CTRL + S
---
And bonus, I think there are chests in the water to work on lockpicking too!
---
Welcome to BFA :\^)
---
The census addon was changed, and to get around being a protected function, just triggers every time you click or otherwise interact with the game.
---
Really? I must be bad luck for my casters then, haha
---
Oh. Are you gunna hold Agro the rest of the fight ?
---
Im not entitled. Ill roll against others on my gear. Im not the one expecting other classes to pass on bis loot to make gearing myself easier.
---
PETS!! I freaking love pets so much. That's part of why it took me so long to hit 60 - I stopped doing quests/dungeons in the late 40s and just grinded on those whelps in the Badlands until I got the Dark Whelpling drop. I'll definitely be going Gnomish Engineering now. Thanks again for all the help!
---
Thx!
---
I have 10,000 armor and 5,900 health self-buffed in my Wildheart gear (only 1/5 Thick Hide). That's more armor and health than an 8/8 T1 Warrior will have. I'm doing my job better than a Prot Warrior, plus I can also heal and decurse.
---
I guarantee I am more useful than a Druid who takes 5% less damage than I do for those 20 seconds and then does nothing for the rest of the fight (when his tanking is no longer needed).
---
Less haste, more speed
---
Think it says somewhere "random enchantment"
---
This is the only answer, these people complaining need to play on a pve server
---
Great to know because that's where I'll be in a couple days. Thank you!
---
I know carrying a quiver sucks, but pretty much every class has its own unique quirks regarding bag space. Warlocks with shards is an obvious one, but Hunters have the luxury of having a ton of overlap in their raid vs solo gear. Everyone probably needs a pvp set with more stamina than their damage gear but tanks and healers need to carry two completely different sets of gear pretty much at all times. This is just vanilla life.
---
You need \*at least\* 11 points in holy to tank as paladin. I'm talking about low levels, not 60. It's quite hard because the mana management.
---
It's not how fast you clear, it's how well you clear fast.
---
I think maybe start your own guild, recruit enough dedicated raiders and then reserve what you want. I mean, if you're the one doing all the work organizing and running the raids, why wouldn't you expect to get first dibs on gear?
---
On a pvp server its more in-faction fighting, lol.
---
That's true - but levelling blacksmithing up to the key level solely for tribute, then you might as well grab engineering so you can clear bugs easier when selling items :)
---
"there is, why would they make armor that that class can wear and then think "oh yeah let's then make them dip into other classes gear too!". "
---
Ask blizzard not me.
---
I won our guilds 2v2 arena with a mage partner.   It's fun and all but 1v1 is really random for me and sometimes impossible against certain classes.   For sure will attend the next.
---
What I do is allow locks to regen from my healing provided I can spare the mana.
---
If any locks get a HOT thrown on them when on full HP it's probably your healer indicating you can lifetap a bit ;)
---
It's about striking a balance IMO, the dungeon/raid goes faster if locks can have their mana topped up through heals where appropriate, but slower if you are sat low enough on health regularly that a miss step means you might die.
---
The less health you have the more it means the healer has to invest time and costly heals to save you when more damage is taken and especially in PUGs it's hard to predict how accident prone you are.
---
We had the robe of archmage pattern drop in a LBRS run. The only mage in the group said that in all fairness, everyone can roll need since at the time, it's still worth 100+g. The mage won the roll. We did a second run immediately afterwards. The pattern dropped again. Everyone included the mage rolled need again. The tank won this time. But everyone is pretty happy afterwards.
---
Tank and Ot get priority then after that the fury spec will press 1 if they need
---
almost like... we're all just people playing an online video game or something...
---
I gave up after like two hours of getting like 5-10gph. As they were my first few runs and I was getting a feel for it, I didn't hit the instance cap in either hour. After what you've said, I'll definitely give it another go
---
Am I the only one who wants neither classic+ nor especially TBC?
---
Oh I agree! Engineering is much more personally useful!
---
**Alliance - US - Westfall - PvE**
---
I am currently leveling a mage and enjoy social guilds and want to get into raiding at some point. I’ve been playing WoW off and on since original release in 2004. 
---
I would consider myself more of a casual player at this point, my time can sometimes be limited, but I do enjoy getting in game and helping/interacting with other folks. I am usually on most evenings (Eastern Time) and spontaneously on weekends. 
---
Please message me here or in-game if you have an active guild and looking for more (new) members. My in-game character name is Strilius.
---
I hope your alt name is Coors.
---
Yeah anytime I mention that I like to pretend to be peaceful while questing to avoid interference and then murder every ally when I'm done and no longer need them to be peaceful you'd think I was advocating for RL genocide from the resulting downvotes.
---
&gt;Weird concept considering retail is supposed to be easier in every regard.
---
Why do you think that? One of the most common complaints about classic is how easy the game is compared to hardcore/endgame retail. 
---
Retail has much more difficult raids, a M+ system where dungeons become more difficult the better you are, a class spec system that's *supposed to be* balanced around having many useful abilities that rewards skillful play (although for many specs, this isn't accurate), and a much more in depth PvP system. 
---
You may be confused because retail has a lot of easy things put in place for casual players that many non-casual players (including me) really dislike and are vocal about. The questing and leveling is extremely easy and dumbed down compared to classic, raids/dungeons have very easy "LFG/LFR" versions of them that have few mechanics, and everything gives you tons of loot (and with the titanforging mechanic, sometimes you get very high level equipment from simple things). 
---
Basically, retail's skill floor is lower and skill ceiling higher compared to classic.
---
As a hunter I always told people in the beginning I would be rolling for it if it dropped.
---
40+ runs later and having never even seen it, I'm done with brd. Especially with DM being released, I'll get my hit% elsewhere.
---
So more rules? And then when the next problem happens, more rules. These are legit problems that have and will happen with dkp systems they arent ridiculous examples. 
---
On top of all of this do you think no guild leaders have ever falsified dkp points to help out their friends?
---
The problems that make loot council not work will make dkp not work just the same. 
---
But without those problems (toxic guild/selfishness/favortism) dkp still has issues. Where as with out those problems loot council has far less issues. 
---
If you can find a good guild loot council will shine. If your guild cant handle loot council then they probably cant handle a dkp system without so many rules that basically end up handing out gear anyway. This makes leadership way more work and will lead to guild frustrations.
---
Eh, I think I just regret coming back. It's tons of fun but it probably would have been much better if I never came back. It had been a decade.
---
I do actually hope you feel better getting that off your chest. I'm not sure what brought you to my post in the first place but know that you're not the 1st or 50th person to say "just mad cuz bad" and it's usually the case when people start fights in old posts they're looking to argue with someone. If I misinterpreted you then i'm sorry, but either way have a good one friend!
---
I think the best things to do and habit to have is to not be in that situation in the first place. Invisibility potion isn't going to drop aggro like vanish, you're just going to turn invisible while everything continues to run at you. Download a threat meter and stay well below the tank, then you won't have to worry about this. Would be pretty stupid if there was a way to pop a potion to drop all threat, then everyone could go balls out dps with no worries and a tank could sit there auto attacking the boss while he takes a shit.
---
Naga in azhara (can drop golden pearls) , demons in azhara (can drop felcoth)
---
Maybe, but I doubt Blizzard is able to pull it off. I mean just look at how some servers are imbalanced, if they listened to feedback at all they wouldve capped who can reserve names on a server and then later on, cap who can xfer off depending on population imbalance. Instead they, once again, just raw dogged it.  
---
It really feels like Blizzard is too proud to listen to fans on things or they just have contempt for their fanbase. Idk, but its why I dont trust them on doing Classic+ in a good way. Like really BGs shouldve been out on release or atleast already out by now, but nope, still slow rolling it.
---
Many Orlando Blooms, handle it.
---
My first time ever in MC I was main tanking it. I didnt know I was going to be MT until I got inside. I had dinged the day before and was still arms/fury from leveling. We made it to domo that night then downed him the next raid night. This was in all blues except 1-2 greens. So yeah your build is fine :)
---
Took me ~12 runs to see a Ravager on my Warrior and I won the roll vs a Shaman
---
I never understand why people in pugs are so quick to be toxic it ruins experience for everyone 
---
. Almost makes me want to quit the game. All the "this item on res" "why are you clearing there" makes me want to stop playing the game. Higher level instances are just filled with WAY more toxicity.(First time player's perspective)
---
Right. No one is talking about raids. But that **is** the problem. The only real justifiable reason to run 5-mans as a tank is to get your pre-raid BiS. If you’re running them for PvP gear, dps gear is more suited to your needs.
---
Whether you like it or not, 99.9% of the people running 5 mans are looking to gear for raids. Tanks at lower levels are in abundance, because you can 2h tank, and you don’t need decent gear. And like I said, unless you’re political game is really strong, you’re going to have an incredibly difficult time finding a 40-man raid group that specifically wants **you** to tank for them.
---
My personal pet peeve is groups that insist on taking 2 minutes to skip a pack that we could just kill in 30 seconds. If we're not actually saving time then it's not worth skipping
---
there’s a difference between playing a game because you’re reveling in the experience and enjoying being Good at the thing, and playing it because you specifically want to ruin someone else’s experience of the same game.
---
my only point is that there are many different reasons people engage in and enjoy pvp, but if your main motivation is to upset someone, it’s worth examining why that is.
---
Maybe. Without context its hard to tell. Hand of Rag is a Ret Pally weapon primarily.
---
Unless loot stipulations are agreed upon before entering the dungeon, don't expect any favorable treatment if a boe drops that you would want and that goes for everybody in a pug dungeon
---
Why 1/5 lol. I’m confused at what you’re even running. And you should loot up taladrils Druid tanking guide as we as his best in slot list. You’ll have a better understanding as to what you should be wearing. And I’m pretty sure wildheart comes nowhere near some of the other tank pieces. And your raid should really be assigning decursing roles. That’s not a feral tanks job nor should it ever be.
---
&gt;Not really true...finding dungeons as a tank/healer is even easier than just as a tank.  
---
Is sacrificing comfort of solo leveling and tanking dungeons worth -5 minutes of dungeon finding? You will lose more time during leveling than saving from waiting.  
---
I never have issue of finding party in 5-10 minutes. You will spend more time flying to dungeon anyway)
---
Lol OP you are a really pathetic person
---
Mario Odyssey on Switch if you like micro-tasks like you're discussing here.  Breath of the Wild if you like the exploration aspect of MMOs (and you can also save and walk away anytime).  The Witcher III is now on switch if you like RPG elements. The Outer Worlds is also great on PC and has a 'story' difficulty level if shooting isn't your thing.  That's just a handful of the great games out there that are way better than wow classic and far more fun if you're short on time.
---
I levelled a warrior alt, and just picked mining - funded my engineering nearly entirely. If you wanna go engineering up to 200 only by buying AH items, it depends on server economy. On firemaw it's doable for 70-100g. If you farm a lot of beasts etc, keep skinning. If you idle a lot, keep leatherworking for cured rugged hide cooldowns :) Personally I'd lean towards dropping both and getting mining ;)
---
Yeah i mistyped it was like 5 am for me and i hadnt slept lol
---
Bankrolled by the guild directly? Relatively little. Bankrolled by homies as a favor? A lot.
---
The two are not mutually exclusive.
---
not really tho
---
While I like some of the ideas, gonna go head and warn you that this sub is gonna shit all over your ideas bc this game was made to be a recreation and not to pander to the retail players.
---
HOW LOW CAN THE FAHFAH TAKE MEH HOW LOW CANNA GO CANNA GOOO

Due to heroic strike interaction with offhand swings hit chance is greatly devalued due to the very real possibility you'll be able to swing every single swing and as such never miss an OH swing.
---
I'm still yet to meet a PvPer on par with the guys who stood out in vanilla.
---
I assumed everyone used a headset...
---
8 pumpkins.
---
It's honestly a bunch of horseshit, if it isn't an upgrade for you, then don't roll need on it. Otherwise it's 100% a ninja loot. 
---
I just ran a SM GY and this warrior rolled need on a blue robe that was an upgrade for two other players. His excuse for it not being a ninjaloot was 1. He "thought everyone was rolling need on"  2. Unless it's a uniform guild run it's a ffa, and 3. He was a broke warrior who needed some gold so he was going to AH it.
---
Unfortunately the two priests in our group got fucked out of a really good robe because some greedy asshole wanted a few gold that he could've easily made at a higher level.
---
Didn't read any of this but you're posting on a Classic WoW subforum, want me to tell you how people are going to respond here or do you want to wait 5 minutes for 15 people to tell you why retail is shit?
---
It didn't on Atlas Loot. I was specifically looking at Vice Grips from ZF yesterday and I didn't realize they rolled random stats because it didn't say anything in Atlas Loot.
---
To be fair, Hunters are THE BEST leveling class in the game, rivaled only by AoE farming Mages.
---
jawohl
---
Bahaha! I did exactly this. 
---
&gt;	OMG! Whirlwind Axe!
---
&gt;	Immediately attack closest mob. A turtle. 
---
&gt;	Almost die to said turtle. 
---
&gt;	Right...
---
Start at side door, a Mage can blink in and counterspell the boss before he runs off. Can do 5 resets in 15m or so of only this boss.
---
1. I've also farmed 20+ hours without getting the blue sinew \^\^ Remember though, you don't need the blue sinew for anything but the quiver (which is a small attack speed boost and 2 extra slots). You need the Sinew from Onyxia to complete the rhok'delar quest :)
---
2. Respeccing definetely not needed - just feign behind the pillars and in good range of the bosses and you're golden \^\^
---
Your post isn’t helpful or relevant. I’m glad your 1 group was good at this method. By and large, the last 10 groups I have been in with a fury tank have been minor disasters because the threat they do doesn’t hold well on more than their primary target. This leads to each dps getting their own add on them and taking damage. 
---
It’s quite telling that your first response is “learn to heal” when you have absolutely no information on my ability, class or anything else relevant. Maybe save your holier than thou bullshit for yourself.
---
Perfect! FOR THE HORDE!!! Get fucked alliance...😂🤣
---
Is there an example of the ledge? Any video link?
---
Reading this and the comments makes me realise that OP is a dick. That is all, people can play the game however they want. Stop trying to tell other people how to play.
---
If you happen to be a dwarf,  you can farm the warpwood pods form runn rum tubers too, which are 2-3g / stack on my server. Don't forget the two dusty tome spawns too
---
Crushim got feared into the whelps.
---
You're assuming a lot just because I stated an objective truth; Shaman are going to take significantly more damage than a similarly geared warrior.
---
In Vanilla it is not unusual to respecc mutliple times a week. I know it is expensive but thats just how the game works. I do it too, even as a mage. For raids I specc arcane, and then I go deep frost to be able to farm/pvp. And of course you have to get a ret set. Especially as a hybrid class 3/4 of your inventar and bank should be filled with differet items for all kind of situations.
---
Well I do have logs :)
---
Summoning is super convenient and a huge timesaver because no matter how much of a hardass tryhard guild you have people are going to need summons. Bitching about having to use your class kit is not a good look.
---
I’m horde on a very balanced realm, just yesterday around 200 alliance tried to kill Thrall. We resisted their attack but these alliance over here are like hyper-aggressive killer bees. I want to get a counter attack on SW pretty soon.
---
Edit: to add, I’ve had some really fun 20v20 skirmishes in hillsbrad, south shore v tarren mill style and those were also really fun to be a part of.
---
I have never heard that as a feral Druid tank, and I've botched several instances with bad tanking.
---
I got these early on and put +mount speed on them.
---
Then they dropped again and I sold the +mount speed by accident. QQ
---
Well i kinda wanted to get both viewpoints, from classic players and BfA players. I know many of them will hate on BfA, but some of them may have valid points. I'm also able to distinguish pure flaming or valid arguments against BfA i guess.
---
It felt like medium to medium for me in the beginning!
---
Go in the barrens and help the low levels in their quests ! Not only you will be THE legendary bearer of Sulfuras in their eyes, you will make the life of many players easier, and with this, making your faction stronger !
---
Be the hero they need to have
---
Doesn’t mean their tank had any of those
---
And the ticket response is to use the report system and not to open a ticket. Blizzard doesn't enforce their rules.
---
Nah you're missing my point. I'm not complaining about it when it happens to me...that's what you sign up for on a pvp server. I just log on to an alt or go do something else. 
---
I just can't for the life of me figure out what people get out of sitting on a flight path for hours killing people that can't fight back.  Don't get me wrong, I actively gank alliance that come across my path...that's part of the fun of the game. Sometimes I get ganked in return.  But Jesus Christ how do people not have anything better in life than to spend hours not progressing their character in any way just to keep other players from playing. Idk. Maybe it's some sort of cathartic therapy for people who got bullied and finally feel on control.of something. I just can't make any sense of.it.
---
Rolling on a mandatory dps warrior item he will use forever when you can replace it in a couple of weeks is a huge asshole move.  
---
I wouldn't do it even to a random, you're basically telling them "I care so little about you or your time that I'll force you to do another 600 runs so I can do a little extra dps for 2 weeks.".  
---
No decent person would do it.

 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3387/limited-invulnerability-potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3387/limited-invulnerability-potion)  against Melee mobs to drop threat on melee mobs for the duration of the potion, if in a party.

 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13506/flask-of-petrification](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13506/flask-of-petrification)  for dropping aggro against all mobs for the duration of the flask, although would be extremely expensive to use as like all flasks requires 1 black lotus to craft.
---
Yep.. that's what I used for my Dark Age of Camelot PvP videos before WoW.. uploaded to fileshack and link shared on ICQ/MSN messenger
---
The first time, remind them to focus the skull/whatever target method is determined before you begin the run.
---
The second time, let them off-tank whatever they pull.
---
If they get angry, well, there’s PLENTY of DPS available for any run. You don’t have to put up with idiots. You are the tank. You call the shots.
---
WASD and numpad arrows are the default for controlling aircraft in GTA V on PC
---
No, do you see where the mage is standing?
---
10 to 60 is pretty rough
---
Don't they eventually come back and start whacking you again?
---
was yesterday, alliance.
---
could be gone by now... would be a worthy invesment since you could probably sell it for way more than 3.3k
---
Emperor and Michael Collins. 
---
Ran with Zealots of Redemption, Imperial Guard, COPS and Undead Lords
---
Who said it was?
---
I'm not saying they *aren't* political, I am saying they are no more political than being cis or anything else. To single out one group as being more political than the rest as a way to silence conversation about them is bigoted.
---
Wow what terrible bot, the waypoints are too far apart giving that stop and go look, and that's one of the most well known spots to bot because it was included as a part of the default profiles that came with the bot (glider I believe) back in the day. It was so well known people advised against using it because it's pretty much low hanging fruit as far as getting caught
---
Camping people who have no ability to get back at you isn't PvP it's just griefiing. Yeah we knew this would happen but it's still the shittiest part of a PvP server. The game can be stale without danger of other players around every corner so it's worth it to be on a PvP server, but when you get home from work and have a few hours to play and most of it is spent being camped by someone hilariously above your gear or level range then it's pretty awful and makes people hate the game.
---
Competing for mobs can feel bad if you're the wrong class and or spec , but that's PvP. They're killing you for a reason.
---
In phase 1 if you're not taking something they're farming and they're just waiting on you to rez over and over it's just griefiing.
---
It gets even more compounded by the fact that blizzard refuses to attempt to address faction balance. My server is literally 70-80% horde. If an alliance player wants to clap back the horde can always come back harder because they can just make it a 4v1.
---
Back in Vanilla I played a Pally to 60 without knowing what a judgement was.
---
My goodness thank you so much.  So many good posts with good advice. I am going to definitely give the carrion bird a try since I can get the swoop in Mulgore . You guys are awesome. Like I said not for gold just a personal satisfaction of doing something. Not bothered about the costs although it would be nice to sell what I get too. Thanks again for answering my questions seriously without mocking me.
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in ceiling fan.
---
Rare level gear vs uncommon   
---
Can't be a pleb wearing greens
---
I think a lot of it is due to the 'neckbeard' player base having progressed beyond the dungeon grind for the most part. Leaving the slower levelers and more casual folks without enough carry to smooth runs out. Just my theory anyway.
---
This was my favorite part of Barrens, depending on what you do, you can milk it to 28 or 30. Think of that, half the levels in the game without ever stepping in contested territory.
---
This just hasn't been my experience. If it's a big pull with multiple mobs I'll wait a few seconds before dropping a renew on them - because yeah you could pull someone the tank hasn't touched. But overall I have not had this issue. I play with one of my buddies who dual wield tanks most of the time... so maybe his threat gen is better? Idk.
---
I’m not trying to silence the conversation in general. I’m trying to do it in a place that has nothing to do with it. 
---
Again. It bigoted. Please get help.
---
I've played both tank and healer and honestly healers who take longer than 5s to find their drink (which should be hotkeyed) annoy me a lot more than chain-pulling tanks. Theres a lot of pulls to do in a dungeon if you're adding 10s after every pull to find your drink it's significant time. On the healer side just drink the instant you leave combat and you shouldnt ever have to ask the tank to wait unless yall just did a huge pull (or adds, patrols etc) at which point it should be obvious that everyone is low on resources anyway. If you're still running out of mana you're probably spamming inefficient/maxrank/the wrong spells and that's still on you as the healer.
---
People seem to underestimate the effect of wasting the tank's rage because they can't manage their mana properly.
---
Gnomergan (back door).  /s
---
I honestly do not understand why so many priests are specced holy/disc at this stage of the game. You can absolutely just stay shadow and still heal everything just fine
---
Issue is ppl min maxing and assuming anything other than absolute optimal is shit.
---
Tell em if they keep mouthing off, that you'll proc a whirlwind with that ravager and shit on their chest.
---
Essences are always win, lashers got nerfed (sadly for us), not sure your professions but there's a handful I hold onto so they aren't super common knowledge and overcrowded which I will send you.
---
This is how we've done it but the issue comes when DPS 1 gets aggro runs north and dies. Ony turns to DPS 2 fire breathing/ tail whipping group, DPS runs north dies. This repeats until the tank finally gets aggro and by then we are decimated. We've downed her a few times just wish it didn't take multiple wipes everytime.
---
I tank with a 2hander as arms, generally no issues so far and I'm 51. Might change once I get into the last few dungeons, but so far it's fine.
---
Yeah obviously the problem is that your data is actually more of an anecdote. It won't take you long to verify if there's correlations in the procs through some systematic data, you can use those monsters in BL that go invulnerable as a controlled combat dummy (servant of Allistarj?) if you want.
---
Boe epics are bags of gold. Everyone needs a bag of gold.

---
Your character looks like he prefers intercourse with men
---
Yeah, I've given up on this game due to the rng.  Only even seen jed 5 times, dropped the wand every time.  Ran ubrs over 30 times trying to get d0 chest, havent seen it once.  Same story for scholo d0 head.  I don't have a problem with having to roll through content more than once, but when it becomes an endless grind with absolutely zero reward and nothing but wasted time, that's not fun, it's boring, and it's absolutely shit game design.  When you have to dedicate every spare minute of your time grinding away or else you fail to make any progress, it's not a game anymore, it's a chore.
---
Yeah thats true, thanks for your opinion. I guess the next Update/blizzcon also plays a major role(Classic+ or old expansions, what happens with BfA)
---
Don't regret my class. But my server.
---
Getting ganked multiple times by multiple people wherever I go is only fun for so many times.
---
I like dungeons. But dread going to brd, start, scholo, etc.
---
Should've rolled pve in stead.
---
I don't mind pvp, I'm not good at it, but it's all part of the game. But my opinion doesn't go to the point of having everything else unplayable.
---
and now my turn has begun at 55, lets gooo
---
It is not a four hour slog.  You are just horrible at running dungeons if you think you have /played 1 day in maraudon.  Please let us know your server and character so we can ignore you.
---
Same here.  I got one early on and gave it to a guildie who then stopped playing and didn't log back on until a week ago to give it back to me.  Now that DM is out I can't sell it.  Wish I would have just sold it early on but hey whatreyagonnado that's the risk you take when you try to be nice haha
---
Ugh the feels lol.  I even noticed some frustrating runs when with my guild.  Pugs are terribad of course but even guildies who happen to pug alot get into the habit of opening with a multishot when all i've done is demo roar.  When I am holding a pack of 4 or 5 mobs the entire time, it feels so great.  It's alot of work, requires patience from dps, swapping trinkets constantly (smokey's lighter is great in strat), but can be so gratifying.  But then the next pull you only demo roar and a multi shot/blizzard go off and all 3 mobs run.  This causes me as a tank to just let out a massive sigh and contemplate why am I even running this mess.  My new strat that works great for strat live human part is just mark a skull and ignore it.  I'll hold aggro on the other 3 and the skull means "hey nuke this guy dont aoe".  I keep hearing from guildies that my runs are super smooth and fast which is good.  Its pretty easy as a bear to hold 3-5 mobs in place, just let me tab swipe like 3 times and you should be fine.  
---
From a healing perspective, after I healed a scholo, I now very harshly judge healers in dungeons lol.  I'm used to healing in m+ where the absolute second you drop combat you spam that drink even at 70% mana so in my run the tank never had to wait on my mana, generally had to wait on mages mana.  On bosses I keep up insect swarm for free dps as well.  So now whenever I tank and I see my hp above 80%, the priest at 90% mana and he's not wanding I literally just start yelling at my monitor lol.  Conversely, priests often like to spam holy nova on a big pack to oom themselves in 8 secs when we already had 2 mages for aoe lol.  When I see a healer at 30% mana but seriously wait 15 secs to start drinking, I just lose my mind.  Being a bear and running with 3 mages and a priest is awful, every pull requires 45 secs of drinking for them, its just insane.  Just give me 1 rogue or warrior so I know I can start the next pull.  Healers continue to drink until I'm actually below 50%, i'll often see a healer stop drinking when they're at like 75% just to cast a renew on me cause I hit that deadly 95% hp mark.  I don't try and do crazy fast speed, just a reasonable pace.  3 mobs, 30 sec break, 3 mobs, 30 sec break is just crazy.  This is also where hybrids shine.  A ret or kitty can handle heals for 10 secs while the healer is still topping of their drink, keeps the flow going great.
---
Back to the original post, tanks often don't find this fun so they burn out of it.
---
&gt; My thought would be: your first plan - 5/5 thick hide - is best. I don't have Feline Swiftness and don't miss it because very few dungeons are considered outdoors in classic anyway. IIRC ZG is when we get to it? 
---
Yah, feline swiftness was only to help level while duo'ing with ret pally.   It wasn't "critical" to have but made the day to day nicer.
---
I'm also thinking that 5/5 thick hide is probably where I should be when I respec. Worry about making myself "hybrid" if I develop a need for it.
---
My server is always looking for tank and dps. As a healer, I cant find a pug to save my life
---
Rogue + HoJ +WF totem = Melting everything.
---
Slam is a great rage dump for single target if you have a slow hard hitting 2h.  WW is obviously very good aoe with a 2h.
---
So, I´m a gnome warrior at level 34 currently using Manual Crowd Pummeler and I got Witchfury for a fair price on AH (3g) but is only usable at 39. Whirlwind axe quest is extremely hard to do now and I feel like i would get to 39 faster than I will complete the quest. Is it worth doing or should I just level and equip Witchfury at 39? Thanks in advance
---
Oh I get it now, the way he worded it made it seem like he was calling himself a mage. Cha feel
---
What?
---
lmao trans people being allowed to exist isn't "politically charged" bro.
---
You don't need any strength or agility to hold threat when you're using Maul on every attack. I also have 10,000 armor and 5,900 health self-buffed, which is more than an 8/8 T1 Prot Warrior. I do just fine.
---
Started as a mage, but rerolled into warrior at 42, enjoy it much more now at 60. There aren't actually that many dps warriors, unlike mages, and it's the best dps class and tank. Also it's not as boring to play as you actually have few different builds with different gear and weapon setups, and the rotation has a few small optimizations that take skill. As a mage you just spam 1 button. The only downside is I'm not exactly swimming in gold.
---
Limited, not living.
---
If you havnt already, drop a few thousand gold stocking up on raid consumables. If your interested in PvP, fill a couple alts to the teeth with FAPs, LIMs, Sappers, etc. After that drop another few thousands+ into investments.
---
Blue quality
---
It probably was straight at least when he got it, but the skin stretched out.
---
I'm thinking about this too much...
---
Reminds me of that late night questing session, when at the end I was going to wait for my HS cooldown while AFK, vendor trash and NOT VENDOR THE CURE BLEED TRINKET (which looks like wool cloth) and go to sleep. Did I vendor the trinket? Damn right. Can I get it back by asking a GM? :S is it any good even?
---
Again, I have 10,000 armor and 5,900 health unbuffed in my Wildheart gear. That is more health and armor than an 8/8 T1 Prot Warrior. Unlike the Prot Warrior, I can also fill another role when I'm not tanking. That makes me useful.
---
Aux is better.  It's so simple it's not even funny.  Go to the post tab, click the item you want to post, it loads in all of the auctions it can fine, click whichever one you want to undercut and click post.  Done.
---
I do use TSM to maximize profit from potions and cooking food though.
---
hmm seems like a good Idea, the only problem is i really like focusing on one game or one version in the end.
---
I was wondering this myself yesterday.
---
Clicking is easier than typing.
---
What settings are you on? Looks really smooth
---
If you search for "spell coefficients" you can find some lists of all the spells and how spell/healing damage affects them. I couldn't find that exact spell on the list (which isn't surprising as it isn't a spell) but if it is affected by it, this formula can probably tell you how much:
---
## "Over-Time" spells
---
This category includes both Damage over Time spells (DoTs) as well as Healing over Time spells (HoTs). The standard formula for "Over-Time" spells is:\[Duration of Spell\] / 15 = \[Coefficient\]
---
The added damage or healing is divided equally among each tick of the spell.
---
are you a frost mage?  If so, that opens up a few other 1-handed weapon options.
---
What reason did I have to transfer?
---
I had names saved on skeram, and started playing as soon as the servers went live.
---
&lt;Insidious&gt; - Horde - Rattlegore
---
We are currently recruiting all classes for weekend raiding.  Our first raid is up and running and we'll be starting up our second raid in a couple of weeks.
---
We are currently 9/10 in MC and Onyxia is on farm status.  Friday night is 8/10 MC (we're doing this in under 3 hours), Saturday is Onyxia and Rag progression, Sunday available for cleanup/progression.
---
Our guild Discord is very active and the raid team menbers are very helpful during the week to help you with attunements and getting your pre-raid BiS gear.
---
Rattlegore server time is Pacific time.  Our first raid group starts pulls at 6pm server time and our second raid group will start pulls at 8pm server time.
---
Message me in-game on battle.net at amalgamemnon#1206.
---
I mean I can toss one greater heal and heal you from 40% to full so its really not a big deal lol
---
My, you're a tall one!
---
Oh man, good luck to you
---
You would spend 30g on a side grade shield? That's crazy but the AH will eventually pop one up for you and you'll have your opportunity.
---
Graphic settings? The max (except ground clutter).
---
That's... not how threat works
---
I'm up to level 45 on my pally, and this is what I have been doing. Prot/Holy spec so I can tank in dungeons or heal. I originally started as ret until I realized I could just spam dungeons to 60 now without using any healing talent points. I love being able to play any role with just a gear switch. Even with just the polearm i got from ZF I can do decent damage with strength gear and SotR and SotC debuff
---
Sure, push ingots to him.
---
Its ogron pumpkin! They were ahead of the time!
---
Here, maybe a downvote will help you understand
---
&gt;  get to use multiple abilities, unlike mage.
---
Eh, warlocks use three buttons (curse/banish/bolt) instead of two for mage (sheep/bolt).  Not that big of a difference.  If you have more than 3 locks then the remainder aren't even using a curse.  
---
I mean, unless you're counting lifetap here.  Mages will evocate, too.  And mages still AoE in MC and Ony.
---
I laughed way too hard at this, and it made Tea come out of my nose, so you get an upvote.
---
Not... from a Jedi...
---
And that was not in early vanilla.
---
You can get there as a rogue in classic, but it's tough, and not in phase 1.
---
Douchebag spotted
---
Honestly if you aren't letting your mages/locks get mana before every pull then you're a bad tank anyway? DPS mana is just as, if not more, important than healer mana.
---
like i said at a cost, sell them half off or something to the guildie.
---
Sure, if you'd like! My pally's name is Fjori. Although I really enjoy fishing them up myself so it's not likely that I'll run out :)
---
Iv tanked several bosses in molten core as pally tank. Its 100% doable.
---
If anything it feels like the GM puts his heart into it.I rather have an GM who aspires to two great &gt;PvP&lt; items that tie him to the guild and that are
---
a) not that good anyways for anything than PvP
---
b) stretched out over the entirety of the game
---
If he would reserve TF actively sabotaging the guild's raid success by taking it from the MT, that would be something different.
---
But especially on alliance side both Sulfuras and Ashbringer are 100% PvP items that are up for grabs for PvP and dedicated players.
---
They are pretty much novelty/ vanity items serving little purpose apart from showing the e-peen of the guild. PvP ranking is over by the time people are at the horseman, making Ashbringer more of an RP item and doing some PvP items, before the server dies out.
---
Anyways who's more dedicated than the guild/raid lead and more deserving of such items?
---
Yeah, i guess you can farm gold and buy Raid gear if everyone is bored later and i like playing hunter so thats also good.
---
WoW isn’t being intentionally manipulated to get to any outcome except maximum profit, on one hand retail has X combination of features that is decreasing in profitability and on the other hand Classic is increasing or otherwise doing better. 
---
The lesson they can take away is that at some point between classic and now something changed that is losing them money, and that’s what they will focus on.
---
How is that an arguement
---
In my opinion, you should play BfA to get to up to level 120, and then you can play Classic until the next expansion. My reasoning: 
---
1. You stated you enjoy solo content. A lot of content in Classic is ONLY fun in a group, unless you enjoy leveling alts, but you've especially mentioned raid sets, so I don't think you exactly want to be a quest grinder and nothing else. 
---
2. Time commitment. Seems like you don't necessarily have a TON of time, and you can still be competitive in BfA without as much time commitment as Classic. Right now, sure you can breeze through Classic pretty quick, but after a few phases you'll really start to see the difference between players who have been grinding since release, and players who are trying to play catch up and/or play at their own leisure. 
---
3. One of your concerns was being too far behind in content for BfA. Well, the current belief is that they're not too far from announcing another expac, which will be the great equalizer for progress in BfA. With this, you'll get the leveling experience of BfA, allowing you to learn about the WoW world, and then you'll be able to hit max level and go enjoy yourself in Classic until the new expansion drops, rather than trying to grind for old gear in BfA right now with no use for it in sight.
---
Only one song truly rings out vanilla WoW.
---
Straight to Video by mindless self indulgence
---
I guess I'm not really sure what you mean by "shield", but I thought you meant that it was Blizzard just escaping blame for "screwing up".
---
*yes but besides that*
---
Looks like the rfk boss
---
The only reason I forced myself to get used to it is so I don't need to keep a spreadsheet for the 30 different relevant potions to math out all of the material cost vs selling price.  Otherwise, I'd still be using Aux exclusively.
---
I caught you checking me out!   I'll help, and our MT can save you one ingot.  =)
---
Same on Stalagg lol
---
Yep titan panel
---
Rude rude rude
---
&gt;You want to go up against someone and ruin them. 
---
I think that there is a misconception that you don't seem to understand. Losing can be fun. Losing doesn't mean "my day is ruined".
---
Saying that the appeal of competition is to ruin somebody else's day is horrible and the only thing I would answer to that is that you should stop playing competitive games if this is why you are drawn to it. That's not healthy for you and that's definitely not healthy for the others.
---
Competition can be friendly, can be done while respecting others and still be at the highest level of play. 
---
But that begins by accepting that you will lose sometimes, that's normal and if it makes you uncontrollably unhappy / angry then there is some work to do on yourself.
---
Camping people until they disconnect with 10 people has noting to do with VS or competition. It's purely griefing, only done to ruin people's day and it's pathetic.
---
Ungoro, bring a mythril casing for the a me 01 escort quest, and enjoy the mindless 8 hours of grinding it offers.
---
Edit: dont forget to tag the silithus fp too while in the area.
---
Man, I didn't even know people were doing that. Slimy but unsurprising, I guess. Those must be the same people who transferred off saying, "Enjoy your PvE server!" while heading to an even more PvE-skewed server. Big victim complex.
---
You know I saw a rat murderer not too long ago and wondered what the hell the story was. They were probably doing exactly this.
---
This is where knowing your raid markers and marking targets comes in. Skull means primary, x means secondary, moon means polymorph, and circle means sap. Mark before you go in, and if dps doesn't want to focus skull, let them die. If they try the whole "you can't hold aggro", you've got "you can't focus the primary". I'm level 52 and have only had 2 issues (one mage, one shamen) using marks like this.
---
As an official representative of Horde Skeram, I'd like you to know we have no hard feelings and will gladly take you back.
---
I finished tanaris all up, but if un'goro is just 48 plus ill definitely go check it out.
---
Does not change my opinion.   Peeps like you makes others reserve shit.   Gear should go to whom it benefits the most,  not for just one stat.   If so there are quest rewards that are rings with crit and you could of got them at your level and didn’t have to piss off the healer.
---
i'm a /pat or cancelled trade type of guy myself
---
Warriors are dependent on gear, so get the best gear you can when you get the chance.
---
No, more as a "(reasonable) justification why not".  And honestly, it's pretty reasonable.
---
Say it with me, nice and loud:
---
* I do NOT need ANY points in prot to tank. 
---
* I do NOT need ANY gear besides a shield to tank.
---
Extra attacks are pretty good.  Builds rage, builds threat.
---
They prefer what makes them the most money, not what makes them the most money per person. 
---
It is NOT a given that they want micro transactions, it is just a tool they used to weather a decrease in subs.
---
I really want a Warden staff as well!  Still no epic drops for me even though I've completed several massive reputation grinds and AoE leveled a Mage.  My luck must be building for a exceptional drop later.  :)
---
lol bullshit. This subreddit will twist itself into a knot finding a way to excuse tanks of fucking everything.
---
Tanking is hard in classic. That doesn't change the fact that most tanks are also fucking awful.
---
Afaik you can retrieve quest rewards such as carrot, luffa (in your case), guard captain etc. because there are no means to get it any other way.
---
It's VERY situational, but something like 5cp rupture can be cured if you are running around in shield + defstance and know the rogue will not evis, but rather rupture, you using luffa, be free of the bleed.
---
Also how is searing gorge for leveling? I've never leveled there.
---
Rofl randos joining rando guilds thinking legendaries won't be given the GM/inner circle.
---
The question you need to answer is are you going to stay 2h as you level or are you going to switch to fury at some point. If you are going arms and are planning on staying with 2h weapons I heavily suggest you pick up the item Bonebiter. It's basically just a quest reward version of whirlwind axe, althought it's (very slightly) better. The quest chain starts in desolace and the quest which rewards the Bonebiter axe is called: In the name of the light
---
Ran it first time other day on my warrior, joke about it dropping, drops from him and proved to lose roll by 1 point. I'll never see it again
---
Except robbery is illegal and camping you for several hours is not.
---
holy shit this is depressing
---
I haven't got lucky yet.   I think Ogre Forged suites my needs a little better.   It's similar, but with more stam and Intel.
---
Those are all valid points, but I've just never been in a successful guild where the GM's biggest priority is getting himself a couple specific items.
---
Not sure what it is about classic but I kept running into shaman 'tanks' and melee hunters while leveling. I mean have the last 15 years not taught us anything at all?
---
But how reliable is a random proc
---
That's what BG's are for, PVP is just for ganking. I'm not surprised you think like that of course.
---
But can I do it on my rogue?
---
Shaman tier sets look amazing
---
Is the community still good on smaller servers? I'm on Herod and I have been SHOCKED by the quality of this community up until a few weeks ago. Herod is so toxic now. Everyone seems to be an arrogant, self-centered angry elitist now. I'm 59 and not motivated anymore... I think I will quit but if smaller servers are still awesome maybe I'll just migrate. I like chill runs, talking with people, I like difficulty. Now it's OK GET AS MUCH PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE, PERFECT CLASSES, PERFECT GEAR, FLAWLESS EXPERIENCE, MAXIMUM TIME OPTIMIZATION, DON'T SPEAK. That's the retail mentality and I absolutely hate it :(
---
I don't want to roll a mage, I love my shadow priest. No, I don't want to heal. Or if I do, don't complain if I run oom every fight, I'm a dps. And I don't want to play a single player game with people pretending to be bots, I love team-based games. I'm not saying this based on one bad run, it's been this way in brd, lbrs and ubrs for almost a month now :/
---
warrior is also pretty underpowered until you have BWL lvl gear or beyond which sucks
---
Do you guys post logs?  If so, can you link me?  I'm not trying to wave my dick around, I just want to compare numbers to see if I'm really that off base.
---
Nuked by the players or nuked by the guards because you accidentally autoattacked a player?
---
If it's the former, report them for using a terrain exploit. 
---
If it's the latter, turn off enemy nameplates (V is default keybind) and turn on friendly ones (shift+V). The bar for the vendor is almost guaranteed to be bigger than whatever player is standing on top of the vendor and you can just rclick the bar instead of the npc.
---
Imagine them spending 1g to train polearms they never use.
---
&gt; I highly recommend leveling enchanting for the armor trinket. 
---
It's on my todo list, when I have the cash to blow on a temporary profession.
---
I'm still working for mine. Grats! 
---
What add-on do you use for that text?
---
Bear is a fantastic dungeon tank, but I'm sure you've already figured that out. Your build is perfectly functional already. The important talents (for bear specifically) are Feral Instinct and Primal Fury.
---
I don't think you could go wrong with any talent choice from here. Imp Thorns, full Thick Hide, Shred+Natural Shapshifter are all good options. Base your decision on how you feel tanking. Do you need a bit more aoe threat? Thorns. Do you want to hit armor cap sooner? Thick Hide. Plan to dps on the side? Cat talents. 
---
If you want to have more security out in the open world, consider 0/30/21. Natures Swiftness is a godsend in both PVE and PVP. Take your bear talents up to HotW and grab resto talents up to NS. [For example.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05502300501) The 2 points in Imp Enrage could be moved over to Natures Focus if you're doing more pvp and don't feel the need for Enrage in dungeons.
---
OK cool that's what I thought. Just didn't know if there was anything more to it.
---
What the FUCK is that SHIT
---
What do you mean by Queue Tracker?
---
Why is dagger rogue not as good as sword in ur OPINION?
---
IIRC wasn't that bug recently fixed?
---
I believe the buff limit is 32 anyways. I can't imagine someone hitting that limit while leveling.
---
Well sure, but weapon skill is only tied to number of hits and Intelligence as far as I know. Not mob level.
---
I focused too much on what was the "best", wanting to heal because I remember healing was at a premium in Vanilla and wanted to be in high demand. Because of that, I landed on a holy priest. There are tons of holy priests, I am not in demand whatsoever, and healing does not help you secure a 5, 10, or 40 man spot at all. 
---
Wish I rolled a class I actually had interested in playing, rather than what everyone said would be the "best". Not that I don't like my priest, just wish I had the balls to roll something else when I had the choice. Would most likely have rolled a druid or rogue.
---
Just level and use Witchfury at 39.  I would have just done the quest for the axe from the SM quests instead (not ravager), but to each their own.
---
If you want to do the Whirlwind quests though, I'd definitely do them.  They're a part of a unique class quest for warriors and can be fun.  If you don't feel like doing them just to do them though, then don't.
---
Yeah, I'm almost full T1 because there is usually only 1 other shaman in the raid. The issue is outside of raiding. I'm deep resto atm so I can't really do anything unless I'm in a group. I'm hoping soon I can switch to 30/0/21 as my guild gets more geared and I can ditch mana tide.
---
No, I don't think any humanoid is skinnable.
---
Ur lagging
---
Brag when you're 60.
---
Havent been in the situation myself, really, therefore I can't say anything regarding that point.
---
I 2 manned it with my Warri buddy a lot. He eventually got it on a run with other friends. Didn't take quite as long as yours but 2manning that event was certainly a little cancerous. What I'm trying to say is I know both your pain and your joy. Gratz mate.
---
Oof, the rest of the can for getting ganked. Id have alcohol poisoning on Skeram
---
You just get a summon again.....
---
Yeah it's kinda shit. Yeah it should go to a warrior first. Yeah it's kinda bullshit the GM just gets it.
---
But the GM is being honest about it, he's letting people know at the earliest possible opportunity that this will happen and you can leave if you don't like it.
---
In all honesty, being the GM of a large raiding guild is a ton of tough work, you spend so little time playing and instead it's just dealing with drama or organizing shit for the future. I can see how this GM would like a reward/incentive for this work, and in all honesty two items over years and years of raiding probably isn't the biggest ask considering how much time they're likely to invest into the guild.
---
What do you farm here?
---
I've gotten several patterns without camping and using a macro. Not the one I want, but that's just me not spending all day at it.
---
I love healing warlocks who lifetap when it's a smart time - it keeps us moving faster through the dungeon and my mana efficiency is better than theirs.
---
If a warlock LTs while I'm drinking, they've decided that I should drink and then heal them and then drink again - it's now they're responsibility to fix their health.
---
That’s not a given, if they project they will lose money on it, they won’t do it.
---
Trash tier player spotted, go back to retail noob.
---
Yup, my bad.
---
If a hunter is running arena/anger, you bet they will roll for the chest or else they wouldn't be there.
---
Ravager is pretty much strictly only good for AoE. Quest rewards (even from SM) can be better. The worst part is that the proc seems painfully low. Even with instant casts an entire pack can be dead before it procs.
---
Smart way to do it but also difficult to sync schedules to level in a group!
---
An important note is that all this information is for raids. Raid bosses are level 63 and have 315 defense, (a level 60 has 300 defense; it increases by 5 per level) this is why a 315 skill brings you up to a 5% miss chance (the base miss chance).
---
For virtually all other endgame content, PvP, Dungeons, Open World, etc, the hit cap is 5% since you will be fighting things your level or lower. While extra hit wont be wasted if you are dual wielding due to the 19% penalty, you would be better served with other stats (think of that wasted 4% hit as 4% crit you could have instead).
---
What are you asking for?  The login queue for each server?  Just download chrome remote desktop and check it yourself.
---
How? How is it impossible? Just because the cap is lower? So then I can't get a bunch of nines in my bag? How do you know the numbers actually represented my real gold amount? How do you know how every piece of code that ever touches this signed int value can't expose a bug that causes this? How an you know anything about something you never ever coded yourself? You can't.
---
Stop pretending you're a developer of the game.
---
Nothing really wrong with this but I don't know why he needed the extra justification when he could just say "it's good for the GM's class/spec and giving this to the GM insures it benefits the guild long term" and leave it at that.
---
Only reason I even considered it might be good is  because duelers have it in their inventory in CDL thats on rn
---
i’m honestly curious is 49 or 59 bricks will pop. i really hope they do but i don’t see why they would. you don’t get exp from bgs. i know people will chime in “i’ll do a few bgs at 47 i like to have fun and need a break from leveling!” sure, i just mean it won’t be anything like being geared at 60 and running bgs. I predict 19s will be poppin off though. hopefully 29s or 39s too.
---
F.
---
How did this happen?
---
/r/classicwowplus/
---
Solution: Join a guild/accumulate contacts that you can trust. Form/join groups with them and even if multiple people need the same loot, everyone will get it eventually. Otherwise, form your own groups and comprise it with folks who dont need what you do.
---
What are you, CEO of the power company bro?
---
Coming from a 60 rogue, this guy has a lot of heartbreak in his future.
---
Yeah, but that's mostly because there isn't really any easier way for level-appropriate Horde to get deep into Dun Morogh. The only alternative is to fly to Tarren Mill, then run through Arathi Highlands (you could fly to Hammerfell-but by the time you're there, Gnomer is almost too low lvl), cross the Thandol Span, go through Wetlands, across Loch Modan, and finally into Dun Morogh - avoiding high lvl guard NPCs the whole way. Also, you'll be too low lvl to have a mount.
---
By comparison, it's much easier for Alliance to get to SM.
---
Mages and warlocks are to one side of the spectrum or the other. If you get greeted at the dungeon with water/healthstones, and get considerate CC? Those casters are frigging gold. 
---
The other end, is, of course, the "open with blizzard" sort.   
---
There's a rare few who can do both, and make the latter mostly work, because they understand timing and dungeons to a great degree. But there's a \*lot\* of people trying to copy twitch streamers and stuff, I think, and not really getting it.
---
Totally agree.  I’m a feral and got super fed up with DPS clowns, i went on strike for a while and levelled via questing and DPSing in dungeons with some other mug tanking.  Every tank I talk to feels the same way.
---
Now i mostly tank for guildies.  DPS need to realise that this isn’t an arcade game like retail. DPS responsibility isn’t just to lay the smack down but also to manage their threat.  Pulling threat from the tank doesn’t mean your DPS is amazing - it means you’re incompetent at your job. 
---
I played vanilla extensively and the average pug group was never great but it wasn’t as awful an experience as this... except for hunters.  They haven’t changed at all.
---
“we have full naxx gear at home” meme.
---
Andddd?
---
What IS the difference between “logging out” and just bouncing? Does it effect rested XP if you’re in an inn?
---
Also, on a side note, why won’t anyone RP with me in Goldshire with my Flimsy Female Undead Mask on? 
---
Am I weird? Or is it them? 
---
It’s them. Thank you. I thought so too.
---
Im planning on staying arms til 60. Ive seen ppl with that axe. It seems pretty good. Whats the minimun level for the first quest of the chain?? I might go for it instead of whirlwind.
---
You sound like a brat to me...
---
Will watch the video later, so please let me know if this question is covered in the video:
---
I can get to the boss, however when I pull with my cat he dies before he can get back to the corner spot. The boss seems to run faster than every video I’ve watched. He catches up to my cat (with dash) and between a melee, charge and a couple spells from the ogre mage my pet dies.
---
Is there a trick to get your pet into position without taking damage?
---
This was written by a dps warrior :)
---
I am at the same exact cross roads.  I LOVE DW fury, I also LOVE tanking.  I love the stance dancing, the threat management, etc, and I also understand there is a shortage of tanks.  A lot of people don't realize how much work goes into tanking with pug's.  BRD a long run for a DPS?  Imagine a tank having to know all the shortcuts, the different types of runs, the boss fights, etc.  I would 100% tank if I was in a solid guild and was tanking for guildies, but pug tanking can really turn a "I am going to run 6 UBRS tonight and get some gear!" to a "wow that dungeon was horrible to tank, i am going to take a break."
---
Yeah I ran out of that too it was a grave mistake
---
I think a lot has to do with bad communication from the tank. You need to take control and tell them what is expected. I explained markings to my group as if they had never played WoW in their lives. Kindergarten level explanations, don't assume people understand markings, CC, threat, and target priorities... ever!
---
Don't be passive aggressive about correcting other players. The "If the DPS doesn't focus skull and pulls aggro I am going to let them die so they learn." thinking is idiocy. Taunt the damn mob and hold aggro as best you can, then after the pull reiterate the expectations... I don't know that I have ever had a pug group not adjust to what I asked them to do, even if I had to sound like a broken record sometimes...
---
Someone complains about pace? Tell them you're moving at a pace that's comfortable for you. If they continue to bitch about it, after you made it clear you will not be adjusting your pace to theirs, add them to ignore... and I don't mean typing "Ignored!" in party chat then not actually adding them to your ignore list... add them to your list and say nothing else to them. This will also help ensure you do not unknowingly invite them to runs in the future.
---
Unsure about a pull or directions? Ask the group to help you. I've had other group members actually take lead on marking mobs and directing us through an entire dungeon.
---
Someone bitches about your AoE aggro? Explain to them the limitations of your class. Don't ignore advice, but as long as you are confident in your understanding of the situation, tell them.
---
Group wants to skip mobs you aren't comfortable skipping? Tell them you aren't comfortable skipping them...
---
Someone is just a completely unreasonable jackass? Boot them or drop group/offer to reform with competent group members. The trump card of being a desirable class is they need you more than you need them.
---
I have maybe 5 people on ignore from the ~2ish months I've played, puging dungeons all the way to 60. Communication and ignore list are key to easy tank life.
---
I’m a resto Druid and I’m consistently in the top 4 in healing for MC fights (outside of the 2-3 I need to decurse). First things first, druids are extremely gear dependent, I’m able to achieve my numbers because I finally got all my pieces to drop and am at 585 bonus healing. 
---
Tips, rejuv is only for tanks and maybe warlocks. Rank 3 healing touch for raid healing. Maybe regrowth on tanks if needed, I very rarely use regrowth in raids as that spec isn’t viable yet. (Due to mana pool). 
---
Either way healing is all about being proactive, instead of reactive. Especially for a Druid! You know dps is about to take damage, toss a preemptive hot. You’re doing onyxia and flame breath is 5 seconds away, at 1 sec start casting your heal so you time it with the cast.
---
Duels are part of these exceptional situationas.
---
Arena master against warrior to rage starve him.
---
Luffa to make rogue use rupture vs defstance + shieldy then cleanse it.
---
Reflect trinkets are self explanatory.
---
Heart of Noxxion to get rid of a rogue poison.
---
Ancient Corner Stone Grimoire + Barov Servant Caller as any class to have a skeleton hit +3 adds on the spellcaster.
---
etc. etc.
---
Pretty much each and every use item has some kind of purpose in duels that you can great effect from.
---
Used to happen all the time, freaked me out the first time.  Yea as others have said just give it a few.
---
I don't feel that I "have" to have it, obviously it is easily obtainable which is nice. Any recommendations for anything better around 48-50
---
&gt;Savory Deviate Delights
---
Free \_\_\_\_\_ that are broadcasted I wouldn't expect a tip. But I've always tipped people that I asked out of the blue.  i.e. tipping random mage who was willing to trade me water/food when he wasn't first offering.
---
My experience as well. Leveling I found myself DPSing in dungeons more than healing, kept telling myself it will change at 60... but nope, healers are everywhere. Judging from LFG chat on Blammo, it is easier to get dungeon groups as DPS than as a healer. 
---
I mean, I love the class - but if you can’t do anything outside of instance groups, and you can’t find instance groups because healers are everywhere, it makes me wish I had rolled something else so I could actually play the game in the time I have to play it.
---
For raids the fights are pretty long so you can reliable get a few procs
---
Killing mythic nythendra 1st pull as a surrender spriest....my surrender bugged out. I was unkillable by stacks kept coming. I just kept getting faster and faster. My guild died...I just kept dosing until she died.
---
With priest tier 1 literally ONE piece of gear is an actual upgrade over stuff you get outside raiding, it's really whack
---
For sure, my 2H generates loads, I just did not know if anything better was out there around 48-50
---
Because Warriors get Taunt and Druids get Growl. Even Paladins don't have a taunt in classic. They did not want everything to be the same
---
I think thats what im going to do. Ill do the SM axe quest and when im higher lvl ill do the quest just for the classic experience haha. If i get Bonebiter before 39 ill just auction Witchfury. Thanks!!
---
By the time you hit the seven, you better have wipe-insurance or you're done.
---
While you have a point, the obvious issue then becomes "What changes are acceptable?". Having never played WoW before, I don't quite know the history of changes that everyone seems to dislike (i.e., flying), so I'm not familiar with what changes would be acceptable. But I think a middle of the road solution would be to implement QoL changes in polls. I know this ties back into the Classic+ vs Classic TBC debate, but I'd actually propose adding some of these in to later phases of Classic through content/QoL polls. It's obviously way too soon to add anything unplanned in Phase 2 (and we don't know, maybe they ARE planning on adding this in Phase 2), but I think a Phase 3/4 release date is both possible and still helpful to the community. 
---
Just my two cents, I can see where both sides are coming from, but I think like most issues, the optimal answer lies somewhere in the middle.
---
Well if the tank hasn't hit them it is... The healer is almost certainly #2 threat.
---
I didn’t even think of this but it got a laugh out of me. Most people ive run with will mark the casters as first to kill in a pull, but occasionally I’ll be in a group that won’t, and I’m in the back getting pummeled ever slowly by shadow bolts while trying to keep everyone else up like “guys.... guys.....  Guys.”
---
I know what you mean, my main is a 47 war tank and I've experienced a lot of what you're saying here. I kinda wish we could not call is dps and instead call it tactical assault or something. There should be more to these rolls than simply doing dps and I think dps meters are kinda stupid if that is all someone is evaluating. Interrupts and CC are important as well as situational decurses/dispels. I sometimes get questioned for why I'm not a frost mage (on my alt) but I like arcane and I actually have low threat with good damage. 
---
It's a shame that many people who play this game are short sighted and use damage meters as the only measurement of this role. If a unit has a powerful spell they are about to hit the tank with there's not much motivation to throw out a interupt if people are constantly posting damage meters and bragging about how they are doing better than everyone else. It creates a stupid competition that will have these roles ignoring other duties the role should be doing. I personally don't care about that and just try to be the most effective group member I can be but many do focus too heavily on it and don't notice the strain it may be causing on the other party members.
---
I think people should play all the roles so that they can have a better understanding of  each role and be a better group member as a consequence of that.
---
Option 2.5: Release BC and Wraith slowly but keep each expansion server separate.  Allow players to copy a character to the next expansion server.  This will require some server merges to keep healthy populations as the player base fractures but lets people play whichever version of wow they prefer.
---
It took me around 30+ times for the wand to drop
---
But Gnomer isn't really necessary for Horde. They have plenty of easier lateral content. SM is kind of required for Alliance after level 33 unless you want to just not do dungeons until the 40's IMO.
---
Thanks for the info, I’ll look into it!
---
Not sure if troll or just ignorant of economics. The market sets the price and tolerance levels for bullshit. Period.
---
Well thats probably the most objective and thoughtful answer i got so far, thank you. i will give 120 a shot, leveling in BfA seems very fast anyways. And then wait for Blizzcon etc.
---
Which game will get the most attention from developers in your opinion?
---
This was great, I love the editing.
---
thats dumb, im not looking for a group....
---
&gt;Here, maybe a downvote will help you understand
---
Found a #nochanges groupie.
---
There are minimal tank swaps in classic so taunt isn't required for the most part, mana potions/dark runes (not to mention seal/judge wisdom) exist and shield block is reliable enough. I've MT'd multiple bosses in MC and it's just fine. If people can wait for 5 sunders then they can wait for JotC/BoK (or even a consecrate as a OK DPS GO signal).
---
As for gearing, go for defense/str/stam, basically gear like a warrior tank. 
---
It's not impossible, or even very hard. It's just different.
---
They’d have to have another independent team. It wouldn’t necessarily be the “same guys as retail” as they have enough on their plate.
---
And as Alliance you have...Tanaris and dungeons. The difference in options between horde and alliance for that level range is shocking.
---
I haven't tested it, but probably not.  Effects like this typically are not affected by bonus damage or healing.
---
Not sure if it was a glitch or just luck, but I was pugging AQ in Wrath as a 40 man for fun(for the cool mounts and maybe achievements), and on 8 consecutive rolls I rolled 100. Unfortunately they were on useless scarab pieces that half the raid passed on, but I somehow just 100’d 8 times in a row for everything I greeded on. I got called a hacker, and pretty sure I thought I was
---
I honestly don't know. I don't think I've tried to do that before.
---
I thought you were saying 3 = 500 I gotchya now. And yeah I mentioned the arcanite for the elementium bars lol
---
I believe the minimum level to start the quest is 34, you can do it at 34 but you will need a group most likely to do it. Once you do the first quest you have to talk to someone in SW, then you get the quest for SM which gives you the axe
---
&gt;started to crit for like 500,000 each time
---
People would still ask you to heal most likely :/
---
Source: spriest always forced to heal even though I'm top dps in every god damn dungeon I join :(
---
For me at the beginning it did not. Anecdotally I'd see 4 horde for every alliance at the least.
---
Reportable but blizz never takes action. See the same people doing it for weeks and weeks. All local chat talks about is everyone reporting them...but nothing ever happens
---
That doesn't answer the question about Blessed Recovery.  Most of those effects don't benefit from spell power.
---
Its a meme for all these scrubs trying to use the spec cause its "cool" and "fun" without understanding why you go this spec.
---
Took me around 65......
---
I have characters one two different pvp servers, i got ganked exactly once in stv and I usually go their at 35.
---
Desperate prayer is so nice, it's like a mini lay on hands. My brother leveled a priest and that ability saved his life so many times along the way.
---
I’m farming the herb above Tarren Mill (for Frost Oil)
---
My question is: Whats the deal with these? I swear I was in that zone for almost two hours and I only got 4 of em. I didn’t see anyone else (at least no one grabbing herbs) but Gatherer shows tons of spawns for it. The spawns shown are ~99% accurate so far (in all zones) so I’m wondering what up. DB says 30m spawn timer on them, so I assumed I would get more than 2 herbs an hour.
---
I saw maybe 2-3 people (grey/green) and they were farming yeti/ogres. Didn’t seem to be gathering herbs. Spy didn’t show anyone on enemy faction gathering either.
---

“When you queue for a group as a tank, people get upset when you roll on DPS gear. 2.5% of the population is going to tank, and they already have an in with their guild-master. Tanking is easy as fuck, but I’m not going to waste my time doing unproductive tasks for your benefit.”
---
This thread has restored my faith in the internet today.

Honestly having more fun PMing people. I dont like the shouting out into the void thing if I can avoid it. 
---
Rather /who and hand pick a team. I find it is more entertaining then shouting into the void, I get some what of an idea of what my team looks like and it has overall worked out fairly well
---
Thanks for clarification. I have some knowledge about pally healer and agree on crit chance, it's very good for healadin
---
thats the one! theyre multi purpose and help you score night elf chicks
---
*stares at his 375 run counter*
---
Oh no...
---
Depends on lvl. When I lvled arms, Berserker rage + charge + Sweeping strikes + WW with a 2hander and then switch defensive was plenty threat. But that's not available till 36.
---
Probably a mod
---
Perd core hound dagger rogue by heart here. I out dps vis kag / bruta rogue.
---
Late bwl and All of AQ i do more dmg than sword on singletarget with SoF spec.
---
Its good for our sanity.
---
I assume you’re newish (at least to Paladin), so sorry for poking fun at you. I had just thought it was a kinda odd statement to make without saying anything after.
---
I would say this. If you can get over visual appeal classic is all around more enjoyable for solo play, however if you want to raid with less commitment I recommend BfA as you can LFR not needing to be a part of a community and get welfare epics. If you expect to get any T1 items in vanilla you're gonna need to be a part of a raiding guild and for hunters spots can be tough
---
If you can't understand that humans all enjoy different things to different extents.. Then just take this big ol fat L and be on your way.
---
be gnome.  Sit down in pumpkin. well.... ok, so that doesn't remove threat, but it does effectively make you less visible.
---
FYI, invis potion can only be used out of combat.
---
Yea it's not ideal, but we have other stuff others don't.
---
because the issue isn't the spec and shows how lacking your knowledge of warriors is
---
fury with a shield doesn't have any less mitigation than deep prot; then again the warrior should just dual wield as long as he's properly geared for tanking
---
Mostly XP, for me anyway. Quests are getting pretty thin, so grinding in spots like this with easy to kill mobs is pretty much where I get most of my leveling done when I have downtime at work.
---
"This 1 guy should farm for hours so I don't have to have my hearth set in kargath" = not the good look. I get some people issues and might have wasted a hearth or logged in late, but thats not what op or the commenter was referring to.
---
&gt; The correct answer is yes.
---
Not exactly.  The correct answer is that things are indeed easier due to changes in itemization and talents, but those changes are ones that always existed in Patch 1.12, and patch 1.12 was not the TBC pre-patch or any sort of TBC transition patch, it was solidly a Vanilla WoW patch.  So, yes, things are easier, but TBC has nothing to do with it.
---
Also, OP asked if mobs had been scaled down as of 1.12, which they have *not* been, at least not as a whole.  Obviously some nerfs and bug fixes were applied here and there as part of the normal patch lifecycle.
---
I got my Master of Arms on my mage this way. Killing rats with my staff, sword, fists in 2007
---
I am not basing this on wowhead.  The warlock discord has some pretty comprehensive sim data and you can input your own variables, and I am basing my conclusion on that, but also some of my personal experience trying different gear.
---
What I think you dont understand is how little value they provide at the expense of spellpower.
---
For example, a 90 second encounter with my current gear puts crit worth 11.75 sp, hit is 11.79, int is 0.21 sp.  When I start enabling world buffs, crit and int start going down and hit starts going up a bit.
---
So, you need 5 int to gain the equivalent of 1sp.  4 sp needs 20 int to come out roughly even.
---
What I think people dont realize is that SP affects lifetaps on top of damage from abilities, and the fewer GCDs you spend tapping the better.  Int and stam are worthwhile and decent to have, but not at the expense of a more valuable amount of SP.  The fact that bosses die so fast further improves the SP value, because you will spend even less GCD on tapping and more on damage for the already limited amount of time you have available to do anything.
---
In all fairness, I did say the t1 pants are pretty close, and they really are.  Skyshroud is still better, though, until t2.
---
I think that if you say it's "incredibly flawed" just because its what wowhead says is disingenuous and ignores the real work people have put in on other platforms to sim this data.  Once you start raiding and try out some of your more well rounded gear, you'll notice pretty quickly how much worse you are actually doing.  You can also go compare parses, and you will find that the warlocks outperforming you are gearing appropriately.
---
Minimum of +5 weapon skill (305) is basically required, due to the enormous benefits it grants you. The weapon skill bonus caps out at +8, with about a 3% white dps difference between 5 and 8.
---
Hitcap: With 2hander you need 9% hitcap with 300 weaponskill, and 6% with +5 or higher weaponskill. Yes you gain 3% hit from going from 300 to 305, which is just one of the gigantic bonuses you gain from +5 weaponskill. Anything above the cap gives you absolutely nothing.
---
Did you read my comment? That's literally what the point of my comment was.
---
Stonetalon is supposed to be the 'equivalent' because Stonetalon and Redridge are the two zones in the game that start at level 15. (and both also have quests around level 23). They've always been equivalents of each other.
---
Hence, since the Horde have no quests in Redridge but the Alliance have Q's in stonetalon, the Alliance are actually at an advantage.
---
9% with a 2H, 6% with a Obsidian edge blade.
---
I mean you want to get real technical most end game content for ph 1-4 is heavily horde located. Like bwl&amp;mc, brs, brd are all located in the horde capital city orc rock mountain
---
if they rehired old ppl it would be massive hype
---
but the management at blizz are asshoe's and they fired a lot of ppl right after launch because "theyre a real company now"
---
No screenshot?
---
Dude.. Can't imagine that many ubrs runs. I'd be dead inside after that many, lol
---
It's 21,000 rep from Revered to Exalted. At 50 rep per turn-in, that's 420 stacks. Not 800.
---
Thanks. So far all my addons are from curse forge but auctionator still isnt working. Ill mess around tonight. Good to know i have the right files from the right place at least.
---
 Thank you
---
Yeah I just give em a friendly "Hello, (sorry to intrude / bug you / whatever ) but would you be intersted in Xing Y dungeon with us?" 
---
and send that to any applicable role I need - usually get a few bites. Have gotten a few PM's my self looking for resto shammys always feels nice
---
Or some sort of bovine reference like moo
---
I dont know
---
It's definitely not a 20% chance for the boss to spawn. 
---
I'm at 375 runs and he's much closer to an 8% chance to spawn, much lower than the other bosses.
---
Yeah I get you.  Sometimes I feel really weird because I'm the only one talking in /p.  I can understand it not being for everyone, but I love tanking and I'm swimming in nostalgia with Classic.
---
If you have 300 fishing and use the +100 lure and go to the secret pond behind Ravenholt Manor after talking to Nat Pagle with a Quintessence in your pack you have a 0.1% chance of fishing it up.
---
The sixth item in your backpack should be a candy for this to work.
---
boomer spotted
---
Yeah, lots of orcs are just not buying Edgemasters, which is silly imo.
---
Wpns do not drop like BFA, they are not candy. They are rare. If youre in a guild with 8 fury warriors, the odds of you getting 2x Onyxia axes are LOW. 
---
But by having a pair of edgemasters, you can all of a sudden have 1x / 1x blade or dagger etc and preform just as well.
---
Yeah from booty bay. It's quicker to get to gnomer for horde than alliance
---
I think what you're looking for is called "viewport" but it appears to be restricted since 8.2.  Yes, this is classic, but they're probably kind of similar in that way.
---
Thank you!!
---
kind of a funny troll though XD
---
I've come across too many priests that pull themselves because I'm too "slow" .....on a whole different level, I swear.
---
Yes I'm aware.  Unfortunately I'm somewhat of a completion so I feel obligated to grind for the quiver although its such a minor upgrade.  Plus, it's quests like this that bring class identity! 
---
I'll be working on tribute runs this weekend now that I know about the spec :)  Really appreciate your work!
---
Warrior tank here and don't regret it.  Being able to start a group and go wherever I want and run my guildies through dungeons is great.  It does wear on me though.  Couple hours in a dungeon fighting for agro can be tiring.  I was fortunate to have friends to help me quest 10-20 when it was really rough.
---
They just point you to the item retrieval tool, which only tracks the last couple weeks and I don't think it lists green items. I tried getting a blue ring restored via ticket and they told me if it's not on the list tough luck. Maybe if you're more persistent with ticket it would work, idk.
---
Yeah I also report the few that I saw so far. But can you tell me why I should Make a screenshot? Is it still a common thing to "thread" someone with " I SENT IT TO COMPANY X YOU GET BANNED CAUSE MY UNCEL WORKS THERE!"
---
Reports HELL YES! Making a video about it or just a screenshot, nah why should I?
---

---
It's one of those things that is not smart to do. It's just bad mechanics. Because your friend can compensate for it doesn't make it a good idea. And try doing this with a random scrub tank and you will realize why it's a bad idea quickly. Also when using LoS to pull, I can't touch the mobs until they all funnel to the spot I'm at. One or two ticks and you are not only tanking everything, but if you aren't hiding behind Los too all the casters stop to cast on you. Which breaks the pull up even more. All in all it's just bad classic gameplay. On my warrior I click it off. On my priest i never do it. This is all big multi pulls btw. It's not a huge deal on single pulls unless the tank misses and or gets dodged a few attacks.
---
It hurts.
---
I was farming HoJ (so I could focus on arena only) and a warrior joined the group to dps. He asked if he could roll on Chain if he would pass on HOJ for me. I said yes, because obviously the chain won't drop.
---
It dropped. I had to pass cause I'd promised to in exchange for HoJ.
---
That's the problem, right? Either you know you want, and you don't get what you want... Or you get what you want, and then you don't know what you want
---
What changed after 30? Are you combat with swords?
---
My favorite is when a rare pattern drops and there’s always someone who says “I need that because I’m an alchemist, tailor, etc etc”. And everyone else is expected to pass or greed.  Next thing you know that pat is up in the AH.
---
You get it. I'm not on Skeram but I am on a server that favors Horde in terms of raw numbers. People don't get that being at a number disadvantage is an overall advantage when it comes to phase 2 PvP ranking.
---
Also not its intended usage, so expect it to get fixed.
---
You think BOTH going to the GM is fine?
---
I'm fine with one or the other.  But the GM taking both is definitely a step above normal greed.
---
Missing the tinket you can damage yourself with for speed increase to suicide and save repair gold.
---
This is completely true and that’s why I’m trying to level fast using my hunter rather than my warrior :)
---
Nice strawman. No one is asking why there is a shortage of tanks. Everyone knows why. It's the same reason ther has always been a shortage in the history of every mmo ever. You aren't saying anything of relevance or providing any useful information.
---
It's like you're mortal striking yourself. Smart.
---
We have a pretty well geared enhanced shammy in our guild. He got spinal reaper last week. His Dps is still shit, but I would hate to run into him in pvp
---
The thing with the "RUSH RUSH SPEEDRUN RUSH" people is that they don't understand that the 10-15 seconds of aggro saves them so much more time than the BS they do like AOEing the CCd mobs...
---
Install the twitch app on your PC.
---
Go to "MODS" section, select wow-classic file location.
---
Search in a list for all working classic addons.
---
Click install on ELVui... --&gt; succes!
---
At least when you  get aggro as pala - you rarely lose it. As a warrior, it\`s a huge problem to hold aggro on multiple threats (BRD, I\`m looking at you!)
---
The attack that crits would be the incoming attack from a mob or another player.
---
Fury/Prot  is absolutely fine if the tank is geared appropriately. 
---
Any issues a group/raid has, is do too bad players or mechanical mistakes, not a Fury/Prot spec tank.
---
Guilds were getting pre submerge kills on Rag in greens and several sub 60s in raid. Nothing in phase 1 requires deep Prot.
---
I just call it like I see it
---
EU server's must be listed differently, because in the list I see language is not listed. Is the server labeled German only?
---
&gt; What are you comparing T1 to here?
---
The standard healing priest BIS list i.e.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-gear-bis-classic-wow#pre-raid-best-in-slot-gear-for-healing-priests-phase-1
---
In comparison, T1 has less overall healing, less int, AND less stam.
---
Unless you're just spamming Prayer of Healing in pvp, T1 isn't a very good choice aside from 3 - 4 pieces.
---
It's an okayish set but when you look at how difficult it is to get compared to standard preraid bis and the fact that it has less overall stats, FULL T1 is a pretty poor choice.
---
Assuming you're talking about raiding and your tank is stacking sunders: 
---
* Keep up Battle Shout.
---
* Skill priority is Execute &gt; Bloodthirst &gt; Whirlwind. Make sure you have enough rage to cast all of these on cooldown before you spend it on Heroic Strike or Hamstring.
---
* If you have spare GCDs and rage (i.e don't spend the rage now if it'll delay the higher priority abilities above) you can use Hamstring to fish for weapon/flurry/windfury procs. 
---
* If you're going to cap on rage queue Heroic Strike. You can use Cleave instead if the bonus threat from HS is an issue.
---
Also your rogue would have to get a weapon chain on his weapon, because the tree form of endboss can disarm back to back for 10+ seconds of disarm. If he pops tree twice and disarms for 20seconds you can kiss the healer mana goodbye as your DPS will be crippled and you won't be able to burst the boss before the healer runs oom.
---
Pve servers exist
---
Lotus = 25g  
---
Crystal = 50-60g  
---
Pearl = 30g
---
First of all, at least some form of reasoning would be nice.
---
I started in October and got level 38 with not that much of an effort, while leveling multiple other characters. I guess reaching level 60  should be doable until then, if i really want.
---
I got mine on my first UBRS. some priest was shouting about Jed runs i joined and he dropped it when we killed it and i won. Good times.
---
So in cata and mop I played a rogue for the majority, but started to play shaman towards the end and found it much more fun, when classic came out I insta rolled a rogue out of habit and was level 45 when I remembered how much more I preferred shaman, so now I have a 60 rogue and 42 shaman, it sucks leveling all over again but I'm having fun with the different gameplay and excited to start farming bis items for my shaman
---
&gt;lvl 53 in mc taking whatever he feels like worth
---
I feel like i need to defend him here, because the entire point of that raid is to gear his warlock. Everyone that participates knows that full well before they join. He also purposefully takes a lot of people that have never done MC so he can teach them.
---
Is this true even with 60% mount?
---
I don't understand why people play on a PVP server if they're not fully prepared to deal with this. If you have a busy life and don't have time to be camped and ganked, choose a PVE server and maximize your playtime in the most productive way possible. Otherwise, understand that you're are the opposing faction's enemy and fair fights don't have to matter.
---
Yes, it's shitty and yes griefing is an asshole thing to do. But it's part of playing on a PVP server, which no one is forcing you to do.
---
Tanaris and Searing Gorge are equivalent between factions. Hinterlands has \~30 horde quests and \~5 allliance ones. Feralas is okay for both, but Horde have a convenient town and more quests, while alliance have to take a boat to get back and forth from their town on the very edge. Felwood and Azshara are fairly comparable between factions, but neither have that many quests, much less a good questing experience.  Essentially, every zone in this level range is either identical for both factions, or horde has an advantage.
---
I skipped it completely, but quests are 48-50 according to my Questie.
---
I mean, the mechanic *is* "Rage"...
---
But how would finishing unfinished quest lines which were later filled out in later patches affect the experience?
---
&lt;Enchanted by Meesta&gt;
---
You pretend that nobody can tank if they aren't specced to tank or heal if they aren't specced to heal.  You complain that people that aren't specced correctly absolutely have to be trash at what they do when it's absolutely trivial to fulfill your role well while not specced for it.  You are objectively wrong.
---
Good day.
---
A rogue in our guild was running brd for the first time and a warrior asked if he would pass on hoj and the warrior would pass on the sword. Poor guy didn't know and agreed. Hoj dropped and he passed and had to run over 70 times at 60 to get it to drop again!
---
Yes I used to run this combo all day on nd. I actually preferred running with a rogue as opposed to a warrior because he could pop evasion when the last boss went wolf form to mitigate all the dmg.
---
Just sharing my excitement about my fastest leveling I’ve ever done. To be fair, I was rested for level 13 and 14 because I was out of town. Other than that I play for 3-6 hours a day pretty much every day so there isn’t much time to get rested exp. I created this toon about 2 weeks ago. 
---
Thanks for telling me I’m so cool though, I appreciate it ;)
---
Crush Gnomes into the ground, of course
---
 https://theunderminejournal.com/
---
To add: What is the plan with classic and its development? Will it stop at phase six and everyone will in the end be same good geared or will it continue somehow in the footsteps of now called "retail"? That makes me worried alot when I think of spending time on classic.
---
I'd say all hardcore players have a variant of that. At high levels of play it's necessary to keep track of your next energy/mana tick, this frame just does it for you so you don't have to keep the 2sec tick in your head.
---
Lol did you edit your post to give it +4 shadow dmg?
---
I'm a resto druid. The best and most geared healer in my guild is a paladin. Should I be innervating him or is innervate that much better for priests?
---
Been clearing MC nearly since release, and 100% there is, atleast on my server.
---
Level 30 was a mix between beginning STV and the shimmering flats and a little hillsbrad foothills I believe.
---
Make a compilation of waiting in queue
---
I'd probably go with double engineering so you could be gnomish and goblin at the same time and be able to craft/use everything.
---
You're welcome to not sell your services, other do. Don't judge
---
Classic is based off the retail client. /combatlog will generate a text file that you can dig through, and upload to sites like [classic warcraftlogs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/) to parse for raids.
---
You said warlock DM:E solo route with dot kiting was a new thing, I just showed you someone doing it on a pserver. Admit that you're wrong.
---
&gt;play an alt
---
Ah I see, that makes sense
---
Thanks! 
---
Didn't see this, would have been a better place to post
---
Is there a good Threat guide for tanking? I'm interested in the TPS a warrior raid tanking would generate against a boss.
---
Classic has a lot to do, if you find yourself with nothing to do 2 months after release you spend too much of your time playing video and need to go outside more.
---
Big thanks for all the tanks grinding this and making it easy to get a group for sash drops. :P
---
It’s so much faster. I quested basically until I hit SM then spammed SM til about 41, did quests here and there and then started healing ZF after 41 (I wouldn’t recommend tanking it until at least 44-45). 
---
I started leveling a rogue so I’ve been banking tested exp on my pally and running ZF every few days when I’m up for it. I plan on doing this til 60 as I level my rogue
---
To find SM Groups, you need to form them at the instance by going into there and spamming in general. That’s how you get fast groups for SM as alliance
---
They have to delete the character. Their subscription can go out, you still aren't going to get the name. It's theirs forever.
---
That dress and the tabard.. just perfect
---
Why would you need that?  You can end yourself with hellfire.
---
Is the server listed as German speaking only?
---
I mean they guys fucking rude af, but there's some logic to the advice.
---
If it's a clearly labeled German speaking server then I'm not sure why you're rolling on one. Communication is kinda important. Unless you know German?
---
Hmm, i honestly didn't know that. Well thats a big Argument for BfA, at least in my case. I will probably play both and wait until Blizzcon. And maybe your right about finding a community in either game.
---
Thanks a lot, have a nice day.
---
Now you can play the game.
---
Sure. I love it on my Hunter in combination with Cheetah to escape mobs. But I think Hardiness and Will are both better PvP racials and Berserking is generally good for PvE. Endurance mostly just seems ok on tanks.
---
That's just https://www.bootybaygazette.com/ with extra steps
---
Yes, I’ve now taken your raid spot because I blew you away on the meters.  Oh wait jokes on me, you don’t have a raid spot!
---
Most of those areas are trash for alliance. Horde they are great, but for Alliance Feralas, Hinterlands, and Azshara are terrible zones. STV comes with ganking, which both sides experience, but there are more horde on every pvp server so for Alliance it's probably a bit worse. Felwood I cant comment on, I have never been there to quest as Alliance.
---
To add further confusion later, aren't ZG and AQ20 on 3 day resets?
---
Lol Matt, its leeloo
---
Server?
---
I use macros to get the best of both worlds. Switching to def stance puts on the old sword and board, battle and zerker use a 2-hander. The primary stance is battle unless things start getting hairy. I have very little threat issues unless someone is doing something stupid, and even then its usually cause someone fat fingered the wrong skill at the wrong time.
---
I was afk following my roomate (mage) and instead of taking the elevator, he just slow-falled to the bottom, and told me to enjoy the walk back to my corpse.
---
Source? I used icyveins but it is possible it was only on pservers. As such, would you have a classic ressource?
---
What's the addon that adds a sell all greys button?
---
I have 2 words: pickpocket BRD
---
Most BiS lists are for 60 pre raid and post raid. There are lists for BiS 2H leveling weapons but I can't find one for tanking weapons, I will check now
---
Why are dwarves specific in this?
---
Someone else just said that on classic HoTs placed out of combat don't generate threat, whereas they do on private servers..... so now I don't know what to believe.
---
All I know is I've been doing this kind of thing with many different tanks while leveling, and only avoiding it with large mob packs or yeah if there's an LoS pull. It has allowed me to keep the group moving fast (and keep my mana up) and we have yet to wipe from it, so idk.
---
You dont have to position the last satyr behind the pillar at all. The imps are the trigger for plants to add (as you mentioned).The satyr has no plant trigger implemented. You can just tank him with your back to the crumbling wall and backpaddle into the cave once the wall crumbles.
---
Only the priest healer has to get to an LoS position like the pillar.
---
Got it on my second run of brd ever with my enhancement sham, stole it from the hands of a furry warr
---
the horde version of the ony attune you change to a dragonkin to talk to emberstrife. If someone kills him while  getting ubrs key you sit there and wait. Generally the people killing ember will alow some people to get their ony portion if they see them waiting. Otherwise you have to sit and wait out the respawn.
---
Personally i understand why you rolled. 
---
You proberly encountered groups in your MS that already had the items they need for their MS. So they let you roll for your OS. 
---
This particular group needed this item for MS and were in the spec that needed it. 
---
You might needed it for MS to, but weren't in that spec at the time. 
---
So i also can understand why they might feel cucked out their loot.
---
Atleast you can actually use it, and in 2 levels everyone will have new upgrades and all will be forgotten.
---
As a warrior tank, what am I meant to do during the ZF stair event?
---
I can’t copy/paste my UI profile here, for those asking, due to character limit. But mine is largely based on Preach’s UI setup. I’m not sure when he last updated his UI in a video, but you may be able to find it on his YouTube channel.     
---
[Preach Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/user/mikepreachwow)     
---
     
---
Edit: Also wanted to mention that importing works from retail profiles, I did it with mine.
---
My sleep schedule is out of control. I feel Undead.
---
Ha, I always make sure to hit the X on any drop like that. 
---
Also, why are need/greed buttons so close?  Serious UI fail.
---
Not always, if you are oom and low health.
---
Diiiiice! 👌
---
Past events do not affect future outcomes.
---
In my experience druid tank snap threat is unmatched, and their armour mitigation makes them great dungeon tanks. I'm not convinced about raid tanks yet but they are OK in MC.
---
Enjoy being mediocre I guess?
---
When you gouge macro, it’s usually because you are low and need hp badly to survive. If your gouge is parried you are prolly gonna die or need to use CD to survive. If you gouge successfully, the macro will get you 1-2 extra tics of bandage, which could be life or death.
---
I’ll stick with my macro lol
---
Too many stupid DPS make tanking more difficult than it has to be. And I've recently been liking signing up as DPS as arms because I'm usually doing the most damage, making the runs go quicker. 😀
---
Highlights only, if you want more in depth info, or sources reply and I'll supply it. On mobile.
---
You can't parry attacks from behind you.
---
Green mobs /quests are ideal for exp/hour. (Secretly the most impactful thing in this entire post.)
---
Combat specialization.
---
Don't plan the use of defensive cooldown, they are for emergencies only.
---
Blade flurry allows you to turn a fatal over pull into nothing special. Adrenaline rush and thistle tea do as well.
---
Improved gouge is a must, and let's gouge last for 5.5 out of the 6 seconds a bandage takes.
---
Always carry the best bandages for your level.
---
Engineering is great.
---
Pick pocket. A lot. Potions are great to have. I get so many I vendor them regularly just for inventory management.
---
Your main hand weapon is your most important gear upgrade.
---
Swords are amazing, and don't require points into sword spec to be fantastic. Take those points if you want them though. By not taking them you can use w/e you want in your off hand, and can use whatever is best at the time for your main hand.
---
Amazing swords from quest rewards:
---
Wailing caverns has one that you can get the quest for at 10, but probably need to be around 18 or 19 to get into a good WC group.
---
Btackfathom deeps has a quest if you are a horde that is available at 21, though you probably want to be 24 to do the instance (can stealth to the quest location and solo - it's a 28 elite mini boss that can root you underwater. Don't drown).
---
Scarlet Monostary has a sword quest reward that is great as well.
---
Mara has the thrash blade as a quest reward.
---
Ninja edit: stay well away from daggers in the main hand if you have never leveled a rogue before. Only exception is when it's an undisputed upgrade, but that means you've missed other upgrades along the way or are absurdly lucky with world drops.
---
Seems pretty close still.
---
Unforgiven+strongholds = 24 stamina, 1% parry
---
Lionhearts+grips = 40 strength, 396 armor
---
Also if you want T2 helmet for massive stam, gloves are in clear lead.

Maybe I've retained a lot of how we treated dps back in Vanilla but the basically mentality was - you pull aggro, you tank it. I do the same thing with DPS in Classic (same as I did in Vanilla).  If you pull aggro and die, you only have yourself to blame. My only real job is to get us through the dungeon and keep mobs off of the healer.  
---
Regarding healers, I will tell them that I will pull until they tell me to stop for mana. This moves the onus from me to them. If they're under 30-35% I'll ask, otherwise I keep going. Communication and Situational awareness are key as a tank.
---
My biggest complaints:
---
* Hunters that open with multishot when you pull / charge in
---
* Mages that open with blizzard
---
* Mages/warlocks that think a regular group is a spellcleave group
---
Once they get a death or two under their belt, they tend to chill out and let me do my job. Once you develop a good synergy though with the group, the run tends to go quick and smooth!
---
Sure thing.
---
First steps:
---
1. From your main, ask in guild for someone to invite you and your alt to a party.
---
2. Log onto your alt, get invited to the same party.  
---
3. Ask for your alt to be promoted to leader.
---
Dungeon loop
---
1. Finish your dungeon run on your main
---
2. Logout or \`/camp\`, which is a shortcut for logging out.  Wait the 20 seconds to get punted to character select.
---
3. Log onto your alt, which should still be in the same party with your main, but won't be group lead.
---
4. Wait \~2 minutes, and your alt should automatically get promoted to group lead (provided your main and alt are the only characters in the party).
---
5. "Reset All Instances" by right clicking on the alt's portrait.
---
6. Re-log onto your main - you'll have been teleported to the dungeon entrance.
---
7. Repeat 1-6.

the economies are shit on my server, people are just installing auctioneer addons without even tweaking the settings and auto undercutting by more than 75% of the orig cost.
---
whats worse is that with my population so low as well anyone at 60 between say now and a month from now will have a distinct gold advantage over anyone looking to raid pre phase 2-3
---
anyone looking to make gold after hitting 60 in the next phases will have a hard time, which is a shame to the players that only play so long. at least on my server.
---
lotus: 10-17g
---
crystals 20-33g
---
pearls 4-8g
---
thats how bad it is. there are no lvl 60s to re-auction items people sell, and nobody running markets. and if you try? you are met with defeat. and the cycle will continue. 
---
its so bad i want to change servers because of it.
---
Right...  because I, and arms spec warrior that can easily tank any dungeon with no special gear or tank spec, care about people being upset when I roll for gear that I will use? U for real?
---
None of your comment makes any sense. Warrior = potential tank, unless a whiny bitch. Spec doesn’t matter. Gear doesn’t matter. Guild politics and relationships don’t matter.
---
If you don’t want to tank for whatever lame excuse you have, that’s on you. Enjoy waiting on groups as this is apparently *not* “a waste of your time”.
---
Do any of you have text/message macros that say stuff along the lines of "hi ill be ur tank today, my casual rules are supposed h n such and I'd prefer if we could do this n that and let's have a safe, smooth run" or anything at all like this ??
---
No problem! That's the best place for discussion about the topic! We're still probably 2 years away from phase 6 so best to talk it out there!
---
if a tank cant out-threat a renew, that's their problem. don't PW:S them though!
---
You're wrong about tanks having to go out of their way to expect basic amounts of respect but you are right about the power thing. I lead partys exclusively now so I can kick the people who never learned manners from their parents. Want to go faster? Let me know and we can discuss a middle ground. Otherwise, get kicked.
---
People don't seem to understand they're playing with real people which inherently means they're not going to get everything done "exactly" how they want it done. People have feelings and if you ignore them because it's WoW you're still an inconsiderate asshole. 
---
Honestly, if you're playing this game for anything but the social experience...why? Go play Mass Effect: better graphics, story, game play and you can even customize your various party members down to individual stat points.
---
About the gear thing: There is no guarantee that TBC and WotLK will be released again... So don't base your decision on that.
---
I also said this, but I guess reading isn't your strong suit?
---
'everyone whose better at this game than me is a sociopath for deriving enjoyment from their win'
---
Got mine from a random dude at level 16, I play a female hunter NE.
---
Check [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) out.  Thrash isn't on it at all, as there are better options at 60, but it's probably pretty good for BRD and such.  Thrash's big brother, Ironfoe, is on there though.
---
We have setup a time.
---
What leve can I use bandages?
---
my first toon was a druid.  
---
On my first runthrough of BRd I got HoJ. "dang this is a nice trinket it will definitely help my cat dps".  
---
Fast forward 1 week. Still unaware of the legendary item I posses. I reroll a hunter. I get him to level 55. I start doing BRD runs. I look at my BiS list and see the trinket. 5% drop chance from boss far in the dungeon? Damn. Not even worth trying.   
---
I log back into my druid after 2 weeks of powerleveling my hunter. I check my gear. Nice nice, some bis items, a couple decent trinkets... wait. Is that... Oh fuck. Why the fuck do I have a HoJ on a feral druid that I will be respeccing into boomkin? 
---
Whatevs, still gonna farm those arcane greens. Still gonna skip it on my hunter.
---
I play on Stalagg(H) and the other day there were a bunch of Pearls around 35-40g a pop. I was literally watching the auction house as someone bought every single last pearl for sale. Dozens and Dozens. Even the ones at up to 80g. Needless to say a few hours later they were all listed at 90g each. The price has gone down a bit but that's part of the reason they are so high right now.
---
Get your gold ready.    We have agreed on a time and place.
---
I prefer playing solo but still prefer classic. Yeah, you'll have to group, especially in the later game, but it's not that bad. I'm pretty quiet in my groups depending on the day and that's fine as long as I'm saying what needs to be said like - sec for buffs and oom - both of which I have macroed on my bars. Only times I really notice playing solo is when I can't find a group for something I need to run.
---
It's tedious, but you can run to another GY and res there with res sickness.
---
I wonder if the fireballs threat reduction is split between all those hit.
---
also, sometimes enemy pack is just at the right spot and next time they'll get there in approx. 5 minutes.
---
Simply because i hate tanking So i am not the one, maybe in cata i could do some prot paladin
---
oh man, the one thing that will get me to play Classic is stance-dancing as a warrior again... This post gives me goosebumps!
---
8 possible MC raids since release. You’re telling me it’s dropped every single time and everyone caster already has it? Right.....
---
Dont have shamans here... but we have a set of tanking bears and pallies.  Helps for 5 mans. they know they are stuck healing in MC tho
---
"All across your gear" lol
---
There are like 3-4 prebis items for priests that are not healer-specific. That's literally it. Bracers, reed, shoulders, and probably helm for most folks. 
---
6 AP. Go tag along with guildies farming hoj and take an extra 3 minutes to farm golem lord. From one healer to another , I don't agree with the mindset.
---
When they are cheap.
---
But you'll never taste this sweet sweet moment when you so desperately want this trinket, so you run over and over to finally win the roll. Such a good feeling.
---
Dear friendly local healers,
---
I am an undead warlock. Please know that I want to life tap and use cannibalize to help manage my own healthpool. If you see me eating a corpse in a dungeon, don't heal me. I've brought food and bandages to heal myself; if you see a undead, tell them to eat humanoids. If I tap to full mana before a pull and eat, don't slap a +1300 overheal on me. You're just hurting your own mana pool. And over healing is a terrible waste.
---
pvp happened on a pvp realm
---
Rank 3 in first week, trinket baby yeah!!!!
---
It's useful if you want to be absolutely certain it's never resisted - but in my experience if you feign in good range behind pillars, it never resists even without FD spec :)
---
When a 16 slot Halloween bag drops. 😁
---
So what do you get DKP for, and how much?
---
I mean F him for having fun. How dare he play the game his way and gear character by farming brd. He should have been leveling not waiting his time having his own fun because I hated BRD runs. 
---
  T1 is a tank set btw, no dps warrior uses that. 
---
 Grats /u/rinkevw you're going to be crushing people in mc
---
Thanks for the reply. I'll try again tonight
---
Your mileage may vary- when I was trying to do Nessingwary's quests on my druid alt a couple of weeks ago, there were more 60's running around ganking than there were level-appropriate people questing. I toughed out a couple of quests 2-3 kills at a time, and then decided I'd just do SM instead.
---
I used 14 slot bags through most of my leveling, however as a mage I did BRD prison runs from 55-60 and saw at least 12 16-slot pumpkin bags drop.
---
So IMO if you plan on farming BRD towards your end levels, you might want to hold off on buying 16 slot bags
---
I see. Does he step behind the pillar when he starts casting his enervate (DoT manaburn) or is there a spot where he doesnt need to move at all when positioned correclty?   
---
Im doing it with a shaman buddy, therefore he just cleanses it off himself and we havent cared for it much, yet.
---
Love these! I still have the RFC one set as my mobile wallpaper.
---
Are you actually this stupid? Armor talent, defense talent, shield spec talent, last stand, shield wall duration increase, taunt cool down reduction. Yes there are PLENTY of things that a Prot has over a fury. The point of a tank is to focus the damage onto ONE target to be healed and mitigate that damage as much as possible, not flex their e-peen on the dps charts. A good tank can make runs far faster by not wasting healer mana, meaning they don’t need to drink as often
---
Forgetting Vurtne ? Absolute god of a Undead Mage
---
yup especially when the tank is actually fury with a shield. Like, it's not my fault, I have to spam heals on your squishy ass.
---
And 16-slot bags are not cheap. Mooncloth and mooncloth bags are both ~18–22g on my server, and Journeyman's bags are similar to only slightly cheaper.
---
Druid?
---
...
---
NOPE!
---
Constantly logging in going "what spec am I playing today?"
---
If anything I am making a second one. Going to be doing the honor grind super hard on my main, and may look at doing the honor grind a second time to help people.
---
Yojamba, this was from a few days when I last checked so might have changed.
---
The thing I've noticed rise the most has been elemental fire... People were selling for 5-10s a few weeks ago, now it's 3g minimum.
---
Think I got 20 days played levelling warrior to 60. Was pretty much solo, mount at 43, just fooling around. 10/10 actually WOULD recommend. Finding a dungeon group at 60 takes usually a minute, maybe 5 at 4am Monday
---
there's probably a few out there, although the main idea is shield block/slam on cooldown, revenge whenever it's up, keep 5 sunders / demo shout up at all time, then rage dump on heroic strike
---
if you're worried about TPS issues because your DPS is getting strong, then you should consider fury/prot
---
I think people are sensitive snowflakes that are afraid to confront problem players, and would rather rant on reddit.
---
I basically warn the DPS that I need to get aggro and I'll usually let them facetank for a bit if they keep nuking.
---
It doesn't appear that the actual target of the fireball is losing any threat. It may be split between all of the secondary targets. Hard to tell for sure. Our tank took every fireball after his first and still had threat to start p3.
---
&gt; I love healing warlocks who lifetap when it's a smart time
---
I was trying to figure out how to describe it... You've got it exactly right there
---
our holy paladin got it at 49 first brd run 0 mail/plate otherwise i died a little inside.
---
Sorry let me rephrase my question. Are these census numbers from AFTER the servers were open to transfers?
---
I understand you have a beef about Tauren size?
---
The alliance gets other stuff like BRM a couple minutes from their most popular capital cities and the insane AV chokepoint.  
---
Big picture, like I said not everything has to be homogenized, if anything that makes for an incredibly boring experience.
---
This kind of wreckage is NOT legal!!!!
---
I’ve lost 10 rolls on reed  and haven’t seen a mage blade!
---
A friendly tip as a mage you don't need light feathers. 
---
Just jump and blink at the last second. No fall damage.
---
There might be a priest in my guild with it in their bank
---
Yeah if you get mostly purple raid geared and can stack the bejesus out of stamina then yeah you can power through 5-man okay and even tank the majority of raid bosses (minus a handful where specialized mechanics dont favor bears).  But if part of being "dope" is having to out gear the content by a significant margin then good luck with that. Maybe the top 5 druid bears of all time can slog through competently .. but it wont help the total lack of pug tanks overall in either wow
---
I want the healer happy and I want to move along. The issue is Ill wait for them to drink, and some won't, and they'll bitch at me to hurry up. Then other will wait a couple seconds and then drink  and I'll pull when they are getting close to full. At which point they bitch about not being full Mana. 
---
I just want to say to all the people in those camps, I'm not a mind reader, you don't have a sign around your neck that says pull when I'm at xx Mana. 
---
And this is not a big issue, I was ranting and this happened a couple of times so I tacked it on.
---
Everyone serious farms consumables to some degree. In this case, it's a reliable, easily soloable 5 runs/hr with plenty of time left over farm rate. It's not so bad compared to farming for flasks.
---
It’s because a lot of healers are stupid, and feel the next pack can *only* be pulled if they are at 100% mana. They are also typically super bad at mana efficiency. They’ll see a warlock missing 10% hp and toss a max rank greater heal, which leads them to being oom after every pull and them crying about it and getting salty at everyone else for not drinking/eating while they are.
---
Yeah, even while i'm just starting to play, i agree. i don't want to grind in classic now just to witness that there's no new content afterwards(i'm honestly happy with BC/WotLk, to experience everything the same way others in the past did, but many people aren't)
---
Guess waiting until Blizzcon is a good idea. It's only a week until start.
---
Actually, you don't need to be standing on a "special spot" on the ledge. You don't even need to be standing on the ledge at all, you can even kill people from the floor. Guard aggro range is just small, it's not an exploit.
---
Edit: Decided to make a separate reply on this thread to clarify
---
This is how it worked in the patch we play on, so no, it won't be "fixed". It was changed in BC to work like mage's Invisibility spell.
---
Here's my take as a Rogue
---
Warriors need the hit even moreso than Rogues. They don't get the hit off their talent tree like Rogues do and missing with super slow tank weapons is awful.
---
If you're a tank main spec, you're absolutely prio for hit chance items. More hits = more rage = more threat = better tanking. Full stop.
---
If it was DPS vs DPS? Before DM I'd say slight preference to the Rogue but they cna get 2x tarnished elvish ring out of DM Tribute runs now that Dire Maul is out.
---
Rogues can reset Krom to do tribute runs without the ogre suit so it's not only much easier to obtain, but it's also just a strict upgrade.
---
You were in the right there. There's no common rule on gear aside from using some common sense and knowing other classes' preBIS lists.
---
For example, a Hunter rolling on Blackcrow is kinda bad form because it's nowhere near his best bow and it's BIS for melee classes (because of the hit chance on it)
---
I got it my first BRD run as a arms warrior. I should have bought a lottery ticket that day.
---
I’m trying to follow the math here...., but I just can’t. So 5.7% (rounds out to basically 6%) hit gives you a huge bonus on glancing, but does nothing to effectively change your hit cap. That is all good at 308 skill. But if I’m a human with this skill, my new wep skill jumps to 313. I just can’t figure out if that means I only have a 5% hit cap, or what other bonuses I get at that skill level. Any help would be great- thanks!
---
14s at 60, 16s after epic mount.
---
Like a legit 9:1 ratio? I know mages are flavor of the week but that would be insane. 
---
I guess it's possible, though. Kinda kicking myself for rolling mage at launch when I used to main Warlock from TBC through Cata.
---
Underrated comment
---
I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at here. This is a list of pre-raid BiS healing gear for priests? I'm not talking about PVE at all, PVP only. Which this list doesn't cover.
---
And? Not even phase 2 is out yet. Ion mentioned phase2  will come sometime late this year, so I'd say end of november, mid december, then phase 3 sometime February to April. 6 months is many months in my book of WoW server progression.
---
I mean who wouldnt tho?
---
/moo
---
Tell that to my 30+ Jed kills with no Reed drop at all.
---
I've done the math, I wrote a simulator to calculate stat weights, but they change with what gear you have. 1 crit is worth about 10 spell power. For me. That being said, crit also increases the damage of the other warlocks in your party, and depending on their gear, it might take quite a bit of spell power to outweigh their increased damage from improved shadowbolt, especially if they are more geared than you, and have a crazy amount of spell power.
---
For me, if you are raiding with 3 or more warlocks, crit is king. If you are by yourself, spell power is king. Hit isn't really great until you have more gear. Once you have over 400 spell power, send me a message and I'll help you decide what path you want to take your character down from there.
---
You have a lot of choice, and you can build your character in a way that excites you. And there is a lot of synergy with your other locks, and great potential for support builds that can increase raid DPS pretty substantially. Good time to explore the fact that this is a team game, and start talking stats with the other warlocks in your guild. Good luck and happy shadowbolting!
---
I wouldn't say it's bad, just that it is harder. It will be easier than leveling prot unless u just farm dungeons, but even then with the 2h dungeon meta it may not be as ideal.
---
At that gear level you don’t need tank gear lol. Just kill things.
---
I take it you don't have a job
---
Oh man I could not remember his name but I remember he had the crazy ass hair. Crazy mage, I remember Noone being fun to watch during TBC.
---
Leatrix plus has this option
---
whys that? its good for hemo rogues esp p1 but its not like the best or anything
---
Right? Horde blow when it's 1v1 on Skeram.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. I've seen people on stream stack but I never knew about the threat mitigation aspect.
---
This is supposed to be the [Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum](http://fortrockoregon.com/) in Oregon, but you can't tell me there aren't at least a few Defias hiding in those buildings.
---
I'm at about 100 runs of Angerforge trying for HoJ. Mostly 2/3 rogue stealth runs. I've lost 6 of them. I want to die.
---
Idk, Hordeside here and I constantly see 5+ Edgemasters up in the 250-350G, I'm guessing it's due to people knowing that Orcs are the best race now or maybe due to also having relatively cheap Devilsaur sets on our server as well.
---
That entire rant and you dodbt even list your server lol.
---
It might only work on the first cast. Or not. I\`ve seen conflicting opinions.
---
Yes, and I'll take it back if you can prove it
---
Did we ever figure this one out?
---
I'm on the don't roll need if you don't actually need it camp understanding I might get screwed out of an item one day but also that my boe epic that drops will actually go to me. Idk, I half way agree with both sides in this debate but I do see the everyone roll need camp as a bit greedier and maybe 'zoomier' than the need over greed camp. I've passed on items I could sell because but someone in my party actually needs and guess what? It's not that bad and I still bought my pre raid bis and still will afford an epic mount soon.
---
Do it.  I’m a priest with benediction and almost full best in slot and I barely bother to log on now except for my guild’s scheduled events.  I don’t *need* Anything out of dungeon runs so I’m not aggressively forming groups, but when I make myself available to heal for anyone in the guild I get no response.  I’ve stopped pushing it because it usually means that I’m just taking spots from the other priests who actually need the gear.  We have 3 full raid rosters so there’s always stuff going on in the guild, but there are *so many* holy priests (and healers in general) that they’re actually having to compete to snag spots in groups.  Like the unwashed DPS masses of olde.  At least with Druid you will be that *in-demand* healer, and you can even pivot towards whichever archetype is most needed if you so choose.
---
Yeah, you need on BOEs get the right mentality.
---
No this is my point. When I position the boss my friend doesnt have to adjust his position at all. So I am facing the boss that is standing next to the pillar and at all times there is a pillar between the boss and my priest. I move my camera to the wall when he starts to get towards 50% hp and as soon as my camera moves I know I can move through the wall. You can actually move through it even before the whole wall has crumbled thats why this helps you prepare for the imps. 
---
Shamans are by far the best healer for this farm but my RL friend is a priest so we just adjusted the way we do it to keep our runs to 12-13 minutes.
---
Care Bears are real
---
poor babies having to spend an extra 10 minutes in the dungeon because *gasp* the tank prefers a slower pace
---
In a game where you spend 20% of your time on fantasy buses why does everyone want to get up in arms when a tank causes them to go slightly slower then they're used too?
---
I absolutely agree with you 100%.  But some people just don’t get it.
---
Maybe not everyone is a minmaxer and wants a profession.
---
Oh look another random social interaction nobody on this sub cares anything about. Not sure why you felt the need to post this.
---
You just took a fat ass L from a mediocre player
---
As far as raiding goes, it depends on your raid group. A lot of guilds straight up won't allow DPS or Tank druids. In raid they are just unfortunately sub-par compared to pretty much any other class.
---
Take the extra time a few times to learn the skip then you save the time later.
---
What is the problem with that? As a mage I can farm 50-80g an hour whenever I please in ZF, DM:E, DM:N, as a rogue I can stealth past ganks.
---
Tanks have leverage when it comes to forming groups. Every class has perks that makes them desireable in certain aspects of the game.
---
Why shouldnt a tank play to his strengths? Should mages and hunters only farm 20g an hour just so they dont inflate the game and dont have so much gold to throw around? Is it unfair that I'm left out to dry without having a farming buddy at my disposal as a warrior?
---
I like that you judgingly checked his level and class. I do it way too much.
---
Thousands of gold? What kind runecloth prices do *you* have, it would cost like..400-500g on westfall from honored to exalted
---
I'm interested in this as well...I've heard innervate the most effective DPS caster, but it seems like during progression we should be innervating the healers.
---
I struggle a little with thinking i should innervate another healer though...their toolkits are already faster and more mana efficient compared to mine...and if I innervate them it just makes me look worse (even though part of their work is credit to me), which invites me getting replaced in the raid.
---
I know the correct answer is whatever the raid needs, but being OOM while another healer uses my innervate feels kind of bad.
---
I'd mind less if i was helping DPS I think.
---
The pros outweigh the cons on a PvP server imo. Yea you'll get ganked but the communities on PvP servers are generally more active, and the world feels more alive due to the inherent danger which subsequently boosts the economy, atmosphere, and rpg aspects of the server. If all you want to do is raid then go to a PvE server, but if you want to become part of something bigger than yourself and truly experience everything vanilla has to offer, go PvP.
---
You can macro it is the reverse order s.t. you sap first and then pickpocket, I am 99% sure this cannot break the sap.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss
---
Yeah it's of course completely reasonable to ask for summons whenever necessary, but summoning most if not the entire raid? Nah, walk your lazy asses over there and respect other people's time.
---
Is that for pvp rezzes only? Because I remember dying to the timbermaws on my way to winterspring and running as a ghost from the felwood gym to the one in WS to try this trick. But the spirit in WS told me you can only spirit res at the gy you popped up at. So I had to run all the way back as a ghost to res at my corpse only to die a couple more times along the way.
---
Depends. I like a tougher experience, personally. But I'm not really focused on endgame. To each his own.

Try reading again? I'm only here to dispel this ridiculous notion that 10% more quests (citation needed) means horde never has to grind.
---
Probably a lot of people just thought you were doing it by mistake. I'd never expect someone purposely opened trade without messaging me first.
---
Take the free transfer.  My server is lower pop (just getting some guilds into progression of MC fully)...but super wholesome. :)

It's just a radical weapon.    I grew up idolizing unbreakable, so this is my chance at living that life.

ya dun goofed son

I thought MCP is bear tank BiS
---
Haha this is just for solofarming DM east
---
I know it's not an upper level dungeon, but after 45 minutes of looking for a tank my SM Lib party just built a grp of 3 rogues and two priests with one of the priests dpsing and ended up doing ok. I don't think we had any deaths at all and only had to slow down when the priest healer was running low on water.
---
Exercise your power as the tank. Ultimately YOU are in charge of what gets pulled. If they have a problem well tough titties. Drop them and replace with another DPS instantly.
---
This inspires me to keep trying to get it
---
some people suck
---
Having a lvling partner just makes the game more enjoyable. I have a few accounts but none of my
---
IRL friends play wow so always finding randoms to play with sucks.
---
What i really dont like as a hunter is that, when i take aggro and FD it will takes ages before i reset the aggro and the poor tank has to turn around and taunt my target. It really fucks up pulls, even if im easy on the initial dps.
---
Found the “nothing” category
---
I take pride in perfectly executed pulls, good micromanagement of all the mobs, moving quickly, handling hard situations well. But I HATE when that beautiful LoS pull is fucked by a moronically timed heal or multishot. People ITT seem to think I'm a bad tank and I am always wiping, Or that I'm a bad tank because things aren't going smoothly. No... I handle it well, people rarely die, but what dps don't seem to understand or care about is the energy involved. 
---
You hit on the key point: The difference between the number of actions taken per second in a smooth run and a run with even one dipshit dps is astronomical. It's tiring to be that high-strung for hours on end when the fucktards could just chill out a bit and it'd be easy.
---
Side note, I mained a prot pally in bc, got to illidan as OT. It was great, I loved it. I also have trouble taking a back seat and not tanking. We even quit the games at the same points lol. GG kindred tank spirit.
---
Whenever they stop being a crippling cost. You should get them as soon as possible because more bag space means you can bring more loot back and not have to throw potentially valuable stuff away to make room for more valuable stuff. They're really an investment.
---
However if you can't afford your mount or key skills I'd call it a crippling cost. You should be able to get Runecloth Bags very cheap though by providing at least the Runecloth. No excuse to have anything less than all 14s when Runecloth is dropping. If you make an alt you should also deck them out with these ASAP as well.
---
I mostly just waited on Traveler's Backpacks to drop but you can also get a 16 Slot bag from the Quest You Are Rakh'likh, Demon which is an awesome quest everyone should do anyway.
---
Hmm, why are you specifically gunning for dun0 set so much, they really aren't even sidegrades from much of the other gear and you have plenty of time to get them before the questline to upgrade them to dun2 becomes available.
---
30 ubrs without once seeing the chest is really unlucky though, at 30 runs you'd have a decent chance of seeing one of the 3 epic drops from there.
---
&gt; It's better if you stop thinking of it as getting screwed out of one particular item but rather having an equal chance to profit
---
Like I said, I understand both sides. It just doesn't sit right with me. I've passed on high value items (granted no 500g+ item has dropped for me) and been perfectly fine knowing my purchased items will be delayed a bit. I'm not treating the game as a race to get bis. Idk, I've tried to explain myself over this several times but this topic is very polarizing and never convinced anyone but it simply doesn't feel as right to me. 
---
With that said, I appreciate groups that advertise as gold &gt; ms and don't have issues as long as they make it known right when you join. That way everyone wins.
---
I guess one way would be to say that I add extra value on top of party members or myself getting their bis.
---
I may be one of the most pro-ganking people on my server, but Even I don't corpse camp.  All I do is gank you once, and then I go find new horde to gank.
---
hellfire deaths save repair gold?! holy shit game changer
---
I paid 60g and was happy with it because all I had to do was talk to the steed who was already summoned.
---
Thanks, Friend, and congratulations! Good journey to you!
---
That's not a safespot though, it's outside the guards aggro radius. Go try it out yourself. I'm going into that building when visiting winterspring and killing the afk bots that snipe the runecloth bag pattern. You don't need to stand on the edge, you're just "outside the guards aggro radius".

And then there is druid... tanking/healing/dps/solo set and pvp set. Obviously with some overlap but I have 2 bags dedicated to gear.
---
I've been playing on Westfall, but I've always had that itch for wPvP. Thinking of druid or warrior
---
I didn't say anything about complaining here. It sounds like he's playing solo as it is, it was just a suggestion. Calm your tits.
---
equally geared / raid buffed /world buffed / skill players sword spec will always do more DPS in fights. this is not something that is debatable.
---
Shoot me a DM
---
No regrets on class/race choice, but I had to reroll the same char on a new server at level 48 because it was 80% horde. Wanted balanced ally PvP. Happy now and getting close to 60. I had no enjoyment with the game having to wonder whether or not paid xfers would be in soon. Don't want to wait for naxx to xfer I might not be playing by then, who knows.
---
"All that said, I really love tanking. When I get a group of dps that know what they're doing and give me a second for threat... Omg it's awesome. People following kill orders, appropriately CCing. Omg. Resheeping? It's great. I make a point of complimenting anyone I see doing well, working well with the group. "
---
These are the people you add as friends and invite to group when you feel like running a dungeon.
---
Probably an engineer, what about you?
---
How long did you wait after the general chat advertisement? I would say advertising for a quest mob then having someone immediately message you for it is the exact type of "future predicting" that is completely reasonable and likely what this person is referring to when they said rude (if they were even serious at all).
---
If you waited at least a bit, then all g.
---
This is not true I absolutely go oom. But only when I know it doesn't matter
---
I only oomed on rag on private servers, dont play mage in classic so i wouldnt know
---
Ironic.
---
I laugh but I dont have any room for anything other than shards during raid. Then a mage wants to trade me 160 water. Calm down champ
---
I think you answered your own question
---
I tank as a feral Druid. I’ve decided to do what I’m going to do and just say fuck it if others don’t agree. If a hunter opens up right away on a pull and  gets aggro then I let him tank that one. If the rogue is on the non marked mob then he can tank that one. I tell them once to give me a few seconds to get aggro. 
---
With healers I pull when they are at about 80% while drinking, generally they can keep sitting for a few more seconds while I’m rounding all the mobs up. If the healer is going oom every pull then obviously I’ll let them get to 100% first. 
---
At the end of the day you’re a tank and are much more rare than a dps or healer. As long as you’re reasonable I’ve never had a problem.
---
For various reasons though, your experience is hardly representative for most people.
---
As I level up my enchanting and create new rods, do I need to keep the lower ranked rods for anything?  Or can I just get rid of them?
---
I play Tank, I make the groups, and the moment I see an idiot behaving like one multiple times I kick him the heck out and look for someone else. Which still is bothersome tho...
---
Lol, yep...and it takes a minute to get sufficient rage flowing for a few swipes to land too.  I can hold single target aggro like a boss and two targets as long as they don't focus fire the second...but 4+ and you're taking your life in your own hands if you aggro off me.
---
Lol thanks for accurately describing the avg dungeon run - Courtesy of the fucktards dps near you.
---
I tank pugs a lot and I just ask politely if I can roll on DPS gear for my offspec, I've literally never gotten a "No you can't" from a group, even when there's other melee DPS, but I'll pass if the DPS need it.
---
I generally don't tank with melee DPS much though, so that makes it a lot easier. Just work with your group rather than assuming they'll hate you for wanting to be geared for multiple situations.
---
I know it really isn't going to help with dps that doesn't care what they are doing, but I found that making a macro to auto skull targets helps a little bit. The macro looks something like this:
---
 \#showtooltip  
---
/run SetRaidTarget("target",8)  
---
/cast Charge
---
hi its the same guy, I found my alt account :)
---
I'm not sure if we're looking at different lists or what, but the list you are showing me does not add up with what you are saying. For example:
---
Shoulders: Elder Wizard's Mantle (has no stamina)
---
Chest: Truefaith Vestments (has no intellect)
---
Gloves: Hands of the Exalted Herald (has no stamina)
---
This is a PVE-focused list, I don't see how this "proves" that PVE pre-raid BIS is also what you should strive to equip in PVP lol
---
When do they start stacking?
---
It's actually\* :D   
---
Also yeah lot's of people talking out of their asses on reddit, that's how it goes.
---
Consolidate your mana dew and you can carry another soul shard SMH 🤦‍♂️
---
Without timestamps, it's impossible to tell which one of you is the numpty.
---
Their ignorance is your bliss.
---
If its something like Ulda or RFK, and people are only ever going to run it like 5 times, its not worth  becoming the living embodiment of the meme of pulling two packs while trying to walk in between them. Unless its something you are going to run ad nauseam, its not worth the time investment.
---
I'm on Rattlegore.
---
Weirdly we're currently in a state where a large amount of bis is obtainable...... outside of the raid from a vendor that's essentially a gachapan
---
Actually loled
---
I mean, the guy mentioned &lt;APES&gt;, which was the first guild to clear MC. They pulled slow the first clear because people were level 55 and in greens, but they kill bosses in under 25 seconds now. Using them as an example of "wait for tank threat" is dumb, because they literally don't wait for tank threat.
---
Then you have the warlocks that lifetap to 10% during the pull and you’re looking around for the mob that broke off from you to attack them or the patrol that they pulled.
---
I know WOTF is really strong for pvp. I'm not doing a lot a pvp and don't like popular race/ class combos. Undead is probably the best race for rogue pvp wise.
---
Get him a good new mouse and keyboard. Simple and affective. This will benefit him even when his not playing wow - and something he will use for years. Alternatively - even just a new mouse with heaps of hotkeys could also help him
---
I had been hunting around for him a bit while advertising but he did indeed spawn pretty soon after that particular comment. In any case I am pretty sure he was joking.
---
Yes it does! My love for that spell is inversely proportional to my healer's hate for it lmao
---
THEN DONT JOOOOIIIIINNNNN
---
Also checking whether he is a guildie
---
Worgens are (this was changed later... And worgens became playable)
---
im taking a second look at this and now idk if its the ravager or the whildwind axe.  
---
if its the ravager, its awful and i would never get it (unless im a shaman)
---
Yup, I've always played a mage for years now and I think that's what led to me stopping at 40 and taking a step back from classic. Debating coming back and making a rogue but wanted to find a good realm first
---
NP kid, helping people in need like you is why I'm here
---
Not hinterlands
---
Simply breaking the whole “someone isn’t 100%, I must heal them immediately” is huge for a new healer to making a run go smoother. They’ll have more mana for more important things and have to drink less, making the run smoother.
---
Instead, they get upset and absurdly angry at everyone else for their shortcomings and failure to improve as a player. They signed up for the role of healer, they knew what it came with.
---
Buy 55+ greens (of the Eagle/of Intellect) off the AH?
---
is there any 50/50 faction pvp server in US?
---
Can confirm it didn't for me either.
---
OP, why not look for a newbie leveling guild, so that you can meet tons of new people and build up a new friends list that won't abandon you a month into it?
---
BRM PvP
---
At 60 with decent amount of MC gear I don't really ever need the tank to wait for my mana. Do 1 pack pulls and I'll start drinking on the pull and stop when I need to heal. 20-30% is enough to pull, if the pull goes bad I have major mana pots and dark runes, which is like 3k mana, so actually I'm at like 70% mana (if needed).
---
If I'm at 25% mana and not drinking then I'm betting on the pull not needing 25% mana, if it does I can just pot.
---
The only thing I need from the tank is he not pulling when I'm line of sight. If I start drinking in the other room and the tank just pulls that's like 5 seconds running, 2 seconds casting a heal and now I've also not fully drinked. Sometimes it's just easier (if I'm not in combat) to just let everyone in combat die and proceed to ress them.
---
would it make it difficult to start with? I just want to ensure the server I start on stays full throughout the years
---
No im listing services. Did i say 1 food or water  as well? No. You are just one of those cheap kids I get it. I don't play a rogue and 1g is standard for everything. You are just trying to twist my words so your ego doesn't get hurt.
---
I had to add a reset conditional to get it to work:
---
 /castsequence reset=5 Find Herbs, Find Minerals
---
server discord might be ok, but i think your best bet would be finding a leveling guild in-game and organizing a group saying you'd like to run dungeons multiple times and just fill in the gaps as people leave if you want to keep going.  make sure you're adding good players to your friends list and you'll have a nice bank of people to whisper to fill these groups with down the road too.
---
Pretty much all mythical creatures in wow are from real life. Even kobolod
---
Upcoming carefulest click of your life
---
Yeah that was my point. Savage is an upgrade but you have to decide whether +14 Agil and +5 Strength is worth it to you.
---
I would leave Savage Glad and Hand of Justice farming for a rainy day and focus on easier upgrades
---
The fucking eye censor kills me!
---
Yeah, you'd gain that 1% crit, however after removing misses for yellows hit loses a lot of value vs Crit (or just using something that gives raw atk) so it'd be more beneficial almost always to just stop looking for hit after that softcap.
---
As someone who just started yesterday. Not sure what I’m looking at
---
I am leveling a lock rn. I’m thinking about keeping a large soul bag or two in my bank just for summons on raid night
---
I decided to not even bother with that shit. I got everything I needed out of BRD extraordinarily fast and wasn't about to do BRD just for the small chance. lol

Mid 30s, Got wife, kids, work, the whole deal so I only really play at night most days from about 8-12 EST or so. I played a bit back in the day starting with ice crown, never played vanilla or bc before that. played up through mists and then got bored and didn't play again until classic came out. So ive just been slowly (very slow rouge solo) leveling. Haven't done much dungeons but i remember most of them and can figure things out quick if its explained once. Just looking for a guild with guys about my age and situation and just chill and not crazy crazy about min/max and all that crap. Message on here or in game.
---
What a terrible bot. Looks extremely basic to be a paid bot. Most paid bots will ignore if a mob gets tagged and moves on. Bots will forever be easy to spot though even with this feature.
---
I have not tested it extensively but this one seems to work.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/download12258-WoWTexasHoldem

I like the idea, but I hate the tone it sets. It also kind of implies that you're telling them what to do, and most people's reaction to being told what to do is"fuck off"
---
I stand at the top of the stairs behind Bly. I make sure to pick up the elites when they come up the stairs and do my best to keep the non-elites on me. Though, most of the time the non-elites are kind of everywhere. As long as you keep them off the healer, you're good.
---
As a hunter, this why I would pass to a warr... If they are in my guild 😈
---
I did a two warrior run last night. I had been tanking a lot and my guldie wanted to take a crack at it. I flat out told him to not stress it if a mob stuck to me, an arms war on a crit streak is not giving that mob back.
---
It worked out just fine, I took a little more healing than a dps should, but I also had the health and armor to take some damage.
---
that's why I disable helm display in the settings.
---
&gt; Archvist Cape of Shadow Wrath
---
Just slip that last part in huh :(
---
Goddamn the amount of crybabies in this thread. As someone who avoids ganking when unnecessary but still has fun with PVP, I say keep doing what you're doing man. Having that little excitement of getting rolled on by Horde and trying to figure out how to survive or win is why I play PVP. You make the game a better, more interesting place to play.
---
This.
---
HotW/NS (1/29/21) is your best bet for a viable hybrid spec that allows you to Tank and Heal rather well. While your healing spells generally heal for less, you have a much larger mana pool, and you aren’t gimped on tanking talents either (aside from not being able to access Omen of Clarity). Very solid for PvE and open world. It will definitely suffice in PvP due to having resto points and Natures Swiftness but isn’t “optimal” so to speak.
---
Be advised that your cat form DPS will definitely not be great in this spec, although it’s not meant for Cat DPSing anyway (again due to lack of important cat points in Feral, no Omen of Clarity or Natural Shapeshifter). And in PvP you’ll only likely be in cat form for openers so you’re not missing out on much.
---
If you really want to PvP, a resto build with points in Balance is your next best bet.
---
&gt; I’m expecting to get gear that I actually need and will be equipping.
---
So then go buy the BoE piece if you need it. If it drops, everyone gets a chance. It has the same value to everyone. You taking it is taking X gold equal to it's value from the person who would have won it. If you had bought it ahead of time would you still demand everyone pass it to you?? So do that. Don't expect people to pass you piles of money.
---
&gt; It doesn’t make sense for a priest or a mage to need on a shield they won’t use at all
---
Yes it does because BoE items can be traded and sell for their market value, so high value ones can be traded for other goods and services IE, other people's BiS items. Did you know some classes BiS items don't drop as BoEs so they have to make them? They don't benefit from "only my class gets to roll on this item."
---
&gt; How is that toxic?
---
You are literally saying that you need gold more than your teamates. How do you justify that?
---
&gt; Imagine a tank rolling on healing gear, or rolling on +frost spell pre-bis gear.
---
Imagine not knowing the difference between Bind on PICKUP and Bind on EQUIP.
---
Thanks! I was wondering why it wasn't on the other page. Is this the only class that blizzard did this for.
---
Cool, that's kind of what I was figuring on doing. Thanks!
---
As a Hunter you don't really need it t1 is much better (if you raid mc that is).
---
Do you not have a guild? If you want to raid future content, getting in with a guild now is the way to do it. Show up for raids and build that equity now.
---
Nothing worse than trying to find a raiding guild when AQ comes out, only to find that you're going to have to raid for 4 months without any chance at getting gear (because all the dependable Warriors who helped the guild progress to that point are going to get the gear first).
---
UX was but a twinkle in it's father's eye back then, compared to today. Everything was still UI pass/fail
---
Even worse when you spend all that time skipping a pack just for some idiot to backpedal and buttpull it anyway
---
There's easily room for 4-5 tanks in a raid, especially off tanks. Majordomo and Garr just require someone willing to take off their agility gear and slap on a shield. You can even be arms / fury spec.
---
You might not get gear for the first 3 weeks of progression but after that the loot rains on you.
---
There is a form of raid competitiveness that is not toxic ya know? I have fun trying to stick it to the dude who is wrecking the meter.
---
&gt;Then you have the warlocks that lifetap to 10% during the pull
---
You mean every warlock?
---
Druid was unexpectedly super fun. A great surprise. I dont regret my main but I will say it can be annoying when people bombard you to ask to tank a dungeon before you even said you were lfg
---
My favorite is when a dps pulls aggro off a mob, which by itself is usually not a huge deal, but they then proceed to run AWAY from me. Like uhh im not chasing you and dragging this whole pack with me to try and get 1 mob off you. If you pull a mob off the tank please run towards the tank ffs.
---
&gt; fiery enchant is a bad example its worth almost nothing and easy to farm. Let them have it.
---
Oh, I assumed it was valuable... on live way back when it was valuable and I never bothered checking the price (since I've never actually even rolled on it). I was just trying to demonstrate that if the group wants to do it that way, I'm fine with it.
---
&gt;As for more valuable patterns, recipes, you should just default to all need. Then you don't have to worry about that problem at all. A person who really needs a pattern can buy it off the winner, or buy it off the AH. I usually give a steep discount if I win something someone else wants.
---
Agreed, I think this is the best answer in general.
---
You need a healer for starters. The last boss has 32.000 health and hits  like a ton of bricks in wolf form (800 damage crits against 45% physical mitigation and around 1-1.5 seconds attack speed).
---
You need enough DPS to bruteforce the boss as rogue. I've seen a video of a t2 rogue with CTS (?) do reasonably well, but that was because he tanked/ dodged most of the boss in evasion and by the time evasion was up, the boss was on death's bed. The healer was a well geared paladin getting mana back from healing crits.
---
With preBiS gear I'd say rogue + healer is not possible yet (I havent tried though myself).
---
As a warrior you can outlast the boss easier due to defstance + shield against wolf form if your healer isnt that well geared yet.
---
I appreciate the kind words
---
I didn’t even think that 3/8 t2 was available yet..
---
I did this almost exactly, switched from shadow to 25/26 Disc/Holy at 56. Built out a +heal gear set off AH and started looking for BRD\Strat Live groups.  the last 4 levels to 60 went by in a flash and i have pretty solid gear for healing 5mans.  Now i am starting on a BiS Shadow gear set for when i switch back to shadow come wPVP or BG days. 
---
Solo farming isn't terrible. a tad bit slower but i just swap out +heal for int or +dam pieces.   It is much easier to gather gear as holy than fake it as shadow.  Healing is more fun than i thought it would be, got to be on the ball in 5mans. A shadow spec could make it work but leaves less room for ohshit patrols or adds.
---
Did a DM:N run last week that i wouldnt have been invited to as a shadow -- lucked into a felcloth gloves pattern. grinding ashara satyrs for demonic runes is easy and fast, and im 2/3rds way to epic mount.
---
So Druid’s are pretty decent healers? 
---
I dunno I did have a 60 Druid as an alt in my vanilla raiding days and that’s how I discovered I liked healing, but I had a lower level priest alt and vastly preferred the healing style of a priest over a Druid. Plus back then I swear I remember druids being like second rate healers compared to priests, but this was actual vanilla not modern classic where we know everything now. 
---
Maybe I’ll bust out a Druid, see if I like that.
---
I complete agree with what your saying there.  And that’s why I wouldn’t run as a DPS, I just don’t think plate DPS is going to get to gear it wants unless it hides the intention from the tank or has some drawn out conversation that can go haywire the first time something drops that doesn’t fit that plan.
---
All pallies and warriors are running armory so you're almost always rolling against a couple others.
---
Yep, I tend to start somewhat cautiously and then speed up until we reach imo our groups fastest possible safe speed
---
If my mage doesn't have this, no fucking way I'm rolling on it over them. Period.   
---
As a Priest, I have options in my trinkets. The poor mages get barely anything, and if it's a really massive upgrade to our DPS/spellpower for the raid, I'd feel SHITTY taking that away from our guild. All for what, +6 on my heal? Objectively, I'd rather have the damage for the clear speed, saving me mana in the long run by killing the mobs quicker is never a bad thing.  
---
If it's a PUB, my mentality changes completely. But in a guild run, it's all about what benefits the guild most, as long as that mage is actually going to commit to raiding.
---
Got HoJ on an unopposed role my second run of BRD...as Ret...without even trying to make a run for HoJ. So yeah I’m at a heightened state of anxiety just waiting for Karma to slap me in the face around every corner in order to balance things out haha.
---

Probably should have gotten edgemasters instead of devilsaur set. Your gonna need that weapon skill
---
Equip ravager and spin to win
---
Weird weapon for a huntard.

Needs more yellow.
---
Also appears that someone is shadow banned.
---
Enchanting is not profitable until you get rare recipes and even then it takes time. For example, I won Spell Power enchant in MC. This is great, now I can charge 30g+ for each enchant. However, I now need to make a runed arcanite rod which will cost ya 250-300g. From there you will need to do at least 10+ enchants before you start turning a profit. Not to mention more people every day get the drop so you're now competing with other people to enchant. It's a good day if I can do one enchant. This reduces your charge price making it more difficult to make your money back. You also have training costs and leveling costs. 
---
If you find yourself parked in cities and only venture out for raids, then it's a passive way to make money over time with the right recipes. If you want to maximize your time, then DM East runs mentioned in comments are a much better profit.
---
Nah, I'm a warlock. I dont mind summoning a few people if they have a valid reason but you have to consider the time of everyone else. If you want to raid then be on time. It's about being considerate of your fellow players
---
Back in the day we had pvp on our pve server. Phase 2 will probably help a bit since there will be a reward-centric reason for people to participate. Otherwise, find a couple people to group up with, find a busy enemy area, flag up and see what happens.
---
If nothing else you can pester the enemy faction by trashing towns and quest hubs to try to provoke a response.
---
I tried playing a tank once, the bitching and whining out of people when you don't do exactly what they want is annoying
---
Had a mage need the shadow damage BoE staff from SFK. Group low-key bullied him to give it to me (shadow priest at the time). Guy just didn't notice it was shadow damage only.
---
yes, after 305 value drops dramatically, after 309 (I think) you reduce glancing blow damage penalty to its lowest value (5% off of white hits) it has a minuscule impact on dodge/parry etc after +5. As a human rogue, guessing combat spec, you have nothing else to put the points into, so might as well just get 310 skill and be content.
---
I think I was in that group.  Pagle Horde?
---
what a horrible post
---
You most likely hit honored in your mid-20s then
---
Yup. It’s not a good cheat and it’s the only thing warriors can get for the next year.
---
Is the scan button the correct button?
---
&gt;people get upset when you roll on DPS gear
---
Until now I've had 1 person get "upset" that I've intended to roll on dps gear. Thats out of 60+ pugs at lvl 60. 
---
&gt;I’m not going to waste my time doing unproductive tasks for your benefit
---
Just ask how many people there are in the group that need the items you want out of the instance. If there are to many for your liking just skip out on that group.
---
As the tank I was even able to reserve loot as the last player joining in(obviously wont work for every item).
---
Can someone explain what "rolling" a class means? Is it literally just flipping a coin to decide your class? Why are people choosing random classes in the first place, just to try out everything?
---
Not worth it on a warlock at least.
---
Also if you are low on cash get your mount first, then 40 abilities later if you are low on money. The 60% movement speed is much more important. You’ll also make a lot more money doing your normal routine while above 40
---
See people fighting for elementals in arathi now.

Last night in MC a warrior won the roll for Wristguards of True Flight and passed them to the hunter that also rolled.

Been gone a while.. Need the keys to RC discord

GET THEM BOI!!!!
---
You see, most classes, we kill something, and that's it.  We don't think twice about it.  We move onto the next kill.
---
But warlocks...warlocks remember.
---
At 0:06 he uses vanish, it takes the reagent, the cooldown happens, and the Vanish buff / stealth is never actually applied, mobs keep hitting him  
---
At 0:10 he uses prep, vanishes again, same as above however this time he gets the improved stealth buff, stealth, and mobs do not drop combat and keep hitting him  
---
At 0:29 he health potions, stealth is applied for some reason (in combat), mobs do not break aggro and keep hitting  
---
At 0:41 as he loads the graveyard he gets a run back to BRD to contemplate the fact that he should have just rolled a Warrior anyway  
---
Cheap shot was fixed in 1.10.0:  
---
*Creatures will no longer get one hit on a rogue before cheap shot takes effect.  *
---
In Classic you not only get hit after successfully opening with Cheap Shot you can be cast on by the mob if it has instant cast abilities.  
---
Both of these bugs are pretty large as far as the Rogue class is concerned, and aside from pickpocket runs it effects how the class plays in general. Would love for this to get some exposure for Blizzard.
---
Embrace it, for you will rarely look this cool again.

"I don't use my own mana"

I tanked largely in PUGs as a Druid on horde Arugal, and I seriously never had a problem. Everyone was really understanding, if I said at the outset I didn't know where the hell I am going, like in BRD and Mara, or what mechanics there are, it was all fine. No one went "oh fuck this guy" and ditched or gave me shit. When DPS pulled aggro and died, I was never blamed.
---
Gosh it's weird because I had totally different experience tanking to you, I actually found it chill. I was in like the first wave of people gearing out so maybe it was just being with the more hard core players? Dunno.
---
You're out of your mind. Plenty of guilds are are much better than "decent" have an enhancement shaman. Pure ignorance right here
---
I literally made this post because I was responding to this question in another thread and ended up ranting too much. 
---
Fun fact you aren't saying anything useful, relevant or informative either :)
---
I actuallyalways thought priests and paladins should be alliance only and shaman and druid horde only. Split the healers up. Makes sense since priests and paladins use holy spells and druids and shamans use nature to heal.
---
Especially if you think about a holy undead.....what?
---
Obviously I only mean in terms of RP. Having no priests on horde would be aweful.
---
And splitting that many classes into factions is bound to have problems.
---
Just seemed to fit for me
---
If you open the ah menu, there’s a menu of buttons on the top left, press the blue two arrow fast forward looking button for a quicker scan.
---
Thanks for your explanation, very much appreciated.
---
Yes. BiS priest spec front and center.
---
Recreate this god, please.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHI3\_a5rjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHI3_a5rjo)
---
MY YOU'RE A TALL ONE!
---
ASAP, but I am a hunter so space probably more useful for me.
---
Can confirm, was running some friends through ZF on my druid at 60, pulled entire room of bugs to barkskin/hurricane, died in like 2 seconds. lol. We got a chuckle out of it.
---
It’s not. Only helm and legs till BWL.
---
Lolol to vendor
---
tbh the game does a pretty good job teaching you as you go. It's not like deadmines or RFC are some insanely complicated pulls, and the dungeons are pretty gradual as far as increasing complexity goes.
---
That's what I call it from Dota 2! Though I first learned the technique with dragoons in starcraft.
---
Im using the RFK dagger and a blue sword. Yes I've put all talents into combat and sword spec. I dont know really what changed, it just suddenly stoppes being completely aids trying to kill mobs. I think it might be because got a lot more spells and stuff now, but I just play the game and dont do much research so idk why, think it might be because I got really good weapons because the mobs dies before I can use a 4 combo point finisher
---
Commie.
---
i know these guys are costly but i really love the mana biscuts the Argent Dawn sell as a warlock. I like to tap to about 50% of each then eat one of those and it restores health and mana, saves some of the space on carrying water and food, worth the price to me!
---
Yes, resto is more popular of course. But enhancement is viable and has a spot in a raid undoubtedly.
---
It's not only gear but also knowledge and setup. You need a full set of stance dance macros, deep knowledge about game mechanics (demo shout can provide up to 30% dmg reduction from mobs) and dungeon knowledge about Pat's and positioning.
---
These things differentiate good and bad tanks. And bad tanking REALLY shows. TBH most players aren't good, so they gravitate to a less critical role where their failures aren't scrutinized. Pushing these players to tank will only give a bad dungeon experience to the 4 other party members.
---
In that case, perhaps I will try this on Horde side since you've already done it Alliance side.
---
I'll add your character to my friend list in-game to keep in touch.
---
That's exactly how threat works.
---
yeah for sure. i agree. funny thing is though that as the phases progress a lot of items have hit on them and you will go over the soft hit cap without the intention to do so, so your auto attacks just get better as the game progresses
---
Earthshaker. Guess there a few crazies around!
---
Dude you're talking like you can't roll on dps pre-bis gear as the tank.
---
That is the *literal opposite* of true. 
---
&gt;Tanks at lower levels are in abundance, because you can 2h tank, and you don’t need decent gear. 
---
It's like you didn't even read the thing you're responding to.
---
perfect
---
Another good example. Glad you were able to ultimately get the staff.
---
I've got two shard bags at the moment and it's 100% worth the investment.
---
Im more worried about the 100g guy getting pm'ed by ppl begging for money.
---
Edgemaster would’ve cost me twice the amount of what I paid for devilsaur, might get it later on though
---
You rolled for stats in DnD so video game’s adapted apparently. My explanation below is wrong as many people have passionately pointed out 
---
Rolling in that scenario means that’s the “role” they will be serving. Not rolling dice. 
---
Like I chose to be a warlock. So I’m rolling a warlock. My role is dps warlock. 
---
People will sometimes say they are rolling a holy pally. Meaning they will serve the healing role as a paladin.
---
Yea, going to have to agree with you. Fun definitely shouldn't get an immediate pass in a video game.  ./s
---
You come across marginally salty about meter spamming. Do you dislike a guild culture where everyone strives to be the top dps/hps dog (assuming mechanics get done)? To some extent the meter is a rough approximation of contribution for some classes some of the time, especially if you are on an encounter where your sole focus is to tunnel DPS. I don't think anyone expects a lock to bring the heat when they have to spam banish/support certain fight mechanics.
---
Yeah kinda kills me that two talents for prot pallys involves needed to be crit by an enemy.
---
I think it should as well but nightfall is p3 and warriors are more dps (according to my guild).
---
Okay but that's because APES is pushing DPS numbers that are 5x higher than most guilds clearing MC are.
---
And that’s his fault?
---
This made my day lol
---
I’m a main sword and board warrior. I play with my wife who heals mostly and the rest of the dps is also mostly family/ friends/ guildies. 
---
But....I have questioned my love of tanking at times and it’s usually when a dps wants to move everything faster and messier. If it’s a speed run I’ll let you know. Otherwise please kill skull and don’t break sheep.
---
Just picking race and class now, wow, pretty dummy proof.
---
If you put your cursor on a recommendation you'll see three vertical dots below the video all the way to the right. Click the dots. Click the option 'Tell us Why' and a window will pop up with some options. Click all of the boxes that apply for you and why you don't want more.
---
Click the eclipses on the video recommendation and select the “I don’t want to see these” I believe is the item. And reason for not interested
---
I'm a warrior tank and my current pet peeve is dps warriors demanding tanks for dungeons while reserving items a tank would need. I do understand there is some overlap between dps and tank items but when I see the same guy spamming "LF1M Tank BRD Anger run. HoJ reserved!" for 3 hours I can't help but think it's like going halves on a lotto ticket with someone but they get none of the winnings.
---
Could you explain why you wouldn't want edgemaster's as an orc? I thought weapon skill universally was the best stat to have. I know orcs get +5 axes and with edgemaster's they'd get another +7. So does the effect of weapon skill diminish the more you have of it?
---
I've seen plenty pass Striker's Mark to hunters even though they should just be going for Rhok
---
Just came back from work, guess I'll finish this quest and go purchase a wand from auction house in Origramm or whatever it is. 
---
I explored quite thoroughly Origramm in my opinion but didn't find any wand enchanters or such? Whats the correct term?
---
Progression... I'd say the healer with lowest mana. 
---
Farm: probably the most mana dependant caster that also does high dps. 
---
Or simply discuss with your RL, they may have their own idea who deserves it.
---
Disappointed in my brothers
---
I bought my mage book for 18s on AH lol. Got 4g for quest completion and it's better than my carrot on a stick until I get Reed.
---
I spent more time than I'm proud of attempting to find a way to get crit more
---
I reported a bot in vanilla and it took at least 4 weeks for it to disappear despite writing a detailed report explaining how it was obvious it was a bot.
---
I'm unsure if they did actually get banned or gave up because I followed them around most days tagging all their mobs.
---
After epic mount. Runecloth until then.
---
Was running BRD last night. Priest was leader of the group he invited 2 warriors and 2 kitty druids. The second warrior 
---
(dps)  took about 45 mins to arrive after everyone so we started without him.
---
Group was running just fine until that dps warrior showed up, I dont think the priest got a innervate up until he showed. Right after the first pull he was bitching that the tank couldn't keep aggro, kitty's wernt doing enough dps and where the fuck is his leader of the pack buff. 
---
Priest took his side, claiming he didn't check dps before inviting them. I note the team comp and tell him it's clear what you were trying to achieve by setting this group up (2 plate and 2 leather wearers)
---
Next pull the dps warrior goes ham, priest goes oom and both druids leaves without innervating.
---
Gotta finish the dungeon 10min faster so I can afk in IF looking fab. HURRY UP!
---
Yo so is a chode defined by the width to length ratio of the penis, or just if it doesn't extend past the scrotum while flaccid? I always thought it was the former, but some chick told me there is a group of women who are judging all flaccid penises not longer than the scrotum as chodes. I thought this was pretty outrageous and very misleading in regards to assumptions of erect penis size based predominantly on the chode label.
---
I wouldn't be wearing those shoulders if I was!
---
Do it!
---
I think I have it but have not assigned it to my inventory bar for reason X. 
---
I did already pick cooking during my visit in Origramm but guess I'll take first aid too unless I can think something better. 
---
Thanks for the tips, appreciate it!
---
Dude, one of the mana fel beasts near the eye of shadow mobs did this to me, was kiting him for a minute then got literally globaled with 3.3k health...
---
The uldum gates is so disappointing.
---
Rip my wallet then lol. Should I save up for edge master or annihilator first? The axe really tickles my fancy
---
Use your professions.
---
As far as cheap shot is concerned, the bug in question happens under the following circumstances:  
---
- You are in stealth  
---
- You remain in stealth and open on a mob with cheap shot  
---
- The combo points are applied, the mob is stunned, you are removed from stealth  
---
- The stunned mob then hits you, or is able to cast on you  
---
- The mob then gets stunned (actually) and the cheap shot takes effect  
---
This bug was actually fixed in the 1.10 patch notes (mirror here: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0) and is returned in Classic.  
---
As for Vanish funkiness, if you watch above and note the time stamps there are 3 different weird things that happen (buffs being applied or not, animations happening but causing no effect) on the same ability. It's not going off as a "fail" in these cases, it's sometimes not even attempting to apply the ability beyond visual.
---
Dude, that's a penis.
---
He’s a hunter, don’t matter to him if it’s hit, crit, spell, chance on melee hit...
---
ahh is that what it is?
---
hunter must be noscope legend
---
I know two mages that have this in their bags because of AoE XP runs. Feels bad.
---
??? I’m EQUIPPING THE GEAR. I’m not selling it. What are you talking about? And it would be the same if healing pre-bis gear was BOE. Imagine a warrior tank or Hunter rolling need because they could sell it when the healer actually needs it. That’s how it is when mages and priests roll NEED on a tank shield when they plan on selling it and when tank rolls need because they are actually equipping it. Doesn’t take a genius to understand
---
Yes the ability which says causes high threat is surprisingly high in threat haha
---
Tanks are basically the only role in the game that actually has to know  dungeon mechanics. People think there's nothing in these dungeons but there's actually a lot of small things that people just never notice as they brainlessly spam 1.
---
the only reason why i'm not full holy yet is because my guild still needs tanks for dungeons. once they get enough warriors and i get enough gear im going full holy
---
Not accurate for feral tanks.
---
It's accurate to say they lack certain abilities/cooldowns that make warriors better overall tanks and it's accurate to say that there are some fights they aren't good in, but it's inaccurate to say they're sub-par.
---
Not only are they equal to warriors on many many boss fights, but there are some fights, especially threat sensitive ones...where feral tanks are *better* than warriors.  The ideal raid group has 2 warriors, one druid OT.  And on fights that don't require bear form, that OT is a better dps and a better healer than a third prot warrior anyway.
---
At risk of going on too long in response to a 3 sentence comment, i'll stop here...but suffice to say you're wrong when it comes to feral tanks.
---
But is arcanite reaper really worth the gold?
---
This reads like those "I'm a mom, you can't be tired" diatribes. Everyone has experiences with every role being shit. It's nothing new. DPS have to deal with tanks that can't hold threat. Healers have to deal with tanks that can't hold threat vs healing aggro. Grats.
---
Yea I am, Bonebiter is sick.
---
I did once try WoW in 2012. I was years younger. I think I was undead warrior or something, hit level 20 or so and then I quit. Can't remember why. 
---
Only thing that's new to me are raids and dungeons. I'm mostly a solo player in any game I play, I'm still terrified by the fact I'm supposed to find a guild and then somehow work together to deal with some monster.
---
I literally play on my alt until my guild calls me to tank a guild run. At least they know what gear I want and roll against me for it (they know, they know...).
---
At lvl 30 I bought all runecloth 14s because im a lock and needed the extra space. The extra space saves time when farming for mount. Worth the 8 or so gold
---
As a bear tank. I'm envious. Very very very....envious.
---
I definitely came to classic for a change of pace. That meant using a class I wasn’t familiar with. I rolled a hunter and leveled up to 37 before I realized that between consumable costs for me, my pet, ammo and other expenses it wasn’t very good on the old pocket book. On top of that was learning just how fast a hunter can run out of mana. Having to drink between every few pulls was a major drag. Then being the only class required to leave room for Jesus on the dance floor in order to even fire my gun was super annoying in tight spaces which dungeons sometimes are.
---
Basically the honeymoon ended and I rerolled to a class I knew from retail but also knew would be very different with how classic handled talents. I can tell you it’s genuinely fun all the way through again but trying to catch back up to friends who play even more than you do? Sucks.
---
With lots of screen flips and screenshots of damage numbers
---
Honestly u should do it if you want. you will enjoy the game more when you look forward to getting new weapons in a spec you want to play and you will have your 1h weapons trained for when u shield tank dungeons!
---
Well put.  I think it's just a misconception from those of us that quit retail much earlier when things like LFD and LFR came out that were catered to make all content accessible to the lowest skill players.
---
We didn't actually play retail raids post Cata nor Mythic.
---
I thought the same as the above comment till I watched some of the raiding.  Certainly the game still behaves in ways I don't envision myself playing but I can see the hardcore or elite players do content that is much more complicated than most if not all of classic.
---
Wow, what a new and original thread!
---
I’ve seen some of this, but our server is pretty anti-meta in pugs. Most people just want to cc and pull slow, and will be ok with speeding but need to be asked first. Idk I think PVE servers are just more relaxed. I’ve had 1-2 bad experiences, but most have been pleasant tanking for pugs.
---
Mankrik pve - horde
---
Wait for bgs and tear some shit up!
---
Well you aren't going to be specced arms in pve. This is because you wont be able to use MS on the boss because of debuff caps. You'd be 2h fury, but that doesnt really work for horde since theres no way to get mace skill. This means you lose a ton of hit and glance way more. Ally has mace spec with humans, but 2h fury isn't very good due to the lack of wind fury. I'm sure you might do OK dps as a human 2h fury with this though.
---
Just checked some spreadsheets, and yeah 2h fury as human doesnt really do comparable dps to any 1h builds. Although you'd still be crushing meme specs and I assume your aoe would be nice.
---
Holy Paladin in PvP is usually just for healing, which is certainly great but for those of us who want to deal considerable burst damage while having utility?  Ret is the way to go.
---
Besides, your point about the potion only works if you *preemptively* use it when going into a fight.  It doesn't clear them away, and you're still consuming an expensive potion.  Blessing of Freedom allows us to use it *reactionary*, while still giving the user immunity to slows and snares.  Once specced, you can only be snared for a small 4 second window.  Plus it's free.
---
Both have their places to be sure, but I'll go Ret for the damage and in combat incapacitate, on top of all that useful utility.
---
Yes except the segment you just clipped is part of an entire article that references theories.... based off vague information from blizzard followed by extensive player testing. 
---
It has been theorized melee is a single roll and then proven quite thoroughly that it is a two roll system by using lower leveled players with debuffs that bring miss rate + crit well above 100%. 
---
Both melee and ranged are two roll system has a much higher chance of being true than any other possibility. 
---
If you would read that entire article start to finish and look up the data references for that article, it is very hard to disagree.
---
Meh, just pick your foes. The only ones that beat enhancement shaman in PvP are rogues and fury warriors.
---
Oof, I feel attacked.
---
Hunters want tier, not those bracers.
---
Oh if DPS actually let us know, most of the time they just help us without saying anything, like pulling that second pack &lt;3
---
yeah it doesn't look all that far from guards
---
The most important lesson I learned so far is you dont need to hold threat on everything. 
---
Even with guildies, actually especially with guildies, as they are getting better geared it's harder to hold threat on everything but the trade off is everything dies faster and the healers have more healing and mana so they dont need to worry about the heals as much. 
---
I usually find my role is to tank the most dangerous threats which are usually the melee enemies and let the squishy ones be tanked by dps. After all you're just as likely to take a 1300 hit fireblast as much as the rogue is.
---
Also, this anecdotal but I never actually see people complain to tanks about their tanking unless people are constantly dying and that usually happens because of the 2handed/dual wield tanking that every "tank" wants to do. 
---
I do think theres a good chunk of people that are projecting what they're feelings are onto others then. It actually occurring.
---
Regarding healers I find the rule of thumb is wait for 50% if it dips below that wait 3 secs to see if they start drinking, if they dont then you're good if they do you wait till around 75% to pull at which point they will have recover 100% of their mana by the time they need to start healing you.
---
Lastly, the one thing I see people complain about but barely ever see, is marking. A lot of tanks seem to assume everyone understands the priority but I can say for a fact my priorities when tanking will not always be the same as another tanks.
---
It's a great specialist class, but your farming scales terribly with gear since pet aggro doesn't. In MC gear you have to let your pet growl 3+ times before starting your rotation. It leads to a ton of time where you just wait.
---
Up to you. You can defend yourself in world PvP in your +damage gear but as you decide to take PvP more seriously and competitively you'll definitely want to balance taking more stamina and stay away from gear with only damage unless its REALLY good. Can't think of a Priest example off the top of my head but for a Warrior think Lionheart. Right now there isn't a ton of difference since gear selection is more limited and MC itemization is a trainwreck, but high-end PvP gear has a lot of stamina. Take a look: https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=390
---
Do the beads and feathers give the same rep after revered??
---
Yea, this post isn't going the way you imagined. Sulfuras is actually only decent for pally / sham, otherwise there are better options. Being a GM is a huge endeavor, simply getting priority on a meme weapon is fine IMO.
---
The problem is what people consider a problem. You say you've had nothing but great experiences but what if I told you my version of a great experience is a standard run killing every enemy in small groups and taking two 5-10 minute breaks? I like to go slow and socialize. 
---
Obviously I'm not going to force people to go at my pace. In pug you should go with the middle ground of what everyone wants. For me, this usually means cutting the breaks and aggroing a couple more mobs than I'm comfortable with. Hell, I've even done the whole AoE pull thing when I joined a group of mages.
---
However for the one DPS who wants to AoE pull, or skip mobs, or more often: do every single little thing their way IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD. These are the people who make tank lives so infuriating. They comment on every mistake or break formation to do things THEIR way. It's not even the cleanup I mind it's the disrespect. They care so little for how others want to play that they will go out of his way to belittle or force others into playing their way without a care in the world for their feelings.
---
Tanks have enough to worry about, don't pile your preferences on top of that. Don't put your comfort over theirs.
---
BoPs are also bags of gold.  smaller, much higher drop rate bags of gold.  if you really want to make a lot of gold it makes the most sense to need everything
---
I'm gonna be honest with you, 40 runs is absolutely nothing. It's an incredibly low drop chance, and you'd have to be pretty lucky to catch it in your first 40 runs.
---
Also it doesn't give hit LOLLL
---
Also I lowkey hope classic wow alternate universe happens and they develop it further without adding all the dungeon queue class homogenized bullshit. Like.... little talent tweaks? Maybe a taunt for pallies? Some int/str/stam plate that I dont have to clear naxx for? Bah I'm complaining while sitting on my free horse what am I doing
---
Please record and submit this. I've tried fighting back, both on and off the ledge. The second I dotted the enemy or tried to death coil/fear, the guards aggro'd and killed me. They were left alone. Had a spriest hit me up with dots, stood next to the guards and they didn't do anything. Tried with direct damage spells too, didn't matter. He could freely attack me while I got killed.
---
This spot is an exploit using building geometry to avoid guard aggro. I provided a blue post from a GM stating this is against TOS. Please stop trying to justify these types of players. If you want to wpvp, take it outside the town or take your death inside.
---
Did anyone say Mortalol - The master of ninjalooting?
---
I definitely think everyone should roll need on high value items. An analogy I like to use is what if you're running live strat with a priest that is trying to make Truefaith Vestments. Would you pass him all of the orbs just because he's the only one that would actually use them and not just sell them? Hell no. Especially if it's just a group of randoms.
---
I love this game.
---
Hunter's dont need True Flight wrists though, it's for tanks/furies.
---
Factions stuck on separate layers.
---
Good design.
---
Can I pre HOT the tank before a pull or does that just add more threat to me?
---
Can someone explain the significance of this? 
---
Saw this on r/all
---
You're right, it's wrong to expect the tanks wet dream every run, but I would certainly enjoy an  equilibrium shift a little more in that direction. I personally don't like the mentality of the run gets done, who cares?
---
There are any number of ways to play the game in ways it wasn't designed to be played. We could have all melee groups and whoever gets attack equips a shield and there's a bandaid fest after each pull. Just cuz it works doesn't mean it's fun. I personally enjoy the 3 role based group. Tank,3dps,healer. In this setup the tank controls the mobs and shuts down incoming damage. That's the mmo contract. What we have here is a bunch of retail folks mashing their buttons and brute forcing every encounter. I mean, sure? It works, but it's a clusterfuck of mobs running all over the place, way less Mana efficient and personally not fun.
---
Gold for your main is more important then loot for an alt!
---
Now I'm interested to see if the participation ratios are the same in Vanilla and Classic. I'm guessing a lot of people playing Classic now played Vanilla back in the day but have more responsibilities now and can't put in the time to build that sort of community.
---
Everyone is so shocked about price going up on golden pearls. I attribute it to the increase in demand/ have you ever farmed them it sucks balls.
---
Cause you had tons of rested xp
---
you should play on a pve server since those are your concerns just like I lock my doors at night since getting robbed are my concerns. thanks.
---
you chose a path and now you're dealing with the consequences that are both legal and allowed in the terms of service. adjust your path rather than asking for the rules to be changed to your desires.
---
Pretty sure your tabard tells us exactly how you feel... 🤣
---
As a holy pally, don't innervate us. Part of our strength is mana efficiency. I see priests go oom all the time though (and idk about druids). 
---
If a pally in your raid goes 100% oom, he f'd up. A mana pot is more than enough for just about every single fight. In case of emergency, he should have a rune available.
---
So one guy asks why tanks are in such supply in an unrelated Reddit thread and you decide to mockingly associate  that question with "dps"(even though the person asking didn't say what role he played) and then rant about it, acting as if it's some big question that people are always asking? 
---
Very rational stuff.
---
To a degree... It's not hard just monotonous.
---
&gt; Plate dps in my mind should be the most polite and submissive dps because they are the least wanted
---
That's only true if you exclusively run as dps. If you are willing and able to tank then you are pretty hot commodity.
---
The video you sap.
---
Nah, Elevator boss is by far the strongest.
---
https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/414/the-egregious-classic-resto-shaman-progressive-bis
---
Nothing more hunter than not even knowing what percentage you're rolling on, cause fuck it, I need it either way.
---
At the base of it all, I tank because I have a lot of insecurities and I'm extremely lonely IRL.  
---
Being a cheerful tank in game makes it easy for me to surround myself with whoever I want around, and of course I use that chance to surround myself with the nicest people I meet. There are plenty of terrible pugs in between, but my friends list has exploded and I can almost always invite at least a couple of people to my dungeon runs. It is an easy way for me to make friends and feel wanted.
---
As a side note; My main has always been a Druid tank since Vanilla so that's what I rolled in Classic and it was kinda miserable. By level 43 I finally decided to give it a break and try Pally tanking. I highly recommend it if you haven't... using mana instead of rage and having massive AoE threat (including -30% threat gen blessing for all those gung-ho Mages, Warlocks, Hunters, etc...) has made my tanking waaaaaay less stressful! I still have groups with people that annoy me, but I'm always able to make up for their mistakes on the Paladin in ways that my Druid never could.
---
Can't speak to gph, I don't do it enough, but princess is easy enough to kite with cheetah. Just takes 4-5 mins to kill her if you don't want to take risks. Send your pet in when the fartstorm is off cooldown to tempt her into using it, use the channel time to cast an aimed shot. Outrange the cast when she's throwing a boulder and use the extra distance to cast multishot.
---
Feign and drop immolation if you're feeling fancy.
---
If she manages to throw a boulder, hotkey disable cheetah before it hits. The knockdown procs before the damage so this is easy if you're paying attention.
---
reported him for botting because thats not a human being controlling that character
---
So back in vanilla wow, some raiding guilds used a "DKP" system.  This stands for "Dragon Kill Points" and came out of a previous MMO.  DKP is just a way for guilds to measure how much participation you have in other raids so that they can more fairly distribute loot.   
---
An example DKP system can work like this:  Every piece of gear that drops is bid on by players.  They can bid up to how much dkp they have.  The winning bid gets the loot and the dkp is spread to everyone else in the raid evenly.  Or, the dkp system can be simular to that, and instead reward 1,2,3 dkp etc per kill based on difficulty, and bid dkp vanishes into air.   Or the dkp automatically uses half your dkp for the bid, and the person with the highest current dkp always wins.   
---
It's not always one system.  It's a way to provide clarity to splitting loot fairly.
---
I mean its an emotional rant. Who said anything about rationality? If it bothers you, move on brah. Or don't I don't really give a shit
---
Break up with him so he ha more time to play

Right? It only takes 5 seconds and I get free loot AND don't pull agro. Yay!
---
so then you have a corruption slot
---
I left for Earthfury. 100% better experience on a balanced server. Stuck it out for a few weeks on Skeram then either decided I would quit WoW or transfer. 8/2 ratio is not fun for either side. Had to leave before HKs came out. If scumbag Horde players are camping the few ally that stayed and not even getting honor I can only imagine when honor is out. GL
---
I was talking about hunters, not warriors. I'm fully aware SGC is BIS for a while for warriors, but saying "its not a good chest" for hunters is completely wrong.
---
 😂 fair enough I was only jk anyways you have plenty of shards
---
However else everyone feels about it, if I’m the tank, and I lose the roll to a mage for tanking gear that I need, I’m leaving the group asap
---
Tried again, even reinstalled Bartender, it doesn't work.
---
I hate you and I think I might’ve been the hunter in your group who cried when you won the sav glad
---
bro it looks like you scooped some cantalope
---
Gotta get them greater fire prot potions.
---
No, because I think they should get them.
---
Thousand Needles.  Shimmering Flats.
---
It's blade flurry.  It's an amazing skill but can't be used until the tank has some threat on all mobs. Many rogues don't want to wait.
---
Were you dancing on the mailbox again?
---
Use your long practiced WOW skills to succeed and accumulate wealth and success in real life.
---
Yes, nearly all builds are great for PvP because druid is one of the best pvp classes in general.
---
if it isn't obvious already maybe retail is for you, good luck
---
If you're in a pug you're safer needing but in a world where people aren't braindead and actually do what's intended, need is for an item you need as an upgrade to equip. Greed is for money (hence the symbol).
---
My group of people always hit greed on every rare purple or blue bird that has ever dropped, period. (Unless it's an upgrade)
---
If you're with guild / friends you can use greed properly, if not seems like most people need all boes these days.
---
That’s a night elf sandwich I could get in on !
---
I have the very first soulshard I got from killing another player in my bank to keep as a memory. "Deprave" on Fairbanks, your soul is mine now, and forever.
---
Yeah pretty much that. I recommend buying blue bows/guns every 10 levels or so, so that the auto shoot does kill them within the stings duration. Or if you can easily get a good quest one.  
---
For example I bought the ranger now at 20, the now I’m currently using a 2.10 speed lvl 34 bow now (can’t remember the name). Next I’ll get the bow from King Bangladesh quest and after that I’ll get verdants aim from Maraudon princess quest. 
---
I bought the guide.
---
In layered servers the time is different
---
and those that lacked the foresight to think ahead will always have a rougher life than those who did have the foreign to think ahead in all aspects of life in any shape, form, whatsoever.
---
Bro isn’t there a weapon chain enchant you can apply that makes you immune to disarm
---
If it was BoE worth a lot then that is completely and totally fair. If the items are worth hundreds and hundreds of gold then everyone should roll.
---
Thank you for putting out a guide for the rest of us! I haven’t gotten the chance to watching the guide just yet as I’m still at work, but was wondering if being engineer was necessary or if you can buy the items from AH/transfer from an alt?
---
I’m 300 skinning and just dropped LW - was hoping I could pick mining up in addition to skinning, but if engineering is a must I would also drop skinning in favor of mining and engineering. 
---
Thanks again for the guide though, will watch it later!
---
That is crazy low on the lotus I feel.   My server 60g lotus, 50-60 crystal not sure on pearl.
---
“It’s a principle”. Okay.
---
No achievements.  #1change.
---
Depending on the group and the type of targets, I find that the initial threat on pull plus a Maul and a demo roar is usually enough to keep the skull on me until it's \~30%. At that point, letting it turn around and hit the rogue or warrior dps isn't a huge deal. If it starts wandering towards the mage, let it. The mage and other dps (assuming they're focusing it) should kill it quickly enough. Focusing too much on that single target almost guarantees that other splash dmg will pull the other dudes off of you, and then its a circus.
---
There's plenty capable of tanking.  They just don't want to tank for pugs.
---
Also the mentality has changed.  It's not just 'gogogo' mentality, people are whinier, less forgiving, etc of tanks and healers and much more selfish in general...so the tank capable class players become selfish in a defensive manner as well.
---
PVP servers are only fun when they are fresh but at this point lvling up sucks due to ganking.
---
There isn't much "fair" pvp happening if just getting ganked or attacked while you are fighting a mob.
---
And so did groups of pugs in mostly green gear.
---
Is that map also from ElvUI? If not, what addon is it from?
---
It heals the boss? What do you mean?
---
1. Costs 30g+ per one weapon
---
2. Takes up enchant slot
---
Might as well not be in game
---
Grow some nuts and help put your comrades, scum.
---
Yes I will, but I want go get it in a more refined, less embarrassing state. Once that is the case, I will send you a PM and probably make a post about it
---
Doesn’t matter, if people aren’t willing to pay that much he’ll never sell em. Demand dictates the prices.
---
Lol funny you mention the focal sword. I was running someone for mara ring. I do tinkerer and the sword dropped. The rogue asked if he could take it. I questioned him and just said sure I supposed but I'd like the vendor price on it. 
---
He's in for a surprise when he realizes its a caster sword.
---
Man I spent days looking for the crimson felt hat and these gloves dropped 2/3 of the time
---
Yep, black dragonscale BiS. Pants, boots, shoulders for 1 hit, 2 crit and can still wear edgies :)
---
I don’t play wow, but I saw this on r/all. Someone mind filling me in? I play OSRS, I’m assuming this gear is similar to say acquiring an accomplishment inferno cape w/ maxed gear?
---
I would ask you give screenshots to this effect, but I know there are none, because I never said that. What i did say, was that I was considering passing it to someone that needed it more than me. After I won the roll, and that consideration became a distinct possibility, and considering how hard the tanks had all worked to get this kill, I thought it would be the most equitable to let them have it. And, to add to my own shame, i was knocked into the whelps and almost wiped the group, so compared to them, I believe I deserved it least of all. Had we one shot it and walked away and I had won it, things could have felt very different. 
---
As an aside, I think tanks have the hardest job, and if I can do something to make their life better, I will try to do that. I don't think that makes me an idiot or a dickhead.
---
TL;DR I didn't know i was going to give it away until I actually won it. Kind of like how you bring a condom to a date, only to throw it away when she asks you to stick it raw. The only constant is change.
---
I saw about 5 of these drop while I was farming my healer robes.
---
If you are in a guild raid, any decent healer is going to notice the innervate mana immediately and be very thankful for it. That is worth more than topping meters with a regular group. If you are pugging and there is some sort of concern that your direct performance on the meters is going to determine whether you get any gear, sure use it on yourself. Although, the better situation is to not run with a group that cares at all about healing meters. A healer's job is to keep the group up. That often means for a druid to use innervate on a healer that can more effectively use the extra mana.
---
My mistake, I just assume it’s warriors at this point since it’s so good for them.

Sounds like you're just a slow leveler who isn't very social so you just vent here instead of finding good players to do dungeons with.
---
just switch layers, it takes like 10 minutes tops.
---
I am guessing your alliance because you never used Axe of  Orgrimmar
---
No changes
---
I'm sure there are more casual players who don't go full classic consumable/world buff tryhard that want to improve their logs as well.  There are over 20k unique fury warriors alone on WCL right now.  It's not some tiny subsection of top tier people that use logs, which are just more accurate DPS meters with extra steps.  
---
The point that I'm making, and I was probably too sarcastic before, was that I don't understand how you can think it's ok to be proud of a Ragnaros kill in general, but not to be proud of actually performing well during said kill.
---
Looks more like somewhere in North America

9 Pumpkins!

Actually love your style, even If I don't win, any chance I could buy one? :-)

 Followed you on your IG too! Keep goin
---
Planning on rerolling to Pagle from a PvP server since I want a healthy alliance population and I don't care as much about WPVP.
---
Do PvE servers last as long as PvP servers? Pagle is definitely the most populated PvE server, but I want to make sure that the server is still there a while from now.
---
Also, is it better to play on a highly populated server when it comes to end-game stuff, or will it be too difficult to even level with the high population?
---
Well, queues will be a problem. I don't play on faerlina so I can't say exactly how long they are, but you can't just log in and play whenever you want. You may have to wait in a queue for an hour or two before you can log in. I would guess low level areas are completely packed, which is good and bad. Finding groups for content will probably be very easy (relatively), but some quests will be such a pain in the ass due to every mob having its spawn point camped that you just have to skip them.
---
"Server is dead at 3am on Monday morning, time to pack it up boys"
---
I read a huge post that stated all this and no one refuted it.
---
40/60 is fair? That’s one third less players. Good luck winning Alterac Valley with only 26 players against 40. Or 10 players in Arathi vs 15.
---
change layers yourself! takes like 10 mins max for 2 raid groups
---
As a prot warrior, I don't mind PW:S as long as I've established threat first. Once you see a few sunders on my target and I have some rage in the tank, bubble away. Especially if it's a boss who's beating the shit out of me.
---
This is the most annoying thing about Classic. Everyone thinks they're an expert, they expect everyone else to be an expert, but they also constantly look for things to criticize. Then the dps fight for top of the meters in a 5 man so they can prove how good they are.
---
I did a BRD run the other day with 1 chill friend, and 3 pugs that had never done the dungeon before. It was a smooth and enjoyable run. The next day I did it with an "expert" in the group that insisted on navigating, and it was a wipefest, took longer than the other run, and we never finished (we went as far as the bar then all left).
---
No way, first 5 runs it dropped 3 times, 2 times healers were happy and the 3rd time I kept it as a roleplaying hat, might have vendored tho
---
Can confirm, I am priest and accidentally rolled need on the +20 attack power staff in SM thinking it was the other staff that drops in the same instance off the other boss, and lucky me I won the roll. I have Never seen so much butt hurt over a level 30 blue but I did feel really bad at the time and I accepted the flame that followed. Won’t happen again, at least it didn’t happen in endgame when gear actually matters
---
Welps in the badlands, there’s people there but the money is fantastic
---
Ret to seal of command and pursuit of justice, then holy to 5/5 illumination, then the rest where you want. Plenty of healing power with an int set and good questing solo sustainability
---
Believe me when I say they dropped a million times for me
---
&gt;If I had to do it again Id go sword n board all the way and avoid any 2h groups like the plague.
---
Use a 2h/dw on the first few pulls to test the healer, if you feel it's risky then adjust accordingly. 
---
While leveling doing a 2handed sweeping strike/whirlwind combo and then switching to a shield gives you the best of both worlds.
---
This implies paladins have a taunt. We do not.
---
We do have fantastic AOE threat, which is great for 5 mans and Phase 1 Nefarion,  but the lack of a taunt makes it so that we can't really tank raids. Paladins tanks also suffer large problems with mana starvation. Paladin tanks weren't really  viable in raids until Burning Crusade when they added a taunt and a mechanic to get mana back.
---
time to blacklist everyone who said nothing \*muwhaha

Is there any advantage between dwarf/nightelf doing this?

*cries in druid*
---
you'd want green mobs. I like the centaurs of SE desolace, troll camp in SE Arathi, or the non-elite ogres of alterac valley. All will have some amount of horde though. Not sure how to avoid that.
---
Are the videos from a private server or something? You click on mobs, and the die right away.
---
We have a spy on our hands...
---
\#nochanges is TOTALLY OK with fixing these map bugs which enable griefing and always has been. It is 100% worth fixing. Just put up one invisible wall and bam, you never get any more tickets for this nonsense that is wasting customer service's time.
---
Or better yet, if I were blizz, I'd write a program which waits for exploiters to use known exploit spots (very easy to do), and if they kill multiple people from there you just permaban them and their whole damn bnet account for all I care. It breaks the ToS BYE!
---
Server A has 50k horde and 20k alliance
---
Server B has 10k horde and 20k alliance
---
so you open free transfers from A to B for horde until the populations are more balanced.
---
In the case of a new server, you start by offering free transfers to horde on high horde servers and alliance on high alliance servers. Once the biggest chunk of transfers have occurred, you open it up to new players while limiting the availability to the higher ratio faction once the realm reaches a certain amount of characters.
---
Like I said, there are people who are paid to come up with these ideas who I'm sure will do a better job, so digging too deep into a random redditors comment on a possible solution is pointless. It will never be perfect, but Blizz absolutely could have handled it better and tried to limit the faction imbalances.
---
&gt;Thinking about switching my profs to enchanting for money making
---
You're probably not going to be happy with the result.
---
You *can* turn a profit with enchanting, but be aware that not only is it expensive to level up (you're losing out on all the gold from gear you could be vendoring), you can't pop your goods on the auction house and have a passive income.
---
Enchanting is an active-income job, but if you like hawking in cities, then that might be your gig.
---
I honestly believe that you're better off keeping mining, *but* I also believe that every server has a pretty shoddy economy for gathering professions. The economies weren't meant for 20,000 gatherers, and it's crappy to see a stack of herb/ore/leather go for 10% over vendor price on the AH. 
---
Go farm yourself some thorium and sell the arcane crystals. Those will at least sell!
---
Pretty sure it opens during BC. I tried to play it back in the day but the zone is so small and flooded with people doing the new content the shit ran terrible
---
It's not only cheap shot, it's just about every CC that's broken that way. I've stopped counting the number of times I scatter shot a mob only to have it hit me right away.
---
It's like the spell is cast and affects the mob on one batch but the actual CC is only applied on the next batch.
---
Can I get a rundown of this?
---
*FESTINA LENTE*
---
Get it tattooed.

Ally mage - Theramore or feathermoon is the obvious choice

Time to reroll

Use both of course. Trinket swap!

The 7 weap skill from edgemasters is worth 3 hit, more than the devilsaur set bonus.

Yellow hitcap don't mean shit since 70% of a good rogues dmg output is in white hits

For someone who got lvl 32 and quit, what am I looking at here?
---
edit: I only quit for personal reasons, games great
---
Y'all are all missing the point that a shaman tank build is literally 1/3 complete in classic. Where the other classes, with war bring the most complete, are way more complete and hence why they are viable tanks.
---
Stop but picking half sentences to correct from this post.
---
Sheesh. I was attempting to point out an obvious class design that was never completed in WoW.
---
lmao ur this mad. u seriously think imma be raiding within a day to give u logs?
---
This dumbass is calling tanks entitled, yet seems to think he's owed a tank for every dungeon run. Fuck pot, kettle. All these complaints about people not wanting to tank your dungeon just crack me up. Nobody owes anybody shit when it comes to them joining or you joining their group.
---
600 seems to be a bit much, I've seen 3 drop in like 30 runs, meanwhile 150+ runs and zero HoJ drops.
---
No one with a mana bar should be with melee ever on Rag.
---
Completed flasks are only like 55g-70g depending on when you get them (Wednesdays they go up to 90g easy).
---
Guys Blizz don't give NO shits.
---
lmao i've raided literally every vanilla dungeon and raid killed every boss numerous times playing p servers over the past years. not everyone is a dumbass who had to wait for blizz to spoonfeed them classic wow xD
---
gouge, backstab
---
What is t1 prot?
---
:(
---
It has two benefits for healers. Crit and mp5. Only one stat for dps.
---
Weakauras2
---
its BIS for them, and mage /lock. But, the Staff of Dominance, cant be used by pallies. SO, we prioritize the pally healers for the mage blade.
---
Honestly, I have never come across so many bugs in a game that have caused so much death. Blizzard really needs to turn their attention to Silithus its out of hand
---
Mind control makes the target your ally, so no your faction can't hit it, but you can run them off ledges, into mobs, etc.
---
You're 'rotation' sort of depends on if you're getting the opening or not.  If you can get a cast off first, open with a cast (at your level either Holy Fire or Smite because they take longer to cast) and follow that up a DoT like DP or SW:P.  
---
Effective times to use Psychic Scream are to get a melee off you and get distance, or used to stop them from casting a healing spell (or any cast for that matter if that next cast is going to hurt you really badly)
---
I’ve got 401 SP can I pm you?
---
I just completed a 2 week 250 run grind with my buddy and he finally got it. We’re not really sure the exact number, could be as low as 200 but it sure as fuck felt like 250.
---
is MC only raid? lmaoo all these retail kids who were shitting their pants when wow first came out and who weren't smart enough to play on p servers thinking they know all this shit LMFAO
---
im glad they made classic but I dont think they care much about it.
---
No beta. No communication. Myriad of bugs still present from early beta.
---
The crystals are very rare, which is why they are so valuable yes. But once you get a nice spot to farm it's all good. And yes, it's a status symbol but pretty much my pre raid BIS
---
It's also something I wanted from before launch. So it was a goal i set to reach. Become axesmith and make arcanite reaper
---
I really underestimate how selfish most players are I guess. I have multiple tanks in my guild who do that sort of thing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . 
---
Or skip MTT and settle for a staggering 6 or 7 less spell power from second wind and/or your DM trinket
---
I stop healing tanks that do that and place a bubble. I'm not wasting a ton of mana on a greater heal while you're reduced 50%.
---
&gt; If it bothers you, move on brah
---
Oh the irony.
---
Sorry, when you say update, do you mean via, say, the Twitch app?
---
That's an easy replacement. Rogues are by far the most abundant class considering their actual use.
---
Looks like courage the cowardly dogs house.
---
It's still a great piece for a hunter, especially one who is just starting MC.
---
I think you're missing the point here, it's a breaker of organic gameplay interaction.. You could be completely oblivious as to the fact that anything is even happening.
---
Heya! https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ice-hud is what I use
---
Retail is easy unless you're pushing mythic content, which is literally the only thing fun on retail. Everything else is exactly how you described. I also recommend classic.
---
Ehhh, I’d say ZG is also about equal, seeing as Org is just a zeppelin ride away.
---
Pre raid bis ofc, I will stick to my Dreadforge Retaliator tho
---
Everyone knows you're full of shit. Either you have downs or this is some next level trolling.
---
&gt;Who won it =(
---
Dreadmist got layers removed.
---
Corpse camping and murdering someone repeatedly (especially in a group like OP is talking about) doesn’t make them “better” than you. You spawn with 50% hp and basically no mana. 
---
Yeah, you’re a real bigshot.
---
&gt; Right now I Power World: Shield myself, Dispel Magic them, Devouring Plague them, Shadow Word: Pain them, Mind Blast, Psychic Scream if I need it, Mind Flay if they are trying to run, and I have health/mana potions too. I wand if I can't cast anything that makes sense at that time and Mind Blast is on cooldown.
---
Fear is one of the better ones to use early because it gives you a chance to slap on DoT's without being interrupted, once they're on you basically have to stay alive long enough for them to kill whoever they're on.
---
&gt;How does Mind Control work? If I'm with a buddy and I MC an enemy, can I have the enemy stand there while my buddy pummels him?
---
Nope, when you mind control them you basically become them and they are part of your faction for the period you are mind controlled. You can buff them, heal them and a bunch of other stuff, but you cannot kill them (Except for running them off cliffs, into mobs or into lava).
---
I have a demon blade of the tiger and julie's dagger as my OH, tryna get a scarlet kris or alcor's sunrazor. Backstab is way more efficient damage wise tho this is a well known things its not even worth debating, it does far more damage per unit of energy used. SS and hemo kinda suck , they are only useful for generating CPs.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ice-hud Here you :D
---
Yeah, send me your SP crit and hit and I'll tell you what your stat weights are with and without world buffs when I get home
---
For example, in BRD there are two kinds of fire elemental.  Blazing Fireguard, and a Fireguard Destroyer.  The Destroyer has a front arc spell that hits everyone pretty hard and should be turned away from group if the group isn't of a high level and can dps them down quickly.
---
&gt;  the game hasn't been out long enough that people are helping each other out of friendliness. 
---
Speak for yourself chief.
---
Blizzard is highly unlikely to \*force\* people back to Skeram. They left for a myriad of reasons, and to force them to return here would be a huge slap in the face to the community.  
---
Best case scenario is, they open transfers for Alliance to come to Skeram and hope people take them up on it. They could also offer players the ability to change their faction, and hope the population gets a little closer to balance that way. However, I'm not an idiot. I find it highly unlikely anyone is gonna actually want to come here to play Alliance.
---
it's all about relative utility. BoP items vendor for a gold or two, but they offer a substantial upgrade for someone who can actually use it. This math is well understood and underpins need-before-greed looting. BoE epics, on the other hand, can potentially sell on the AH for many times what any Blue would vendor for, and as a result, the calculation is more complicated. A Warden Staff, the BiS mitigation weapon for a Druid tank for *all of Classic*, dropping for a group with a Druid tank illustrates the dynamic: that is potentially the only BoE epic any of the party members have seen. It happens to be a Druid item. They could give it to the Druid out of the goodness of their hearts, or: the Mage could sell it to buy the mats for his Robe of the Archmage, the Priest could sell it to buy the mats for his Truefaith Vestments, so on and so forth. Shit, even the Druid could sell it to buy the Pristine Hide of the Beast to craft his BiS chest (and simply get the 2h from DM:T instead). Either way, BoE epics are "bags of gold" as the guy above you commented.

Like I said, 600 is 120 hours. Me and my buddy did 5 runs in 20ish min then logged to alts until our saves expired. To commit 5 solid days worth of resets to this is just really unlikely. Like I said, not impossible, just very unlikely.

Like... not even close. Our tanks can hold aggro with no issue with blue quest reward weapons, an MC dagger isn’t going to help that. MC weapons full stop shouldn’t be going to tanks over DPS, it’s *far* more benefit to the raid to give them to DPS.
---
Our tanks have passed on every single MC weapon, they don’t need them at all.
---
Manually through the healbot interface. I am not at my gaming rig so cannot screenshot it for you.

It blows my mind that some people will screenshot some shit, post it to reddit, and wait for answers before just chilling out for a second and trying again.

Some people need more patience and less time at the computer.
---
Healing in retail I would literally just tell dps "it's not my fault, you should try taking less damage" and the tank would back me up.  (I would only say stuff like that when people were taking avoidable damage that I couldn't heal through for w/e reason.)  As a tank in retail, I'd tell people the same thing even if it wasn't causing death-sized problems.  
---
I can't imagine having to heal in classic.  I feel like dps coming from retail who never played back in vanilla/BC are probably going to be terrible to play with.  The few instances I've run in classic have been with competent tanks and healers, who were also upfront about their shortcomings, and dps who were pretty cool and accepted fault when applicable.
---
My attitude is just ‘fuck the haters’. I routinely get comments that I’m a good tank. The one off comment that I’m a bad tank doesn’t phase me. This is in part due to my ‘attitude’. I pay attention to the healer’s mana. &lt; 50% and we don’t pull the next pack. If somebody pulls for me they get to tank that pack. Attack the mob I don’t mark more than a couple times (sometimes mistakes happen) and they get to tank that mob. 
---
I don’t mind a DPS dying. It will just take a tiny bit longer. My job is not to protect people from being dumbasses. My job is to keep the healer from getting punched in the face and to keep the DPS who are attacking the correct mob from being punched in the face. 
---
I don’t mind being expected to know the dungeon inside and out. Even when I’m not tanking the party leader role usually kinda defaults to me anyways because nobody else steps up. I just watch a full walkthrough before I run it. 
---
Yes, I have an inflated ego and thick skin. Yes, I can be a bit of a jackass to dumbasses who refuse to take requests like ‘please attack skull’. That’s what it takes to be a good tank and I’m at least a decent one.

After this happened we all agreed not to let it happen again. I for one did not want to cause drama with my passing the head to another, I simply thought I was doing the right thing. I did not know that giving an item to another person that I won was a controversial act, and in the future, I think we will all be more careful.

TOEP on bosses for sure

It leaves you so damn thirsty for a new adventure!!!

Hell, i'm easy, just remix some of Ulduar and I'll be happy.

No.  Rolling a character does not come from choosing your "role".  It literally comes from pen and paper RPGs when talking about choosing stats for you character via dice rolls.  It has NEVER had anything to do with "role".  
---
It literally just means creating a character originally taken from the context of Pen and Paper RPGs.
---
It took me 15 runs. I got so freaking lucky.
---
Would not compare a competitive PvP shooter versus a non competitive PvE+PvP mmo

or the raid tab in the social window in game

You can run to a different GY to Rez...
---
As someone who now plays horde almost exclusively due to IRL friends, the only alliance characters that pull on my heartstrings are NE druids, human pallies and dwarf rogues. 
---
I miss them so dearly.
---
They did reply to the hunters after a 200+ post thread on the forums... hoping they can at least make a note of this.
---
Lmao nice one. It's funny because I'm an engineer and programmer. You don't know what you're talking about
---
You go around oneshotting fools of course
---
How do you get the “extended character stats”?
---
does it not proc on melee white crits?
---
I guess that turned into the Worgen's travel mode thing?
---
I'm a mage and when the archmage robe pattern dropped I let everyone roll on it cause that's fair. Not as expensive of an example but it was early in classic and was worth over 100g at the time. It just makes sense. We all have an equal chance for a payday. Most of those epic BoE's are just very, very minor upgrades to farmable dungeon items or quest items. Because this marginal difference makes them best in slot sometimes, the prices of those items are insanely high and normally not worth buying unless you're just loaded. Just cause one guy would rather equip it than auction it doesnt mean he should have any priority.
---
I can't believe how many didn't even respond. 
---
This actually makes me feel a lot better about the interactions I've had in game. Almost all have been positive. Most people acknowledge a good turn but every so often they don't and it's bugged me. It won't anymore lol.
---
was he sood?

---
A lot of locks will lifetap until they're so low a stiff breeze will kill them.  It's almost as annoying as feign death.
---
Sure, if they are doing dumb stuff like that and are being rude, I'd probably kick them(goes for any player).
---
But from my expirence so far I've found dps warriors pretty agreeable. I usualy tell them to tank the priority target for rage, which allows me more time to build a lead on the other mobs.
---
There's some good rogue leveling guides on youtube. Personally I went with swords. Either way, you want to get blade flurry talent asap (lvl 30 i believe).
---
It’s not good for hunters as in if you want the reputation for taking the only thing warriors have as RAID bis then go ahead. I took the bow off 2nd boss mc and I still get shit for it even though we were no where near killing major domo at the time. Haven’t seen a leaf yet so I’m sticking with my guns on this one. Was better for us progression wise to get it.
---
Yep it's a very very important piece for fury tanking
---
It’s an addon called extended character stats :)
---
That’s total bullshit. They are mad because they didn’t get it. Especially since (it sounds like) DPS is your main spec/role. They should have been happy you were doing them the solid of playing healer.
---
Anyone else notice after a patch 1-2 weeks ago you can’t toggle off your poisons anymore?
---
Fury warriors have dick all upgrades in MC.  It's all tank gear
---
Hello! I try throw this question here.
---
I do not understand why you would prefer to have ”click to cast” instead of click your target and then dynamicly cast your spells with fingers and keybinds. To me it seems like the later alternative is quicker and overall better. If your mouse is occupied and the main thing you use to get heals out, that must meen that its harder to move and look around..? Less mobility..?
---
Click target and heal with keybinds makes you more mobile... maybe mobility isnt a thing in classic healing.
---
This is random thoughts. Please educate me.
---
To do what exactly?
---
Interesting. Are you opening with scatter shot in that case from not combat? I'd be curious to see how that plays out.  
---
I know some hunters are complaining that FD is working similar to Vanish bugs, but scatter shot has a few different things going on probably (for one, you're not stealthed and untargetable when you cast it).
---
Yes - if I can travel 60% faster, the way I see it is that I'm about to be 60% more efficient with my limited playtime (about 2 hrs/night)
---
Broke but mobile.
---
Black lotus 70g. Mograine EU Horde. Sold one just like an hour ago
---
I just got my HoJ, 150~ runs. Only seen it drop once. I feel your pain
---
Are you skipping the installation process? It's the first thing it asks you to do and it should set it all up for you based on your choices. Copy pasting someone else's setup is likely to make things worse because their UI scale almost certainly won't be the exact same as yours.
---
ElvUI works out of the box, no configuration needed except for doing the bare minimum setup process and then maybe toggling your anchors.
---
YouTube recommends are trash regardless.  If you block out that one type of video, it'll just do it with another.  I wipe my entire youtube profile every few months just to clean out the crap that accumulates.  Unfortunately, that's just resulted in crappy clips from TV shows now, which I'm sure have been paying a ton to be spot #1 on YouTube.
---
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim.

Port warrior here with full pre-raid BIS on Mankrik looking for a raid team. Hit me up.

I've been lasher farming on my priest.  I average just over 40g per hour and it's SUPER easy.  I watch shows on hulu while I'm doing it.  It's a nice and relaxing farm.  The only problem with it tbh is you can easily do more than 5 per hour so you have to twiddle your thumbs a bit between runs or you'll get locked out.  I personally go and kill a few satyrs for chance at felcloth and demonic runes.  Don't push your luck though, they hit really hard!  
---
I don't know what the other guy means about messing things up.  I've died a total of 1 time in doing it for well over 20 hours.
---
If it's not bodies by drowning pool is it even the true experience?
---
Ty bro
---
don't really understand why I deserve ridicule for giving an item to another player that needed it more, I think that behavior is the type that keeps games like this going, rather than loot reservations (which smack of greed) and endless need rolling for shit that's barely an upgrade (something that happens in guilds and pugs alike)
---
There are no layers.
---
I want Windfury totem. Kind regards, Alliance Rogue.
---
Ranged classes in general can be frustrating as a healer since they're usually squishy. I've had so many experiences with mages and warlocks using either AoE or single target spells...right next to the mob. Not 30 or 40 yards away, not even 10 yards which is most AoE but right next to them. Maybe they need glasses?
---
Enjoy it until phase 2.  Then this won't happen anymore.
---
Bats also fly around. Not sure when they appear or how. Unclickable, but very spooky.
---
As a priest i buff anyone I can.
---
I already tried that and the gold is good but it goes sadly really slow
---
I've started running around major cities with bags full of mage food/water (tipped for etc) and hand them out for free. It's a small project I started, I named a paladin Jesus and started telling people to eat this, for this is the body of Christ. Do a little good in your community
---
A lot of anti social shitters in ironforge it would seem.
---
It was to most people.
---
Retail feels good to play. I enjoy the rotations and everything and i always gave it a shot. The problem is that after weeks or a few months it wears off because you are only doing chores and nothing feels rewarding.
---
There's literally always going to be a shortage, this post is not about that at all and is just you venting lmao, hope it helped homie
---
Taking a lot of damage at the start of every pull might make your healers miserable.  If your healers are cool with it, you aren't taking too much damage.  If your dps are cool with it, you are doing enough threat.  Just have to find that balance.
---
The trolls in Arathi is a nice idea I should try ir ,I only did the quests there.
---
The ogres tho are going slow,because of the wide range and slow respawn
---
Are you waiting for aggro to generate, or are you shooting instantly?
---
It's one thing to pull aggro on every pull onto plate, but you're a liability if you require one taunt per pull. What if somebody else pulls, and the tank used his taunt for you? He's got to go on to Mocking Blow and its two min CD. Okay...now, what happens next pull, when you take the taunt and Mocking Blow's not back?
---
Just wait a few seconds, and then single target the elites. It's all you need to do.
---
That explains my sudden jump in hp :p

wait until there is not much supply on the AH before you post the item. That way you can set a higher price.
---
now you can stop
---
Just be nice.  Encourage other people.  Offer to help when you don't have to.  Say please and thank you.
---
Nice! Im Hugsforbuffs on Dreadmist EU (tauren druid), i ran in to like 11 people from &lt;Purity&gt; who had taken over Light Hope's Chapel in EPL.
---
Guess they were just warming up for this :D
---
Awesome to see fun stuff like this happening!
---
If you're using Details you can check the average damage of hits and crits rather than just the overall. If you got a lot of misses or just didn't crit your average will be low. 750 is very low so it sounds like you were getting unlucky, but your average hit damage should be higher than his. Unless he was using consumables.
---
Uhhhh yeah you're old as hell man
---
Pretty sure that font is the default for the scrolling combat text addon
---
You playing in a fishbowl bro?
---
When they say there’s no max level content
---
Well I cant come around to calling myself jesus but I'll certainly keep the free food thing in mind. Thank you (:
---
This is new levels of austismo we're dealing with. Why are they even playing an mmo...
---
there are a bunch of tanks. you just gotta pay them. i dont need anything from scholo why should I go help you instead of doing whatever else?
---
but then if you ask for the greens or w/e ppl screech. gl spamming for hours only to find a lvl 59 noob tank in quest greens that doesn't even know his way around the dungeon :)
---
also I've tanked a bunch of pugs just fine. never asked for a second for threat and never had any issues with it. so the problem might be you, OP...
---
The oasis in the barrens. There are 3 pools there. Also wailing caverns
---
Pretty sure Dreadmist only has 1 layer.
---
No kidding. And they aren't even happy it drops. They're like.. well. I guess I accept it, as long as I can still go for the ring ...
---
I went ret to 60. It’s not the fastest leveler, mage Hunter are faster?, but I never felt like it was snail slow. If you play solo a lot it’s def the way to go. Finding dungeons gets harder as you level bc your not the best dps out there. You may have to switch to a healer build later for dungeons and raids. If you want to do raids that is. As you level keep an eye on healing items. You may need them laster. 
---
Fyi something I didn’t know till later. 
---
Crit chance
---
Hit chance  are some of your most imp stats later. Being able to crit both your white damage AND your seal of command proc is SUPER imp to compete on any level with the other dps
---
I would play tank, but I play horde, and don't like warrior or druid, I often find myself playing hunter tank with a defence pet, works really well if you spec BM
---
I play a healer and have never seen dps saying go faster or pulling for the tank (ignoring butt pulls), it's always the tank setting the pace and only time I see dps pulling aggro is on aoe pulls or locks doting all the mobs, what type servers are you all on?
---
Your explanation isn't entirely correct, or at least a bit confusing, and your attack table is wrong.
---
Miss  
---
Dodge  
---
Parry  
---
Glancing blow (Player white hits only)  
---
Block  
---
Critical hit  
---
Crushing blow (Mob white hits only)  
---
Normal hit
---
You just add the chances of each of those happening from top to bottom, capped at 100%. Everything below the 100% point can't happen at all.
---
That's also why a warrior tank can become crush (and crit) immune thanks to Shield Block.
---
[Here is a video of it happening to me, actually.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4vqbp/this_really_needs_to_be_fixed/) You can clearly see I'm standing next to 2 guards, he just hops right up on the ledge and attacks me. I don't have any where I attacked back on the ledge, but I can definitely tell you that it's not "you can even attack from the ground!" because ALL attempts with mulitple people to retaliate and kill them ended with us dying to the guards. This was both on and off the platform, behind the book case, standing next to them, the works. This guy is clearly a veteran at it as he's able to get right into the spot and go to town on us.
---
I ran past 2 guards with dots ticking away. It really sucks that you're defending this type of behavior. 
---
Go ahead and accuse me of twisting words to benefit my agenda. My agenda, if it can be called that, is to not allow this to happen. If that's a bad thing, so be it. I'd rather be downvoted and be told I'm wrong than have you accept my comment or post. These type of players are using exploits to gain an advantage against others. If you want to pvp, do it outside or take your death inside.
---
As you should! Hunters throwing a fit over Mag's bow aren't very good hunters. That bow has a speed of 2.5 and is WORSE than the blue one from the first boss of UD strat. People shouldn't roll for downgrades just because they are purple.
---
On the other side of the coin if it's a pug I don't agree with passing because it's a % better for someone else. It's a 5 man pug. Yes the chest is BiS LONGER for warriors, if I never see them again I don't care. People are responsible for gearing themselves and maybe to an extent guildies, not random pugs when gear isn't reserved.
---
&gt;only doing chores and nothing feels rewarding anymore.
---
Exactly!!!! That's exactly why I always left retail.  It becomes the same old boring grind.   I think if I get more into pvp tho it can be more of a "I wanna keep playing" vibe.   But doing daily quests and such.  Dungeons.  Blah.
---
I do my best with that but I wanna do more:p
---
But you’re also saying the crit neck AND crit trinket would be the better option because of the frost shards talent?
---
I often offer help to lower levels needing a high level to kill some elites or boss
---
You still have optimism. That's nice. 
---
Give it another year or two and you will be dead inside and cold like the rest of us.
---
This is not only normal but expected. get off your high horse
---
To be completely frank, ret damage is negligible and the class is often either ignored or cced.
---
You're basically an autoattacking warrior, minus virtually all combat utility, plus the ability to heal inefficiently.
---
A holy paladin is at least a royal pain in the ass to deal with, and a good priest easily outheals, oututilities and outdpses a ret paladin.
---
/Wave from Dragonmaw!
---
&gt;??? I’m EQUIPPING THE GEAR. I’m not selling it. 
---
This is irrelevant.  BoEs are fungible assets and are worth their auction value no matter if you equip or sell them.  If a Warden Staff drops for a druid and they equip the item, they still effectively made 400g they just chose to spend it on the item itself.
---
Joke &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
---
Is boss 62 or 63/skull?
---
Look for a bigger realm, join a good guild (not necessarely the bigger ones, since they kinda ignore when you ask something in chat). It will be easier to find people to play with, just don't expect to find a 'friend' to play and level with you 24/7
---
I don’t have a main I regret every class I choose for one reason or another, too many mages, too many rogues, I don’t want to be stuck healing etc etc. I’ve done 1-20 on so many classes I could probably do it in my sleep
---
Buddy of mine had NS bug out in MC and he was free casting lighting bolts and pulling aggro on every mob.
---
Oh no layers suck 100% there is no denying it and I wish for it to be gone asap. I'm just saying that we have to adept instead of blaming it all on layers. Horde was attacking SW, we got a word so sent scouts the ones that saw him invited us over and we wiped them
---
Many years ago, when Classic WoW was just known as WoW, I heard a saying about running instances that has stuck with me ever since.
---
1) If the tank dies it’s the healer’s fault
---
2) If the healer dies, it’s the tank’s fault
---
3) If dps dies, it’s his own fault
---
I play dps and I do it very carefully.  I let the tank pull, I direct aggro to the tank and I focus fire the tank’s target.  I suspect that even if dps were all well behaved, we’d still have a shortage of tanks, but typical dps behavior probably does make that shortage even worse.
---
Hell naw. I ain’t wasting that 13 copper on somebody.
---
Hi, thanks for the suggestion! Fixed it and now I feel like a bit of an idiot for making a post. Is it uhh, standard etiquette to delete a thread once resolved?
---
Only wolf form. By having wf I normally stay in bstance and switch over to zerker stance for whirlwind. Wf does enough damage as is. Still "only" have Dal'rends, therefore sometimes it's a tight squeeze mana wise for the healer, so I prefer bstance over zerker.
---
"Help I'm out of mana"
---
yeah i am
---
I'm not sure about tanks, I just know it was annoying as a priest.
---
Sounds like your tanks need to work harder. You shouldn't always be pulling aggro.
---
How does one check to see the player counts of their server's factions?
---
Bash gnomes plz

GJ guys! Dreadmist belongs to the Alliance!

If you make an alt and sit them in a city you can auction items without having to waste time traveling.

Ha, proof posts proof. Nice.
---
He's a lot more threatened than the mobs are - heyoo!
---
Both what? The corrupted ashbringer? You make it sound like he is taking sulfuras and thunderfury. Wow he is getting a weapon in phase 1 and another in phase 6. Weapons that no one even wants except for pvp.
---
that's the fastest way for melee to level in the 20s. 1 hour levels. Nothing beats that. I give you alternatives to go to Hillsbrad instead with a guide on it.
---
it's not about relative anything.  nobody else cares about upgrades for other people.  a bag of gold is a bag of gold, vendoring your bop for 1 gold in your pocket &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0g and somebody else gets +1% crit, just like everybody in this thread agreeing they'd need on OP's 30g shield.
---
there's no standard price everybody instinctively agrees is the exact perfect price an item must be valued at before everyone gets to roll on it.  
---
if you want to make tons of gold, you need everything.
---
if you want to potentially make marginal gold in 1 big surprise payout, you only need epics.
---
&gt;Nethergarde keep has 0 purpose with 0 quests ffs
---
Well this is just outright false.
---
You turn in exactly one quest there for Saving Razorbeak or whatever his name is.
---
If you watch the video above you see that this:  
---
&gt; If you get hit by a mob within the batching window you’re basically SOL, so you need to get a little distance from mobs for it to be essentially guaranteed.  
---
Is negated by this:  
---
&gt; At 0:10 he uses prep, vanishes again, same as above however this time he gets the improved stealth buff, stealth, and mobs do not drop combat and keep hitting him  
---
After the rogue int he video has sprinted a hundred or so yards out. While what you're saying would make total sense it is not the case here with the second vanish, the first vanish it's completely possible.
---
Yea when the game stops becoming a mid/max meta fest it can become....fun! And as a tank please let your tanks know about whatever you said in your last paragraph because none of that makes any sense to me.
---
Orgrimmar is the city name.
---
Two places of interest. When you first come into Orgrimmar (or Org) you'll see a large between dead-ahead. This is the bank. It's used to store items you want to keep but not necessarily in your characters bag.
---
From the bank, leaving it, turn left diagonally you'll find the Auction House (AH for short).
---
Also outside of the bank is a mailbox. I'll let you figure out how that works.
---
For the wand in question, you can find an enchanter using the trade channel or buying one from the AH.
---
1% spell hit is always better than 1% spell crit 'til you reach the hit cap (which most specs can't until ZG/p4). 
---
As for the Eye vs. ToEP, it depends on what your current damage looks like (base and crit) and how you use the proc. If you keep it on cooldown, you'll get an average of 175*15/90 ~= 29 SPE, which puts it at the same level as the Reed off Jed, and you can probably raise that in practice if it's a fight where you're not constantly casting and/or you combine it with AP (assuming you're specced into it). Eye of the beast, on the other hand, only hits that level of SPE (spellpower equivalent) when you get near what world best players are currently pulling—most of us probably won't get there in MC but may in BWL, and only Neltharion's tear is better from there.
---
So in the end it comes down to how well you're going to use the ToEP. If you can use it often and strategically, it's going to be better than EotB; if you don't want to worry about an active on-use effect, just stay with EotB.
---
You are a skilled DPS.

---
Of course.. but as stated, this is a solo guide for people that just want to level the old fashioned way.
---
The irony is here that not being in a guild is exactly what made this possible--I gave it to a tank, and a tank received it. And all this without any heavy-handed loot rules. 
---
If we had decided to reserve the head, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. At least everyone was allowed a chance at the head, which seems far more fair to me than reserving items, which is to the detriment of anyone pugging with you.
---
&gt;I would’ve left.
---
And nothing of value would be lost.  Your understanding of economics is immature at best.  This isn't a debate; there is a right and wrong answer to the question of handle BoEs and you are in the wrong.
---
Not at all! I had the same problem. I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t heal a group as a mainly holy paladin.
---
Leave the thread up. There will be more if use with issues like this. It will help. Glad to have been of service.

Do you tab out and read or how do people use the guide? I’d consider buying it but only have a single monitor.
---
Hey man. 
---
A lot of people do not like dungeons and raiding. You don't have too at all. However, I would suggest a good solo class if you do not plan on dungeoning/raiding. A good soloer like hunter, mage, druid, warlock. Also, these classes tend to do pretty well without a lot of gear.
---
Yeah I perfected to route using private servers over the years. The one in the video is a custom one my friend set up for me.
---
Yea, im not sure about itemzation for other healers. Just from my perspective as a shaman I value MP5 over SP currently. Also i wouldnt ever force someone not to roll on something they could use, just for me personally feel like I dont need my reed anymore with DM out.
---
You actually don't have to grind at all with the updated version.. I should have made that more clear. However, if you're a melee class, nothing even comes close to the XP/H you get from grinding those harpies.
---
Understood for the neck. 
---
I’m not sure I follow with the trinket part. The breakdown of ToEP makes sense but you are basically saying EoTB is better only if I’m pulling the same dps as the top players? Are you suggesting top players with only replace EoTB with Nelth. Tear? I don’t understand the reasoning behind that. 
---
And side note: I love having an active and paid it with AP in the beginning and keep it on cool down after that.
---
You know I don't recall, but you could always swap to the Devilsaur set. Alternately there's Bonescraper from Strat or the quest reward Darrowspike. It probably comes down to my penny-pinching nature, Shadowblade is a fine dagger and it's not that expensive.
---
Why would it being a weapon matter? The only factor is what it sells for on the Auction House. If it is a large amount then everyone should roll for that large amount. If you're equipping that item, your character gains X gold worth of value that you could just buy yourself because the item is tradable. You could win that epic BoE axe and equip it and then you wouldn't have to pay 400g for it. Or I could win the roll on the axe and be able to sell it and make my robe, or the hunter can win and buy his devilsaur, or the priest can buy Hide of the Wild, or someone can even get their epic mount. It's very simple equal opportunity for everyone taking the time to run the dungeon.
---
Yea because me leaving when the priest rolls need on tanking gear makes me wrong. Makes complete sense.
---
I kept getting in groups with multiple casters. I saw it drop fairly regularly (At least three out of every five runs), mind you, but the RNG gods never smiled on me. Finally got mine last week before raid. Feels good to finally grab it, for sure.
---
Skull means what you think it means, and the rogues should know it.
---
I've been playing a rogue in classic (didn't in vanilla) and I've just realized I've been ignoring skull a lot more than had occurred to me.  I go kick a caster, I build threat on the thing that the tank is going to lose to the healer, I vanish and distract the patrol that nobody sees, I make sure I get combo points on the target that the idiot mage is dpsing (not skull), so when he runs I can eviscerate him so that he doesn't pull another pack, etc.  Also, sword rogue here, I open with a garrote, build a second combo point, then SnD and change to the correct kill target.  Garrote on the target that's going to die first is a huge damage loss, and my damage is really impactful so I think I'm doing the right thing here?  (Vanilla/Classic rogues, call me out if I'm part of the problem.)  I do keep getting invited back to groups with these tanks though, so I guess I'm not doing too terrible.
---
It's not that I don't know what skull means.  A lot of times, I **think** there's an exception, or that you put skull on the wrong thing, OR I'm 2 levels lower than you, and will body pull something else if I hit the skull.  There's a LOT of stuff going on, and if you are properly accounting for all of it and the rogues are doing their own thing, that's on them.  If you are missing something, the rogues may be fixing it for you.  I have no idea, because I doubt I've run with you.
---
Yeah, there's at least one on Earthfury I see constantly in Deadwind. Alliance mage named Qtgarves or something like that

This is one of my all time fav spots from vanilla and I did go back there for a bit during classic, it's just so good. Great geographic variation in 1KN going from big pillars to this wide, flat area. Wonderful pvp there, nice mob density, good questing, mining and skinning, close to GZ... Good times.
---
It's like that on Smolderweb as well. Leveling was definitely hard mode as an Alliance member. I rolled rogue and it was still pretty rough with the disparity being pretty huge and largely Horde favored. Feel bad for my warlock buddy who lacks the stealth mechanism.
---
I would still take it over PvE any day though. Even when it's majority Horde, when us Ally finally band together and fight back it is pretty epic!
---
Great tip,  as a hunter I'll give it a.....shot (:
---
If you're just going to ignore all the solid information INCLUDING A SCREENSHOT OF A GM TICKET FROM CLASSIC WOW that I've put forth in my other comment THAT I HAVE SAID TWICE YOU SHOULD LOOK AT and continue to be ignorant then be my guest. I can't help someone who insists on playing the victim.
---
Also that video proves absolutely nothing except that you clearly haven't read my post or attempted to understand what I've been saying at all. I won't be replying to this comment thread anymore, go down to my reply that actually has all the information laid out if you want to be educated.
---
lol the only weird shit I had to do as Horde was run from Arathi to Badlands, and that was fairly scenic and safe.
---
I saw a guy, level 30-ish running people through the Deadmines on my server the other day.  Said he just randomly takes lowbies through their to get their quests done or whatever.  You could do that?
---
3 years and going, when is this supposed to happen again?
---
You dont even want it for its intended purpose.
---
I was wondering why I couldn’t insta log off there!
---
I keep levelling stuff to 40 then losing interest because mount and level 40 talent are pretty much the peak of most classes, and raiding in classic isn't very interesting.
---
Why are people stupid enough to spend like 500gold to get +5 healing and 6 mp/5? It's so fucking stupid, 500g is like ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 10 hours, but more realistically like 15+ hours of gameplay.... for an extra +5 healing and some measly mp5? I actually lmao whenever I see a priest with it because it's the clearest case of awful time management in the game
---
I can solo low level runs so maybe I can try that. Thanks for the tip (:
---
Next time just get water walking buff
---
Several posts about this have been made, several posts have been ignored.
---
I’m afraid this is one will suffer the same fate.
---
Last I checked that doesn't work. I did that and got rezzed at the original graveyard I appeared at.
---
They should have opened up access to multiple “new servers” when they dropped a couple, instead of “this server can only defer to this new one, while that other server can only xfer to this other new server” stuff.  Give them like 5 options to pick from.
---
Idk. I was doing mostly pvp anyway. But since rewards are completely random it felt like shit too.
---
The hero we needed
---
Go out and get a life you fucking nerd
---
No I didn’t. I went out of my way to complete every quest I could.
---
Quel'thalas is in northern EK though, not kalimdor
---
I only have one monitor as well, don’t see the need for two. I tab in and out while my character is on auto run/flying etc.
---
Agility boosts ranged weapon damage and wands are ranged weapons. It seems super weird, but I guess that means agility boosts wand damage ?
---
It's happened to me just about every single time I've ran BRD solo for the arena with mobs on the way in and out.
---
I'd pre-emptively Scatter a mob before entering combat to prevent it from hitting me, but it would walk towards me, hit me, and *then* the CC would kick in. There's always this 0.2-0.3s window between the spell affecting the mob and the CC kicking in, where the mob is going to smack me in the face.
---
11$
---
Basically get 1 for being there the first pull. 1 for staying until the end. Then 1 for each boss kill you get so a full clear nets you 12 points if you didn’t spend any. Onyxia is 3 points, (show up, kill, stay til loot is given out). Our shadow priest was capped at 50 going into last week which means he didn’t get loot for weeks, but spent it all on his eye off domo so he could get anathema. Imagine not getting anything even tho you show up an kill bosses then when the one thing you really want drops and you still don’t get it, this system slightly prevents that in the fairest, easiest way possible.
---
HAHAHAHA quick story about this. 
---
I just hit 58 on my hunter and a bunch of guildies we’re doing a arena/angerforge run only. So I jumped in. The warrior that needed the chest was telling us the story of how many times he ran this place and finally after 14 runs it drops and he loses to a hunter... 
---
So queue to us now and out walks the boss for the chest... I just had a feeling that it was gonna drop and I was gonna win it over him. So it drops and I won... LOL the guy till this day will never let me live it down in guild and constantly speaks aloud of his pain and hatred for hunters hahaha 
---
GG
---
Just tank dungeons while you level. Holding aggro is harder at lower levels, but up until ulda/zf, mobs don't hit hard (so dps can take a few hits) and fights don't really have mechanics that you need to know. They're pretty much all tank and spanks. Just knowing what abilities to use and knowing basically how to position and LoS pull gets you 90% of the way there.
---
Tanking is more complicated than DPSing or healing, but it's not some crazy arcane mystery. It just takes practice and a little bit of critical thinking, and unfortunately many people don't have the patience to let you learn after you've hit 60.
---
Oh maybe it's not for classic wow then. My bad.
---
I think a lot (if not all) of that is for retail
---
lol yeah my method applies when you are training 1H obviously (i.e. when you get a new tank weapon)
---
I see spikes
---
I play every day and created this character 2 weeks ago so not much opportunity for rested XP. Ftfy
---
White hits are more than 50% of your damage. 
---
You want as much hit as you possibly can.
---
All the time =/= once a week maximum, HMM
---
Just south of Wailing Caverns in the Barrens. There are three ponds called Stagnant/Lushwater Oasis. You can fish directly into Savory Fish pools there! 
---
Edit: Don't recall the skill level required
---
I feel like there is no tanking “weapon” really. A lot of classes can actually use and equip weapons. But if I lose skullflame shield to a priest, I’m leaving. Why would i tank a dungeon just so a priest or a mage can need when an epic BOE tank specific item THAT I WILL EQUIP drops. That’s ridiculous. I know it sounds fair to you, but as a tank, whose extremely gear dependent, and is leading the entire group, responsible for aggro and making sure dungeon goes smoothly, I’m not losing a shield drop that I need to a mage and staying. No way.
---
&gt;  DPS shamans wouldn't be allowed period 
---
A DPS shaman who shows up to every raid stacked with consumables and isn't above offspec healing in a heal-intensive fight is approx. 5x more desirable for a raiding guild than a full BiS 1400 DPS warrior with a prima donna attitude
---
Thats quite a statement lol
---
I think you can learn first aid at level 1.  Definitely by the time you naturally make it to your closest major city.  It's an extra profession (like fishing and cooking).
---
On what realm did you play during vanilla?
---
Why are people stupid enough to spend like 500gold to get +5 healing and 6 mp/5? It's so fucking stupid, 500g is like ABSOLUTE MINIMUM 10 hours, but more realistically like 15+ hours of gameplay.... for an extra +5 healing and some measly mp5? I actually lmao whenever I see a priest with it because it's the clearest case of awful time management in the game, cringey asf
---
Then that shitty bad-at-his-class rogue isn't getting invited back.
---
Its the best bear tank item for all of classic, it never gets better. Its just that there is a mace from DM Tribute runs that is basically just as good. Imo warden staff isnt worth more than like 150g, otherwise im farming DM
---
488 avg dps vs 494.5 avg dps based on Charlie’s post on Elysian project means you’re wrong based off their real world numbers. Can you show me where it’s being shown as the absolute top dog? Because to mee it looks like both are within margin of error on par or lower.
---
For big groups...Casting HoTs on yourself before pulling helps, demo roar, and tab swiping.
---
On groups of 3-4, if someone can CC 1-2 it helps alot. Same principles as above with clear marking and maybe no hots. 
---
But even doing all that... it's a fucking chore. 
---
Fuck strat live.
---
Nice dress. Looking cute. Congrats on the gear tho.
---
Good on ya.
---
Exactly! I understand where healers are coming from but when I pull a single lone mob to keep/build rage there is no need to stop drinking and start throwing heals around when I'm at 95% health. A single elite mobs vs a full health tank and the one or two dps not needing mana is not going to wipe the group.
---
I take it that Barkskin doesn't work in bear form at the moment?
---
Your not suppose to be able to after applying them. You are stuck with the 30 minute buff unless you use another poison.
---
Yeah not soloing.  But finding 2-3 is still really easy.  You'll always find a healer to go with.
---
 Procced to lose a duel to a Female Orc Shaman  named Chubette wielding an Arcanite Reaper.
---
You sound so mad. You must've lost the roll on the pattern quite a few times eh?
---
True, but I think people that want a leveling guide would also want to know the tradeoff and it only comes into play at the very end. 90% the old fashioned way is still pretty old fashioned anyway. Fantastic work either way.
---
I'm mining/eng.  The boes can be ded by a level 6 with enchanting.
---
Never downloaded dbm once and never will. U only need 2 add ons in this game, recount to see where u stand, and a threat metre because hidden numbers that 100% influence ur ability to do well are hidden for some reason.
---
Idk dude, our tank held aggro on a magmadar yesterday where one of the warriors pulled 700 dps
---
I was the same, dropped Skinning for engineering.  Spent roughly 100g leveling to 200
---
this is good fiction
---
Our boomie dropped all his dkp on choker of the fire lord 😂 they can do that because they don’t have to bid on anything
---
I feel as though I should have known that ha but like my explanation has made sense to me for so long! 
---
People seem very passionate about how this word came to be apparently lol. It’s okay dude...
---
Yeah these guys come prepared, trinks, sappers... the works lol
---
the rule of thumb in general is prioritize hit over crit until you are hit capped. I would say just feel it out on your own, frost mages differ from other casters because of the talents I mentioned, but I'm not sure as to the specifics of what % hit and what % crit where they begin to outweigh one another
---
Yeah that's a good point.  I'd forgotten which WoW subreddit I was in.
---
Ok that's good to know, I must have just never noticed it until now.
---
Not that 0 native hit or threat reduction on mobs immune to half your spells and resistant to the other half is acceptable. But thems the breaks, we curse and summon shit until AQ40.
---
Not 100% sure but it will be close with the zig zaggyness of the flight path and actually getting down elevators into UC.  Plus backtracking from lights hope
---
ONE!
---
Ah that makes sense!
---
&gt; 2% spell crit &gt; 175 spell power every 1 min 30 seconds if your gear is reasonable
---
Actually, if you use ToEP on cooldown it's 29 SPE, and you can potentially improve that with more strategic use. The 2% crit doesn't pull ahead til you're close to where the world best are now. That said, most people aren't going to use ToEP to its maximum utility, and in practice EotB will be better for them.
---
Errr no. unyielding is BIS for mitigation. 
---
Unyielding can get both counter weight and elemental stones while warden cannot. (also agil + elemental stone later).
---
They get a free mount its fair
---
I OT for my guild. Tanking is a lot more fun than healing imo.  Plus when we raid I even do some good dps in bear 1k mauls, and for bosses like rag I can sit in cat and power shift and hit shred to my hearts content. 
---
When we’re not raiding, I can have some fun with world pvp hitting 1,600 ravage grits in the battlefield of Un’goro. I haven’t had a melee dps aside from shaman beat me yet. Hits on a bear with 10k+ armor are as effective as swinging a wet noddle.
---
All the feels.
---
Honestly you don't even need a shield if your healer is decent I've DW tanked plenty of the level 60 dungeons and not had a problem. I only put a shield on for the hard hitting bosses.
---
Dwarf is better for PvP, getting out of fear is so strong
---
You're not talking about PvP, you're talking about cheesing and mild annoyances

I have started being super direct at the start of dungeons because of this, and honestly I've seen an improvement. I even had one guy drop cause he didn't like my tanking style. I totally prefer having to pick up a new player than playing with an awful one. 
---
I basically say,  "I run a smooth pace, only taking more aggressive pulls once we get in a good flow.  I'll pull unless I call for it, follow my marks, give me a pause for aggro, and we will have an awesome run." I also check if anyone is hoping for a particular drop, ask preference for killing all mobs or straight line, and give praise when we have a tough or textbook fight. So essentially I just take charge, but try not to be a dick about it. I've had mostly good/decent runs this way.
---
Holy shit this is awesome. I’ve never paid attention to the green sets. Didn’t realize it has so much int.
---
And a small army of personal healers
---
Of course. You have to prepare in advance. Basically just TOEP for bosses and regular for nonbosses. Usually there's a small break before boss fights which allows you to get the trinket ready
---
The issues I see with LC is that you rely on people to remember and reward you attendance. I just don't trust people to be 100% impartial when it comes to that and if you LC is based on attendance you are already half way to a DKP system anyways.  
---
The issues I see with DKP is sometimes it's wasteful, people save for items that might help someone else more or just long term raiders have all the DKP.  These are valid concerns but there are ways to deal with it.  Have a 10% reduction in all DKP each week.  People with high DKP will lose more and over time this equalizes.  Have minimum bid requirements but let new members go negative if the item will rott anyway.  Loot is used and basically new players get loot at minimum possible cost.
---
As for people taking loot that might be better for someone else, doesn't really matter.  If they had the DKP they earned it and like we all have said there isn't really any content you can't run in pre raid BIS so let people bid on what they want.  At the end of the day I can feel ok if I see someone spend more DKP for an item I wanted.  I know they earned it, but if I see an officer allocate an item to some guy who I dislike (even for personal reasons) over me when I "feel" like they didn't earn it I will be annoyed.  Just human nature.
---
Everything except the addons is saved by blizz
---
Wrong, when you're ready please come back to the real world.
---
BRD chest is better then T1 chest until 8/8
---
I rolled a druid expecting to play an alt mage almost as much. My mage is still lvl24, I'm loving playing my main too much to bother with it. Tanking dungeons is generally good fun, raid healing as the same spec is just fine and pvp is brilliant, I couldn't ask for any more.
---
I don't regret rolling mage, not one bit. 
---
I started in BC, so I missed roughly the first three years of WoW history, and never got to experience the feeling of playing vanilla while it was still vanilla. Certain amenities were already in place when I started, and I enjoyed it immensely.  Anyway, that first character of mine was a mage that I still have and log onto fairly regularly. 
---
So, while others might have rolled mage because they saw some streamer do it, or they did it solely for the ability to AoE farm, I did it simply for nostalgia.
---
yes, it works. it gets you into the SW of Redridge then pick up the road to the North.
---
Nobody is going to get mad if you roll on DPS gear as the tank, what are they going to do kick you?
---
Errr no. unyielding is BIS for mitigation.
---
I play rogue and go hell for leather with my dps. It’s the tanks job to out-threat me. Do it, bitch.
---
Why would I open trade before asking? I always ask before assuming. But you still wont get any of my coin.
---
You can adjust the viewport. Type something like
---
    /script WorldFrame:SetPoint("BOTTOMRIGHT", -400, 0)
---
And you'll get a large black bar on the right, witheverything else squeezed on the left. It should be possible to stretch the game to two screens and make viewport cover only the left half while putting UI elements on the right. Not sure if there's an addon that does this normally, but you could edit any addon file and add this line at the top.
---
Maybe that's my problem... I've only pugged. And I'm not sure that my contribution will be seen if it's not on the meters.
---
God that mount sounds absolutely awful
---
you would switch enchanting for mining if you need money
---
Spot on with feral.  I think people just don’t realise what it takes to get and maintain aggro as a bear.  I was running as a tank early on but now I’m at Ulda/ZF/Mara I prefer to go in as dps.
---
On the weekend I tanked an Ulda and generally did ok until the last boss.  The mobs leading in can be pretty unforgiving and the dps were jumping in immediately so were taking damage which obviously led to the healer spam healing and gaining threat and then a wipe.  Props to the dps though, we discussed the situation and they were keen to work through it and give me more time to generate threat.  Progressed much more smoothly from that point on.
---
As a tank spec but running as dps, I find I provide that utility in the runs.  If things go awry I can switch to tank, drop out to help heal or even throw in a b-res without creating major issues.  Druids are awesome for filling gaps in a pinch.
---
You think
---
How do I keybind f1, f2, etc? For some reason, system volume changes instead when I click it. And also, is there a way to disable the windows button when the WOW client is open?
---
Same here. I didn't play Vanilla or PS so I end up looking up a wowhead guide and hope it's not a terribly difficult route.
---
opulent and imperial
---
Sweet I’m a warlock so I should be good to go
---
You don’t need much as a tank. Some kind of threat meter and weak auras if you like that kind of stuff is all you need.
---
Dont get me wrong I'm enjoying classic alot, and I never played retail past wotlk anyway. I just think that it could be better and too many people think no changes is a good thing because they erroneously think it's all about the nostalgia.
---
Interesting reply you got from a GM! I'm sure you worded it to talk about hitting players inside of Winterspring instead of just out-ranging guard aggro from outside of town.
---
If you want to freely attack someone outside of town while they're inside, go for it. If you're both standing inside of town and inside of a building with 2 guards posted at the entrance but call that "using mechanics to out-range the guards" you're bad and you know it. Stop justifying this type of player. If it were truely just "out of range" show us the question you asked the GM. Hell, spend the evening camping players and show us the lack of a ban you receive!
---
Join the lfg channel on your server you will have much better luck. Lfg on reddit ain’t gonna get you far.
---
Gottem
---
Between 150 and 200 down to rank 1 FoL from max.
---
Between 400 and 450 down to rank 3 HL from max.
---
Go Ret, you can easily heal any dungeons on the way to 60 with a bit of int gear
---
Being a raid tank and dungeon tanking are completely different. Any warrior of any spec can tank for a dungeon with just plate gear, I guarantee you most of the tanks you get for your dungeons have a DPS set for raiding.
---
You can still resize WorldFrame, they just restricted attaching other frames to it apparently.
---
Anathema is the big one
---
I guess that works for sub 60 dung's
---
By the time you are in UBRS, most dps wars are in half/full leather and are just as squish as a rogue not using evasion. Those draconic mobs that enrage at 50% hp can kill a dps war in 3 sec when they crit (and they have like 0.5 swing speed while enraged). I've seen it happen when taunts resist. 
---
The problem is this retail mentality that pulling threat is okay. It's never okay, it always add stress to tanks and healers. The lack of tanks is due to this "death by a 1000 cuts". Your mindless enjoyment comes at the expense of the tank/healers enjoyment. Sometimes the tank wants to breeze through the dungeon too without too much work, but that never happens.
---
I'm at the point of telling healers to not heal dps during pulls so they die and learn it's not okay to pull threat.
---
Ya idk.. I think server choice matters a lot.
---
We have equal mages / warlocks currently, having had to recruit a few mages and basically say no to warlocks.
---
Actually many people seem to report *slightly* better dps numbers in raids with Striker's Mark than with the strat xbow.
---
Rhok'delar, while far superior to Striker's Mark, isn't guaranteed either, so it should be acceptable for hunters to roll on Striker's Mark
---
Badlands have some nice dragon whelps,  which will give you a fair amount of gold.
---
The thing missing from that equation is the tank pulling with 30 rage from last pull or none
---
unless you changed the key to use the new screenshot tool - in which case you're even better prepared and you know the F you're doing :)
---
You won't replace Kang until lvl 55+ (Emperor in BRD rops Dreadforge Retaliator) or even until 60. It\`s really good.
---
&gt; ehhh tbf i see a lot of ppl being dicks about those who aren't 60 yet
---
Show me one that hasnt been downvoted
---
Undead rogue? This suffering of yours will get me through the night.
---
Maybe a dumb question here but I had my first raid as a warlock recently in classic, do i need to be the same group as someone I soul stone for it to work? I soul stoned a raid member two different times, they had the icon in their buffs but a couple of times after they died they claimed they had no option to use a soul stone. I know there's a max bres limit per encounter but that isn't it.
---
Hunters can solo arena tho
---
If I see them drinking I'll usually start my next pull when it looks like they are close to full, figuring that they will take their time to finish and still likely be there before they are needed.
---
Yeah, MP5 isn't great RN for anyone but heals.   
---
The Warlock DM trinket is nice though, poor poor mages and their trash options.
---
Find some nails to bang in stormwind
---
All the epic BoE's drop off of dozens of mobs in all the different dungeons so it's not like you're running that dungeon for that specific item. You have other reasons to be there. It could have been any one of them. Also if you were my tank that was my friend that I was running this stuff with all the time then yeah I would pass it to you, but you can't expect randoms to pass on expensive loot for you because most of the time they won't so you should probably do the same.
---
Same deal. Does anyone questing actually stand a sliver of a chance of even surviving, much less getting revenge?
---
Yes, that's what the author of the first post was referencing. What are you trying to point out here?
---
Any green level humanoids with low armor will be best to farm for you. Dont know any specific spots but look through mob database and you will surely find something.
---
I see a scarab
---
Well you lack of foresight will be the end of PVP for half the serves, so enjoy.... Bet you will be the first to cry for cross-realm BG when you realised that max-level raid-stomping of people leveling on a server where one faction already are twice as many, will only hasten the inevitable downfall.
---
Hahah this is exactly why I'm here
---
Yeah, so not-obvious. You got reported 500x times by people who saw you botting in the open, but you only got banned several weeks after so hey, it could have been anything.
---
Is this confirmed to be true? I had no idea
---
Makes sense 😏
---
Standard etiquette would be to use the questions megathread.
---
Kromcrush was nearly 50/50 back when the census addon still worked. I don't know what it is now. Seems pretty balanced to me.
---
Ah, there’s your problem. 
---
You’re a warlock.
---
5g
---
3 1/2 days played at level 37. We’re pretty close!!
---
Daily dose of internet pog
---
Wait.... are you saying they wont....
---
The funny thing is, they are in such high demand that they can get away with just about anything. The last two PUG tanks I've had only seemed to be using thunderclap to build aggro and almost never sunder. Never marked anything and couldn't hold aggro off of an auto-attack after waiting a few seconds to start dps. The rest of the group were guildies, so we just kinda laughed it off and suffered through the run. Trying to get a replacement would take too long. Only took 3 1/2 hours for a full clear of BRD though...
---
OKAY DAWG OKAY OKAY HUAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
---
Maraudon is great for ghost mushrooms. 
---
I go straight for the coffers yeah, although you can pickpocket on the way for some extra profits. I usually take of my gear after getting the 12th coffer, and suicide, reset corpse run back in. 
---
But then, I'm a night elf, so the wisp speed bonus makes that a preferable opportunity.
---
If you have to chug mana potions then I went too fast. This should only be necessary if multiple things go wrong in a row. If there's a mage in the group, I literally don't care about how much water you go through though, I expect you to sit down between each pull for a few seconds. If you are drinking bought water, I'll usually let you fill up because I know how expensive that shit is. 
---
The rest is perceived stress, and that's highly individual. My initial measure is "we can do this", if the healer would prefer a more chill run I'll gladly slow down a bit if he asks kindly. The only real issue I have is with the (rare!) healers who let people die to prove a point or open the discussion about pull speed with a friendly or complain passive-aggressive about pull speed instead of talking to me like the human I am.
---
I don't follow the video's advice on pulling the boss.  I post up where I'm going to have my pet the whole fight, use Eyes of the Beast, using Dash will allow you to leap across the gap between the two platforms, attack Cho'rush and run further away from the "stay" spot.  Right click off the Eyes buff, Whistle your pet back, put him on stay, and start the fighting :)
---
Aye
---
A lot of Blue gear is better than EF for straight healing (though the massive Stam amount of EF makes it great in PvP). 
---
Purely mathematically, only EF Helm is BiS, but I personally give up a little bit of stats (taking shoulders and belt) to get the 3 PC. Bonus.
---
I did twice... And i got a copy paste type response the first time. Second time the gm said he would be investigated... 4 days later dude is still doing it.
---
This is a nice way of pulling as well yeah. The bosses transfer aggro to you on despawn. On re-summonning pet, it has 0 aggro, but when you feign death they will run to pet as usual as it is part of the combat.
---
oh shit they killed thrall, they were getting spanked when i logged on so i assumed it didnt go well.
---
Don't forget the unregistered hypercam or fraps!
---
You were never able to. Its not a buff to yourself its a buff to the weapon, that shows in your buff slot.
---
Annoying as hell for Horde raiders but an intended mechanic.
---
You can also kite around the small rock, it's a lot easier to reapply dots this way, and if you don't fail the peek-a-boo game she never gets to hit you.
---
My best friends brother had it drop.  He won.  Whole guild disbanded but he got hand of rag lol
---
Copy the WTF folder for settings. The addons folder for addons. That's it.
---
If you have too many addons to do profile copies in-game or if they don't support profiles you can go deeper into the WTF folder and copy one character's settings to another.
---
Technically, you could also do an NTFS symbolic link if you wanted two characters to always have the same settings automatically.

Free enchants, food, etc. at major cities.

Go help a lowbie level.
---
&gt; are basically saying EoTB is better only if I’m pulling the same dps as the top players?
---
Yes (where they are now, at least), EotB only pulls ahead when your frostbolts are hitting for about 1200–1400, depending on your effective crit (crit has somewhat diminishing returns).  What I meant with Neltharion's tear is that it's the only trinket from BWL better than EotB, so you won't replace EotB in BWL/phase 3 (since you have two trinket slots). It's only more of a sidenote, forget I brought it up if you're still confused.
---
I think we found one of the guys who didn't even say thanks over here
---
It's a level 60 twink game.
---
I'm on Skeram ally-side, come get some
---
I’ve also noticed they haven’t fixed the bug where mobs that you kite for long enough will sometimes hit you for multiple auto-attacks at once when they reach you.
---
Purity are pure cancer though.
---
You confuse everyone with yourself ;)
---
Saw a Nightelf with a strider named Hordepecker, got a good chuckle out of it.
---
Same as how priests can solo any (non cc immune) undead mob with enough patience.
---
As a rogue who often tank because of the lack of real tank... 
---
Having to lead, be sure everyone got is quest item, that the group stay united until we get out of the elites zones or whatever....
---
seeing others rogues pulling mobs when everyone is resting, or seeing a dps on a mob that haven’t a skull on it... or better, burst dps on a warrior while the caster mob roam freely.
---
I feel your pain, and I assure you, for the players who play whatever class they play and are aware; it’s a pain to play with those people, but there are people who game week or at least try ^^
---
I haven't had much of a problem getting the first orb if I ask beforehand. Although there was one 58 lock who was trying to ask what my gear was when I asked him for an orb like I was applying to MT his MC raid. I told him I had mostly preraid BIS plate gear but he was trying to ask what my individual pieces were, at that point I knew this guy was gonna be a dumbass so I just ignored him and found a different group.
---
As I explained in my first comment, in a LC+Roll system it's virtually impossible to rig it to give someone benefits. The LC is only there to make sure that people can only roll on their most optimal gear and that people who don't do their job get punished for it. A very straight forward system that more or less equally rewards everyone who does their job, and it doesn't have the drawbacks of a full LC system or a DKP system.
---
Ahhhh chickenhome was the best pserver to hold me over for classic
---
Try running your own guild man, it’s a lot of work.  Quite simply, a vanity item like Sulfuras is kind of standard.
---
Shadowmeld is nice to have in some close spots - but sometimes it can fuck you over as well. Shadowmelding directly from feign death seems to have a chance of agroing mobs as there is a split second or so before you gain invisibility.  
---
It has saved me several times, though, so I'd say it is a slight advantage. The dwarf racial can be helpful as well, though!
---
You’re just a bad tank, what do you want us to say? Whiner
---
Laughs in grounding totem
---
I don’t get it
---
haHAA
---
Smesh
---
So I respond with me stating that I was wrong and owned up to my not remembering correctly and you come in with an insult.
---
I am sure you are a gem to play with.
---
go into settings -&gt; text &amp; Images -&gt; enable website preview
---
*INTERACT* with group members.  Ask people to explain things you're ignorant about.  Ask people to go in-depth about rotations or whatever.  Ask them about stat priority.  Favorite gank stories.  Favorite class to play.  Whatever gets people talking. 
---
Cultivate a positive sharing/uplifting atmosphere if that's what you want by trying to be the one to start the conversation.  It won't happen unless those that want to see it try to initiate.
---
Basically there was a spot you could walk up to that would put you in between the badlands and searing gorge where the tiled textures were very jarring (red vs gray).  It wasn't really wall walking I remember anyone could easily get up there.
---
I went back to find it as it would be a prime location for dueling (its a little hidden) but I saw the map had changed.
---
Your UI is cool.
---
not to mention faster computers, and a better server situation, better internet connections, with less lag (who played on 56k back in the day?) higher resolution monitors and gameplay, etc etc.  
---
We're all playing as if we had 10k to spend on a setup back in the day.
---
except that it will prevent any reasonable leveling, so alliance will starve to death from lack of new players.
---
And people say retail has too much grind.
---
Yeah there were loads of guilds in my experience who only did Ony/MC/ZG20/AQ20 runs.
---
The mind set felt different though, people were fine with that and fine with not seeing all the content because it allowed for a pretty casual game.
---
This time around though with how things are looking i imagine BWL will be more doable by casuals
---
wait....have I been brainwashed being on faerlina thinking every server is like that? There's like 5 hands of rags on that server.
---
Wouldn't it fall off pretty hard when people no longer queue up to buy tarnished elven rings? Vendoring tribute loot isn't particularly amazing compared to other solo farming methods I think, since tribute runs are noticeably slower than on private servers.
---
You'd hit much harder as elemental.
---
I'm about half way to ya. Only seen 2 even drop so far. I fucking hate ubrs.
---
&gt;I don't ever remember this happening back in the day or on private servers
---
aka "rosy retrospection"
---
Yah I looked at drop tables for BWL the other night and it seems Warriror was getting the highest drop rate on tier pieces.
---
that's how i open every pack  
---
still hunters will blast multishots as soon as my charge reaches the target
---
I've already replied to that comment. I find it interesting that the GM is willing to talk with you about exploits and guard ranges while when asking for clarification on rules, they usually refuse to explain it. They request you report someone that you think is breaking the rules in game and it will be reviewed and handled.
---
The video proves that this is a certain spot you stand in on the ledge to avoid aggro, which is clearly an exploit. How can you honestly defend it as something intentional?
---
you spamming my inbox bro ahaha
---
Now u can finally play the World of Warcraft.
---
I have tanked every dungeon probably 50 times or more each, mages get bitchy about threat all the time.
---
In strat UD, had a mage get upset on the first pull because a non elite skeleton attacked him after he blizzard the second I pulled. I told him I had to keep aggro on the elites and the non elites I managed to sunder. He told me I should have switched to bezerker and intercepted the one non elite attacking him.
---
First pull! I just left and found another group 30 seconds later while he probably spent another hour looking for a different tank. 
---
So for DPS, if you pull a non elite, just fucking kill it.  Don’t expect me to re-position for it.
---
Great idea, I'll try to incorporate this into my runs.  Ty for the tip (:
---
You have special functions (Fn keys) enabled by default. Try disabling them
---
Those mobs have an ability, Thrash, which gives them extra attacks on their next hit. This was in prebc. Whether they could stack it multiple times like on classic I don't know.
---
What's hit cap for a level 62? If it's 9% for a 63 and 5% for a 60 then it doesn't really seem linear. 
---
I have an awkward spot with my gear where my best option for raids takes me to 10% hit, and the easiest thing to replace with a quality option takes me to 8%. Would this be fine for King Gordok?
---
lmaoo my god you are angry. ya lmao I have a job and shit I can't play this game 8 hours a day, and I do level slow cause I like to PvP and stuff. There's literally 0 point in rushing to 60 because the first 3 phases are gonna be same raids, i've got like a year to do mc without any other raids even being available lmaooo u mad asl
---
about the message id, the message is already pretty cluttered and full of stuff. So I opted not to display the message id since its easily retrievable by changing to developer mode.
---
About the first question, I dont have a picture atm how I would realize that. Seems like too much adaption for little effect :(
---
This is one of the cringiest things I’ve ever read in my life lol.
---
Him: “He was camping noobs”
---
You: “I’ll fucking kill you 1v1 and show everyone, to prove how fucking sick I am”
---
Like the fact you got that defensive instantly, when he wasn’t even coming at you... I can see why you’re one of the players with some special item, you take this VERY serious
---
It's not worth it at all lmao. What class do you play? Why don't you play druid so you can tank and heal and dps? It's worth it, just reroll bro LOL
---
Ah, just going off of what our feral tanks were stating. A lot of them said it's Raid BIS for multiple phases, some claimed until BC. I don't play druid so I don't honestly know.
---
I think a lot of people had nightmares from Vanilla when there was seemingly never enough priests and a lot of people rolled priest to be 'in demand'. This is also compounded by the fact that people learned how to gear other classes to be viable healers.
---
This is not broken, this is working as intended.
---
As a rogue main since actual vanilla, Blizzard addressed accusations of this being bugged back in like 2005 stating;
---
\-If a weapon swing/attack has started before popping vanish, it will still hit you
---
\-Bleeds and other Damage over Time effects will break stealth
---
\-Some Area of Effect abilities like Demoralising Shout/Roar will destealth you (personal fav on my warrior)
---
To ensure your vanish is successful, it is best to incapacitate your target(s) first with a stun bomb or Gouge.
---
Then check debuff area for DoT/Beed effects
---
Also remember that stealth detection is heavily based on level so there's still a chance of being detected \*immediately\* after entering Vanish-stealth.
---
As far as the visual buff indicators go, they actually don't exist. They're given via addon. They didn't appear until BC if i'm remembering correctly, if you don't believe me check this old video from 2006 [https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=6140](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=6140)
---
Lying on the internet doesn't make you cool. Cut down the edge a bit will you?
---
in game more then here
---
You should subtract two from your level and look for humanoids that match.  Bonus points if they are casters for easy interrupts and having low hp/armor.  Once a warrior has pummel casters are EASY pickins.  More rage cuz you're hitting harder, elementary interrupts (even on 1.5 sec cast it's not hard) and good drops (coin, cloth)
---
If you eat and drink at the same time, which I do, then Argent Dawn mana biscuits are cheaper than other vendor foods since you only need to buy the biscuits instead of buying food and water.
---
That's correct. It does not transfer back when you summon pet but you will be so far ahead of the boss that you have ample time to mend and drop down.
---
You say it is a pathway, yet many of us find that at times there is No Path Available. So we wait for the time to strike (and the healer to get mana)
---
This. Windseeker NA is pretty barren as far as PvP goes, but we go and trash Darnassus and Goldshire weekly, and it’s met with attacks on Xroads and UC. Good balance
---
DPS with threat issues are a self-correcting problem! You never lose aggro to that player for the rest of the fight!
---
When frostbolts hit for 1200-1400 non crit? If so I have a long way to go for that. Maybe after mageblade w/ spellpower enchant, choker of fire lord and ring of spell power with full consumables than I will start seeing those numbers. I think I follow though, the crit will be better at those numbers. 
---
2 questions though:
---
How do you determine effective crit and does that mean you hit a breakpoint and any crit after that isn’t as useful? 
---
In what ways are you saying to use ToEP to its max effectiveness? Just using it on cool down would be using it to its max effectiveness, right? What are strategic ways to use it that you are suggesting? Use the proc then swap to EoTB right before combat starts?
---
Murlocs in Southshore
---
About cheap shot, they can also occasionally get off an attack when you sap. Sap still lands. It doesn't make sense.
---
&gt;funny
---
I think we have different definitions of that word lol
---
Its 100% not better.
---
Essence of Earth is definitely manageable from the Desert Rumblers in NW Silithus. They are simple melee mobs and you can mounted pull a bunch then easily AoE them down.
---
Damn, I thought that was a RDR2 screen shot.
---
save yourself the rage for clap and go sweeping strikes instead
---
Is it okay to roll on off spec gear in dungeons? I always feel a little odd rolling on agility stuff when I'm healing.
---
How early is too early for a warrior to try tanking BRD? Can it be done at 49/50?
---
you're comparing a combo used in combat to logical thinking of should I wear +healing when I go solo kill mobs
---
Every few weeks on onyxia splits
---
Exactly my reaction my friend! It’s crap! 💩
---
I was logging into my mage sitting in free wind to check mail when he started moving on his own.  Took me a couple seconds to realize it was mind control.  After they tossed me off the ledge I just popped slow fall and /wave as I made it down safely
---
In some instances ive gone the route of snacking skull real quick then focusing on everything else, letting whoever gets skull keep it. Works out for the most part even with a rogue so i figure a pally taking a few hits is fine.
---
If you were in my group id let you keep the skill which will be down soon anyways and build a healthy threat lead on everything else
---
You know a lot of people were blind to the intricacies of classic because they never played it right?
---
Just be like my bud and spend all your DKP on enh and ele peices for now- then when the other stuff drops again later it'll be way cheaper =p
---
Tier gear will get to you eventually as there simply won't be shaman left that want it.  Although most horde raids have 6-8 sham so that could take awhile.  Healer prio isn't as bad since you have multiple ways to get it done- and as the rest of the raid gets better (tanks/dps get stronger) there's less need for you to gear better because fights are shorter, tanks are beefier, AND other healers are better too so if you want to whistle along you'll be JUST FINE!
---
Blade flurry should be used on cool down if you have any gear. You will kill the second mob before you need a heal, especially if evasion is up.
---
AP equivalent of glad chain is 96.2, T1 is 92.8.
---
You're also pretty easily replaced though if you do it too much.
---
If the run is 1 minute slower in the end because you didn't participate in the trash killing you wasted 39 minutes of your guild mates' time.
---
Probably a good idea to have weapon swap macros for enh in general, nice to have the shield if you're getting attacked sometimes.
---
Never got ravager and can not bear the thought of going back to SM again
---
Shadowmeld mind control is always fun. Shadowmeld eating and drinking.
---
I was speaking in general terms, +healing would be a priority in most cases especially for pre raid rings
---
Yeah I don't think this is due to batching and both are pretty buggy - it needs to be dealt with. As much as I dislike rogues their kit should work correctly!
---
Ps: my rogue friend straight stopped doing pickpocket runs due to this bug so it's definitely having an effect on the player base.
---
You're taking longer to make less money. Purely because you choose to.
---
It's the definition of stupidity
---
We killed all their leaders.
---
I might suggest throwing your next 8 points into prot for melee hit%
---
thanks
---
I have never spent more than 10 minutes looking for a tank. They aren’t as rare as some of them seem to think.
---
For me as tank, starting the fight at 20-40 rage instead of zero is a night-and-day difference. It means DPS instantly can open up on any mob (which they do no matter what), no mob will ever get through to the healer, and instead of running around taunting and stunning stuff left and right I can sit back, tab through and do my thing. 
---
If I let the healer drink to 100% all the time, this is something I never get. I'm always empty on pull. Just because the healer only likes to use the first 30% of his mana. It's not like my mana estimation is "okay, if I pull this and everything goes perfect the healer is OOM and everyone almost, but not quite dead at end of the fight". I'll include quite a healthy safety margin in that, usually enough for another added group for example. But in most dungeons with most healers, this means I can pull like 3-4 mob groups one after the other with very short drink breaks while I pull before the healer drops so low in mana that I'll wait for him to top off. It's much easier for me, makes my tanking smoother, and it's faster for everyone.
---
Agree...but...#Nochanges. LoL
---
-11 int -10stam -10fr but sure its better ye...
---
it does
---
that's literally not how threat works. at all
---
HAHHAHAHA GIVEITASHOT
---
Roll pvp lol
---
Yah not sure where OP is getting at.
---
You need a bigger sample size, like a few thousand hits, on the same mob.
---
Then do that again for another mob or different conditions.
---
Then aggregate the data and base your conclusions on that.
---
Not doubting you OP, but more is needed.
---
It's not "miles" better. For hunters specifically you're only losing out on a value of less than 15 attack power when compared to cadaverous armor, which is also A LOT easier to get, and seeing as T1 is better once you get the full set, it's nothing but an asshole move to take it over a warrior as the chest could easily last them until Naxx as the AQ chest is only a marginal upgrade.
---
Every dkp guild I've been in has announced the dkp auctions in chat
---
Yeah man, all those stats right there sure help dps!
---
420chan had item tooltips from wowhead for a long time.
---
Y'know, before they had webms or 100 other features.
---
Canadian stoner dev had his priorities I guess.
---
I have to chime in and say I agree with you. Nothing better than a group that allows me a few seconds to have people beat on me and establish rage/agro, nothing worse than trigger happy DPS. I hate playing with other warriors who love to charge before I have even reached a pack of mobs
---
This is exactly what I think is wrong with retail. Changing stories and fabricating wow reality to cover up technical things. 
---
Instead of a bunch of ingame RPing to a new magical server I just want TBC and a one button click that transfers me or whatever. I dont need to talk to a NPC that guides me through shit
---
Also fuck Warlords of Draenor.
---
By "real world" you mean "wowhead guides"? LOL.
---
Side point, why don't they cap factions to make servers more balanced
---
It's good for personal time efficiency of the player but shit for the overall guild time efficiency. That's just selfish behavior that shouldn't have a place in a guild.
---
I know having more mana and staying alive ofc does but feel free to play with whatever you like.
---
i... honestly don't understand people doing this so fervently. i guess if they're just that fucking bored, more power to them. but, it only adds up to 7-8 more damage then just using Spirit of Aquamentis.
---
Sometimes I feel like anytime I type in chat that I'm OOM or need to drink, it's code for the tank to charge into the next mob.
---
Also had someone over the weekend get mad saying pallys are God tier and should never go OOM but I'm only level 26 so Idk what he expects from me.
---
So at this point, flying is basically disabled until blizzard unlocks the pathfinder achievements. WoD was a single achievement whereas legion on was two, the "pathfinder part one" being available from the start of the expansion but not really doing much until part two which unlocks flying which is usually halfway or 3/4ths of the way through the expansion.
---
Generally the first step entails completing all major questlines in every zone. You often need to use a guide to figure out *exactly* what quests to do as they don't all count towards the supposed storylines. From there you're often required to reach revered status with all relevant factions of said expansion.
---
From Legion onward it was split up into two parts, one for the first portion of content and the last usually entailing the "end daily zone" or so i call it. Basically whatever new area they add later on and make it a daily/world questing hub akin to tanaan jungle. Usually this entails hitting a certain rep with the factions and some other miscellaneous stuff.
---
It's an extraordinarily tedious process if you didn't play the expansion when it was current. And it's only going to get worse and worse as they keep using the system for every expansion.
---
People will often scoff and say "well why do you need flying anyways if its not current content?" which drives me nuts considering "back in the day" we just paid our gold and were done with it. Maybe actually had fun making that gold. Flying is a big feature of retail, if anything zones *not* being current content is even more of a reason to want flying so you don't need to be there longer than you have to.
---
I think the worst part about retail for me is that i *want* to play retail, but knowing myself i'd just force myself to do the allied race grinds and pathfinder for BfA and already be burned out. I've always valued "permanent" progression above all else, which are usually things like mounts, account features(races/flying/etc), transmog, etc. Getting dark iron/void elves/LF draenei with WoD flying pretty much soured the entire experience because it was so tedious and felt like complete filler. Which is a real shame. Most people i know also burn out before they even get to "enjoy" what they paid for in terms of the allied races like i did, despite that being one of my most anticipated feature of the expansion.
---
In each run, Xn killed 2 of the 4 dragons, making for a total of 2000 kills. However, he has only gotten 79 drakestones in total: 15 owl, 14 whale, 13 eagle, 10 falcon, 7 wolf, 7 int, 6 spirit, 3 frozen wrath, 3 fiery wrath, 1 healing. ~~This means he has also gotten every possible affix EXCEPT shadow wrath.~~ Not sure about that actually. At the moment, he plans to continue doing ST lockouts until he gets 100 drakestones.
---
To be fair I only spent like 15 minutes eating.  I thought it was hilarious because I wasn’t in a hurry at the time. Four people spent 30+ minutes waiting for me to respawn so by wasting their time it felt like a reverse grief. 2 of them were rogues and I could see them in stealth when my ghost walked by them.
---
No need, we kill most bosses around 1min and I dont run out of mana because we prioritize our items correctly.
---
It was an impromptu swim. Didn’t really plan for it to happen but I was bored and went with it
---
Omg. Watching a perfect LOS pull, all bunched in a ball, round the corner together, almost to the tank, and suddenly they’re running all over the place.  That hurts my soul.
---
I wonder if we can ever get back to that sweet spot of tanking, which IMHO was tbc heriocs where the tank and cc had to do their job right every pull.  All the “GOGOGO big pulls!!” AOE fest is just annoying
---
sick! I always wondered was it was like to owning that in vanilla era. 
---
PS, I fought unbreakable and whooped his ass on my gnome rogue. Good ol times! RNG procs were less common after the fix.
---
He is less than 10% for sure. I’ve seen him only like 5 times in 80+ runs.
---
Increase your odds boys.
---
I managed to get all the gems to make the key while doing my runs trying to get hands of power (still don’t have them. FU quartermaster zigs!) Once I was able to get the key for UBRS. I made my own groups and did 6 man Jed / Rend runs. Guaranteed you will have a ton of melee messaging you to go. They need dal rends and true strike shoulders in UBRS. Stack the group with melee. If they aren’t cool with it, that’s cool they can leave you will have an easy time filling. 
---
Going with 2 or 3 casters will increase your odds instead of having to roll against 5 or 6. Good luck!
---
Ty for the input was looking for such post.
---
From what I read they're heavy diminishing return After +5 wep (6% yellow cap at 305 5% at 315) skill meaning that if you have edgemaster as a human you can use axes without much penalities.. very interesting
---
its probably not the content, it's the delivery of advice that causes people to respond badly or not at all.
---
because honestly I've rarely had the toxic blamefest / horror pugs that everyone complains about. you are the only common variable in your groups.
---
if the only time you are 'teaching' is after a wipe and you are going full on blame attribution then people will be far less receptive
---
1000g saved on mount to put toward mace.   Beat by my guilds main tank.   Yeah!   I never claimed I was elite, just lucky and happy.
---
Id personally just get LH helms crafted and sold with all the arcanite. The MC weapons just shit on it too much to justify, for me that is.
---
its not bis for druid tanks.
---
I'm lvl 57 can I do all dm wings?
---
Bruh why are you going in with competition just organize runs where you’re the only one rolling.
---
/r/NobodyAsked
---
It's principle and content at this point.
---
Honestly, I like tanking. But all of those things that you've mentioned are just things you have no control over, unless you want to sit have an interview with every single potential party candidate to see if theyre above 50iq. The way my buddy has told me to look at is is: you're the tank, you lead the group; you get to decide on how to approach each fight. If someone doesnt agree, they can go back to spamming in lfg for another hour.
---
Lol def not faction changes. That’s definitely a retail mindset. Don’t like your faction? Too bad. Server transfers were in vanilla so that’s good.
---
Skeram Represent.! Congratulations Brotha.

Crix-Invictus
---
Keep seeing Alliance stomping Horde cities but not the other way around. Seems strange.
---
I don't understand your point. Are you just taking a nihilistic extreme stance to highlight the apparent inconsistency of rolling "greed" for BoP items while rolling "need" for BoE? I mean...you aren't wrong. Rolling "need" on every BoP drop would probably net you more gold than rolling "greed" like a good citizen. 
---
But the point I was making above is that the WoW community has pretty obviously settled on need-before-greed for BoP items. Try rolling "need" on some BoP plate gear as a mage if you don't believe me...you will probably get immediately booted and will subsequently struggle to find a group once your reputation spreads. The same simply isn't true for BoE items; consensus on how to treat BoE epics isn't established, hence the origin of this thread. There is an obvious and enormous difference between vendoring a 1g BoP blue drop and selling a 30g-500g BoE epic drop on the AH. Pricing on the AH *reflects the usefulness* of the item: the Warden Staff I mentioned is BiS for Druids and thus sells for 300g+, while the shield in this thread isn't good for much of anything and therefore goes for far less. In either case, the fungibility of *any* BoE (versus a BoP) is such that it doesn't make sense to give priority to class/spec when rolling on them. This view is compounded by the unfortunate reality that telling everyone to "greed unless you need" creates an obvious incentive for bad behavior. Expecting 4 people to nobly press "greed" when offered a 300g bag of gold so that the Druid gets a nice upgrade just isn't realistic (even assuming you think it's fair), but it seems to work just fine when that "bag of gold" is a 1g blue to vendor.
---
I got mine the only time I ever got that boss in arena. And the only r
---
Not really. It’s far easier to keep S&amp;D up all the time with SS and it results in more consistent damage overall + you don’t need to stealth to every target + you don’t pull aggro with ambush/backstab crits.
---
They won't trigger the demon unless they move. Both of my tank (Resto Druid Bear and Fury/Prot) both died. The tank was able to use rage without the event ending, but the bear just stood there)
---
I've made a habit of not waiting for mages to refill mana. If they have mana, that means they are pulling aggro as soon as I pull the next pack, and it's a shitshow. They keep asking to wait for drinking, but they can drink for the first 10 seconds of the fight if it's a problem for them. There are some good mages out there, but they are few and far between.
---
Read the guy who I was responding to.
---
I see what I did now
---
I know you don’t need best gear, of course. The point was I assumed you were better than that based off the praise you wanted, but you admit to only being subpar. So Gratz on your weapon you shouldn’t be using. I’ll send you a SS of my next white weapon I get.
---
EU Mograine checking in?
---
Volunteer to tank or port for free. Give away potions or gold. That kind of stuff is nice
---
God, yes. I hate using frost Nova, casting Frostbolt a few times, and when I get hit at 2.4s into the cast it's a triple hit and my cast bar resets to 0.
---
Eh respawn time isn’t even 10min. No harm no foul.
---
A top comment from wowhead:
---
The Rake used to be much sought after for his fast 1.2 attack speed available at the low level of 10. This speed wouldn't be encountered again until level 20 or so, and didn't get any faster unless you obtained Broken Tooth at level 37, or a Bloodseeker Bat (both their speeds were 1.0). Since TBC came out and pet attack speeds have all been normalized to a standard speed of 2.00, he is essentially the same as any other cat. As far as looks go he is a typical lion, not unique really, unlike Ekyachee, Sian-Rotam or Humar who have unique skin.

I'm not sure if it still applies to classic, but The Rake is and was a very popular and sought after pet.
---
Because they're something I never had a chance to get, and at this rate probably never will.  They're sidegrades, but also cool for pvp and just appearance.
---
But even if you're going for actually pre-bis, it's just as bad, if not worse.  I'm playing a lock and ran brd arena/golem at least 30 times before I even saw the ogre, let alone the belt.  Pants pre-bis? Going to have to find someone who wants to spam lbrs.  Cloak, wand, neck?  Find a group that wants to spam live strat for an infinitesimal drop chance and hope nobody else in your group needs.  Main hand?  Have fun spamming scholo.
---
And the drop rates are just fucked in general.  I've already lost count of how many times I've run scholo trying to collect d0 helm and necropile set.  Have never seen the boots or helm drop, ever, but I've walked out of there once with two of the plate belts in my inventory because it dropped back to back.  That should never happen, especially in a group composed of a druid, rogue, shaman, lock, and a priest.  Drop rates should be weighted towards the classes actually running the dungeon, because the way it is now is just a random crap shoot of slogging through the same dungeon a hundred times hoping you get lucky.

omg that sound... i would want to kill myself if i had to listen to that any longer.

Omg so many shields!
---
Yeah, I don’t always pop it right away, but now that I can burst mobs down in 10 seconds or so it’s usually just worth it for the extra dps. As a rogue it’s nearly impossible to actually die in a 5 man unless the tank dies.
---
It's like rain, on your wedding day.
---
I need this aswell would make my life alot better
---
i have seen you a couple of times :) you are not on my kill list thats good. Biggest enjoyment I got today was killing knifecrime he is ganking lowbies in bb
---
Yeah, it happened in Vanilla as well
---
To all DPS reading this who struggle to wait before opening up, do what I do. Take Skinning as a profession and skin 1-2 mobs before you spam out damage. A lot of dungeons have skinnable mobs and no-one is waiting between pulls for you to skin. The number of dungeons I've run now where I'm the only Skinner is insane, you make off as a bandit!
---
Ive seen this too, had a zf group with a much high hunter and we wiped afew times because he kept thinking he could do whatever he wanted.
---
I encountered a level 60 botter today doing laps around a recommended grinding spot for legit players needing to get those last few levels, I had run out of quests and was looking to grind some xp to get to 55. There was two other people farming that area too. This is on a PvE realm (Nethergarde Keep). 
---
I led the bot into three mobs and it ended up getting stuck on terrain for 5 minutes until the mob it last killed, respawned, which kinda fix its glitch allowing it to start running the same farming route over and over. Eventually the player running the bot returned and stopped doing laps. This was after 45 minutes to an hour of it running in the same mob farming route over and over again in Winterspring, on the lake where the undead ghosts are.  
---
The botter left but there was two dual boxers farming the area too. In the end I gave up trying to compete and logged off.
---
I got mine after my fourth run and after seeing the orc boss only once before. Beat a hunter too. Luck is luck I guess.
---
i feel like i get more savorys just normally fishing there, every time go for a deviate pool i only get rum lol
---
We found the paladin.
---
I both love and hate tanking... 
---
I recently decided that I hated all my characters, all of them, I tried to like em but I really just wanted to be a warrior. I wanted to tank and I hate that because all of the problems you mentioned resonate with me.
---
The only way I've been able to suffer through stuff like this is by literally just accepting it. Someone says I need to speed up, I tell em they can stay and go at my pace or leave and find another group, if they pull for me I let them die, if they ninja loot gear or try to wipe the group I blacklist them.
---
I'm just letting things come as they may and accepting it, it's made the role less stressful for me.
---
Just gave it a read vert interesting. Don't know how I missed this since I'm almost always trying to understand how things work in this game
---
I've chood
---
your food
---
so dood
---
don't mood
---
^(...yeah, this isn't really poetry though, just sniping anything that rhymes and stuffing it into a sentence :P)
---
Just about enough shards to summon the lazy members of the raid who don't want to fly to Blackrock Mountain, and then summon them all again when a mage plops down a Darnassus port on top of your summon portal for shits and giggles.
---
Go pve, then come back in a month and make a thread about not having anything to do at 60, or during phase 2. Or maybe make a thread asking when are they adding server transfers.
---
These threads pop up daily. People rolling pve regret their choice, yet lack the motivation to level another character. Sure, nobody likes getting 2v1d in world pvp, it sucks. But if you take the easy route of a pve server, you will never experience the full wow classic, and will possibly become envious when you see all these giant pvp battles and skirmishes on twitch and youtube.
---
Make the right choice, roll pvp
---
wait did you guys go UC after we were wiped in the Barrens?
---
Basically, but no cube rerolls and no enchanter.
---
I also main a tank for my friends, I was completely confused why are pug healer kept yelling MANA, in chat. She told me that I was the only tank she has played with that waits for her to drink, and made a macro that says that when she sits. I had no idea that not watching casters mana was a thing. Crazy times since 15yrs ago.
---
&gt; Click the keybind once, it will use gouge and change the icon to bandage,   
---
so basically exactly the same as using 2 key binds, one for gouge and one for first aid. Very useful indeed l33t technology =.=
---
Yes. As far as I know The Rake is the second best kitty (fastest attack speed). The fastest is the rare spawn in badlands. (I think)
---
I think too, if you're paying attention to how much damage you/the group are taking on each pull, it makes it really obvious really fast if your healer should sit and drink (or not). In Mara the healer was going to half mana easily on each pull, sometimes further down, but wouldn't drink (I gave him 60 water) even sitting at 50%. He should have been drinking every chance he got because he was feral and was struggling to heal two warriors who kept ping ponging aggro.
---
Instead, he ran ahead and moonfired things.
---
I wish I could say it was a nice smooth run but it wasn't. We died a lot, and it wasn't all the healer's fault of course, but holy shit...if he'd have drank when I did, even just a few sips here and there, deaths would have been less than half of what we had.
---
One bad pull or crit, one mishap, and that full mana makes a difference. If you're gonna stand there and wait until the tank's at 50% health to start casting anyway, why not sit while he's running to the next pack? Why not sit until you're ready to start casting?
---
I get it when it's your own money/water, but with mage water? It doesn't make any sense.
---
In a 15 year old game Id like to believe that most people have played both roles. If so its pretth easy to manage the speeds and when to wait and when to pull
---
“Picking”
---
Did you have levitate buffed?
---
Cheap shot isnt broken. Artificial  spell batching is retardrd and shouldve never been added to the game.
---
Honestly this was my problem.  WoW:C was my first experience with WoW and I haven't touched it in 2 weeks because I just haven't found the desire.  I got to 40 and got my mount, which was what I was super excited about, and now that I have it..Idk, the game just feels easy as a PvE'r.  Every dungeon group I've been with has just steamrolled without any hiccups.  I know that the raids might be harder but based on what I've read it doesn't seem like there's ever much of a challenge outside of PvP which doesn't interest me.  At this point I don't see myself returning to wow.  Some of the individual quests I had were very hard to solo and that was fun, but they get incredibly repetitive, honestly.
---
I was there... at the Horde side. :P
---
His dps still gonna be crash in raids cause of the 16 slot debuff limit
---
now that i think of it, many old mmorpgs do have combat music.
---
people do it because thats how you instigate world pvp.
---
Yeah I don’t understand. Just stop giving them the free entertainment. People get bored really quick if you’re not feeding them kills over and over. Honestly if I get killed by the same person right after I Rez for just the second time, that’s enough for that toon for 20 min.
---
I went cookie cutter ret spec until 50 then went over to the holy tree for the last 10 talents and healed dungeons with a healing set I collected as I quested.
---
Only issue is running out of mana, just bring a bunch of mana drinks and you'll be fine.
---
or you could just learn to keybind and bandage the mili second after gouge goes off, i mean if its parried you're screwed anyway right? So whats the point then in the macro lol  
---
P.S. 2 extra ticks lol sure, enable that combat text and see how long 2 tics of bandage actually take. Are you telling me it would take you THAT long to realise whether your gauge was parried?
---
Bhagat has almost no wait time. Folks don't know that Bhag spawns across the road and little south too. In like 30s. I know this because I camped her for 15 mins and the. decided to talk a walk and whoomp there she is
---
This is the right answer. No way in hell DPS mana will ever be more important than healer mana.
---
I just hit 53 as a Gnome Warlock. Should I be questing WPL/Searing Gorge/Un'Goro/Burning Stepes or should I be going for dungeons? What's my path to 60 now?
---
Cast a grenade when they start casting frostbolt when you're in a Nova
---
What is the point of this topic? You really think people who read the wow subreddit are the same people who do stuff like this? Its like telling people ina bar that alcohol is nice. Trust me, the already know
---
If you stand in front of her even while in the air she can swing and hit you with melee, Basically the whole fight you should be on either side of her to avoid tail/swing/Breath etc.
---
How do you make a horde and Ally toon on the same PvP server? Thought you couldnt do that
---
you're getting all the fury warriors who can't get a group and are forced to "tank"
---
most of the **real** tanks have already hit 60 btw so if you're still in leveling phase you're in for a bad time
---
I got clearcasting early so it was handy for when I accidentally trapped myself out of form and needed to fish for a regrowth clearcasting proc bashing with weapon! Getting crowd pummeler with zero mace skill was rough.
---
You can shift out, cast Barkskin, shift back into bear form. The only problem is getting oneshot while you're not in form.
---
No, neither did the ret pally.
---
Arms scales with weapon damage and WW has huge weapon damage. 2h fury isn’t that good until you get good crit chance, and it’s also more reliant on overall gear than arms. And when you’re leveling you generally are always undergeared.
---
There are no layers on this server...
---
Surprising how often lfg is going odd on him
---
c o m i c s a n s
---
&gt; When frostbolts hit for 1200-1400 non crit? If so I have a long way to go for that. 
---
Yes indeed, as I said only the best (geared) in the world are at that point now.
---
&gt; How do you determine effective crit and does that mean you hit a breakpoint and any crit after that isn’t as useful?
---
By effective crit I just mean measured by logs. Full raid buffs/auras/etc. As for the diminishing returns, I just looked back at my formulas and it's the same numeric gain to your dps, it's just a lower % gain since your dps will be higher with more crit.
---
&gt; In what ways are you saying to use ToEP to its max effectiveness? Just using it on cool down would be using it to its max effectiveness, right? What are strategic ways to use it that you are suggesting? Use the proc then swap to EoTB right before combat starts?
---
I don't know if a proc-then-swap would be worth it. I expect it'd have to be very well-timed, and only on short fights. I mostly meant using it in conjunction with AP, and not popping it shortly before downtime (e.g. in-between phases) potentially makes the % uptime on it better w.r.t. your actual attack time.
---
Simple and straight to the point, I like it
---
I've given up pickpocketing BRD as I'll get hit out of Vanish so often that I don't even want to bother anymore. It's happened quite a bit in PVP as well. It's REALLY annoying. As for cheap shot, the most common occurrence  for this bug I've found is with the Yeti's in Winterspring. They'll get their instant cast freeze ability on you right after cheap shot so often that's it not even worth trying.
---
Yes, we did quite good with the counter force. :) It was epic indeed. The classic experience.
---
It’s true though.  Let’s forget the drop rate and focus on how easy it is to do arena 5x an hour.  You can do it with 3 people and you could easily bring along 48-52s that would be more than happy to go just for the xp/drops.  So finding a group for it isn’t very hard.
---
Other epics in dungeons are harder to farm.  Even if you found a group for emperor runs, it still takes time to clear mobs and lava jump.  Getting to arena is the easiest path to an epic than any other part of a dungeon in the entire game.  But yeah, the drop rate still sucks
---
20 for 55 réputation so from revered 0/21000 it's 21000/55 = 381. 
---
Easy enough to do by yourself tho..
---
You cant do that silly.. That energy is for max dps ofc
---
The real mvp sits on top in between the lil hole right above you
---
Certified Queb. Congrats my dude!
---
Classic ret paladin
---
hello retail-boy
---
FASTER FASTER FASTER!
---
that make your dick hard?
---
Played rogue in vanilla, and the vanish bug seems consistent with how to worked back then (small chance of it failing somehow). 
---
The CS bug, I dunno - I remember it working consistently no probs.
---
Sure if everyone is down with it.
---
But  it doesn't always work, and if you're running a dungeon, it's OK to take an extra few minutes on the dungeon so you aren't playing at 100% the whole time, it gets tiring to focus super hard the entire dungeon if you're running it on farm.
---
I was just following the icy veins guide that said it was prebis so I rolled haha
---
This sounds like the only logical explanation but as I said at the time we were well on a side of her as she had used a breath not long ago. That said maybe I wasn't enough considering her hitbox. Thanks for the insight.
---
Run away
---
Perhaps
---
Dwarf passives are definitely the best in general, no argument there. However, it is my strong opinion that if you're going priest healer, Nelf priest have the edge (Elune's Grace included) in pvp.
---
Being able to shadowmeld from the opposition and pulling a sneak attack/heal is more crucial when it comes to pvp, and even more so in bgs. Back in my pvp glory days, I'd shadowmeld across from my flag carrier, wait for a rogue to come by and sap and swiftly run on to fear/shield/heal. No one fears you when they can't see you either, but you can dispel it when it's cast on others. I'd also take advantage and defend by myself while shadowmelded. And in the event you got targeted, you could cast Elunes Grace and give yourself some opportunity to save yourself. Granted, I was disc, so I couldn't kill anyone by myself, but no one could kill me either.
---
Yeah Vanish was -always- like this. Those downvoting you are wrong. I remember this vividly as a rogue player in vanilla.
---
kirtonos
---
I run a feral build thats 60:40 (bear:cat). I stomp melee dps and mages in pvp but warlocks and good hunters stomp me and raid tank and DPS.
---
All you can do is controll the pet and exploit the deadzone
---
Why do this now?
---
well well well how the turntables
---
As long as you bring the healthstones, we're good.
---
Yeah it's easier to just count anger instead since he's usually done for arena runs.
---
Hit cap only matters in long fights/raids, nobody cares in dungeons
---
oh damn i guess it is bugged then
---
If you don’t dead zone the hunter you will lose.
---
Yes, for one of us
---
Feral tank.......that's funny
---
&gt; do that on an LoS pull and you'll be tanking something.
---
Yes - if it's an LoS pull i won't be healing a thing until the tank establishes aggro. Fortunately there's plenty of time on LoS pulls for me to post up and have a drink while the tank grabs the mobs.
---
Base miss chance against same defense (300 vs 300) mobs is  5%.
---
 The first 10 points of defense above attacker weapon skill is .1% added chance to miss per point.
---
That's a 6% chance to miss against a mob 2 levels higher (310 def vs 300 weapon skill). That's because of the 5% base plus 1% for the first 10 points of deficit.
---
If Defense-Weapon Skill is greater than 10 the first 1% hit contributed from your gear is ignored and the chance to miss is .2% per point of deficit.
---
That's 8% chance to miss against a mob 3 levels higher (315 def vs 300 weapon skill), but you need to have 9% total hit to bring miss chance to 0. That's because of the 5% base plus 3% for the 15 points of deficit and 1% due to the greater than 10 weapon skill gap that ignores the first 1% of hit from gear contributions.
---
Weapon skill also helps reduce the damage penalty from glancings blows.
---
Against a level 63 mob you always have a 40% chance to land a glancing blow. At 300 weapon skill glancing blows deal 35% reduced damage. That penalty can be decreased at a rate of 4% per point of weapon skill reducing the penalty down to a minimum of 5%.
---
For example at 305 weapon skill your glancing blows receive a 15% damage penalty (35%-(4%*5skill)).
---
At 307 weapon skill your glancing blows deal only 7%. With 5% penalty being the minimum that means the 308th point of weapon skill can only reduce the glancing penalty by another 2% making it half as effective as the points before it.
---
308 is the weapon skill cap on glancing blow damage reduction with the 8th point being slightly diminished return.
---
What do I have to do in order to learn how to smelt dark iron ore? I read i have to talk to some dwarf before the seven bosses in brd and make an offering of 20x gold bars, 10x truesilver bars and 2x star ruby. Is that it? Does it have any prerrequisite, like reputation with any faction?
---
&gt;Expecting 4 people to nobly press "greed" when offered a 300g bag of gold so that the Druid gets a nice upgrade just isn't realistic 
---
that's what's happened so far for all the expensive BoE's i've seen drop so far.  freezing band, vestments of truefaith pattern (needed only by priest), distilled wisdom elixir.
---
99.9% of the time it's need before greed.  none of my groups start off with "btw need boe's".  every time that seems to happen, it only comes up once the item drops you get somebody who wants to ninja but doesn't want to face the consequences of ninjaing so they try to convince everybody to need.  
---
if somebody tries to ninja, that sucks, but there's actions that can be taken against them because this isn't retail, everybody has a reputation here.  all agreeing to ninja only hurts the people who legitimately could use the upgrade with no avenue for them to do anything about getting ninja'd.
---
So ur the guy who does this :(
---
Got into an SM Cath spellcleave farm group with a 60 holy priest - he just ran around aggro'd groups while we AOE'd it down (Lock, 2 mages, Druid, Priest). He took all the loot we didn't need and made out like a bandit. Must've been 20-30 gold an hour easily. Obviously you have to find a few level 38+ people who are willing to give up green rolls for xp, but it seemed to work out well for him. Everytime someone left we replaced them in under a minute.
---
Sometimes if the tank looses aggro, and you are building new threat (whether by dmg or healing), Ony may physically attack you if the off tank can't pick her up quick enough or is deas.
---
I'm not sure if this happened to you though.
---
Exactly! this is the true experience! But so many butthurt people on both factions shit talk each other for attacking cities -.-
---
It’s a weird fight. People still are not 100% sure on how the aggro works on ONY but that’s the way I do it. All times stay on the right side of her and it seems to be working
---
Many issues stem from Blizzard being super lazy and instead of giving us the real client they gave us modern WoW with the artificial batching. It's the same reason why people are shocked at content being so easy right now. I mean don't get me wrong, it would have been easier than before by far but not to the extent it is now thanks to having patch 1.11 talents. Every class has had their revamp as well as all the nerfs to dungeons and raids by this point. Not to mention the gear changes. This isn't an exact replica of vanilla its a mish mash hybrid of BFA and pre-TBC vanilla.
---
Yeah this is how I've always done it, it's really easy and mentioned in so many guides.
---
That is why they are doing it before phase 2.
---
Its probably because you were within range of others when the fireball hit. Its been reported elsewhere that the fireballs drop 100% threat divided by number of people hit. So if you were say 33% above the next dps on the list and got hit with 2 others standing next to you, you might get hit again. But 3 or 4 in a row is absurd unless totems count for some hysterical reason.
---
I don't need to imagine that's what happens when valuable, BoE gear drops.
---
You apparently struggle with the concept of opportunity cost. When you are equipping, say a BoE with a market value of 100g, you are taking away from yourself, and others, an item worth 100g. It may be an upgrade but is it a 100g upgrade for you? That depends. You should be doing this evaluation every time on BoEs and if you are not then you are leaving money on the table. Saying you're equipping it is nothing more than saying you're spending 100g on that item. It's EXACTLY the same. If you already had it and won it, you would go sell it for 100g.
---
If you are doing that evaluation then you understand why everyone gets a shot at the item. Because anyone can sell the item and buy THEIR equivalent item that they can equip. YOU can even do that. Not every item is auto equip just because it's a marginal upgrade. And more importantly every item that drops isn't distributed solely based on who can equip it or who has X profession. For BoP that IS almost exclusively the case though, because those items have different value for the user vs someone who would have to vendor it for peanuts.
---
If that tanking gear is a valuable BoE then yes, it does make you wrong.  It makes you about a half step above being a ninja if you bully people out of a fair shot at an item that is equally valuable to them as it is to you.
---
This is the correct option. I like the other comment on this, too, about tanking a single mob at this stage to build rage while they let my mana regen. That's super awesome. It's also great for mana using dps, cause melee can help you kill it and the rest can drink up and then you're all ready for a bigger pull again.
---
You're right. Only legitimate tanks in classic at level 60 are warriors. I've gotten into several debates but any veteran of the game would side with me lol
---
Well , it really may have been a DPS upgrade! Lol. As long as their wasn’t a caster who needed it.
---
People ingame are dicks for virtually no reason. And I havent seen this particular reason come up once
---
Whats your spec?
---
And here I am on my warrior, level 54, using allyroute.com, with 7 days played....
---
&gt; Good warriors don't want this item (BRE is arguably better)
---
Funny story about that. A certain WoW Dev was playing warrior in a raiding guild in Vanilla, and lost the first Eye of Sulf to drop for his guild due to having less DKP than one other warrior (busy wow dev can't make every raid). Having a tonne of DKP and no Eye to save for anymore, this guy ended up coming to the next week's MC and got Bonereaver's Edge for hardly any DKP. This is because this was in February 2006, when BRE was still pretty terrible.
---
Fast forward to March 2006, and the [1.10.0 patch](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.10.0), where BRE received a *substantial* buff, and overnight became one of the best 2H weapons in the game for warriors; and he'd *just happened* to have got one 2 weeks prior. We thought it was hilarious and started asking for buffs for all the other weapons we won in raids for a while after that.
---
Hunters have a “dead zone” that basically makes them unable to shoot or attack you. I believe it’s like a 5-7 yd range? Don’t quote me on that just get close to him. 
---
Once you’re in his dead zone, just frost nova, use your abilities and he’s dead. If you let the hunter get away, you’re done. Same with if he’s the one ganking you, can’t let the hunter have distance
---
I remember seeing our guild leader (rogue) with it and thinking that he sort of strong armed the LC into giving it to him, and then I saw the speed...
---
/r/dataisbeautiful
---
Don't mind him. Just butthurt horde.
---
I just stand in the corner spot, eye of the beast my pet, then resummon when he disapears (the boss is just far enough away for theboet to despawn). When you resummon your pet, he still has aggro. So i just put him on stay, get in position, and fd. No need for your pet to run all the way back.
---
Yeah our mt legit spent that long in brd over the past several weeks. I probably have close to 50 arena runs just from being down to help him now and again, but just from counting anger kills in dbm he had over 450, and if he was gonna log out after he'd just do 5 arena by itself runs so it's probably quite a bit higher.  Everyone else in guild got it working like 50 max lol.
---
This error also existed in Vanilla and was patched out in 1.10 - noted above.
---
Honestly the real asshole attitude is this bis mentality imo. No doubt your completely right in all of that, but if an item drops and its a big upgrade, your not an asshole for rolling for it dude. You are if the group ressed it though, that's different.
---
Super easy.
---
Rank 1 frost bolt
---
Sheep pet
---
Deadzone
---
Win

"Hey yeah I know that this is barely an upgrade from a dungeon item and there's a bow quest that drops with a 50/50 chance that's way better with every MC but I'm gonna give it to the hunter even though it's something that a melee will use until the end of the game."
---
As long as you've been killing gnomes, I would argue it's the most efficient use of your time
---
I had 10 slot bags until like 55, then switched to 14 slot. I never run out of bag space now.
---
meh sure your opinion is valid, and sure you get a lot of more control in sub spec too. Its just that when you say that your biggest problem when leveling rogue was waiting for stealh cooldown then we are playing the same game but with a different chips in our heads, if you know what i mean. Just play whatever is fun then, but I wouldn't go off debating intricacies of different specs
---
I just had a really similar question the other day and a lot of people gave me some great ideas if you wanna check them out
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/do4ou0/druid_dungeon_solo_farms/
---
Yes. Weaponskill essentially stops being useful at +8, and the difference between +5 and +8 is only 10% penalty from glancing blows, which is about 3% ish increase of white dps. If you can get it then cool, if not, +5 is all you rly need.
---
Doesnt make much sense reserving it after
---
nice :P
---
Thank you for the replies you are being super helpful.
---
I see what you mean about effective crit. Little confused about the last part.. so if you gain 2% crit your dps will go up the same amount if you had, say, 6% crit vs 8%? But your dps at 8% is going to be higher than the 6% so that 2% crit is not as effective? Or it is just as effective but doesn’t reflect it?
---
All right, pack it up. Warcraft over.
---
The Yeti quest in Winterspring is actually what caused me to start taking notes of this. The freeze cast using most of (if not all) of Cheap Shot was incredibly frustrating.
---
Oh nice! That’s definitely a quick way to befriend warriors. Honestly if someone sent my warrior alt potions I’d kiss the ground at their feet. I use health potions all the time while questing
---
its easy to solo and even easier with 2 people (warlock/spriest and a mage). when you have everything else its worth chasing. if you couldnt solo/duo the drakes and had to do a full run or sth it wouldnt be worth.
---
Well, the only thing that can be faster than light, is a shadow! 
---
(also the blades of scissors with 1 light year long blades, but, oh well, not like we have these in WoW)
---
Priests are the overall better healer with a larger toolkit - aoe heals (prayer of healing), shields (put on casters to avoid push back while hellfire, etc.), and better regen (come back from going oom, aka mana burn effects).
---
Paladins in groups of 4 have better support buffs. They have better single target sustained healing. They wear plate and can BoP themselves.
---
In essence, alliance healers complement each other.
---
There are or course a lot of differences and niche plays. But I think when considering alliance healing, the above holds true.
---
/r/choosingbeggars
---
Lol no way will I ever be cool with a priest rolling need on tank gear that I need. I really wish y’all would go out there and tank dungeons and have that happen. No way would you think that’s fair. Much easier to say when your pre bis drops are BOP and you’re DPS always competing with others in the dungeon for all drops.
---
I rolled a Pally alt because I was getting burnt out on my Druid and everyone says they’re god tier healers but I personally prefer my druids heals more - then again my Pally is only level 28 so it could just be a level thing, but it feels like I have to constantly be spamming the heal on the tank and then if a DPS needs healing.... I’m OOM before I can blink.
---
dont be, buy a Unyielding maul for 30-35g from a DM tribute run, its better than warden staff.
---
Dead DPS is 0 DPS. I love when people stat-sheeted to the max are dead because they can't handle getting feared into Ony's lava in Phase3 and other unavoidable damage like that.
---
Is there a way to move or change the location of the Need/Greed window?
---
I know a lot of people that would beg to differ.  Especially because farming Baron cloak requires you to at least be half awake, vs effortlessly knocking out 5 arena runs in 25 mins with 1 healer.
---
Only after you fd. Here is what I do
---
Eye of the beast pet. Attack boss, cancel eye of the beast the moment he aggros. Resummon pet and put him on stay. Mend pet if he took a big hit before despawning. Then i run and hop down, tossing a viper sting on my way getting in position. Once i fd, my pet gets aggro again.

Thats a screenshot after our 4 guildruns we did tonight.. Still no MH btw.
---
(This is on my laptop, which I have been playing on for 3 weeks. On my PC I know that I had ATLEAST 40 kills)
---
That's what has worked for me... /shrug
---
This is great, first of all I hope none of your dps is actually dying to the lava on phase 3 and second of all.... its avoidable for ranged dps. Hell even if it wasn't pop a minor fire prot potion and go ham. Damn.
---
Elementals on my server are 2-3g. Some guy bought all the essensce of water the other day and marked em all up to like 22g lol
---
I've been 60 now for a while, always tanked dungeons on the way, and I might be the minority here, but think all those pugs made me a better tank, now running with guildies on the regular, makes the whole thing feel like easy mode and I purposely go and find a BRD pug that consists for lvl 54 players and below just to make it more interesting.
---
Right but that's his whole point. If you can get 40 nerds to carry you around on a golden stretcher and feed you grapes as you casually scoop up any and everything you want, you can be a hunter with TF
---
This is the best way to do it, and I rarely have my pet take much damage this way.
---
Is what we did on vanilla pve server was have a group of mostly stealth druids and rogues. Have a non stealth attack an opposing quest hub, the other non stealth site farther away out of sight. Low levels call for help. Gank the high level. High level calls for help. Pvp until you get too many to handle, or you call for help. 
---
We would also setup guild pvp to do similar events.
---
Everyone rolls need on boe epics
---
Druids don't mind the shield as much as warriors as they generate most of their rage by damage done rather than taken, also they have much less threat problems than warriors
---
My recommendation would be make leveling your priority and forget gold making. Grinding at 60 utterly overshadows any grinding for gold that you would be able to do at this level. 
---
However, if somebody comes up with something efficient and profitable, I'm open to suggestion.
---
Tanking for me is ruined by classic.   It's so boring.   I almost enjoy the bad DPS because it mixes it up.   I tanked Wrath to MoP, that was fun.  This is a snoozefest and classic's threat model is the culprit.   
---
Blizzard knew the threat model in classic was completely hosed too, because that's what got the most changes in TBC followed into Wrath.   Cataclysm heroics pre-nerf is where the game should be.  Kill orders, CC, and full out DPS/healing.   *That* was fun.  This?  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
---
Even linear dungeons are better than this, and classic players agree whether they admit it or not.   Look at how all the large dungeons are sliced and diced into smaller linear runs that don't take as much time.
---
Well hello there... :)
---
Don't forget about the 19 and 21 energy ticks, Rogue is damned in Classic.
---

---
Basing your argument on an outdated post on a pserver forum isn't really a good idea.
---
Use watchyoursixx's spreadsheet if you want to calculate the damage difference.
---
\*136 dps\* I would've stacked my meter to the moon showing off that fat loot.
---
I see so many of these screen shots of people complaining because of x, y, or z. They all seem so entitled. I'm glad I've not experienced any of this so far.
---
Oh hey that's my server
---
This can be quite dangerous doing Princess runs in Mara. There has been at least one time where she caught up to me and "one-hit" me, but in combat log it was actually 6 hits all at the same time.
---
There definitely some weighting to which boss spawns. Seen spider and worgen an absolute ton.

idk, we did duo as shaman warrior with mining herb and disench, and it is not that much gold unless u get arcane crystal... we did that for hour and it was maybe 40G for me
---
I'm an arms warrior tank, and I approve this message.
---
Hardest content is harder, easiest content is easier (if you considering lvling easiest content). Just I mean, pretty basic concept that shouldn’t even be debated
---
Bartender has this option
---
Apparently there is a dead zone I had no clue of. So sheep pet, get close just outside of melee range, nova, frost bolt to death. Well learn something new every day! Thanks all!
---
I’ve done 15 scholo runs and still haven’t seen a cadaverous armor. I don’t think it’s crazy hard to get, I’m just unlucky for that particular piece. Everything has variance in this game.
---
Its likely that bugfix is still working and its artificial spell batching causing this issue.
---
Well you guys heal yourself and tank/dps all at the same time so y’all def got that. When is tree form?
---
If you do Ashenvale you'll probably be better off. There are some good quests there.
---
I have noticed this while doing princess in maraudon solo, if she catches me she hits me 4-5 times and can just wreck me instantly if any of the hits crit. I thought she had some kind of windfury but it really does seem like a bug
---
Are the xl jumper cables any better than the other ones? I've tried using them probably 10x and have yet to rez anyone lol.
---
Don't offer help and refuse to answer.
---
Note that shield doesn't stop warlocks from hurting themselves, but protects them from anyone stopping the channel
---
I just started playing this game last week, can someone please explain the significance of this/what’s going on here? Sorry for the ignorance
---
Everyone notices when a dps does no damage in a 5 man. The big brain move is to do it in raids.
---
Is that to me or the guy who randomly whispered someone 13 levels higher to heal a mara run for free?
---
Agreed.
---
Hunters, if you're that person who multishots as soon as we pull so you can maximize your dps, i hate you and will never invite you back.
---
Same for you mages. If you blizzard while mobs are still running to me during a corner pull, i will tell the healer to let you die.
---
Would be pretty silly to not take up mining and farm the arcane crystals yourself knowing you’ll need them.
---
We figured from the amount of insecurities in most of your replies yeah.
---
Can confirm. I’ve just hit 7 days played and I’m 47 lol
---
You're totally clueless aren't ya? :)
---
You should actually watch the video. None of those points address the issues that occur at 0:10 for example. No dots, reasonable distance from level 52 mobs as a level a level 60 and stealth lasts for like 5 seconds before the mobs that never drop aggro break it. 0:29 dude drinks a *health potion* and gets stealth from it (even changes to his stealth skill bar). 
---
Dunno how anyone can watch 0:29 and not think something fucky is going on.
---
You go out and delete the alliance from your server.
---
Oh... really? I didn't know that about mocking blow. I'll have to pay more attention to that.
---
Unless your also paying the other 4 members the 20% of the items value then your scumming them. 
---
Why should you get the 100g item for FREE? You want it so bad go buy it from the AH.   Or offer to pay the party members or everyone gets to roll.
---
I'm not just talking about Revered to Exalted. I'm talking about the entire process. Jesus. All of you are so picky.
---
I feel like your mindset is probably the same as the tanks I’ve been playing with. They never complain. I’ve heard them complain to clothies. 
---
Thanks just wanted to verify that I’m not inconveniencing my team too much.
---
Thanks for the reply. Do paladins have a heal over time like me as priest or a Druid  dose? Just curious, I have not raided yet.
---
Sorry mate must've hit a nerve with you real hard. I guess I should have said that this was our guild first raid. You right ms does add a useless debuff that's why I didnt fucking use it lol.
---
I'm really curious where you're finding your "many people". Nobody is saying that. Every serious hunter is using rhok, and was using CSC prior to it. 
---
&gt; Rhok'delar, while far superior to Striker's Mark, isn't guaranteed either, so it should be acceptable for hunters to roll on Striker's Mark
---
50% drop chance every raid isn't high enough for you? LOL
---
Sadly there's plenty of #changes, the biggest one being that they allow 3-4x as many players on a server compared to old vanilla with 0 changes to certain things like herbs and ore veins. It's really dumb. Also really odd that no one is crying about #nochanges + the population like so many did with other suggestions and things they might change.
---
You are sick dude i hope you have time to grind high warlord u deserve it that 4v1 was really impressive:)
---
And here is where we see the BiS lists break down.  How much of a dps gain is that offhand over the next BiS?  Have you calculated your time lost to farming as opposed to the gold or anything else you could have done?
---
I have here a quick gif I just made of me attacking somebody from the floor of the building with rank 1 smite to prove my point that the ledge isn't anything special. No terrain exploitation, no geometry, and no f\*\*kery  required, and as you can see this is purely from the ground level in that building.

---
Again, guards aren't meant to defend players being attacked within their aggro range. They only aggro on players who are offenders and also are within their aggro range themselves. That isn't a bug or an exploit, that's how guard AI works. Neutral guard range is just smaller than you seem to think it should be.
---
Id pref pali but I think priest is equal to in strength. Its really hard to calculate their different strengths and figure out what outweighs the other.
---
Imagine rolling on a PvE server...
---
i’m pretty sure you need to keep the old ones! try it (put the old ones in the bank) before you delete them.
---
Obviously I love the class. 
---
I agree with everything you said. I wasn't referring to current end-game. MC/ONY is when druids are at our best. I was trying to say how druids fail to scale well with increasing levels of tier gear.
---
The amount of power a warrior gets from going to T2 then T3 (or PvP equivalent of gear) is insane vs what a druid will get out of their high-end gear. The same can be said for all classes except hunter. Druids and Hunters just do not do well compared to how insanely powerful other classes become. Druids are still great, but we end up looking useless in comparison to the ridiculous power other classes will have later on.
---
 Playing private server as a druid was useless minus flag carrying just because how easy it is to 1-shot us. We depend on attrition in fights against the other classes as well as our mobility and sadly our high-end gear only significantly approves our mobility. 
---
So like Hunters, we will just see our class stagnate in power as the game goes on. We can easily get gear because of how few of us there are, but our gear won't help us in the same ways it helps the other classes.
---
Flip the scenario. 
---
Imagine there exists a 2H weapon in MC that is BiS for hunters as a stat stick, and it’s BiS for a looong time. 
---
For warriors, at best it’s an immeasurably small upgrade over a super easy to get blue item, and most theorycrafters say it’s worse.
---
And the warrior 2H BiS that’s far superior has a 50% chance to drop on a later boss. 
---
I personally wouldn’t let warriors roll on it. That’s a hunter weapon. Every warrior who raids semi-regularly is going to get their warrior-only BiS weapon pretty soon, this 2H is for hunters.
---
What was the hunter thing?
---
You'd have an argument if we were talking about how to play, what class to play, etc. etc.
---
But we're talking about using the auction house interface, quite possibly the most binary part of the game
---
You have two options, use the shitty default interface to manually set prices.  
---
Or use an addon to automate it and make more gold for the time you spend in the game.
---
There's no understanding required here, bud, you either do it the efficiency way, or the oblivious idiot way.
---
Prioritize 1 spec before entering that you will roll on imo.
---
While I remember Vanish failing occasionally in Vanilla in the video above he pops Sprint, flees from his targets, preps, and Vanishes again.  
---
Combat does not drop, melee mobs keep chasing to fight.  
---
Happens at the 10 second mark (roughly)
---
You are the rare unicorn. I've had more bad experiences than good experiences with mages so far in classic. This was not the case in vanilla... I'm not sure what happened.
---
I never said it's hard or impossible, but if it's one person in the raid you want to min/max it's your MT. Gear is an issue and even more so the further the game comes along, so is a lack of a reliable shield block(reliable enough sounds sub-par in my ears). No last stand or shield wall removes two god sent crutches.. Dark runes put another strain on your healers and mana pots share cooldown with healthpots. Sounds like quite a bit to sacrifice to get more AoE TPS.
---
I use Twitch for all my other add-ons but I downloaded ElvUI directly 🤷‍♂️
---
I’ve had it Happen with all kinds of mobs. It’s only really noticeable with high lvl elite though cause you’re like wait.. he just 1 hit me for 2500 damage?
---
Damn, that’s actually a thing? I was in strat and I thought monks there just did that.
---
Oh for sure, I just hate Gorosh and Baron so I'm whining.
---
😬 well warriors are the slowest levelers.
---
Thank you.  
---
He's like the third person that ignores the Sprint/Prep/Vanish portion of the video and only watches the first 7 seconds and complains that people are wrong. Would be less depressing if it wasn't only 10 seconds into the video.  
---
He also implied that Stealth doesn't have a visual buff indicator without an addon so I'm doubly sure he's not paying attention here.
---
There are actually 2 folders, Tukui and Tukui\_Config. Don't just copy the main folder into addons folder. You need to copy the two subfolders separately.
---
[https://www.wikihow.com/Install-ElvUI](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-ElvUI)
---
Have you tried this
---
Because everyone who doesn't enjoy playing a video game int he most efficient, clinical way possible is a low IQ moron right? 
---
Like I said, you apparently lack the shred of empathy it would require to realise this is laughable.
---
Yeah it’s been happening since classic launch.
---
I wish Blizzard would allow use to Transmog new armor. It almost hurts to think of giving up this set as I level up.
---
Even out of combat, restealth and they’re still chasing you lol
---
Classic til you drop. Supporting BFA only encourages poor game design decisions.
---
To the warrior. Pretty much the same as some entitled Karen wanting everything you do for free just because you are doing better than her in life.
---
In your example the poor warrior jist wanted a Blackstone ring, because it was his sons birthday, for free and also you have to deliver it straight to him, and pay for his repair bill, because at 60 you have gold anyway.
---
We got legendaries first week of the last 3 expansions tho... in a 15 year old game, do you think people dont know what they are doing at this point?
---
Start tanking and have a priest get a pre bis shield or plate shoulders that you need and tell me how you feel. It’s a lot easier to say this as DPS when you’re always competing with others. Much different when you’re tank.
---
Nem vi que existia server BR... Estou jogando no Pagle desde o lançamento
---
I think if you just type the spell name and not the rank it will cast the highest rank, at least that's what I did on my priest and it seems to work fine. Though he isn't super high level and I don't heal frequently enough so I could just be wrong.
---
nah it was a ring run
---
&lt;3
---
3-4hours twice a week is standard. Iv been raiding over 3 weeks with no gear yet. Can't be in  a rush
---
Roll a DPS alt for farming.
---
These comments are hilarious. Fuck people whining about pvp and fuck OP for posting his character on r/classicwow OMEGALUL
---
So, as a troll with a bow. I only need to get to 6% for rags?
---
I wanna transfer to your server! I've made it to 33 as a feral tank. I look forward to new dungeons right up to the 10ish minute mark. That's when the insanity starts to get to me.
---
yeah, i would have done it if he was nicer
---
Question about the skill priority, once the boss is in execute range, does that mean we just spam execute from there on out? It has the highest priority and it uses up whatever rage we have, so how do we fit in BT and WW if all our rage goes to execute? Sorry if Im missing something.
---
Mad cuz pvp happened on a pvp server.

Didn't he run to the water to be safe?

Oh right on, ty! Question; what method did you go with and what spec did you roll?
---
I got a warlock to 60 and since I dinged I couldnt play it again, and I'm currently leveling a warrior, which is what I should have done from the start.
---
Wow classic sucks ass
---
The thing with the first vanish happened in vanilla, hell even all through bc iirc. The second vanish where he stealths but they stay aggroed seems bugged though.
---
But there were multiple betas...
---
Our definitions of circlejerking must vary a lot. 
---

---
-Someone offers advice
---
-Circlejerking?

Haha! That's amusing
---
Yea I would think the cloth user would be far better but knowing we have inner fire inner fire and a bubble on short cd it makes sense.
---
Had the EXACT same BRD thing happen to me!
---
&gt; I don't understand why people play on a PVP server if they're not fully prepared to deal with this.
---
It's easier to blame other people than realizing and admitting that you yourself made a mistake.
---
The idea that paladins could tank 5 mans and weren't very viable in raids is interesting considering it would help deal with the tank shortage problem (when you consider they'd never be looking for a raid slot as a tank, but as a dps). Sadly respec costs make this frustrating, but I imagine prot pally dps in a raid would be ungodly bad.
---
Can someone clarify when quests turn grey? I thought it was when you were 7 levels above a quest but I just turned 44 and a 37 quest was still green for me.
---
Mograine is still layered like 24/7
---
If you use the brain that god gave you, you may eventually be able to re-read my post and figure this one out for yourself
---
I got mine at 53, tanking for a spellcleave group. 
---
Ended up seing 3 of these chests before 50 runs or so.
---
No.  Wands are magic damage not physical.
---
It's not World of Lovecraft.
---
Keep going, when you get to 60 the tables will turn.
---
When you PuG groups now start adding people to your friends list that you think are great players.  Mainly focus on healers,  but exceptional DPS (CC's without being asked,  Focus Fires,  Doesnt stand in the lava + also pumps out nice DPS to boot)  make your list as well.
---
This expands 10 fold when your 60,  as everyone will want you to come tank their shit.
---
Now you form the groups,  You pull in one of the many competent healers you've befriended,  maybe some of the good DPS too,   and any pug's you pull in without knowing them can literally be carried by the rest of the group.  If they're loud and obnoxious just boot them,  you can 4man it because...  you know you have a competent group :) 
---
Hold out till your 60,  it gets much better.
---
A mage steps in. Its for gold. Like the post if a warrior, a rogue and hunter rolling for iron foe.
---
You let them buy your items. What's it matter to you if they're buying your stuff?
---
There's a big difference in a warrior using 2h and a warrior with 1h+shield spamming shield block. But, focusing only on mitigating damage in low level dungeons makes the dungeon go at a snails pace. The dungeon really speeds up when a warrior has a secondary focus on DPS. As long as the healer's mana isn't strained, it's not a big deal.
---
Sounds like my friend at the casino when we go. Walks in with $30 and immediately has $500 somehow (roulette always plays red 9 with a 5-10$ bet) 
---
Meanwhile I loose my $30 on 6 consecutive hands of blackjack 😂.
---
Happy for you mang, and happy riding!
---
Frost nova stand in his dead zone
---
Aka be aggressive
---
So why do you think your first guild raid, where you didnt even kill domo and by your own admission you died countless times, is an example of arms spec working in raid? 
---
What a useless argument.
---
I don't think so, but when I try to set up the "cvar" nothing happens. I probably over simplified by saying it didn't work. I got the UI running but it doesn't look as clean as some of the screenshots I've seen.  It definitely needs some tweaking.
---
To piggy back off this post is there a cap on the amount of INT and stamina you want/need? Like for example if I were to follow the pre bis to the T my int would be much lower than it is right now (215-220ish iirc)
---
Also staying within that dead zone after you get in. In addition you need to be careful as you get closer because they can Scatter Shot you into a Feign Death -&gt; Freezing Trap combo where they can reset back to maximum range.
---
A hunter dead zone pretty much the hunter cant auto shoot or use any ranged abilities nor is he in melee range
---
Haven’t run into it too often but it’s pretty scary when it does. Always just assumed it was a special attack some mobs had.
---
Classic version works fine for me but had to download it standalone, wasn’t listed on twitch
---
Over 700.  350 for the gnomes then 350 for the elves after realize you can't ride mechanostriders.
---
Way to completely miss the point. I'm sure your raid never fails or does anything other than perfection so it doesn't apply to you though!
---
Damn, thats BIS for rogues you know
---
(kromcrush gang will understand)
---
I use this for my mp5 as a hpriest
---
I've definitely seen the first Vanish case here happen many times. The second on is the real issue. When you do what you're supposed to (break melee range, break LOS, make sure you have no dots, higher level than the mobs, etc.) and run off, then have Vanish happen but do *literally nothing* is a major concern.  
---
Drinking health potions to have stealth then apply for some reason is a whole other can of worms.
---
That's literally just spellbatching. Anything that happens within a couple hundred miliseconds will be in the same "batch"
---
I didn't say it was a lot. That's just all I was willing to do for an item I didn't really need that much
---
Hah my wife is making a wow pumpkin (shhhh, she doesn’t know!)
---
If youre lucky you will get a black lotus, that alone makes you more than 50g

Paladin leveling will unfortunately never

be quick. Together with warriors we‘re the slowest levelers I‘d say.
---
thank you. exactly what i was looking for.
---
That's a good call.
---
I'm on Arcanite Reaper and the small server makes it tough to charge for runs like this. It's doable but people throw hissy fits.
---
If only they understood what grinding for gold is like as prot
---
You will eventually be 60 and at the same level as them.
---
Wow, does it, never thought about that haha. But only with one-handed weapons do they flip right?
---
I just watched this Hand of Rag shaman click every CD that wasn't within 1-5 keyboard range, oh how far we have come
---
63/skull.
---
I dont think so, but priests rarely use the HoT on raid formats.
---
Alliance questing is garbage too in most contested zones.
---
Copy not transfer.
---
More eloquent people have said that making a copy allows for people to play with TBC if they want without abandoning friends who only want classic.
---
You'd need to find a way to avoid duplicating, as someone could transfers characters one at a time.  A one time only, full account copy would be enough
---
A few things just in case
---
- using the ogre suit gives you a third tribute item. Mats arent too bad, so i just make an ogre suit after each run. If you use your pet to get past cromcrush, you get 2 items
---
- the enemies summoned by eye of kilrog can see through invis
---
- always have the ogre warlocks targeted when going past those packs to scatter immolation
---
- i restart the instance if i die. It throws the timing off getting to the courtyard.
---
- sell tarnished elven rings to stealthers if you can. Ive sold 2 of them for 30g. If i find one ill ask, then grab it if i dont get an immidiate response
---

&gt;level 1EnevorahScore hidden · 52 minutes agoI’ve also noticed they haven’t fixed the bug where mobs that you kite for long enough will sometimes hit you for multiple auto-attacks at once when they reach you.
---
If true, this would explain a lot.
---
Doing AOE farms on my mage sometimes I will inexplicably just drop when one or two mobs get a leeway hit on me, I always check the logs assuming I've been crit or crushed. But nope, just heaps of whiteswings.
---
I wish different mob types would agro each other sometimes
---
In 350 swings (10 -20 minutes), you would expect to see 1 sequence of 26 nonprocs on average, so this should be happening multiple times every night.
---
With regards to the consecutive crits, humans are very bad at guessing what sequences of events came from completely random processes; this sounds like an example of that.
---
If you still think there is an issue, for your data to be relevant you need to state your hypotheses and choose which hits to look at before you hit things. Its very easy to fool yourself into thinking patterns exist if you look for them in data which has already been collected.
---
Not tanks only, but yes tanks first no doubt
---
That is literally what OP said, that he needs more data
---
Tbh if it’s not in thrall’s chamber it’s not a real raid
---
If you want to play on a PvP server, you have to be prepared for this eventuality. A good thing to do is make an Auction House alt, and another alt of a class different to your main character (I main a priest and have a rogue about 20 levels behind him), so you have characters to switch to if you encounter someone like you are describing. 
---
You can log to them while you're dead, and continue to enjoy playing the game (yes it's not going to be progressing your main, but you only need to do it for 20min or more), knowing that the sad, sad camper will be sitting there, waiting, wasting their time for absolutely no gain, since you're off somewhere else enjoying Azeroth. Plus, changing up the playstyle with an alt can be refreshing. Eventually you can log back when you think the poor soul has probably given up, and you can do your own thing again.
---
Making people waste their time trying to camp a corpse that has logged out is one of my favourite ways to deal with a high level camper.
---
Many people head to BRD to start collecting their BiS gear- if you start now you'll be around 60 before you collect it all
---
Well I think I saw a couple people bring up rage as the reason , but not really explain well why.  Rage as a mechanic works basically the opposite of Mana, you do your job better the faster you go, the less you rest and the more you slow down the easier it is for you to be pulled off of. 
---
It's not usually a bad thing for them to keep pulling without you being at full Mana, unless the pull off a specifically dangerous/big one and then they should wait. Some of them are also very used to healers that are probably better geared/use more consumables than you (not a dig, but usually well geared healers never oom unless things are falling apart).
---
That said, I've healed, tanked, and dps'd at varying levels of progression from casual to hardcore guilds in every expansion minus BFA and sometimes people just tunnel vision on their job and forget that teamwork is the only thing that matters in the end with a dungeon. Any gear group can clear any dungeon, no problem in classic. And the best advice I can give you is to try to get a pocket tank stick with him/her forever. That's what I do.
---
I know everyone's already told you the Barrens, but there's an important detail to know. Deviate pools can show up in any of the oasis, but the Forgotten Pools is the best one to fish from. Why? Because the Forgotten Pools has a 40% rate of Deviates when fishing in open water. The others are around 20%. I don't know the rate for fishing inside WC.
---
First aid is definitely always worth it for classes that can't heal themselves. A lot of enemies drop cloth, so much cloth that you'll end up with stacks and stacks of the stuff. Whatever cloth you don't need can be sold to a vendor as a bandage, as they sell for more that way. And cloth isn't too lucrative of an Auction House item until Runecloth.
---
As a Warlock, being able to lifetap and then bandage yourself in dungeons is pretty useful if you run out of mana mid-fight. The healer won't always be able to spare the mana to top you up.
---
For many classes, Bandages/health pots are the only way to restore your life while in combat. You can't eat or drink while in combat. Cooking is important mostly because of the food items that give a 'well fed' buff when eaten.
---
First aid is a free profession to level as long as you keep making bandages and going to trainers. When I'm on a new character I will usually just let my cloth stack up, then queue up bandage creation while I'm afk.
---
People dont even know what toxicity is until they played Rust. I know im gatekeeping, but holy shit that community is absolutely sickening. Absolutely hilarious tho.
---
"There's too much RNG in BFA" People say as they farm the same dungeon 1k+ times for a drop :P
---
Yep, I recently realised I haven't logged into retail once since Classic came out.
---
i was probably high on peyote when i said that
---
Holy balls! Thanks man, works!
---
My favorite part was levelling and the friends along the way. Ive played way less at 60 now that i basically only log on to raid.
---
With the mass of number crunchers this is such a true statement. It's sad that there is some pieces of gear from the lat 40's and early 50's that are better than some of the "dungeon" tier of gear.
---
It is spellbatching. Spellbatching makes it so that everything that happens in a couple hundred miliseconds will be in the same "batch" and take place at more or less the same time. The problem with vanish could also very well be a spellbatching issue as well. I've found that vanish won't really failed if you create some distance between you and the mobs before using it. So far it hasn't failed me after I started doing that.

I've never heard it called "hate" instead of "aggro" until a couple days ago. Where does that come from?
---
Small
---
As a healer, if I'm making the group then in brining a mage. It makes drinking so much easier as I can just drink and cancel all the time, without worrying about running out. 
---
Which also makes for alot faster run as the tank won't have to wait for me to drink, I'll just drink for 5sec whenever I can.
---
Not to mention all the aoe, slow and cc they have, making big or bad pulls much easier to handle
---
Pre raid BiS is overrated. If it's not purple it's not worth my time.

Can you describe how that run was like? How did he pass the loot to you? Did you have to follow him to get close to princess? And if yes, how did you pass the mob while level &lt;60
---
Weirdest thing I've played through was that Pally damage bug during Dragon Soul in Cata.
---
I'm sure other people will remember, Pallies doing a gazillion damage for a few days after a hotfix.
---
Hit chance isn’t worth much until 60, meleeing lvl 63 bosses. Which means you’re ret in raids which is a bad idea. 
---
For leveling you shouldn’t be fighting orange mobs. If you’re a human using maces/swords it’s even more a waste of talent points.
---

What a shithouse bug.

How long has it been known about?

Of course you ganked him you’re horde. Only horde care about gambling players that aren’t interested in fighting back because they are doing something

That's interesting. I'm assuming duels fall under world pvp rules?

10 seconds into the video in this post he does that and it fails.

My server is mined dry, there's no money to be had in either herbing or mining as a primary activity. At best it's a bit of pocket money while doing other things.

Why would anyone refuse fish...
---
Yeah it’s soloable at 56 with just like a stam buff and motw for safety.  You can’t unlock the shadow lock without being seen but you just sap blind the two guys near it unlock and vanish.  Plugger is easy just bring a healthstone and major healing pots until you master him.
---
I think this is a fundamental flaw with whatever RNG they use. I've noticed it with fishing, crafting, fighting. Anything remotely RNG based has this. 
---
For leveling professions I'll routinely go 6-10 on a green without getting a skill up then get 4-5 skill ups in a row. With fishing I’ll go a very long time without getting the fish I’m looking for then get a bunch in a row. For fights I’ll have a few mobs a couple levels below me almost kill me or actually kill me then absolutely demolish several in a row. 
---
But you're right. What I say is just anecdotal and we need data. Humans are pattern recognition machines and will very often see patterns where there are none. I'll start making an effort to actually collect all my logs from now on.
---
Edit: And I am a software dev so could moderately easily write a log parser to get at the information you want given we can probably just export logs to a text file. Just need to know what information you’re looking for. Distribution of non-crit and crit streaks? Time between crits? Actual crit chance? I’m not a math person so don’t know what would be most useful.
---
Well there's a weapon that drops that BiS for 60 ferals, and it has charges. So you have to farm new ones when you run out of charges.

Or for most people to realise how bad retail actually is

Pallies have awesome near unbeatable single target healing, Fast flash of light spam with mana return on crits,judge seal of light on boss for quick raid small heals for everyone meleeing the boss, priests Aoe is tops keeping the whole raid up,

Wow, a whole loading screen.

It’s not a massive difference, ally also has to go from Darkshire down which adds some riding time. Ally may have a slight advantage, but it’s not some giant massive edge.

I’ve been following this guide since I got to 50’s, and I still really don’t understand. I’ve had the same question of OP for a while and have just been collecting all I can get.

In this kind of scenario, I can just bid the min amount that is higher than the 2nd highest dkp person right? Wouldn’t make sense to bid higher than what’s required to win.

Did you code it?

I don't tank cuz I play priest and mage
---
I'm not certain my tips are good, but they might at least be food for thought. I think you want to use Shield and Psychic Scream when you're low health, so that your heal spell doesn't get knocked back. Maybe even save them until that situation. So I think the object is to wait as long as possible but not too long. So, you could try postponing your first shield, if you want, especially since your first cast will then be devouring plague, which will be more powerful if you start to take damage earlier. Depending on how your fights go, maybe also do Pain before Plague to get more heal out of Plague. I think Holy Fire is probably worthwhile, ie. better than wanding, in a PVP situation, even without talents, if it isn't getting knocked back. Mind Flay would be better if they're trying to get to you, so I suppose the place for holy fire is if you are able to land it when they're feared. So I think wand if they are on you and you don't feel the need to fear/shield yet, and cast stuff if they won't knock it back. I think at 31 it might be best not to forget about your holy spells. Also you didn't mention touch of weakness/blackout, that is if you have blackout. I think you don't want to waste fear because of diminishing returns, you want to delay using it a bit, as much as is safe. Smite if holy fire DoT is up, and mind blast is on cooldown, and you don't need the slow from mind flay, and it wouldn't be knocked back. Maybe mind blast sooner, (lose some efficiency but gain some burst.) When I say to wait as long as possible to fear or shield, in practice that won't be very long at all, if they have any dangerous CC.
---
it seems like a networking problem
---
It's actually worse than Unyielding Maul until p3 when 15 agi releases, since you can put a counterweight and use elemental sharpening stones on the maul.
---
Too many metasexuals who think that the fact that they read a spreadsheet built by someone else and watched a youtube video makes them an expert on the game, but have no understanding at all about how threat and aggro work. My policy is that if they want aggro so bad, I'll let them have it. I just try to keep the healer alive and don't worry too much if the DPS are eating hits, it's a self solving problem.
---
Isn't BfA the first expansion with no PvP servers?
---
I also noticed i suddenly had a insanely long time in my raid without crusader procs, dual wield with crusader on both weapons, then when i re equipped my weapon i suddenly started getting procs again. Classic is full of bugs still and blizzard doesnt care. They alredy got their sub money and know that the ppl still playing likely wont quit over this bug anyway
---
You fish the same spot rather than looking for nodes? Is that as fruitful? Love the Pic BTW.
---
Yes. It’s rough, but they are so fun.
---
Cool. The OG version of the death knight now. Still blows my mind to see a few DKs drop relevant raid bosses, even if really geared.
---
Wait, you can eat and drink at the same time?  I suppose you can learn something 47 levels later....
---
This has happened to me on a wyvern before.
---
I've never seen it say 75-25 the worst one I saw was 63 - 37. Do you have the data for that claim?
---
Which is only one time per minute. The ability to hit 3% more with white swings, but also yellow abilities is significantly better.
---
I'm genuinely interested in your math. How did you arrive at this?
---
It's really not bad, especially if you go alchemy and herbalism. On my warrior alt I do that and run around with tons of buffs and 3 shot mobs with pretty decent regen.
---
I main a lock in a guild farming MC and this is precisely what I do. Bank the extra few shards for the next raid and boom, I've got 50 ready to go.

(Wrong person)
---
This is an item that will last 2 full raid tiers and then you need to actually get the drop in AQ. For some reason I feel like the 4-5 min per run is worth it.

**&lt;SFK&gt; Horde - Herod - PvP** is currently recruiting all roles for leveling and raiding, with a plan to begin raiding in late 2019. We're a group of friends who are looking to stick together while raiding. We're also looking for class leaders for a variety of roles - right now only Shaman, Warrior, and potentially Mage are covered. SFK has an experienced raid leader planning to raid Tuesday/Wednesday at 8 PM EST and Sunday afternoon/evening and we're looking to divvy up loot with a DKP system.
---
We're welcoming all players whether you're a vanilla WoW veteran or a newcomer to vanilla raiding. We'd prefer players who are closing in on 60 so we can begin raiding in around a month, but if you're lower level and you plan to stick with your character, there's a spot for you in the guild. We only require two things of our guild members: be nice to your fellow guildies and kill all gnomes on sight. A guild Discord is also on the way.
---
Private message me here on Reddit or whisper Grimka or DncingPnguin in-game for an invite or with any questions you might have.
---
Oh man. Ok. So as a Warlock, you use cloth gear. It's been a long ass time since I've played a Warlock so I don't remember their specific itemization. Cloth gear with Stamina/Intellect/Spirit would be my guess. 
---
Green gear is the best you can hope for at your level. You won't see much for greenies until around 15 when they become more common from bad guys. You can always buy some from the AH but that can be expensive as you level. Learning what instance/dungeons are and how to have fun in them is what I recommend.
---
I haven't failed once doing it that way though.
---
I'm not really sure... I wasn't paying too much attention to it. I think that someone told me level 49 quests are still green at 60. I'm trying to avoid doing 49 quests and above so I can do them after I reach 60 and get that sweet extra gold.
---
Good to know. 
---
Should I not sell linen cloth away?
---
How can I acquire new armor? I'm levell 11 and I have Fire Wand, nice spells but shit armor cant find anywhere any better :( I can't use the stuff enemies drop. Think that's why i'm having difficult time atm
---
The cheap shot thing is spellbatching mate, it really should get removed because it's utter fucking shit. 
---
The vanish bug is sometimes due to spellbatching, as in the melee attacks of the enemy lands in the same batch as your vanish and just cancels it out. As for what you are showing I'm not sure whats going on there, I'm a rogue my self and never gotten this unlucky.
---
Rogue feels SO slick when you play and so great to watch in PvP.

Oh how can I bott looks fun

*Mr. Sulu, engage damage control! Act like we didn't say something dumb.*
---
I think I recognize the guy, and if I'm right, it's a guy on my realm who has been farming it pretty much constantly from 54 to 59, so while I'm not sure it's 600, it could be quite high.
---
Except go tank a strat live and go dps one. Guess which one is wayyyyyy more involved/stressful/whatever. It’s tanking. I’ll go dps Jed/Rend all day, but I can only tank a few before I need a break.
---
yo
---
&gt;You wont be using MCP every pull too
---
Why not?
---
Simply (and briefly) put, in endgame healing there are lots of damage going around and being able to cast on another target without having to first select then press a button can make the difference, especially in a raid.
---
Moving around, in pve, is something you can learn to do blind. It's learning a pattern most of the time.
---
Damage can have sudden spikes and random targets or just a dps aggroing unexpectedly.
---
Have fun on your new server!!
---
Edit: you could try consulting a GM don’t think they will do much but you never know.
---
Its the best blue 2h weapon. Unless you get lucky in MC there is nothing better.
---
It's not a big deal, I'd just keep 2 sets. Tank and heals.
---
Being able to tank BRD and upwards will get you your tank set, and you'll end up collecting healing gear along the way.
---
Once your healing set is halfway you can do either, which means you can pretty much find a group for any instance you want in under 5m.
---
Later on, you just ask healers if they are ok with you /rolling for a piece, and most are because tanks generally don't do scholo/strat that much
---
Finally some sense in this thread.
---
I've actually never seen anyone complain in an instance.  Had people just drop the group and hearth, but never any outright bitching in chat.
---
Only instants, and only once, because the action of casting the spell breaks the mind control. So for instance you can Renew, or PW:F an enemy player. But why would you want to, lol.
---
And this is something you believe is correct? You feel like blizzard designed the game to act this way and this is intentional? This spot was put into place so that you can freely attack players without worrying about the intended behavior of the guards? The guards should act this way?
---
Or do you MAYBE think blizzard made an oops? 
---
In the game =\= intentional. Ask the guys who abused layering to get ahead and the guilds who abused game mechanics during certain boss fights to clear certain hardcore raids.
---
Blizz actually added that mechanic to the "Not a bug" list earlier this evening.
---
"Some monsters have a “Thrash” mechanic and can proc multiple attacks against players in a very short duration.
---
Note: Most of these monsters can also “store” these procs and unleash them all several seconds later. An example of this is the Princess Theradras encounter in Maraudon. The Princess will store her attacks if kited and can land several attacks instantly when she catches up to her target. This behavior is consistent with the reference client"
---
While it did happen back in vanilla, i had no idea it was actually an intended feature.
---
Get ready to tank nearly every dungeon then.
---
Wow, that's a pretty good Hunter weapon
---
I get that. How do I get cloth gear, even the most basic shit available? 
---
Stamina / intellect / spirit doesn't ring a bell at this point ;/
---
I see. Do you happen to know any good guide for reading about instance/dungeons? Because I don't know anything about them. And they are group only, right?
---
Also, the patch were on added things like Spellpower to most items
---
my man
---
Vanish didn't work for the entirety of vanilla. I would submit tickets every few days crying about how mobs would attack me through it and break stealth. 
---
It may not be busted in the same exact way, but vanish being busted is Vanilla-like.
---
It was more common in TBC.  You could get a rogue up to 100% avoidance, which trivialized fights like Gruul.

He's  probably the warrior that lost hand of rag roll XD

DAoC free shard was popular earlier this year and I played it a lot. At one point I thought it would be fun to make my way to those leveling in the frontiers and slay noobs. I ended up one shotting a few noobs and felt like a total asshole. I just couldn’t do it. I was wasting their time and mine for nothing. 
---
For someone to corpse camp and grief someone without reason, they legit gotta have a screw loose upstairs. Probably pulled wings off flies for fun.
---
This is my goal.
---
Guild goal is, by the end of classic to have me specced out in naxx gear and see if I can tank MC. 
---
We have theorycrafted it super hard, and believe with naxx gear I can do it! (Clearly, that isn't an accomplishment for any other class, but just to say a shaman tanked rag, lol)
---
Lvl 54 haven't had vanish bug happen yet
---
Hmm that’s really weird. Would’ve been nice if they’d mentioned this weeks ago lol.
---
I meant they are nature damage immune more than anything. So druids cannot farm lashers with hurricane. On private servers, they weren't. Can't remember about back in vanilla days but that's what I mean by "nerfed". The gold/hr is still pretty decent if you can kill them!
---
&gt; At 300 weapon skill you won’t miss level 60 mobs.

lol no.

I am so goddamn excited to play BC content when it's like, populated and relevant you have no idea

I can confirm, I am much better at running away now
---
&gt; Our heals are slow so we get beat to the heal all the time by pally heal. I’ve seen lots of 0 of 1200 land a lot because they beat my 2.5 sec cast with there 1.5.

You know priests have a 1.5s flash heal too, right? For almost 2.5x as much healing as a paladin's?

Playing a feral tank is like playing a Hunter -- except you're the pet.

It's worth noting that a lot more mobs have Thrash than you may think. So a lot of mobs can double/triple hit you and it being legit. But indeed, I have been hit a few times by mobs that do not have multi-hit type abilities listed on any of the database websites. Earlier today I set up my combat log to log more stuff, and hopefully see if it makes any mention of a procc on them. I'm still really not sure which one it is.
---
But you won't be getting one every hour, that's why you won't average more than 50..
---
It's a great way to burn out or to start hating an instance.
---
You can always come back for it, a little crit really isn't that big of a deal if you can do a couple runs and get half a dozen slots that will increase your damage more
---
They are all in BRD trying to get their SGC and HOJ?
---
Also, you roll either way. Always bugged me that one of the icons was dice. What does that even mean.
---
Rogue is so much fun tho
---
In Desolace, there's a strip of elevated land along the Sartheris Strand; the entrance is to the north of the road that goes out to the coast. The far end of it is where the roaming Giant, the Kodo packs (and probably Hyena packs) all spawn from, so be watchful when you're around there.
---
But its pretty hidden and not on the way to anywhere else, so nobody goes there. I was farming there and in that area around level 37ish.
---
I love exploring the World of Warcraft...and had never even known this area existed before!
---
I always sheep the hunter and kill the pet first just so he remembers not to ever attack a mage again and then deadzone him hard to finish him off
---
Yes. Because warriors want to dps
---
As a 60 warlock who raids and partakes in end game stuff, I've never felt the need to carry this many SS? All my raid has their hearth set to Kargath and for the few who fuck up and forget, well I just summon those. Maybe I'm missing something? I guess if I was so soulfire on CD then maybe I would need more shards.
---
its funny to see people mad about the exact same things that made blizzard put in LFG, change mana, remove threat and change dungeon length
---
Probably because so many say that then immediately pull aggro and die after lifetapping.

may your friendship never end....waiting for screens from 2030....
