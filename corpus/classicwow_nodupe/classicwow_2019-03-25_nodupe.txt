Why do people want to play mage? They legit just press Frostbolt.....let him play what he wants to play
---
---
---
They don't make as much sense in the time period WoW takes place though. After what happened to the orcs in Azeroth and how they basically their will to fight when the demonic bloodlust ended, Thrall brought their pride back with a return to their shamanic roots. I'd think orc warlocks would be very strongly persecuted by the orcs from that point forward.
---
&gt; Whats surprising is the paladins
---

---
*Esfans*
---
But Alliance locks don't have to deal with paladins on organized PvP...
---
The longer you wait the worse the ret becomes.
---
So if you gonna ret, do it early.
---
My guild brings rets for buffs because we have enough non-pally healers. If you’re allowed to raid with you’re mdps prebis blues, you can roll/wager on mdps gear. There’s also a lot of random plate and weapons that are usable for ret but warriors won’t really want them. See fallen crusader gear in BWL, or finkle’s lava dredger if you want a meme example. With the right guild you actually won’t have the worst time gearing up.
---
I have no beginning. I have no end. I am infinite.  My kind transcends your very understanding. I am a nation. Independent, free of all weakness. You cannot even grasp the nature of my existence.

Playing private servers here is the pros and cons to war
---
1. Have to human if taken serious with elitist
---
2. Over populated - so many warriors, so many damn warriors.
---
3. Slow leveling - alot of people will quit because of this yet they will still be the highest played class endgame
---
1. Top tier dps
---
2.  Easy to gear
---
Because those rets will want gear, the gear that would be better used on a warrior. 
---
The reason why you can clear raids with less than 40 people is because people are trying to play optimally. 
---
You either bring full 40 man group to clear the raid quickly, or bring less than 40 to have less competition for loot. 
---
Nobody wants to carry meme specs.
---
Ret and prot are not trash.  They are both good for solo play.  Ret is great in PvP.  Prot can do some AoE pulls that even a mage can't handle.  They just won't outshine other tanks or DPS in a raid environment.
---
500 dps in bwl BiS with full nightfall uptime LUL
---
[removed]
---
Lol
---
Yes.  I never completed my tier 0.5 set because a mage needed my dreadmist helm the only time I ever saw it drop.  If you need another classes tier 0 you’re needing a quest item for a quest you can’t get.
---
I think many people are willing to accept it because in this case, they are doing exactly what they told us they would be doing -- basing the game in 1.12 and holding that original version almost sacrosanct, for better or for worse.
---
Would it be fun to have a different version?  Sure.  But it's not a fight worth having IMO, especially when the reasoning of basing the game in 1.12 and not a Franken-Patch is actually kind of solid.
---
That being said, you won’t be able to play when you’re sick from food borne illness. 
---
The temptation to roll female dwarf warrior is almost unbearable.
---
The guy had lifesteal on his BiS - i wouldn't look much into this. 
---
What kind of optimal builds are you looking at?
---
My guess is that you have been looking at pve builds, stuns don't work on almost every single raid mob.
---
Having 1.12 AV would not interfere with a frankenpatch. It’s such an easy, if not the quickest solution for the classic WoW team to give the community the next “we love blizzard - they listen to us” moment. 
---
I don’t see any disadvantages with having Pre-Nerf AV in the game. 
---
It would only compliment the longevity of the game &amp; keep the PvP scene even more engaged then a quick rush AV, nobody will enjoy after doing it the 50th time. 
---
The results of these surveys will always be skewed, since the population you are asking consists of dedicated vanilla WoW fans. Rogues, mages, and warriors tend to be the most played, with hunters following them. Paladins and druids definitely won't make up that much come launch. You just have a bunch of memers on here that say they are going Ret PVP, but will give up by level 30.
---
Because mage can actually do a lot damage while spamming one button.
---
He can play whatever he wants, I'm just curious what is it about ret that he finds so appealing, especially since he knows that ret isn't all that great.
---
Shimmering Flats.
---
My guess is many of the people responding to the poll played on private servers, which were almost entirely PvP. I think you'll be right about the balance though, as casuals in particular will go heavily towards PvE servers.
---
Av is very much near the bottom of why I like vanilla. And I actually prefer 1.12Av
---
Stuns are great.  Unreliable stuns and RNG are not.  It's hard to base a strategy (and therefore a talent build) off of something that happens 15-20% of the time.
---
Well when the other team is MC gear and below it's decent. If I remember correctly we just got out of an AQ40 raid and threw together a final WSG game as a farewell since a couple of our hunters were quitting.
---
The only thing good about hunter 2.5 is the 5p bonus that decreases rapid fire by 2 mins so it's mostly PvE.  The + dmg and healing on the set is completely useless.
---
I don't really care about AV at all, but I don't think they even have the old version. Like they said they didn't keep backups of stuff pre 1.12 and sometimes like how old AV was is kinda hard to just guesstimate 
---
I only played during TBC but didnt raid til WOTLK besides karazhan
---
I'm scared of vanilla with how hard I heard it is. I might end up not even raiding.
---
Hmm.. alright .. I guess
---
Go read the thread when they posted, people were plenty outraged. We don't need a daily post about it like we get about sharding, server sizes, etc 
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, I get it.  I'm just saying that on some level, it's hard to fault them for trying to be internally consistent.
---
Plus a big part of the problem with AV is the players moreso than it being this version or that version.  The BG could still be fun if people were in it for more than the rep grind and subsequent rewards.
---
Have they confirmed they will allow paid server transfers?
---
You drew Ironforge wrong.
---
Every build I saw ignores the passive stun chances!
---
I see, makes sense. Thanks mate
---
MEAL PREP GANG.
---
I'm actually glad that they're going with 1.12 AV.
---
I'm sorry, but not everyone enjoys being stuck in the same BG for hours.
---
Unfortunately I cannot, never really played either of those classes.  I'm sure there are some great guides out there though!
---
I would personally just heal with a hybrid build for holy/ret so you can still heal raids. Just get some pally gear and maybe a 2h from raiding as a healer and you'll be good to go for at least a good entry level.
---
It takes way, way more time. I agree though. Getting rank 14 is basically 3 months of 12-15 hours a day. You need a pre-made group pretty much. You can raid two nights a week instead and get your epics that way.
---
I played ret in vanilla and you gotta remember this isn’t retail. There’s a lot more people that will play classic and care about lore, character fantasy, character appearance. Paladins have a amazing backstory and look fantastic in gear, also being the executioner of justice is a fun as hell role playing fantasy. Not everyone just looks at “what does more damage, I’ll pick that class”
---
Whatever server the big streamers aren't on. Although it's not them i'm avoiding it's their viewers that will follow. If I get stuck on a dead server because of it i'll just transfer later on.
---
Cause while PvP is a fun bit of content it really is the backseat of wow Content.  Where raiding and dungeons are at the forefront.  Honestly people going on and on about it Is funny. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1.12 AV is just fine IMO

Hi Nineteen, this is Wesly (Orc Hunter) from Shattered Hand. Love seeing those old names in your ss, hoping DnT announces which Classic server you guys are playing on so I can roll against you again.     
---
I was in &lt;Revered&gt; when WSG released in the summer of '05 and those guild vs. guild battles against DnT, Drama, and even Skyfang are some of my favorite experiences gaming. Is Lotek playing Classic?
---
The armor cool down will give you more leeway to generate threat
---
It means they flared up in anger and clicked the button after seeing you BM (bad manner) them. Sometimes people wait and don't release until you /bow or /spit and that determines the next 2 hours of your life in STV lol.
---
If I had to guess I would say in April if it is coming in July. Totally guessing.
---
If trolls were real, I'd get me a QT3.14 troll gf ifuknowwhatimsayingmydudelol.
---
Unpopular opinion. 
---
Change troll model to Zandalari so races on horde are more spread out 
---
Until it happens to you, then you'll understand.
---
I want the fastest AV possible.
---
What if the next “we love blizzard they listen to us” proposition would be cross realm bgs? Or free respecs? Or class redesigns? You see how is easy it is for that to spiral out of control? It’s important to remain consistent to avoid these issues 
---
Basically. If your guild has enough non-pala healers, they might bring a ret for buffs. Having to skip out on salvation or might on 40 people is kinda worse for your raid than one DPS underperforming.
---
If your guild cuts that one extra priest though, and you have no buff utility, you’re healing.
---
Seems like an overblown issue unless you are elderly, young, or pregnant.
---
This is a bad idea and honestly not relevant. Sorry, I'm removing this post.

**Sulfuron Harbinger vs Princess Huhuran**
---
Sulfuron himself keeps aggro on Huhuran while his four adds heal him. Huhuran tries to get them with various poisonous attacks, but the adds have an immunity to poison! The moth gets burned, Sulfuron wins.
---
**Grand Widow Faerlina vs Kel'Thuzad**
---
Faerlina and her lackeys easily deal with waves of undead minions. When Kel'Thuzad himself enters the battlefield... Frost Blast, baby! The spider freezes, Kel'Thuzad wins.
---
**Gluth vs Ebonroc**
---
Ebonroc keeps burning Gluth's favourite zombie treats. Gluth is a good boy, but enough is enough! Ebonroc eats a Decimate, Gluth eats Ebonroc.
---
**Gothik the Harvester vs Mor'ladim**
---
Gothik the Farmboy gets cut down by former professional soldier Mor'ladim, duh.

TBC... Best Vanilla 2.0 expansion. 
---
Oh god, I remenber when I first got myhands on this box. It was my first travel to United States and I had never heard of WoW or Burning Crusade. (Incredibly I was a loyal fan of Warcraft 3 for years!)
---
yes, you can tank 5mans as Arms
---
you can even offtank as like 4th or 5th tank in raids as Arms
---
48 hour AV was stupid 
---
Boomie is nowhere near 90% of a mage. Closer to 50%. 
---
Ya I remember the 8/8 is better for pve 
---
Exactly what I thought lol 
---
What you waiting for, marry this woman
---
If you don't enjoy it you can just not queue up for it though.
---
Go play BFA then.
---
Then why didn’t you upvote my priest boner pic?
---
Nah.  I like classic.
---
This makes me want to hold off on my human characters, and roll a Night Elf Hunter right out of the gate.
---
I get that, but do you know if that's why OP wants to play ret?
---
Because depending on the reason why he wants to play it, there might be better alternatives.
---
Not everyone who wants to play meme specs cares about lore and RP.
---
It’s supposed to. It’s a dungeon set. It still compares well to all non-raid gear for PvP.
---
Pretty much this, what’s not to love about the fantasy of laying down the pain with a giant two hander then having some of the best defensives and heals in the game?
---
Those guides are great, shout out to Defcamp and Melderon. 
---
Ah yes, the solution to every problem, if you don't like something then leave...
---
Isn’t one of the main knocks on warrior that they’re very gear dependent and it isn’t that easy? Correct me if I’m wrong
---
Haha
---
Found the Reaper. 
---
I've seen a similar spec that picks up last stand for pvp 
---
Could consider doing a mage or warlock. Give you the ability to Port around or summon group members to finish out a dungeon group. 
---
Comments like this keep my hopes up, hope there are more guilds like your own come classic
---
Yeah they suck as DPS but you could totally do it. My recommendation would be play as a healer for a while then just stay in the same guild to build relationships with them and make it clear that one day you want to raid as DPS.
---
Once you get a piece here or there once the warriors get geared you can start rotating in. Once everyone gets geared they will want to play alts and off specs. 
---
I found a screenshot of my ret pally and guild after we downed rag for the first time, I raided as ret too. If I knew how to post it I was gonna show you for more hope :)
---
And my axe!
---
The result may be heavily influenced by blizzard. I'd imagine blizzard would want it to stay as one so their game shows higher on viewing charts
---
On retail our server was 70%+ alliance.
---
I’m raging internally because that’s what adults do. Stuff it down, deep down, its shrill and muffled cry will be buried by the avalanche of time

It's not about having a racial yourself, it's about preventing your ennemies in pvp from having it.   
---
Or, you know, just add together the classes ?  
---
It's been a while since I last played WoW at all.
---
I'm assuming that recipes are 1 time consumables that let me learn it's respective recipe.
---
If I learn a recipe from one of these, drop that profession and later want to get back at it, would I have to obtain another copy of said recipe or would the recipe(s) carry over? 
---
2.5 is actually 5/5
---
Put a ring on it, sir.
---
One thing to consider that might be fun is feral druid. With thorns, retribution aura and swipe in bear form mobs will stick to you like glue. You will keep aggro on huge pulls with ease. The problem is your allies wont have much Aoe unless specced for it
---
Dwarves are literally human beings though?
---
Didn't end up buying.  I'm trying to break my habit of collecting stuff I'll never use 
---
I am going to say most of them won't make level 60
---
I’ll be honest, I haven’t raided on a mage, but I have seen them in action plenty and have some ideas.
---
People talk about frostbolt spam, but single-target boss DPS is just one slice of the pie. Boss fights are over pretty fast. You do get to spend a lot of time crushing meters by AoEing packs. You have an important role with throwing out and maintaining CC. Sometimes you even pull with this. Generally, ranged DPS get to be more safe, consistent, and inconspicuous during boss fights; and yes, I suppose they have a better view, too. Melee is usually a clusterfuck.
---
I mean, it's not like you don't have 2 other bgs to play that end relatively quickly.
---
There was a toggle for *some* settings in the Demo. Basically 'new' water and clutter density.
---
The concern with newer models, etc -- is that it will almost certainly provide an advantage to have them on. If new models mean more visible AoE effects or buffs/blessings -- PvPers will feel obligated to turn them on to get that extra edge. That's the primary concern.
---
I'd be ok with a setting to have new shiny things on in the world only. And raids/pvp being locked to a standardized look. But I'm not sure how tenable that would be for Bliz.
---
Pvp ones definitely do not 
---
I know it is supposed to be a joke weapon but... 6.8 DPS? Fuck, Blizz - even though it was the dawn of memes; you couldn't even meme with that weapon. 
---
Yep, makes it look like there is more demand for pvp server.
---
apparently a lot of ret paladins do that, the proc works with seal of command or some shit like that lul
---
HotW. The one spec to rule them all.
---
To answer your question: [yes](https://youtu.be/BirMIEA1oVI).
---
So do you have innervate 
---
I just wish someone would make a quest guide  focusing on the STORY behind the quests. I know there are a few, like Nixxiom has some, but not many.
---
Yeah ALL pre nerf AVs were 48+h. It is known
---
Well in Vanilla the low level zones are basically relevant because you often need to travel through them to get to where you need to be.
---
Instead of having the expansion almost entirely set in Outlands they should have kept you coming back to Azeroth through making max level areas there. Deadwind Pass, Blasted Lands, Hyjal, Quel'Danas f.ex. 
---
You could use that same argument for both versions of AV...
---
Obligated is too strong of a word here, as long as the same buffs are visible and invisible between the two settings you should be able to tell them apart with enough experience, no?
---
Nah, I still am very disappointed with their decision, and so are many many others, even most probably on this sub. Just gotta wait and see if they hear us out
---
Nah. Most guilds will get BWL on farm eventually. However, most probably won’t be able to one-night it until ZG.
---
He is talking about private servers not retail 
---
&gt;but do you guys really just accept 1.12 AV
---
I accept 1.12 AV because we're playing 1.12 base game and AV is like 0.03% of the game.
---
1,5% tank Shaman lel
---
I agree I would very much want a Graphics toggle/slider. I want the Gameplay/Mechanics, but I don't agree with those that say the "Graphics were better" or "No-Changes" in this regard.  
---
Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the Classic graphics but they're going to be a huge eyesore by the standards of today, and anyone saying they're better I'd say they're certainly in the minority.  
---
I want Classic gameplay/mechanics, but with updated Graphics.
---
Do you find yourself ever agreeing that the orc racial is strong, well it's RNG? I have had impact proc 4 times in a single duel sometimes back to back. A rogue hitting you with frostbite on can be rolling several dice to see which comes up with 15% frostbite. Another thing to consider is that some of these talents aren't for winning a shortterm duel but for getting an edge in long grinds of pvp. In those long grinds you are constantly doing checks to see if one of these bonuses will proc. Those talents are great for causing a paladin to blow a cd early or forcing a mage to iceblock when conc stunned. They proc often enough.
---
Nobody who plays classic pvp which revolved around RNG crits would ever shun even moar RNG.
---
Others have said this.
---
But I think alliance is clearly the better raiding faction for *most* guilds. Any guild below a hardcore level will, I think, get more benefit from blessings and fear ward than they will from totems and shit.
---
Ya I really hope they announce it more than a week in advance. I'm in a similar boat as I'll be coordinating a small grp of friends and family to roll on the same server. I'm hoping we get a list and that we have enough time to figure out which servers to avoid. Our shortlist of servers to avoid includes any server with a prominent streamer or an uber hardcore guild aiming for world first kills
---
No you don't use them constantly, but they help a lot when you pull too many mobs or get ganked. You need to put 5 points into the first tier of demonology talents to get imp voidwalker.
---
If you're on an rp server with a name like that chances are it'll be force changed. If it's a pvp serger chances are you're gonna be fine. 
---
Seems like PvE was prioritized over PvP by the respondents across the board.
---
I played paladin in vanilla. I am not going back. 
---
Life steal and fiery are higher dps than crusader. Crusader proc you get 100 strength for 2 auto attacks, if there is no movement. Fiery/lifesteal can proc off attack, seal hit, judgement, and can also proc on hit trinkets which ret use heavily 
---
The primary function would still be to skip anything you dont want to deal with.
---
Just think of all the chokepoints in Vanilla and the PvP that happens there. Blackrock mountain especially. When your only option is to go on foot, you either group up or die trying.
---
Nah Imp drain life is a really inefficient talent, there are much better ways to spend your ponts in the affliction tree. Drain life in general is not mana efficient until level 40+ anyway. It becomes good when you have shadow mastery.
---
He’s using it in a different way to it’s usual WoW connotation. He’s referring to metagaming within an RP game, which is using knowledge your character wouldn’t know for an unfair gameplay advantage(?). It’s frowned upon in those circles. 
---
I don’t think this is something most people give a shit about on RPPVP servers, so it’s kind of a closed question regardless.
---
But the hostility he describes exists now in retail, for many of the same reasons.
---
Yeah, hostility is a feature of modern internet life nowadays. Hopefully smaller server pops on classic change it. 
---
The surprising stat is the lack of night elf hunters. 
---
&gt; What do you do if a Paladin or Shaman ability make an encounter significantly easier? Do you tune the encounter differently for each faction?
---
The question is, does the content NEED to be tuned the same for both factions? To me it seems perfectly acceptable to have some encounters easier for Alliance while other encounters are easier for Horde.
---
Being competent, reliable, and congenial is exotic as hell.
---
Undead warrior all the way down at 1.1% Ouch. 
---
Farmers hate him
---
This spec is probably best suited for you then:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0xcx0MxsZZxtcoxqz
---
It is a good raid healing spec, on par / competitive with deep resto but has different mechanics, since your burst healing doesn't come from Swiftmend but from Nature's Grace.
---
Your playstile will be more caster heavy, which is great for itemisation since your healing gear won't be as far off from your dps gear.
---
You can move around some of the points, especially in the Balance tree to suit your playstile better.
---
0/30/21 is good for pure PvP or if you want a tradeoff between healing and tanking, which is good for 5mans and the like, but it lacks the healing power expected of a raiding Druid.
---
I have all of the covers up until wotlk and plan on framing them. XD probably in a cascade with vanilla on the front. I'll admire it while I wait at the dungeon for my companions.
---
Referring to t2
---
No thanks, new models with the low polygon vanilla gear would look retarded.
---
Also the amount of undead mages is disgusting hahahaha
---
Sims 4?
---
:P
---
Looks cool! Bring us that finished producttttt
---
That is your personal opinion, not of the "great majority". Some people are seeing the new models and begin to choke..
---
If it is a toggle option I have nothing against this, but they have to bring all new models to the world. Cant measure how much time that would take. 
---
Tier 0.5 has zero relevance in raiding and doesn't trivialize raiding gear in any way shape or form at any point on the game with possibly very few exceptions. On top of that it is very expensive. It would be fine for Blizzard to realease the 0.5 quests right of the bat.
---
I played human in Vanilla/TBC because humans are objectively the most evil race.
---
Here's what I worry about and want to do in order of importance.
---
1. Pick a server that is in the Los Angeles instead of a Chicago Data Center to lower my latency. (from what I understand there are only 2 US datacenters where WoW servers are located according to [this](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter) ).
---
2. Pick a server that will not eventually die out and have to be merged and the community aspect sort of being ruined.
---
3. Pick a server with a balanced Alliance/Horde ratio, or one that benefits my specific faction and disadvantages the opposite.
---
4. Pick a server that isn't west coast server time (servers have different times even if they're not located in that time zone).
---
5. I want to pick a server streamers aren't on for multiple reasons. The population might be more temporary than other servers, the population might be more toxic, the population might be younger, and there might be random annoyances caused by seeing a streamer run around in town and a posse of people /yelling stupid things that might be annoying.
---
What I will do until then:
---
If servers are not announced beforehand and no one discusses on this reddit, or have multiple high end guilds who choose to be on specific server before anything is released, then I will look for guilds named after the highest population current servers: https://realmpop.com/us.html and see if there's any repeating names.
---
If all the new servers are completely different names I will join multiple servers and try to find ones that match my #1 and #3 worries by checking latency time etc in game.
---
I will also look at top guilds to see if they choose to play on specific servers and I will probably follow them. Not because I am a top player but because they will consume a lot of farmable materials that I can make gold from. 
---
END DWARF ERASURE
---
Nah 3 seems too many still if the rest of the group are optimising and we are talking perfect world. However if you’re a really good and dedicated player as a hunter you’ll stand out in early tiers and be a fixture of your guild by Naxx so will be assured of a raid spot. It’s 40 man not mythic where getting benched is much easier.
---
you lose 10% healing but gain 20% intellect. So basically you can just gear for +healing only for your healing set since you don't have to worry about your mana, it evens out. Just get the absolute highest +healing items available don't worry about other stats.
---
As others have posted, a raid could very easily accomodate a ret paladin and still succeed, but why would they want to? The gear you want may be better used by a warrior, the dps you do is lower than 3/4 of the raid and the utility you bring is minimal. 
---
If you were a guild leader would you want to take on someone you don’t know, in a role that doesn’t benefit you? If you create a guild, or have one with mates... you could push for a position to raid as ret. 
---
I remember playing during WOTLK laughing at that number saying "by now it's doubled!"
---
Holy shit I completely forgot lol
---
I miss this beast
---
It's a census from Reddit, it's not that deep. Make of the info what you want and chill
---
It should pop b4 you can leave, also you would be ported back to the pvp npc after. 
---
For mage I have come up with a basic formula for picking a build for pvp. All of the pvp specs are unique but share certain spells and tactics. The formula is simple:
---
* Choose a 31 pnt. talent, or two 21pnt. talents. There is no exception to this rule. (except meme specs)
---
* If you chose a 31pnt. talent now you choose a supporting tree to synergize with the bulk of your talents.
---
That describes each and every mage spec for PVP, they are.
---
Elemental (fire heavy - frost heavy - 21pnt each for double iceblock with fire crits and blastwave/pyro)
---
Arcane / Fire (heavy arcane - heavy fire - 21pnt each for 2 additional instant cast damage spells)
---
Arcane / Frost (heavy arcane - heavy frost - 21pnt each)
---
Most notable specs overall would be the balanced elemental spec, Heavy frost/arcane for ice barrier and imp CS was the most reliable and common spec in the game, viable at all points in the game. Last but not least heavy arcane/fire, the infamous PomPyro spec which was so much fun, especially when geared.
---
For PVE you raid with arcane power(31pnt arcane) and frost talents that buff frostbolt and reduce threat. Your worst geared mage will go deep frost for the winter's chill debuff to buff the more heavily geared mages. If you are in a newbie guild your mages can go some form of ice barrier and imp CS pvp build as long as you have shatter / winter's chill / frost channeling(didn't use this because my tank was a monster.) Later down the road you respect fire sometime around AQ40/Naxx. I wonder if you can respec sooner if you get perfect fire gear(tons of crit).
---
If you need specific links to a mage build I can do that but in each build there are probably less than 7 talents you can play with.
---
Hell no! One of the main reason i want classic back. New models are hella ugly and helped ruin the game further(Crappy animations).
---
Adding toggle is a bad idea also. Since it will ruin the immersion greatly when you know people will see your character with another model. That iss why i am opposed to modelchanger hacks aswell.
---
Literally none of my friends nor my guild want the new models added for classic.
---
People advocating for this to be added truly is in the minority.
---
This suggestion belongs in the trashcan forever.
---
/Rage out
---
Because 1.12 av is the best
---
I assume this is a post stat squish screen shot. A TBC grey probably has 30-40dps. 6.8dps is like a lvl 10 2her in vanilla stats.
---
Why are you going to SW? PvP items won't be available for few months so you won't be going there during the summer.
---
Reroll warrior 
---
If you are in a guild that feeds gear to the #2, then being the #2 will be extremely competitive. In a lot of ways moreso than being the MT, because you are replaceable at each new encounter/tier, and you don't get many reps. If you're not the #2, you will have a lot of trouble gearing up.
---
If your guild doesn't feed gear to the #2, then gear is inherently competitive.
---
I lay in bed at night just staring at the ceiling
---
"Rogue or Fury warrior?" 
---
back and forth i go
---
This is certainly a problem too. Vanilla content is largely relevant because gold largely define what you are able to do in the game which keeps players running content that can get them gold.
---
In TBC you just get gold thrown at you left and right. At the same time, the daily quests start to feel more like a chore where you optimize the most effective quests to do each time. This problem has persisted into the current expansion and has made the game feel like you are ticking off boxes on a list instead of your activities being more dynamic and open ended.
---
I always see all of these people saying they will play as warriors and tanks but when I’ve played on private servers or back in vanilla wow, it seemed like there was always a shortage of them. 
---
It's on the front page. So it must be deep. :V
---
I think blizz won't do that because if they give that option then they'll have to update more models 
---
Full BiS paladin doing less than 1/2 of a mage  in Mc gear lmao 
---
Would you say the two specs are similar in strength when it comes to solo content? Feels like it could be weaker due to downtime caused by mana issues?
---
Yes 
---
I’d prefer the old graphics personally, but I understand your perspective on the matter.  I’d rather not see a toggle option in the game, but it wouldn’t make much of a difference to me.  Certainly wouldn’t dissuade me from playing and enjoying classic. 
---
Pets do more than 2/3 of hunter damage. 
---
Good luck finding warrior tanks who will agree not to roll on dps loot. 
---
I was in the same position, I left it up to a coin toss. Landed on fury warrior, and in that moment I knew I really wanted rogue. Worked like a charm.
---
Yeah that was my reasoning behind it possibly being viable. I’ve not healed vanilla content so I’m not aware of how good healing per second is compared to just total healing available.
---
Agreement with you on this.  They said 1.12, and there it is.  Interesting point about how play styles have changed as well. 
---
yeah i want to dps not tank and i played a few private servers and it was not easy to get groups as a dps warrior in 5 mans, which i totally understand. 
---
It existed then, too.  Especially in hardcore raid guilds.
---
The thing is, with the way Vanilla was structured, it encouraged people to interact with each other more often, and people are mostly well-meaning and nice.  You just don't see that side as much anymore, because the social aspect of today's game is diminished.
---
Oh yeah vanilla was toxic as hell, I’m not under any illusions - at least it wasn’t anonymous and lacking any accountability (which pservers basically also are as well imo)
---
I’m hoping there are higher res textures along with other eye candy. As long as there’s an option for the classic graphics I can’t see a problem.
---
I would like to make use of my modern gaming pc.  I really like the increased clutter density that was added in tbc. Hopefully that stays in from the demo. 
---
For any paladin, you want to get Linken's Boomerang for sure -- but that's a really late item. Verigan's Fist is also fantastic -- but impossible to get alone. Might be a bit rough on a fresh server.
---
Ravager and Diabolic Skiver are pretty rad, too. 
---
This is actually useful for some people who are having a hard time choosing race class combo. I’m stuck on Tauren warr/hunt/sham. Seeing his I might stick with hunter, but sham is fun... fuck
---
Me too brother!
---
Bigger bags.
---
So not the same thing at all? 
---
Idk why but whenever I level a plate wearer I am always thinking of when ill be able to use Herod's shoulder. I always thought it looked cool when I was younger and would was jealous of other people who had it.
---
Bigger bags
---
Pendulum of doom!  Although I would just give it to a twink. 
---
Nope. 
---
Night elf priest only 1%? I have my doubts.
---
Require lvl 64 hmmmmm
---
Could you not just reduce the AOE and buff particles? Will it really matter with addons? 
---
At this point I wonder how many of the "old" AV crowd was/is actively PvPing. The AV as it is played now (1.12) often goes on for &gt;1h and sometimes much more. Yes, there are fast games but those are more dependand on the kind of players you get on either side and how organized/coordinated they are. If the level of coordination is roughly equal then the games usually last longer, if not then one side gets dumpstered, which is how it should be. Also capping/defending the right/wrong points has a massive influence. It just isn't an endless zergfest like it was before.
---
I remember running all over Azeroth doing the Verigan’s Fist quest. It took me so long that by the time I’d completed it, I’d WAY out-levelled it and it was a straight downgrade for me. 
---
Pretty sure I used it anyway
---
There are a lot of good mage builds depending on what you want to do and how you play. But if someone is frost spec and doesn't take frost bite it's not because it's bad, it's because they want to use that spec to also pve or aoe grind, and then it's worthless or counter productive. A PvP optimized frost spec 100% wants frost bite. 
---
For fire mage impact is never speced in pve, but PvP it should be your first 5 points spent in the fire tree. 
---
The message at blizcon was "The 1.12 data is sacrosanct." I'd highly doubt they will add balance (at least not intentionally). 
---
To answer your question: yes, but it depends.
---
If someone else is willing to do all of the GOTW buffs, then the only real thing you're missing out on is +10% heals and either buffing regrowth or rejuvenation and then swiftmend.
---
In the beginning, its hard to imagine not wanting to have those tertiary healing skills which dramatically improve the mana efficiency of your spells. Also, Swiftmend in addition to NS + HT gives Druid's two "oh shit" heals which makes them even more flexible.
---
You say you'll be doing "solo content", but there is no such thing. Whether in PVP or 5 man's or PUG ZG's, everything is a group activity in Classic. Thus, the question is, how much benefit am I getting from having all these feral points? 
---
Well, if you're pvping then sure, having a great feral spec is wonderful, but all the feral talents in the world don't make up for sub-par dps and missing out on root, natural weapons and omen of clarity as you do in this build.
---
The problem with being a druid is that even though you can switch around your role, once you're doing pve content, you need to fill the role assigned and that will normally be healing.
---
In the beginning, i'd recommend something like 5/13/33  (max root) which gives you all of the best healing talents with significant investments into improve regrowth and rejuv or 3/13/35 which gives you a 2/3 chance to root with maxed out contributions in healing with the important feral utility.  As i've mentioned in other threads, once you start collecting your feral off pieces and you can actually do a bit of damage, then I would consider reworking the spec.
---
Obviously you can do what you want, but a level 60 Druid in greens and blues with a feral spec does no one any favours.
---
Real talk. 
---
I played back in the OG AV days and I never got any rewards at all from it because the battles lasted so long. This time around I’d like to actually get exalted and get some rewards so I’m fine with it. 
---
But, i'm  speed
---
I liked the 31 Arcane / frost build, but why do I need to switch to fire later down the road?
---
Why does what I see effect you? I don't see why your preference is more important than mine. I think that the people advocating for a modern graffics might be a minority in this community, but I think this community will be a minority in the overall player base. Again, I don't see why the no changes camp is opposed to things that have zero impact on their experience. 
---
DK were added 6 months after launch, and just 2 months after the Honor System was started. They stayed in the game for 18 months until the TBC patch.
---
Wow.. this made me realize that in almost 15 years, they've only gone from 9 to 12 classes, yet have gone from 8 to 17 races. I think one of the hazards of a game lasting so long is that existing classes need to keep expanding, which in the case of WoW has largely homogenized them. This probably makes it difficult to add novel-feeling classes to the game from scratch.
---
Because we aren’t children
---
yes
---
When you drop a profession all learned recipes are gone. If you want to pick that profession up again it will involve learning every recipe again. You would need to acquire any that aren't taught from trainers again as well. 
---
Day long avs are more of a meme, a memorable thing that happened, than actually a good design ppl enjoyed playing.
---
Long ass AVs can still happen in 1.12 version aswell, if one team decided to turtle for some reason, and other team doesn't have enough force and coordination to break through.
---
I participated in avs like that on ps (half of the day long), mad "fun" (not). most ppl just halfafk, some mages and others lazily ppl spam aoe on the entrance, and others cant get through. and so they half afk aswell afterwhile. noone knows what to do, and ppl leaving all the time, thats how awesome it is.
---
most ppl leave this av, wait deserter debuff. try to get other id bg,  and if they happen to get to the same av, they curse in bg chat and leave again. 
---
I came and join one av like 5 times through hours, and ive seen many ppl aswell. playing it abit seeing it going nowhere and there is nothing to do and leaving.
---
"one of the best experiences of all of Vanilla." btw...
---
Of we’re on the same server! Honestly, when I hit 60 and it was before BC, I ran a ton of 5-/10-mans, and enjoyed it all. Don’t mind farming that stuff at all.
---
From what I remember warriors have always been popular. Apparently their class fantasy appeals to a lot of people.
---
That’s a good point but I think part of the concern for devs would be that a higher difficulty level and a more open ended game may not appeal to the masses.  
---
Sure, but the players demand – quite rightfully – that there is no large advantage for either side. So say you now make 3 encounters that are easier for Horde and 3 that are easier for Alliance.
---
Now you need to make a balancing change to Paladins due to some issue arising with PVP or whatever. Balance is an ongoing process. You again have to remember those three encounters.
---
And of course, people will complain either way. 
---
I agree that I prefer the game without paladins on the Horde side. But from a design standpoint, it's an issue that's getting worse over time. Either you have to think about paladins and shamans more about any other class, or you take everything away from them that makes it special.
---
It would depend where the zombies are
---
It's not quick or easy. We have no evidence they have the server side files for the earlier versions of Alterac Valley. They've only confirmed they have a source code for 1.12.
---
If a database with earlier versions and server side info doesn't exist, I'd personally rather not have them making things up and guessing at values to appease the community. Given how much we as a community seem to get angry about "picking and choosing" and "slippery slopes," this seems like a strange sword to die on.
---
Expect a high failure rate for warrior and paladin.
---
My two biggest concerns are avoiding streamers and a decent faction ratio and population on a PvP server. I'll be playing Horde, so I'am not terribly concerned.
---
You ever played habbo hotel? Might be more your scene :)
---
you obviously dont
---
Druids are viable:
---
* Can heal all dungeons
---
* Can tank all dungeons 
---
* Can heal all raids 
---
* Can off-tank all raids, MT some 
---
* Best flag carrier in WSG
---
* Top mobility in PVP
---
* Innervate, Brez, MotW
---
Druids have their benefits though?
---
Tank: Good 5 man tanks, good pvp tank, raids, solid off tank.
---
Cat: Many guides out there have shown how you can get really up there in the damage meters in raids, have their uses in pvp, can’t speak on 5 mans.
---
Balance: Fair enough, I don’t know any advanatges for them.
---
Resto: Have one of the most mana efficient heals in the game for raids, have two great emergency big heals. 5 mans they’re fine. Pvp can be amazing with proper form switching.
---
Have one of the quickest leveling capabilities.
---
They only have a battle rez, the only battle rez in the game. They have innervate which is huge.
---
They bring a lot, just because they aren’t topping the charts doesn’t mean they aren’t bringing their own unique things.
---
Thunderfu.. Lesser magic wand
---
I hope it is July 16th as that's my cake day! fingers crossed.
---
&gt; rotation
---
lol
---
Human Paladin, Raging berserker axe, Ravager, Herod’s shoulder, and the tabard of the scarlet crusade. I’ve loved that gear since I was a kid and the effect of ravager is so damn cool! Also as a bonus the whistle trinket from Scarlet Monastery that summons the dog!
---
&gt; He tells me there is and we go round and round about it, but any MMO that uses sharding or megaservers just doesn't have that MMO feel. Its just "what rando's will I group with today" and "time to play with my friend's list" with the world around you basically meaning nothing.
---
That right there is exactly why I want to give Classic a try to see if the old community is back or the new community has the same feel. A friend convinced me to pick up BfA this weekend  and I gotta say ... retail WoW sucks. It's just this big, homogenized mess with no personality. I healed for 5 or 6 dungeons and I didn't even bother reading the character names because they're all going to be gone in 20 minutes and I'll never see them again.
---
Am I missing something about mor'ladim?  Either lore or mechanics wise? Or did he get an automatic bid because he won some shitter conference? I can't come up with a scenario where he beats gothik. 
---
This is me, I lost this PVP video years ago and have been looking for it ever since. Youtube didn't exist back then and the link I originally shared it to has long been lost; in 2005 people used to download each others' PVP videos from MegaUpload. Thank you Nineteen for sharing this and bringing back a lot of old memories, I really appreciate it.    
---
I was a noob in a lot of ways, and this vid mostly shows how much we all had yet to learn, 6-8 months after WoW launched. Most of the footage was taken shortly after WSG released in 2005; some folks may recognize that fight against Sodapop was in Ashenvale between the Alliance WSG queue site and the Horde one in Barrens. No idea if it's the same person behind Sodapoppin.    
---
To answer some of the questions here, I used to melee a lot because back then hunters panicked when I got in their face and/or didn't realize the importance of Wing Clip, along with a big 2H for Raptor Strike. I could strafe around and they'd barely hit me, as they tried to turn and click their melee buttons. This was before Blizzard reworked the talent trees we know from 1.1.2, and created the Survival talent to add an extra 20% chance to crit for Raptor Strike, which helped many Hunters understand that everything is a Hunter weapon.    
---
Warriors and others also didn't yet know how important it was to keep an opponent snared, and wouldn't do it immediately when I went in to melee, which meant I could often Wing Clip and get back to range at full speed for optimal kiting. Plus, Wing Clip was a 60% slow with chance to root and Hamstring was a 50% slow, which still gave me the running advantage over Warriors if we were both snared than if we both ran at 100% unsnared. At least, that was my 2005 logic.     
---
I had more HP than opponents because the importance of STAM was not widely understood for PVP in 2005, an advantage I stumbled upon to give myself any chance in 1vX encounters. Horde on Shattered Hand (US) were often outgeared and up against two of the top Alliance guilds in the world in Vanilla: &lt;Death and Taxes&gt; being the most famous and &lt;Drama&gt;, which got the world first Nefarian kill in BWL. Later on everyone else figured out the STAM in PVP thing, along with other novel ideas such as keybindings, and I probably wasn't so impressive. Eventually I saw the Pat PVP video and re-rolled a warrior, stopping two weeks short of rank 14 in early 2006.       
---
This has turned into a rambling nostalgia post; seeing my old video again after all these years brings back the nuances of why this game was so fucking awesome. Thank you again to Nineteen for uploading it. Can't wait for Classic.   
---
Because i like a certain version of AV?  Lol.  
---
31 DPS according to [this TBC dB] (http://db.hellfire-tbc.com/?item=25402).

Yeah man, this is so amazing lmao. Good ol's times.

Both was in so either is blizzlike, DK's are prolly good but to be honest ly they are really poorly implemented, they don't stop people griefing and most griefers don't care about pvp rank. All it does is mean that pvpers can't be part of any city invasions or stuff like that without risking decay.
---
pvp servers are just better regardless of pvp or pve focus. on a pvp server its such a minor portion that only do 1 hardcore. majority do both
---
Yep agree
---
My favourite is "just throw the cake up here pls!"
---
Too many memories just from watching this!  
---
D+M do some 'lore videos' and a few other sources do as well.  It's not my cup of tea but seek and ye shall find. 
---
What a rational response
---
Which one is the angry Grandma face? I am intrigued
---
what a rational suggestion for the game 
---
This stand the test of time as quality content.
---
I don’t see any rogue in the picture. 
---
hahah, I remember watching this with my friends, I think it's still hilarious to this day. 
---
I dont really agree that class balance was terrible. You could say specs of comparable roles were not balanced, but if you take each class as a sum of all its parts I don’t really see the imbalance you are proposing.
---
He testes in a private server where retri's are not scripted correctly. Even the vengeance buff which he says is bugged. That alone is a huge chunk of retri's DPS. This is partly why the stigma continues to perpetuate itself.
---
RP
---
I mean, i dunno about you but i probably encountered at least 10 derivatives of Legolas on every server i played on.
---
Check out barrens.chat! Site is really nice and a lot of people stoked for classic wow.
---
My bad. Meant to reply to the the op comment. 
---
TBC had such ugly tier sets 
---
That’s totally fair, I should be pulling my weight like all the others. Would you say the specc works during the pre raid gearing? I’m somewhat afraid I’ll not be wanted as a healer in 5mans due to lack of ress and heard bear druids are good dungeon tanks. 
---
But his shoulders look like the warrior set (although they are the same blue as the shaman set)
---
Disco cheat is best song.
---
Nice. 
---
Nice.   
---
Shocked at the higher amount of Human Warlocks than Gnome Warlocks. Never expected that.  
---
On the loot trading; seriously this is not a common issue.  I’m surprised they don’t just ignore it and leave it as it was.
---
Until this whole debate started, I didn’t even know you could open a ticket to get loot redistributed in vanilla.  Never had it turn into an issue.
---
[Oh my god, he's going all out!](https://imgur.com/tuYoLat)
---
Pallies are the “best” healers in Vanilla, in terms of mana efficiency and performance on the healing charts. They are great tank healers and great raid healers too.
---
My guild brings 4 pallies, 5 priests, 2 druids.
---
Priests have more utility with PI, fear ward, prayer, and good all around direct heals and hots.
---
Druids are just not that great, but you do want to have one or two for gift, brez, and innervates.
---
Overall priest is probably the best healing class in terms of everything they bring, but just for the healing throughout itself, pallies are king.
---
Your downtime will be larger than with a feral/resto hybrid spec yes.
---
It really depends on what kind of solo content we are talking about. Most vanilla solo endgame content is very much profession based. For example as a Herbalist/Alch you won't have any problems making very good money with a proper healing spec. As an Skinner/LW you need to grind mobs though, including high level elites.
---
Your build wants to reach for HotW which is a very potent and worthwhile talent though and again you'll be a more formidable tank for 5mans and the like as well. But for raiding you'll lack the oomph and efficiency of a build that takes Gift of Nature+.
---
This wont be a big issue for entry raids and catchup raids but will certainly be a problem for endgame raids, where every class is forced to min-max, or honestly *most* players are. Any guild can handle some slackers, off-specced classes and the like.
---
I wish they had added way more items like this. They really add an interesting element.
---
We can see top guilds kill videos and they are wearing crap gear, no buffs etc
---
As long as a class brings something unique to the table, they'll be invited to a raid. Druids bring innervate and motw, so you're always going to bring at least one. They're pretty useful for decruse fights as well and can tank fairly competently in mc. They're hands down the best flag carriers in wsg and one of the best defenders in AB. Druids don't suck, most groups just don't need a lot of them. 
---
Oh trust me, I've seen them. I just want more. Lol
---
Second-least-played class/race combo, according to the graph. Probably because tauren don't really have good racials for top-level hunter play.
---
Fortunately, not only am I not the least bit concerned about CharOp, I actively enjoy playing suboptimal characters. Partially to spite those I feel put way too much emphasis on perfect builds and partially just because I enjoy talking the road less traveled by.
---
Start a guild. Most guilds are built around a small number of tanks, so if you start your own, you can be sure to always have the MT spot 
---
I’m rolling dwarf if I go Alliance.
---
Make sure you make friends with all the raid leaders, that’s how I always got my shadow priest in
---
Was depressed yesterday for random reasons. Only thing I wanted to do was play Classic. Can't do that...
---
I'm on this sub constantly. The only tab on browser that doesn't close is the talent spec calculator.
---
Results that suprise me
---
Troll Rogue being the lowest, while theyre the worst for PvP, theyre still the best (marginally) in PvE. Thought that the more established knowledge of the game would have evened things out.
---
NE being reasonably popular for priest and warrior and i thought dwarf vs NE hunter wpuld be a close race. Thought Human vs Dwarf Paladin would be close too. Guess the RP is too strong.
---
Gnome mage more popular than human, but human lock more popular than gnome lock? Wut?
---
Gnomes and trolls being unpopular in general. I guess the old stereotype is true, allys play forPvE and Horde for PvP.
---
Rogue being unpopular in general being the biggest surprise. This one makes me think pserver meta had a big impact with how competitive gear and raid spots are for them.
---
Wasn't there a shield called "The Movable Object" too?
---
They should buff the damage of Judgement, its the only attack you have as a paladin outside auto attacks, and it even requires a seal to be used.. still hits like a wet noodle
---
Whats your favourite memory from vanilla?
---
Druid looks inflated because the other classes are divided by race, whereas each faction only has one druid race. Do the math and they're near the bottom of the chart comparing class totals.
---
Have some self respect man!
---
In duels I’d consider paladins with the right spec/gear as top tier and able to win against just about anything. In world pvp and bgs that isn’t usually the case. 
---
Is there a hunter equivalent youtuber? Someone who posts all about hunters? I know there's Kargoz, but he's really focused on everything now rather than just hunters.
---
Midgetforge? Psh, Orgrimmar is where its at!
---
Fire does more damage, but the first two raids are filled with mobs that resist or are immune to fire. 
---
No and no. You want blackout over spirit tap for PvP. 
---
Undead really dominates Rogue, Mage, Priest, and Warlock. 
---
I think Undead and Humans should’ve been allowed to be Hunters as well.
---
I'd be shocked if there wasn't. 
---
The immovable object
---
Both tanks and healers have no issues finding groups for 5mans ever. If a tank OR healer is looking for 4 people he/she will fill it faster than 3 DPS players looking for a tank/healer.
---
The lack of a spammable ress is an issue if your group wipes, but that doesn't really happen if you and your tank are doing a good job and your dps aren't completely clueless. Also a well timed bress can save a wipe and the resulting downtime entirely.
---
So don't worry about Druids not being invited as healers.
---
Secondly if you go deeper into resto you can still tank all the dungeons with appropriate gear w/o an issue. How do you think most Warriors are tanking dungeons? The vast majority of them are either fury or arms specced so they lack major defensive talents from prot including threat talents and efficiency talents.
---
You in the other hand can reach Swiftmend or at least Gift of Nature and still have your major tanking talents. Just some example builds:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxLs0MZVtckeq0o
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxx0oZVtcksq
---
(id prefer the second one but I highly value PvP)
---
The + stam buff from HotW will actually not increase your efficiency as a 5man dungeon tank all that much because you won't get hit hard enough for your healthpool to be that high. It "just" makes you safer. But 5mans are much more about playing well together and pulling packs in a smart way than your spec.
---
So don't worry about you not being able to 5man tank as a Druid even with a healing build.
---
Yah, nobody cares about racials for raids or pvp. Just pick what you like!
---
“Tauren or orc? Tauren..... or Orc?”
---
more like mud hut village 
---
both
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=25407/the-movable-object
---
the short answer?  
---
In the older versions there were much more, and much more powerful NPCs in AV
---
1.12 basically fully enables  'we don't play the map we both rush' playstyle. Rep and honor grinders will approve. People who want a big zerg BG disapprove   
---
&gt;  All it does is mean that pvpers can't be part of any city invasions or stuff like that without risking decay.
---
That was kind of the whole purpose of DKs... to stop large-scale griefing of lowbie players by killing their questgivers and vendors.
---
If you are not interested in world pvp and just want to farm honor, then that's what the BGs are for. That's probably why BGs were introduced in the exact same patch as DKs.
---
Shame its going to only take people a few days to farm this as soon as AV is released.
---
You basically just described Wintergrasp and all of the other areas like it. I don't know many people who enjoyed those. The servers I played on just traded wins to get access to the vault and free marks. I imagine the same thing would happen in AB and WSG if they were world areas with a cooldown associated with the battle. 
---
I respectfully disagree. I think there will be a few people who had no idea what they're getting into. However I feel like its pretty common knowledge that this isn't going to be a 3 week steamroll then start raiding.
---
Planning on maining either warrior for classic, what are the major differences between arms and fury as far as 5man, raiding and PvP?
---
Was 1 spec just better over all then the other like it is now in retail?
---
Ive seen these panels used on here before, but this is the first meme that used it well.
---
Well done sir
---
Wow, you have to be shitting me! So good to hear from you and so glad you found your video! I remember you and other Revered players like Bondstar giving me hell back in the day. Here's a group picture for you, lmao: [https://i.imgur.com/Ezcg5Sy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ezcg5Sy.jpg) I've got more nostalgia on my Youtube and even did a podcast talking about raiding in DnT &amp; Drama.  
---
I've been reediting and uploading all the old Shattered Hand videos I saved hoping one of you might find your own lost video. Crazy that you did. I really wish SMBU wasn't copyright blocked because your video actually had the rare in game sounds.  I hope you like the songs I chose to fill in, I tried to use ones that sounded similar to SMBU. As far as actual edits go, I did cut out one cycle of gnome dancing to keep the video on beat and I did add a touch of Vegas's sharpening effect, too. Anyway, I still have the original copy if you want it for yourself.  
---
Haven't heard from Lotek. Not sure how many people are actually playing classic but a few DnT and a bunch of Drama have been congregating in discord, I'll PM you the link.  
---
But that's not what it does.. Did you not read?
---
Trade material bags will not be in the game.
---
Loved Liquidice, ran some world PVP with him after seeing his first video. I think he was part of the PVP guild that never advanced far in raids but was pretty decent in WSG... I think the guild name was &lt;Enmity&gt;? Can't remember but they had a good FC rogue for the time as well.
---
Doing stupid things with my friends. Pug dungeons, rolling new toons and battling it out in STV, PvP shenanigans. Hanging out with friends and making new friends is awesome in classic. I was pleased to find that private servers have not altered this. Any community involvement is amazing. 
---
I started playing WoW late TBC, apart from a few things I’ve seen posted here I’m going in blind for the most part and trying for that mix of nostalgia and new game feeling in one go.
---
You can find me by the tree outside the auction house. Probably dancing in bear form :)
---
"Ruining my immersion because people that can't tell the difference won't see what I see is bad because it ruins it for me so I should ruin it for them"
---
That’s fine but the amount of ripple posting guild recruitment stating they want max content on farm in a week to 2 weeks says otherwise. It’s not a huge amount but they have huge guilds already supposedly.
---
I say let them try. It will just add to the amusement I’m having playing Classic watching these people crack and fold under the style of this game.
---
I also really hope people come to love it, those who have never played it. I hope they see the merit of a hard, slow leveling process. Teamwork in dungeons that isn’t an add on. The value of playing your class well and working well in a group.
---
Hopefully it’s enough that it shakes the game world some so we no longer have everyone making Battle Royale game and instead games that really challenge players 
---
I didn't say it trivialized raiding gear. Please read. I said dungeon gear. 
---
Graphics don't effect your game, especially if you can stick with the old graphics. The "muh immersion because they won't see what I see" is a strawman 
---
Aoe looting is a retail ‘quality of life’ feature I’d love to see . Aoe grinding and then having to click to loot every mob is slow and adds nothing to the game. I guess one downside is it means mages would farm gold faster 
---
Crazy you still remember us! Sadly, I mostly just remember the people in my screenshots.  
---
My pet was named after a dwarf warrior named Genetic who played for Riders of the Apoc. The guild Genetic was after my time I believe, playing into TBC from what I have gathered by reading old forum posts.  
---
When I played on Shattered Hand Relentless was the best horde guild.
---
As an Orc, I need a female nelf corpse, still fresh...  ...for research.   
---
Damn I remember finishing this grind after BC had dropped. Needed to flaunt that sweet mage set all over SW and battlegrounds.
---
While SC1 remastered didnt get a new page, but then again it was a perfect 1:1 remaster (as in, no changes to gameplay, only changes to graphics, and even that wasn't too overhauled, or they would've made it like SC2) so it makes sense to keep them together.
---
This one is going to be such a different situation, I really hope they go ahead with splitting them up-they need to show that Classic is it's own thing, otherwise they will limit streamability of the game, which could limit the amount of people willing to play it.
---
It really just depends on who you get around...
---
I had a pretty bad experience with a couple of early raiding guilds, and I was ready to just quit playing altogether.  Then I managed to find a guild that had almost no drama at all, and was just fun to be around, even if we were banging our heads against progression content and getting our asses handed to us.
---
And let's face it...  That's when things become the most frustrating, and people start losing their cool.
---
My best mate back in Highschool and I use to spend the whole weekend at his house or mine pretty much every weekend, we would order 3 family pizzas on the Friday from the local take out place that would last us till Sunday. usually  we had to sleep during the day when the phone was needed by the adults but the nights were hours from 7m till 3-4am in the morning.
---
We also only owned one music CD that both of us liked D12's album "D12 World", so that would be played weekend after weekend, it sort of became the soundtrack to classic wow for of us.
---
We also had to share one dial up connection usually with 4000-8000 MS of lag, it would also take us hours of work to get the bridge connection going as every-time we had a new issue, but even with all of that they are some of my best memories from when we were young.
---
Now we both are grown up, have kids and families but we have already talked about doing this for one last night when the servers go live, we agreed to take the day after the servers go live off.
---
We are meeting at my house, planning on making our own pizzas (since the pizza joint closed down) and he's even brought a copy of the album so we can play it in the same portable CD player I have stored in the roof, he was even laughing saying we should try to bridge the network connection over the PC's again get really old style and get out the old CRT's but luckily I convinced him to allow some future tech.
---
I am looking forward to this night since we first decided to do it, as excited as I am to play Classic its more about reliving a point in our childhood that we didn't think would ever happen again. 
---
Only if they put in the effort to update **all** of the old models and textures to the standard they have today. 
---
Having the updated Orc model riding on the old wolf mount looks silly. Or playing a human model from 2015 and covering it in armor textures from 2005.
---
Alliance scum. 
---
Its not a big shock, but AV 1.12 is broken. A major part of what people wanted out of Classic is no easy epics, no instant grarification rewards and thats exactly what AV 1.12 offers. A fast easy grind for raid quality epics. It takes any sense of accomplishment out of them.
---
Very cool.  Blender?
---
Cruel Barb as a combat rogue, you don't know how many times I try to run DM for that shit.
---
Sorry I misread that but it is a weird statement to boot since to aquire 0.5 you need to do all the dungeons and farming in the world.
---
Yeah the community aspect of this game is incredible, honestly I find community to be something that can keep a game alive longer than fresh mechanics/content, Eve online is a great example of that. When a certain private server launched last June I played alone because I couldn't convince any of my friends to try it out, ended up making a ton of new friends from all over the place that I talk to almost daily even though I've stopped logging in (to avoid burnout before classic even launches). What faction are you gonna play?
---
The funny thing is, tanks will be in high demand for 5 mans and PUGs, but when it comes to raiding in a guild, most Warriors will have to be DPS. Tank slots in dedicated raiding guilds are pretty coveted. 
---
I mean, people went there for rewards, its just no one expected them to be handouts like they do now. Since they made it broken and easier, people dont want it to go back to being a challenge.
---
AV exalted was doable, easier than WSG or AB, but somehow people complain that it took too long since they got a nerfed version with easy rewards
---
It is a rational suggestion. Classic will need to bring new players and 15 year old graphics are not a strong selling point for a more modern audience. 
---
see my username
---
do you even play this game????
---
In general I agree.  TBC mechanics adjustments were overall for the better, specifically for hybrids and hunters.  At the same time TBC did set the precedent that Blizzard tinkered with each class every expansion often not addressing the real deficiencies of the class.
---
My example would be the mage.  Mages were obviously in a good spot at the end of vanilla for both PVP and PVE.  With TBC, raid mechanics were getting more dance-athon so mages needed instant cast damage spells for on-the-move casting.
---
Instead we got the frost pet spec meme required for PvP arena.  
---
I understand why people would want a specific feel of certain things in the game and I also agree with you.
---
But I'm more confused that it was some big reveal or letdown that AV wod be 1.12 even though they said that it was the patch they were using. Was there anything else that was announced that isnt 1.12?
---
Paladins are not viable in pve raids AS RET or PROT.
---
So there’s still a need for some balance
---
The water animation on Chain Heal
---
From a former Shaman player, I agree
---
Damn it, this is me lol
---
private servers are a plague. good thing thought that youtube and twitch will be forced to suppress their content soon, but that's off topic
---
PvE raid builds obviously do not need % based stun procs.
---
The main reason I can see here is that prior to patch ... 1.8 or 1.9 these random short duration stuns were on the general stun diminishing return. Meaning they've reduced the duration of reliable and targeted stuns with their procs.
---
Later when they were removed from said list they became much more popular as they were an optional additional bonus over a 'your X screwed my Y's duration and now we are both dead...'
---
Haha yeah I saw that one, wasn't big on us cheating like that but Bagamut hated turtlefests. I admit I preferred the epic 1-2 hour WSGs that ended 3-2 for either side. Used to hate Schmitty and Yes coming with a priest or two to return flag, they were beasts for their time. I also clearly remember losing a particular 1v1 to you on the Alliance ramp that made me rage a bit; wasn't used to losing to Hunters at the time, Knob was the only other challenge!        
---
Good choice on the music and thanks for the edits, I thought about commenting on you taking out the old school Vanilla-era tunes. I was a PVP video fan in those days and learned a lot from Dinan, whose vid preceded mine, and is the reason I included the in-game sounds. Someone uploaded his old vid to Youtube, though the title is wrong (wasn't from 1.1.2, more like March 2005): https://youtu.be/U95UNBeSubQ    
---
I would love the original copy of the PVP vid and look forward to your DM. I'm sure a lot of Drama names will come back to me once I see them, but I always remembered DnT a little better (you guys were superior opponents in guild vs. guild WSG).    
---
Thank you for the in-depth replies, I think you’ve helped me come to the conclusion that I wanna roll a Druid come classic. That second build looks like a great jack of all trades build without sacrificing too much healing. I can definitely see myself running something similar for the start of my 60 period and then later transition in to a more min-max healing build when content gets harder (bwl maybe)
---
I don't have any retail experience since TBC, so I just made a mage this weekend for the free trial period to check out the new graphics. Ran to ironforge at level 5 to buy a lesser magic wand. They were priced at several hundred gold! Inflation is crazy, I had like 2 silver since they toon was brand new.
---
Why are private servers a plague? They are what ignited my love for WoW and now I can't wait to buy the Classic WoW!
---
If the thought of somebody playing an undead mage makes you cringe, boy are you going to hate the real world.
---
Depending on your class certain rewards from class quests, the 2h mace for paladins, whirlwind axe for warriors, warlocks have these robes and an offhand later on. 
---
I played a bit of retail this weekend and while there's a lot I don't enjoy there are some feature's I'll miss:
---
1. Flying. I know, I know, flying was something that led to death of the game. It still feels incredible to actually fly though.
---
2. Advancing relevant parts of the WoW plot. So, I recently replayed the WC3 TFT campaign including the orc campaign, and it really is cool to see some of the questions that were raised at the end of the founding of Durotar finally get addressed. (ome of the stuff with the kul tirans is so ridiculous though like how everyone's fat. Also, Kul Tiras is somehow like half the size of Kalimdor, which is ridiculous). 
---
If you want to rush through AV asap, you clearly don't enjoy it, so just don't queue for it and let everyone that enjoys it for what it was enjoy it.  
---
Everyone is satisfied.
---
Fire scales better with gear in the later stages and some mobs in naxx are frost immune or resistance. You can raid in wow having never respecced to fire but eventually it becomes better.
---
Let them farm gold, do dungeons, PVP, or heal, then.
---
Hunter is easy: go marksman/survival until you're hit capped, then go marksman/BM, by this time BWL will be just about over and you can basically spec however you want for the rest of the servers lifespan because nobody will expect you to do much more than below average dps and tranq shot.
---
A watered down AV can hardly be called the best.
---
If it's backseat content to you then why would you care if it was the og AV? 
---
Just don't queue for it and let everyone that wants long epic struggles enjoy it. 
---
Seems like most believe like i do and thats why blizzard is following suit. So its you that should just not que. 
---
As an aside, since you like RTS and MOBAs I really hope you play through WC3 sometime, it provides a ton of background for WoW. 
---
I was so happy when I got The Unstoppable Force.
---
Might wanna check the vanillafriends website 
---
Hand of justice, so i don't have to farm it at 60 
---
Yeah I guess it’s passing up to much in the resto tree, I’ll probably roll some kind of hybrid spec when starting out in the earlier phases of classic and transition in to a more min-max healing build when content more requires it.
---
Dude, I played WC3 my entire life. My problem with WoW was the subscription, I grew up on a very anti-gaming family and the only games I had access to was the ones at the Cyber cafe close to my school. (It had Warcraft 3 and it's expansion), they added CSGO and Dota2 as time passed.
---
Last year I got my first job and adult life freed me from my parents grip so I can finally enjoy WoW
---
I guess that's why the blue post was lambasted in the announcement.
---
Will definitely be Horde. I played alliance to 60, but 90% of my characters are Horde. PvP servers have given me a strong bit of Horde pride and I love it! You?
---
I'm looking for a guild to start in. I need something casual for dungeons and leveling since I have a full time job now.
---
I used it on my druid. No fucking clue why. I was 60 in really good pvp gear. But I had no idea what I was doing. I would leave cat for to try and stun people. 
---
That’s the joke lol
---
Back in 04-06, would’ve been a lot of Gorillaz, Korn, Sublime, and The Pixies.
---
Good times.
---
were those actual weapons?
---
That's not how statistics work.  A 99% confidence level for a population of 1,000,000 is 9,512.  The survey's sample size is just fine.  There are certainly reasons to think that the sample is not representative, but sample size is not one of them.
---
The world would be a better place if people didn't talk with authority about things they know nothing about.
---
My wife and kids. 
---
I never played vanilla I think I was playing Toontown at that time since I would've been like 7 or 8.  I'm planning to play it, to see what it was like and have some fun with friends in something "new" since there is a huge   multiplayer game drought right now for us non-fps fans.
---
Stop trying to make stormwind happen. It’s never going to happen!!
---
Given that, man you are going to LOVE IT! It's honestly such a great game. 
---
They are shit in pvp and even less than shit in raids your suggestion is ridiculous 
---
It's not about the 100% uptime. It's about the debuff stacking, as every hunter produced his/her own while all benefit from it.
---
For a better understanding: With the T2 and goodies from aq40 and naxx you were looking at the ominous 1000 agility break point (especially on alliance with kings) That means 2000+ RAP from your gear
---
Yet just mere 2 active debuffs equal +900 RAP already
---
5-6 active debuffs at the start of a fight when rapid fire raises the chances for it happening? Hello 2700 RAP. Duck and cover with FDs or get an angry raid lead. (good thing when you were one of the three people doing the job :p but you get the idea)
---
That's why people don't understand old thottbot comments about hunters pulling aggro when they talk about T2. The more hunters wear T2 the more bonkers it gets
---
Alliance raids have more hunters in their raid core for nature resistance. They don't have the luxury of shamans to assist you for that. So it was much more natural to see the phenomenon there
---
To answer your question we've had patchwork fights with hunters capping on 932 and finishing around 820~ish. (not the usual mind you - that extreme case happened because we had to stock up players from the - what you would call a B raid today - on that raid ID we ended up with 9 hunters just for the abbo/mil wing farm evening)
---
This debuff stacking madness was the entire reason for the inspiration of the first recorded 1000 dps clip on patchwork. (at least based on the attention we've got back then afterwards implied as much and later you've had other people like the fury lilui? something with Lil-X dropping his 1250 dps patchwork, but with KT weapons mind you. Our lil old Aylow broke the magic 1k as a leftovers absorber rogue because he was marked for a reroll onto shaman in BC.
---
Anyway
---
Aylow just flipped the game mechanics. Instead of stacking debuffs, he opted for all the world buffs in the world. Literally all of them not just mere theorycrafting.
---
Something that wasn't that usual back in the days among the German servers. Ony/nef, ZG for first kills, sure. People were not nearly as manically as players go do today in their glorious plague private servers.
---
Oh yeah and I almost forgot. Aylen also outed himself as clicker with it. Hence why he got the nickname Aylow :p
---
Even found the clip. Nostalgia hits you hard when you watch the old raid ... and Aylow's clicking :D

Hi Visarax, I was Wesly, Orc Hunter on SH. Enmity is the name I was looking for, I think Liquidice was in that guild! They were mostly PVP but undergeared because they didn't care much for raiding. I agree with Nineteen, Relentless was the best PvE horde guild for the time and we were second (&lt;Revered&gt;). Not sure who the strongest Horde guild was because there were about 5 Alliance guilds better geared than all of us (DnT, Drama, Riders of the Apoc, Hammer Clan, Skyfang)
---
Patch 1.13
---
Judgement scaling increased by 20% of AP and Spell Damage but places a debuff on the paladin causing all healing received to be reduced by 50% in addition to placing a cooldown on blessing of freedom for 10 seconds.
---
I approve of KozedyrKare's ideas for paladin balance
---
\-Horde player
---
I second the SM gear. I will probably live in Armory for a good while fighting off all the warriors.
---
If you don't like classic with flying mounts you can not play it.
---
Esfand had full consumable/buffs, amazing gear, frequently in feral group, was in mediocre dps overall guild, and still usually averaged 12-15th.
---
Tank pally is only half good for one pull in MC and warriors can still do it easily. However for 5mans, tank pally can be effective. Though that's not endgame content really. 
---
Hunter OP confirmed?
---
I'm aware, it was just an interesting difference in some of the classes. That's all I was saying. Not refuting or questioning the evidence. 
---
So many great times. Schmitty got r14 one week before me. (He kind of hated me though because I forcibly got more honor than him at the end and risked his not getting it.) 
---
I don't remember anything specific but I do remember being stressed fighting you. Knob was definitely another legend, but kind of a bit before my time. There was also Durahan and Thropan. As far as horde went, it was basically just you, hah. Sucks that the factions were so imbalanced. I would have liked to have seen you geared by a guild like DnT.  
---
DnT was def better than Drama, which is why I was so happy when DnT recruited me because I was actually in Drama initially.
---
Alliance through and through, I tried levelling horde but I can't get into their aesthetics. Oddly enough the only race I want to play in a fantasy world is a generic human. I'll be on a PvP server though, if you're US east maybe we'll kill eachother some day :)
---
yeah im not sure where this "Derp theres not enough quests" bullshit comes from...maybe if you dont hit up every zone and dont complete chain quests and dont pick up dungeon quests i guess you might run into some issues but like you said its way overblown. 
---
charge
---
swing
---
wf
---
sword spec
---
rage capped
---
... nothing there to hit with all that rage anymore
---
Imagining that made me laugh for some reason
---
As someone going into alchemy and I’m sure some goblins will kill me for saying this.  but the highly competitive limited vendor patterns for alchemy will be my first major purchase. Free action potions are so nice as a warrior. Eventually at max I will be alchemist engineer. Also bags and alts if it’s truly just a second sub for wow classic I may run a second bank alt account to monitor AH for cheap supplies. 
---
After getting my rig I tried retail and hated it. My friend made me download Classic private server and I fell in love.
---
I would *not* call D2 catch up gear. To me catch up gear is defined by being easy to obtain compared to how strong it is. D2 is not easy to obtain. It still requires work. It's *different* work, yes, but it's still work.
---
I'm opposed to *easy* ways to obtain good gear but I am not opposed to different ways to obtain good gear.
---
It was a BC item. 
---
I think the reason it took so long during the non-zurg AV was due to there not being auto grouping in BGs. When I finally found a mod that would just invite everyone in AV to my group it was a game changer. Got to exalted very quickly. 
---
Stuff like this reminds me why noggenfogger is such a rich little ... ;)
---
I think what many people aren't stating is that server pops will be normalized no longer will you have a huge pull off players to pull from (15k pop pservers) and instead now you have a 2-3k pop pull if players. It will be hard pressed to get 40 dedicated raiders with that size. That said ret dps is super low and only reason esfand and other retail are playing on private servers is cause they max world buffs etc and the boss fights are only a minute long. That can't be done in classic cause world buffs have CD timers and consumables are much harder to obtain.  So it's completely up to you. I'm sure you can find a guild as ret cause most guilds will be trying to just fill a 40 man roster, but at the same time you will be fucking over 39 other people on time. But it's a game so if you aren't having fun you need to make it fun and if ret is fun for you do it. 
---
kinda ghey
---
You could do it in Boomkin form :)
---
I remember Transcend progressing pretty far on horde as well.   
---
Here's a screenshot of the alliance honor rankings showing some of the other guilds like WarEnsemble:  
---

---
Refreshing this sub for my week off. 
---
I forgot about korn!!!!! Shadow priest soundtrack at its finest
---
I specifically remember seeing FAR more arms warriors in vanilla. I think the main reason was because you missed alot of attacks being fury also that it was very hard to get any good 1h's for a warrior as fury.
---
Sleeping.
---
Yea, that's just a theory that was busted ages ago. If you sort by level range, Warriors change by something like 0.3% if you compare levels 1-60 to 50-60. They're very overpopulated and banks alts have nothing to do with it.
---
That's good to hear. Honestly, I was pretty nervous leading up to that hoping I could live up to the legend of my old guild.
---
Vendors for 2 gold? Shit that was like my entire net worth 1-59 in Vanilla. 
---
Not really, it's more like in dungeons you need a tank for every 5 people, where in a raid you need a tank for every 10 to 20 people.
---
There will always be space for 1 prot pally as an offtank in raids. Atleast for the non-minmax crowd. Pally tanks bring sanctuary buff and if you give them time to build aggro (aka kill MT target first on pulls) you aren’t pulling it off the pally tank guaranteed
---
When people know that private servers are in fact stolen intellectual property
---
yet they still support them, and pay them
---
What does this make of those users? What does the law say about buying stolen goods from a fence in your country? In mine its still a crime even if I were not aware that the goods are stolen.
---
Not to mention that they fill the world with their scrapped together misinformation. The people running those servers even openly admit that ''their product'' is not properly representing the game as they don't know anything about intended cooldown algorithms for example.
---
Pick a certain npc and go over content from multiple private server youtube channels. They will behave differently just based on that little bit. Yet here in this subreddit people preach about 'facts' based on that burning pile of a mess
---
Should be rocking Domo shoulders. 
---
Funny you said that, I was just coming back to say I now remembered you were originally Drama (looked through your old ss, including you in the world 1st Nef kill). Going to listen to your podcast soon.       
---
Forgot you went to rank 14, grats man! Most of the guild vs. guild battles I'm thinking of were before you went to DnT and got really big, Thropan was just starting to become a problem and Knob was more around my time. I think he and I both scaled back on WoW around the same time (I re-rolled Warrior towards end of summer 2005 after seeing Pat's PVP vid, eventually stopped 2 weeks short of rank 14 in early 2006). By that time you had the BWL xbow and a reputation throughout Horde as an impossible killing machine. Good times.     
---
Sounds like you want to be a rogue.
---
Ret’s can be monsters in pvp? Prot I can agree with you, but ret paladin’s have proved themselves to be great in pvp over and over again.
---
I don't know what you mean by that
---
hits F5
---
Wall climbing/exploration in general.
---
Yes they do, probably not as much, and no they haven't confirmed yet.
---
Phase 2 is the earliest possible because some of the quests require Dire Maul.
---
Thank God I don't believe in intellectual property. And is it really theft if no one is loosing anything?
---
I think he's talking about Warrior specifically, and Orc is better for a Warrior until the end of Naxx. Weapon skill is very powerful.
---
Biggest takeaway is almost 3/4 of respondents don’t have active subs... that’s a sweet 200k for blizzard to pick up alone!
---
In prefer BM while leveling, it reduces your rest time and allows you to just auto shoot 1-60 while fending off most threats in PVP with the pet + kiting.
---
But, the point stands. Hunter is ez and you can probably play with a lot of other builds 1-60.
---
End game you'll be forced to spec Marksman, and dismiss your pet during raids so no point in BM unless you are strictly PVPing.
---
I started mid-BC as Alliance on Gorefiend. I've been watching multiple classic videos regarding leveling, making gold, tips, pvp, etc.
---
I don't own BFA or an active WoW account. 
---
People are still talking about right-click report being an automated system used to grief players. I've only ever been banned for 24 hours for using a homophobic word in a response in a global chat. Thus, I have not been victim to anything beyond that.
---
People who are actually looking for world pvp are not concerned about honor decay. Do you not understand that distinction.
---
Once the in game sound runs out, the Diablo soundtrack. Fuck is it good 
---
Eh. There's line of sight in open world pvp. Getting the hunter close enough to cast on him is much more feasible in certain terrain than others, or at least stalemate it if he doesn't want to commit
---
For druid, the fastest leveling in my experience is feral.
---
When you hit 60, spend the 1g to respec to restoration so you can get into raids.
---
Thanks fo sharing, ish is dope.
---
No, the hierarchy of class balance in vanilla is a house of cards. If they buff classes at the bottom, the entire system is turned on its head and the meta completely changes. Ret is viable in later raids if the player is willing to spend a lot in consumes. Protection paladin is more or less a meme.. but it's okay in dungeons.
---
Just do:   31/whatever/whatever
---
Cause I sure needs me some sweet sweet Boomkin dance moves.
---
You're telling me this has nothing to do with bank alts?
---

So depending on your class duo leveling Doesnt feel that slow. I’m sure a hunter or lock may feel the slow down but a warrior paladin combos going to mutually benefit from grouping. If your wanting to level a warrior I would highly suggest grouping with someone. I’ve leveled a paladin and 2 warriors through vanilla wow. One warrior was solo it was a miserable experience filled with deaths and general noobiness it was my second character. My paladin was duo leveled with my cousins warrior. It was our first classes and we were complete noobs no advice to give from that experience. Our latest time leveling through classic was warrior shaman started at the same time and solo quested to 12 in our starting zones. After that we met up in barrens and began the journey. You can pretty much follow the guides to an extent but you may need more grinding here or there. Honestly If you find your a little to under leveled for the next level back track and do some quest in another zone. I enjoy doing the dwarves second area before going to west fall if I start a human. I enjoy doing silver pine forest even if it’s a bit out of the way for an orc.

Raids will always bring multiple pallies. Don't worry.
---
Oh boy, you're in for a surprise. Remember this comment when this subreddit is absolutely flooded with qq in a year about premades. There is so much wrong with the Classic PvP system. If you're not on the faction with the top premade and you're not willing to spend at least 25 hours a week PvPing, you're going to have a bad time in 60 BGs.
---
The HotW build that you and someone else posted is also suited for that plan and is tankier but it lacks long term healing efficiency.
---
Note that having 20% more intelligence gives you a good *buffer* but factoring manaregeneration, mana pots etc. the 10% more healing has more impact in terms of long term efficiency. It is not a bad build and it definitely has its uses. The primary advantage over other builds is that it allows you to possibly offtank in raids if you have aquired suitable gear for it, which can be great if one of your tanks isn't online.
---
The second build has quite some variations on it, the major one is about choosing Natural Weapons + Omen of Clarity vs. Tranquil Spirit + Swiftmend. Both variations double up as very strong PvP builds as well because there you'll be switching between forms a ton.
---
Druids have so many variations with unique strengths that my head explodes right now. Such a flexible and fun class. I think your plan on running one of the tradeoff builds first and then seeing where it goes is exactly the right approach. With time you'll find out what you enjoy the most and what your friends/guildies need the most so you'll be perfectly suited to answer your question yourself. Have fun!

There are various WoW related rooms in VR Chat if anyone cares. lol
---
Wands
---
&gt; They are shit in pvp 
---
Clearly you've never seen a GOOD reckoning Paladin in pvp. They can shit on any melee class and out last most ranged.
---
Yeah, I was just referring to the joke one.
---
Raziya the Ravager, but he doesn't really upload anything anymore. For hunter PVP you have Traquenuage, and Corossity, who ALSO doesn't really upload anymore either.
---
I agree. ***If*** classes need to be buffed then it's what makes them unique that should be buffed, not just raw numbers. Ret Paladins doing poorly in raids? Improve their buffs or give them a little bit of passive raid healing. They should not be dealing the same dps as pure dps classes.
---
People don't dismiss their pets anymore in raids.
---
You forgot to insert the obligatory Reeeeeeeeee!
---
As a Horde hunter (and later warrior) on Shattered Hand during Nineteen's reign, I can confirm he was universally despised, feared, and respected.  
---
Id say this is more smart than funny. Hunter is a breeze to level and doesn’t scale well into endgame. Is great in MC, however. I plan to level a hunter and alt a warrior, switching to my warrior as my main after BWL comes out.
---
I would post my time on WoW, but everyone would assume I was typing from the beyond the grave.
---
I'm curious: why shouldn't Paladins (or more broadly, any hybrid class) be dealing the same DPS as pure DPS classes?
---
Problem is once you do your rep grind AV is dead. With the old AV at least its still played.
---
Really? Is this confirmed?
---
Twice over the course of WoW's history now, they've done "stat squishes" which have significantly reduced the power of lower-level items so that stats of max level characters and mobs in the modern game wouldn't be so ridiculously inflated. Like, Sulfuras is now 11.5 DPS (down from 80.4) and Corrupted Ashbringer is 11.9 DPS (down from 90).

Eye of flame, I prefer leveling as fire.

a stacking buff/debuff lasting 12 seconds
---
now watch my dps RISE
---
I don’t need to watch the clip to know that’s a monkey going ape shit. I know because I myself am going ape shit.
---
Check 5 times a day everydayy cept for yesterday only checked 3 or 4 times =\
---
Curious as to why that is, as someone who wants to play a warrior for PVE tanking and PVP I was planning on going gnome, would you say human is better overall? 
---
That makes sense. 
---
I’d swap in frost mage for warrior in bgs and say this is perfectly accurate.
---
As a dwarf priest when I got attacked by a hunter I just turned and ran away while they tried to kite, mounted up after a couple of seconds and lol'ed my way back to somewhere not near the hunter.
---
I want to go gnome but at the same time, I'm worried about not being given prio on weps since humans have the racials and I'm still hearing conflicting opinions on how big wep skill is for Tanking and DPS. 
---
WarEnsemble was also ahead of the Horde guilds, forgot about them. So many good names in that screenshot, Rolund and Genetic were both monsters. WarEnsemble also had a beast of a druid, I think it was Elegba, who used to make my life hell in Felwood as we battled over Whipper Root Tubers. Haha
---
oh for sure, but if tbc made ground mounts 200%+ speed vs flying 60%, that might change is what i meant.
---
I just want view distance
---
Many collection quests are worth it in vanilla when multiboxing when you take into account travel time, and the fact that there arent enough quests to get 1-60.
---
You're going to end up grinding mobs anyways, especially after level 40.
---
But troll rogue is best because troll.
---
Their spec is based off of sitting in the floor or waiting for crits.. that’s a shitty and inconsistent play style.
---
They are still trash 
---
cept its a tbc grey
---
I had one of those but hammer spec was so meh.
---
No you guys like to think that but buffing ret to help be existent in dps meters will not do anything bad. 
---
They can even make it so that the buff will only affect pve
---
Because what else were you going to use? 
---
First that's false. All rankers world pvp, but typically they don't go around and grief people's quest NPC's much. Those people that do that, don't care about ranking, don't care about DK's, some of them even chase high DK points, so how is DK's doing anything good for the game?
---
Next, mobs that are actually dishonorable aren't usually even questgivers, they are just random useless NPC's none cares about, and you can see which mobs are DK's and which are not, so it's hardly difficult to grief without getting DK's. 
---
The only thing DK serves to do, is to prevent rankers from participating in things that risk DK's, everyone else can join, but rankers can not. That's a stupid system lets be real. 
---
Answering this from a player who quit in TBC.
---
1. Keep 40 man raids. There was something about requiring that many players at once that fostered a sense of community in guilds and alliances.
---
2. Auto skill learning. In classics, while leveling you had to invest a significant amount of money into your skills, and sometimes forgoe certain skills in favor of buying something from the AH.
---
3. World PVP. In classics, people would fight over certain areas, like SouthShore, Duskwood, etc... and shut it down essentially stopping leveling. I didnt see as much of this once arenas were introduced.
---
4. The leveling experience. For each character you to invest the time to level 1-60. It was a grind for many of those levels, and you had to earn it. Even your alts were very valuable to you since they represented a few months of work before you even started raiding.
---
Because there are more to the game than raids and doing the same DPS. You give them the same dps/sustainable damage as a pure dps they now have MASSIVE more draw to them over a Pure Dps because they still have all their survival tools, heals, and utility. So instead pure dps will get left on the bench and unlike a hybrid they have no way to change to make themselves more appealing. Would you take a warrior or a ret paladin who can do all that melee damage and be immune to damage, effectively instant full heal on emergency, cure poison disease and magic (makes Chromagus a lot easier), and grant others lower threat. 
---
Yeah, actually I am shocked if that is the DPS number (I didn't watch the video) then its shockingly low. A moonkin with a combo of blues and epics can out DPS that. 
---
Thanks for breaking this down! I guess I bought into what I was reading a little too much. I feel much better about my potential end game.
---
That's a pretty good answer. You've convinced me.
---
(I'd still wish Shaman DPS was better but I mostly just like Shaman's).
---
Haha yeah if I wasnt a lazy fuck I'd actually try to argue the point someplace where people would be able to hear it.
---
the problem wasn't "ridiculous inflation" as much as it was that the game's code has a max HP value for mobs, and bosses in Panderia started to hit it. 
---
BG queue from anywhere. Jumping around NPCs while waiting for pop will be fun for first 2h, after that I will start to count those hours in gold I could have made.
---
The realm where I get to kill Kargoz is my first choice, unless I find more friends that will be playing.
---
Didn't this weapon used to have a knock back proc on it?  Or am I just remembering it wrong.
---
I detect a Priest.
---
AFAIK, Fury is a lot more popular in pservers now that people have done the numbers and theorycrafted.
---
I've never really played around at endgame as a Warrior, but conventional wisdom now (don't quote me) is Arms for PvP because Mortal Strike, and Fury for PvE. Not entirely sure what makes Fury better in that regard - more crits? Faster attack speed? But it's the received wisdom.
---
Dude, i cant wait to go see thousand needles again. 
---
I think this time around I want to try for an Ironfoe and a Thunderfury.
---
I would kinda disagree here. Yes you will .ost likely be asked to heal, but having a hybrid offtank/healer in the raid who (provided the player puts in enough effort to play both specs to its potential) can do both is of great value. imagine bosses like Magmadar and Garr - vastly different tank and healing requirements, and on Garr you can even help out heal after your assigned add is dead. and you being Innervate + Brez to the raid, nice perks ;)
---
We're an alliance guild, but if you change your mind and decide to switch let us know! we raid 7-10est T/W/T teamvc.us
---
You say "BWL BIS" and then give yourself a drake fang talisman... Did your guild get lucky and have 15 DFT's drop or do you think you're magically going to get DFT over rogues/warriors?   
---
Not impossible, but perhaps a little unrealistic... 
---
Yes, content release plan is not 1.12. PvP not being out at the start is not 1.12. The argument that this was to be expected is stupid in the first place since we're not going to play 1.12 but rather 1.13. I personally don't care much about the version of AV but to say people who do care want anachronistic changes borders on stupidity.
---
The world would be a better place if people stopped expecting things on reddit. :V Go teach a few more courses in real life, and make the world a better place.
---
I imagine it would take way more time because you're not just grinding to reach a set goal - you're grinding against everyone else whose grinding, competing to be in the top 0.1% of people PvPing in your faction on your server.
---
Of course, once you *get* the rank and all your equipment, you can let yourself go, but that's still absolutely fucking bananas.
---
Yes, they BG on PvE servers but the player pool is lower. The lower the player pool, the worse it is for ranking.
---
However, competitive premades are real on all server types. 
---
Those aren't n00d models. :V
---
Meme specs in order from best to worst in PvE:
---
Feral Druid &gt; Shadow Priest &gt; Ret Paladin &gt; Boomkins aka oomkins &gt; Protection Paladin.
---
I actually love feral bear tanks and dps kitties in dungeons but they're better off as healers in raids. 
---
Most shadow priests that do PvE are only doing it for the gear so they can PvP,  or they really wanted to be a night elf warlock or something.
---
It sounds like a battle that I will look forward to. My main will eventually be an undead warlock named Zeromus. What class for you?
---
How are they an eye sore?
---
Oh no, my eyes: Graphics from 2004 that look fine.
---
Because in vanilla they're not a dps class, 90% of your abilities are for supporting your group and you have access to all of them as any spec. 
---
Going ret allows you to play more offensively, but most of your skills are still based around support.
---
I'm rolling an undead warrior just because of that and because of laintime :&gt;
---
Still really good stats for Druids in PvP right?
---
Frost mages excel in every aspect of the game, whereas warriors are especially powerful in battlegrounds, but weak elsewhere.
---
Fun fact: Horde players never get a recipe for spider legs. So won't you kind and drunken lovable dwarves put the recipe on neutral auction house so me and my Tauren mates can enjoy some delicious spider sausages?
---
Thanks, dwarf bros.
---
Yeah, used to knock back people.  So OP
---
Yeah - PvE servers have premades. When PvP is released in Classic, I'm certain there will be premades on all medium+ pop servers.
---
As some other comments mention, the player pool may be a bit smaller, but there will be interest nonetheless. 
---
(PvE servers have wPvP too - but folks who don't want to join... don't join. You can still flag for PvP on a PvE server.)
---
They already said no stop asking...
---
The addon Questie will show you all available quests on your map.
---
Yup. I had to use the letter i but the dot was longer. I got the name I wanted but eventually I regretted my decision and bowed never to do it again.
---
Except Devilsaur is pre-60 gear... It will make the pre-60 *and* post-60 easier.
---
Stop trying to sell me on Orgrimmar!
---
Yep you’ll be fine.
---
Honestly I think there will be a glut of healers in Classic. Everyone remembers how it was back in the day when no one wanted to heal, so everyone is going to be rolling Dwarf Priests this time around.
---
The point being fiery weapon is better for dps. It has a higher procrate and hits for 40 as opposed to 30.
---
So you would take Leatherworking just to craft Devilsaur for a couple levels?  
---
Seems pointless.  
---
Just buy the two pieces you need when you can afford them and move on with your life.  
---
Devistate got introduced in tbc right? So what was the icon used for in vanilla?
---
Fun game confirmed.
---
my brother and I made test characters on a private server last week. It was so damn fun we ended up playing all weekend. I look forward to continue playing until classic
---
Yes. Warriors are basically the only real viable tanking class and they'r going to absolutely destroy the meters in pre-raid BiS in MC. They're very strong, hence why they've become so popular on private servers.
---
I played resto druid for approx 3 years on private servers. Played all 3 specs at some point in raid environment. Raid wise:
---
- My issue with hotw - I really do minmax when it comes to mana potting on CD and I find not potting equal to slacking kinda. And with potting you dont really go oom, so you are kinda losing +healing for nothing.
---
- 24/0/27 - most common spec, spamming HT r3/r4 (even r2 very late on), awesome tank healing, awesome healing in general, every guild either runs all druid specced into this or all besides 1 that specs swiftmend. I played this a lot but got bored at some point when i started respeccing more often.
---
- Swiftmend spec - defo most fun for me, the downside is that only one in raid should have it and be allowed to rejuv tanks. Its a spec where you can shine so much if you know how to play, but also fail so much if you dont execute it properly.
---
Now to answer you more directly - if you wanna play hotw, bear in mind you are losing cast reduction from not taking 2nd spec or losing swiftmend otherwise. For 5mans id argue swiftmend is best spec by far and once you respec out of it you cant ignore the feeling that you are missing something really big.
---
Hell yeah! As soon as I can run that place I’m going to be living there until I get that gear! :-)
---
How are ret paladins in pvp?  Should I expect to go holy if I want to be competitive?
---
Private servers completely packed with players having a great time would prove otherwise.
---
A human rogue named Scythus or a human warrior named Gershom, so you'll probably crush me in a 1v1 :P
---
If you aren't making them... Who do you expect will?  
---
Cause' all  I see on this subreddit is everyone telling everyone else to *not* craft.
---
2 felcloth = 1 mooncloth every 4 days at a moonwell. stockpile them til Naxx drop and every clothie needs it to finish their tier set. esp PVPers who have taken engineering over tailoring $$$
---
Getting cruel barb made my rogue feel more godlike than any epic I ever got
---
&gt; and the fact that there arent enough quests to get 1-60.
---
That is not a fact since like 1.9, or before.

since when are MC mages doing 1300 dps? Fully world buffed with flask and other consumes an MC mage will do like ~600 dps, mage dps only gets super ridiculous in AQ+ when they start going fire, stacking more and more spelldmg/crit/hit and can ignite stack, etc. 
---
I'm super looking forward to twinking at lvl19 with no Heirlooms. All the planning that went into getting geared without hitting lvl20 and scouring the AH.
---
Nah it's really just people realizing that win or lose zerg rushing the enemy base is the fastest rep, if you lose you queue up and hope you win next time.
---
It had to take a while for the rep grind to become unbearable with week long avs for people to begin coming to this conclusion
---
That's a good point, I'll take the L on this.
---
How dare you point out my incorrect statement while I’m trying to shit post 
---
I looked it up, apparently lifesteal at least on pservers had a scaling with SP which made it better than fiery which did flat.
---
I feel like the issue, for me, will always boil down to player mentality. No amount of nerfs or tuning will stop people from taking the path of least resistance. The base rush will always be the path of least resistance. Doesn't matter how tough the NPCs are, the easiest way to get the honor will always be to focus on the PvE side of things in AV.
---
I think the only way to make AV an actual war, consistently, is either adjust the rewards so the grand ol' zerg war is actually the best way to get honor (maybe make it so there's no diminishing returns, improve honor gain for HKs in AV? I dunno, don't look at me) *or* remove all rewards entirely. No marks, no nothing.
---
Obviously, if you do the latter, there's probably going to be a lot less people doing it - but the people that remain are almost definitely there for the 'fun' of AV and more liable to enjoy fighting the everloving shit out of each other.
---
Exalted actually meant something, now you will get it in a day or two.
---
I hear you buddy. I've never found much use for the "new" button on subreddits until now...
---
But just think about it... Double Warlocks means you own everyone in PvP. :V
---
Not sure you're allowed to post such things here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers) might be what you're looking for.
---
ahh gotcha, like I said I don't frequent this subreddit much, appreciate the heads up I'll remove it if it's not allowed.
---
One of the only reasons I was hyped about classic was 1.5 AV ,the original bloodbath matches that brought the WAR to Warcraft. You will find alot of shills that don't want the old version, most of them are PvErs who could care less, or retail players trying to sabotage the classic experience. 1.12 AV is not the classic experience.
---
There are more pro 1.5 AV folks than 1.12 AV folks, just look at the classic forums and reddit. 
---
Well I can not find the raw data in your link, maybe that could be the reason.
---
I can not da a statistic without raw data...
---
Whirlwind Axe, preferably at level 30.

---
Very little experience on a private server. My friends all tried to get me to play WoW in High School but I just wasn't interested. I've been watching a ton of videos to get myself prepared.
---
\&gt; Most or a lot of people still choose their race mostly based on flavor.
---
\[Confirmed.\]( [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayx2ua/virgin\_dwarf\_fw\_bot\_vs\_chad\_night\_elf\_priest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayx2ua/virgin_dwarf_fw_bot_vs_chad_night_elf_priest/) )
---
Classic is releasing in a couple of months. Realisticly there is no chance they implement the modern models in that time. They would have to plan for this from the start of development because it is an enormous effort to implement such a toggle.
---
On the other hand the Classic Demo already looked way better than the original Client on max settings, I bet most people moaning about graphics didn't look into the Demo.
---
This is, by far, the best example.
---
That offhand is incredible.
---
I also don't think the game gets broken in half by "giving it" to a caster. It's mostly noticeable in MC. Basically because the Staff of Dominance is not really that much better than Azuresong Mageblade + a fist.
---
In BWL, this along side a Claw of Chromaggus is 73 damage, 1 crit, 1 hit, 4 mp5. Pretty significantly inferior to the Staff of Shadow Flame.
---
In AQ, pair this with the Viscidus MH and compare it with the Regalia staff and it's 5 more damage, 1 more crit, 1 less hit...traded for a ton of stats. So you're still really going to want that offhand from Twin Emps.
---
So for the majority of the expansion, the Offhand being fantastic is really not world-ending. In all honesty what's happening is that this offhand is on par with the AV ones and caster weapon itemization left a bunch to be desired.
---
Honestly that's kind of an argument to include the Scepter, if you ask me. There weren't any good caster offhands.
---
You can argue #nochanges and it's not like I don't get where you're coming from, but when this stuff came out it was widely agreed that it was too much effort and the people who could do it would just do BWL instead.
---
Meanwhile, phase 1 is going to have Molten Core which is going to get stomped on. The early parts of the game could really use a difficult way to get alternative pieces of gear in preparation for later tiers.
---
The alternative is to implement a bunch of shit nobody does or uses or cares about well after it could have been interesting. It's not like the #nochanges crowd (like all crowds here) aren't at least half people who couldn't tell the difference anyway.
---
Sounds to me like you wanna play an ally mage. And you worded it really well, a pom pyro classic (nothing as awkward as getting one shot in bg by pom pyro).
---
And afterall - its not set in stone that you cant reroll!
---
Most specs are not optimal in raids and they don't have to be since every class has raid optimal specs and every class is needed, so in terms of raiding there is a good balance. Not every random spec needs to be raid viable.
---
Raiding is all about highly specialized builds where everyone has a very specific job, unlike 5man/PvP/solo content where the classes are played in their full capacity.
---
Also Pallies have it *very* good because their raid spec is also close to PvP optimal which is rare. Many raid specs are viable but suboptimal for PvP and some raid specs straight up suck in PvP.
---
I honestly think some of the sub-optimial specs are horrendous not because of the talents themselves but because there is no setpieces for them. There is nothing for balance druids in the game.
---
Like ZG set piece for druids is all plus healing but the 5 piece bonus is starfire? Like who designed that. 
---
&gt; requires level 64
---
Classic TBC confirmed
---
Haven't touched him since vanilla.
---
If I'am not going to use it at lvl 60 I'am not seeking it out or go out of my way to get them.
---
Lol you think a server of 3000+ people is not going to take Leatherworking just because a couple people on reddit said not to?  
---
There will be people out there who take Leatherworking so you don't have to.  
---
We're not too worried about PvP scenarios, but good point!
---
Nah bro. Explosive traps as a rogue duh.  
---
&gt;Playing through this again right now!
---
How/Where were you able to find it to play? 
---
You mgiht be surprised... Bur sure, whatever floats your boat. :V
---
Lol you say that smug like I'm wrong and you're right
---
When people talk about hating redditors it's this thing they're talking about. 
---
We are gonna go fucking apeshit
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
That's so cool! My mind got blown by the fact that I too have a character that is older than I was when I made him. Strange... 
---
From what I remember it is 32.
---
No, that's a terrible idea
---
Mobile.
---
&gt; why wouldn't you main a class thats a bit harder to level the first go around, then come back for the easy run the second time around?
---
To make money
---
Follow your heart. 
---
And beat your friend on all the damage meters.
---
(Also worth noting that -- if you both play warlock -- you can share the cost of the epic mount quest when DM is released. Most of the cash you spend on the Warlock mount quest is on summoning mats you can re-use. So split the cost and use them twice.)
---
Wouldn't it be easier to roll rp server and have this band of ppl turn on pvp in contested zones?
---
Arenas
---
Dungeon Journal
---
all the pve gear was good for pvp before resilience, t3 being the best even vs r12/13 gear
---
Difference is that SPriests with Shadowweaving make up for their lack of personal DPS plus some if you have 4+ Warlocks. Warlocks (like Mages) really start to pick up on DPS in the endgame raids.
---
1.12 AV with 1.12 patch? This is madness! /sarcasm
---
Was just about to say diablo 2 soundtrack 
---
Find a guild with friendly people in it and join; it makes a world of difference.  You'll still have social interactions with other people out in the world, but having that core group of friendly helpful folk makes everything that much better.
---
1. Open Noggit
---
2. Select a map on the left side by clicking once.
---
3. Double-click on the mini-map on right side for the area you want to view.
---
4. Wait, as it takes time to load.
---
5. Press "M" to remove minimap.
---
5. Press "U" to toggle tile mode (ie. 2d mode).
---
6. Click on the left button for "AreaID Paint"
---
You should now have a 2d representation with sub-areas painted. You may want to test different settings in the View Menu to toggle on/off different things.
---
No it's not. DPS are very easy/fast to find. Healers not.
---
&gt;with potting you dont really go oom, so you are kinda losing +healing for nothing
---
The idea is you are giving up efficiency for more capacity, so that means you have room for a few more inefficient heals you otherwise could not afford.
---
Still, it rectifies basically all of BC's problems. PvP and PvE segregation, Dead World PvP due to flying Mounts, homogenization of the factions.
---
The raids would of course be better by having more interesting encounters. I said Naxx difficulty to have some sort of understanding how difficult they should be. As far as I care the newer raids could be more difficult than Naxx.
---
New talent points and abilities were not a good thing in my eyes. The talent trees were designed with level 60 in mind. adding 10 levels + 10 new talent points each expansion made the talent system obsolete and blizz had to switch to a different, more simple system.
---
Questing can be a lot of fun without leveling if the rewards are worthwile and the difficulty is high enough.
---
I'm not saying it would be better than TBC. We have never actually seen such an expansion play out. We could only speculate how it would fare. Overall, BC went in the wrong direction from a lot of design standpoints. Vertical leveling has massive flaws and those have shown over the years. It's not just Blizzards design metality to cater towards casuals that killed the game. Vertical progression had a big part to play in because the game was basically reset every two years and most progress was undone.
---
They're all in denial and trying their damn best to convince themselves  and everyone else that Druids aren't trash to play. 
---
Tunic of westfall and triprunners for druid/hunter/rogue, they are so easy to obtain and you  don't replace them for like 15/20 levels.
---
Yo for all 30% of you delusional people who think you're gonna ding 60 in under a month. The average /played to 60 on private servers is 10.5 days played and for retail vanilla it was closer to 20 days played.
---
That means if you were leveling at a good pace and wanted to ding 60 in under a month you'd have to play for at least 9 hours a day every day.
---
Most numbers on druids is skewed.  All dps meters can’t differentiate Between feral cat feral ot and boomkin.   And depending on how you value the crit aura he brings you get higher.  I have seen estimates between 80-90%. Never 50%.  
---
Part off all crit delta damage should be added to the boomkin dps Count as his aura is responsible for it.  
---
Still they are weaker.  
---
exploration isnt going anywhere
---
How are add-ons going to work?
---
will there be some available pre-launch?
---
this is just not true
---
For instance the Darkmantle (rogue) 4 piece set was incredibly good and competitive with equivalent BWL/AQ40 gear. 
---
This probably representative of the first character people will roll... They'll give up... Betting half the folks who answered didn't level a druid it vanilla.
---
I mained Troll priest and did love playing as a troll but I have to admit I kinda got tired of the hunchback, tusks and ears breaking most helms and the fact that just like the Tauren, you didn't have shoes. It was kinda lame as no matter how epic looking set you had you were still always barefoot. I think there's been some shoes in the retail that actually cover their feet and it took this long to get Zandalari allied race with their straight backs.
---
Later on in tbc I rolled a belf paladin and liked that class better but since there won't be horde paladins in classic I'm also probably going to roll either Orc warrior/shaman or Undead mage/rogue.
---
I mostly mean for me personally, there's not much left I haven't seen
---
Came here to write this 👍🏻
---
Thanks for confirming that I wasn't going crazy! lol
---
For real!
---
I read somewhere that rogues are way weaker relative to other classes in 1.12 because of item and talent changes.
---
Can you confirm/deny this?
---
&gt; Yep- that isn't how the site was (hopefully) designed but it is how people treat it.
---
It wasn't. Basically all subs try to remind people that downvoting isn't for disagreement and you should reply instead. Downvoting is for off-topic posts so they can be dropped down but of course that doesn't stop people from using it to downvote. Just the way human psyche works.
---
Bags for sure, cloth, silk, ore, profession trainers, flight paths, easy xp. Gearwise always seeking precious rings or helms.
---
The thrash blade; raiding MC with thrash blade, rogue sword spec, hand of justice and windfury is heaven for me.
---
When I'am entering a dungeon as a Druid I'am either healing or tanking most of the time because that is what is required and hard to find.
---
I tell people beforehand on what I roll on and almost noone ever complained. I think your ruleset is highly flawed, because there will almost always be multiple people rolling on the same items anyways. Your Warrior tank will roll on the same weapons and even armor as your Rogue. Your Healing Priest will roll on the same gear as your Mage sometimes.
---
The role of a group member has absolutley nothing to do with what they can or should roll need on.
---
People have forgotten how boring Paladin in vannila was.
---
Why does it matter on a pve server?
---
Damn bro o_0
---
Lol. You got rekt son
---
They're a bit trash as pvp choice though.
---
I'm not the only one who laughed my ass off about how casually he stated that then? Lol. I remember there were like 2 on the whole server.
---
Horrifying. Poor monkey.
---
Subscribed - create more content! Awesome stuff though really! It brought back so many memories!
---
You play to bubblehearth you cheap bastards.
---
This. Personally I'd wait til you're sleeping with the guild master, really lock it in before you declare for ret. 
---
IRL in general.
---
Maps: \*\*0\*\*
---
Besides SM you can also pickpocket the upper part of The Ring of Law in BRD. Should be more gold/hour than SM I think.
---
Besides that maybe you can go with a healer and tank to do DME jump runs. 
---
There's also the tried and true profession gold making.
---
Warlock it is for you.
---
Compared to the standards of today they're an eyesore. If you'd read the entire reply. Thankyou
---
Vanilla
---
The mace dropped in molten core 
---
Ok we can maybe find exceptions and look at some of the boni/pieces in isolation.
---
But in general the 0.5 sets had stats and boni all over the place and a general lack of raiding specialized bonuses. For healers specifically the sets were unusable. And I'am not a Rogue expert but I *guess* you'll  have a hard time integrating the Darkmantle 4 piece w/o having very specific gear around it.
---
Damn!
---
Are Rogues specifically better at DM:E Jump runs though?
---
I'm looking for specific things Rogues can do, that most classes can't. Another example might be stealth-ing to rich Thorium veins... but you can get a whole lot more of those if you just do jump runs.
---
The committee putting Patchwerk and Thaddius in the same region is rough. Both of those dudes are straight heavyweights and would have met in the finals.
---
Tsktsk.
---
No changes! Except these changes, they're OK.
---
Sharding for the first two weeks is fine, but any longer ruins it.
---
I really do like the old +crit chance instead of a stupid meaningless rating like live. 
---
Even sharing just for the initial zones would work. Once you get an option where to go I’m fine with it off. 
---
It's not bad, 19 STR and 2% crit are both great stats.
---
While I agree with what you're saying, that last bit bothers me. If the meme spec is playing as optimally as they can, bringing the consumables, properly executing mechanics, utilizing their utility (aka not tunneling dps as ret when they could throw a clutch heal), is it really a carry? I feel like an average warrior/mage/rogue is being carried harder than a dedicated meme spec.
---
Rogues aren't particularly needed for DME. It's just if you have friends or guildies you want to hang with then you can do that.
---
Stealth mining the Dark Iron in BRD and the entrance areas of MC is a thing. You just have to be careful. Some of the ore spawns aren't possible to get to without aggroing a pack. The Dark iron itself won't be super profitable itself. (Combine with pickpocketing the Ring before you reset). 
---
The Dark Iron will sell more during fresh server progression when ppl need fire resist gear and the Nightfall axe.
---
Zum'Rahs Vexing Cane from ZF is huge for casters at like lvl ~45. Ill be going Rogue this time and rly want a Gut Ripper tbh!
---
He’s talking about Grey item
---
Many private servers operate on different rules and interpreted guesswork of what vanilla was like - or in some cases, simply don't have the means to properly emulate it. What this leads to is people who act like they played WoW back in 2005 because they played on a private server, and using the experience from there as gospel for how scripts and mechanics must have acted in retail vanilla.
---
Information from private servers can't be treated as credible sources, and must not be used as a reference point. That's why their mentions aren't taken seriously.
---
Nah, dawg, on the internet there is only one truth. :V Never believe 99% of the things you see on reddit.
---
Yea i went hammer spec on my last warrior using the judges gavel. It was fun when it proc’ed but it was miserable otherwise 
---
It's a survey, son. :V Nobody is buttrekting the other.
---
The blizcon client was based on 7.3.5 -- and devs confirmed that 7.3.5 will be the 'base' they build on. 
---
So we assume addons will operate similar to retail (but we don't have confirmation yet).
---
If there is a open/closed beta before launch -- that *likely* means we will have addons at launch. Because addon devs will have time to develop/test.
---
To address your point about KT, i have to agree with the size. I dont play retail but i saw a map of current WoW and its just ridiculous. Massive fuckin islands just everywhere in the middle now lol. 
---
as long as you live in a country with laws in it, it doesn't matter whether you believe in them or not.
---
As for loosing anything. The moment blizzard has their own classic servers going you have the legal foundation to press charges against private servers even in the dubious eastern European regions.
---
Knowing Activision's greed - you can be sure that is coming as well.
---
Sharding is a requirement for the 1-15 zones to avoid waiting ages for mob/item spawns and only for the initial few weeks when everyone is jumping in. Past that, there's no reason to shard due given that we won't have the same number of realms that retail does. 
---
Sharding in the initial zones I'm fine with. I was there for the original release of vanilla and it was an absolute disaster. I have no desire to experience that again. 
---
Sharding past that I'm not ok with. But Blizzard have said it's for initial zones only at launch, and I trust them on that. 
---
Thanks! This was made in Maya :)
---
Thrall himself tells you in classic that warlocks are still accepted in their ranks, but he is highly suspicious of them, and they can only live in the drag.
---
Hahaha. I thought of ironforge first, but from outside it's basically a mountain with a door lol
---
Shaman tank here.
---
Reckoning + SoC &amp; 2H spec is pretty good -- but expect to spend a lot on Engineering. Holy is also *really* good, and you can sneak in HKs using HoW and Holy Shock. If you're in premades and you want to feel like you're a high level contributor -- be Holy until you get some decent gear, then go ret hybrid.
---
I know the saying is "Every weapon is a hunter's weapon", but what class can equip the most gear?
---
It looks like Warrior can equip pretty much everything but wands. 
---
Also what about mount restrictions? Is it true that Tauren can't ride a bunch of stuff because their sheer weight? 
---
I dont mind having a few meme specs in guild if theyre dedicated. Thing is if im a warrior for ex, 0 chance i wont be pissed losing out on a big time weapon to a ret pally. 
---
Loot is really where people would probably be annoyed, because objectively giving Askandi to a ret is an utter waste.
---
So you say there's no difference on RP and RP-PvP but you quit a RP-PvP realm because it's differences didn't suit you?
---
I think it needs to be 1 - 20ish zones.
---
So, including Barrens and Westfall.
---
Love these surveys, thanks for the good work! just a tip, if I may: this is not the proper visualization technique to display the data - better use stacked bar charts to show conditional distributions.
---
Keep in mind you don't just pickpocket in solo content. If you are doing group content such as Dungeon farm runs you'll be constantly doing it plus you'll open chests/doors for free (as opposed to engineers).
---
Just be opportunistic about it, do it all the time whenever you can, especially while leveling to keep up your skill and buy bags/slots/mount faster.
---
On top of that you have spammable stealth which can get you to places other's can't w/o groups. Use that to get to high value gathering materials for example in dungeons and elite areas. The only other class who can do that as well are Druids and in some cases a skilled Hunter can do it with FD shenanigans. So it is a pretty exclusive trait too.
---
I meant more like if you are dedicated enough and put in the time then there will be at least one guild having no problem inviting you and accepting you in their raid squad. 
---
I have raided in multiple guilds, including one hardcore raiding guild, and all of them accepted a ret in their main raiding squad. But of course, that ret player was no casual. He had to put in extra time and energy to have insane amounts of potions and buffs for every raid in order to do decent damage. 
---
Most guilds will not allow Arms in their raids. Arms is an absolute no-no for late vanilla for the following reasons:
---
1. Mortal strike debuff takes up a valuable debuff slot on boss, Thus lowering total raid DPS.
---
2. Arms is overall simply worse than fury in patch 1.12.1. Before 1.6 Arms was the commonly used spec by warriors in raids, both tanks and DPS but from 1.6 onwards its fury (and prot) all the way.
---
Warrior/Hunter can equip the most stuff. Warriors care a lot about top-end damage on weaps -- so for some levels staves are actually *really* good for dps. 
---
And yeah, some mounts have race restrictions.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18772/swift-green-mechanostrider
---
Like mechanostriders from the trainer are Dwarf+Gnome only. Skeletal Warhorse &amp; Raptors are Orc/Undead/Troll only. 
---
The RP might be about heavyness, or something -- but in reality I'd guess Blizzard just had problems making the tauren models ride on the other mounts. Taurens were also planned to have https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsrunning (which ended up not happening).
---
Laintime?
---
What's the difference? Thought Critical strike rating increased your crit chance on retail?. 
---
Also doing the math that's 12.6% of Horde Warriors going Undead.
---
Rogues have pickpocketing, lock openening and a huge advantage when farming anything by going to the nod in steath and not pulling and having to kill a milion mobs. Sure its slower but still Rogue is opportunistic lie and wait class. 
---
The warriors talents went thru absolutely huge changes from patch 1.0 (release) to 1.12.1 (Naxx). In early vanilla before BWL, fury was garbage because Bloodthrist worked like victory rush in later exansions (only usable upon killing-blows) and Prot tree didnt even have shieldslam at their 31 point talent.
---
tldr: Arms was the only viable spec for both dps and tanking prior to BWL.
---
For the love of Metzen all you undead mages please consider rolling troll instead of yet other blue haired zombie mage.

Members will be expected to be helpful where possible and respectful to the rest of the guild, if we all work together we will be able to achieve much more, much quicker. 
---
We believe faction pride and PvP is an important part of Vanilla. As well as our achievements as a guild &lt;Earthsinger&gt; will strive to work with other horde guilds to secure faction dominance on the server. A friendly relationship between active Horde guilds on the OCE-PvP server will ensure we have a healthy and thriving community.

---
You can tank all 5mans and UBRS as arms, no problem. You can also offtank all content (including Naxx) as arms. That being said, Mortal Strike debuff makes you impossible to bring to any "serious" raids.
---
Arms debuff is a big no-no in raids. That being said, PUGs may not be as picky who they bring.
---
You want consecration to tank with. Start with this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVz)
---
Then get this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVhdh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVhdh)
---
Key talents are consecration and improved righteous fury. Once you have those you will be a great tank for 5 mans. Use seal of righteousness ofc. I wouldn't tank in full ret spec, that's a good way to propagate the stigma of paladins being terrible tanks.
---
After those you could go deep prot or deep holy depending on if you want better healing or better ability to tank. I would still use a 2 hander for solo play unless you go deep prot.
---
I shit you not this was me last night, my fiancée was telling me what she bought for our 9 month baby boy and in my head was “Priest or Warlock...” 
---
Aaaaahhh, yeah, that would definitely do it.
---
Your main problem tanking early and especially in ret spec is keeping treath on multiple mobs not staying alive. Go for str gear and might be better to level to consecration as early as possible if you want to do early tanking makes your life as a tank alot easyier
---
So compared to a Hunter, a Warrior can equip plate armor and wield maces, right?
---
Human is BIS race for warrior for pve by far. Gnome out performs human in pvp but not by much. Human has the detection ability, which is great in bgs but pretty useless in world pvp. Gnome has escape artist and a low profile which is great for PVP. but as a war you are gonna be chugging free action potions regardless, so human wins IMO.
---
10 to 20
---
TO 40 hello
---
Its a massive difference
---
Up to 4x
---
Huh. I'll have to give that a try! 
---
Rank13/14 is the worst grind ever in all of world of warcraft. All expansions. Period. It is absolutely mentally insane. And competition will be more fierce this time around. A friend of mine who did Rank14 on a private server using the vanilla PvP honor system had to play approximately 15 hours/day for 3 months straight to get Rank14. He was a warrior and played mostly in premade groups. He claimed it would also have been possible to gain rank14 but playing about 10-12 hours/day for 6 months instead. 
---
The thing about ranking is you gotta beat the 20% decay (which is insane once you go above Rank12) basically you'll need 500 to a million honor per week to both beat the decay and to increase in standings.
---
Yeah, I think Consecration into Redoubt and further on into tank specc seems better if I fancy tanking while leveling. I guess 3% hit chance with wep talent will do alot when it come to leveling compared to the retribution talents early. 
---
most of the classic community didnt play classic and just played private servers. Look at all the top classic wow streamers/youtubers, I cant think of one of them that played anything besides 1.12 classic. They are mostly private server people. joana is the only one i know of that for sure played before 1.12
---
Its bis early technically
---
Hi, /u/dngrs
---
Just shows how skewed the playerbase here is. No fucking way is there going to be nearly same number of human warriors and paladins.
---
Yup, Warriors can do Hunter weaps + Maces &amp; 'Thrown' (like throwing daggers). And also Plate.
---
low level kills in Stv
---
Basically any contested zones should have it off imo. 
---
I'm not "speaking for everyone", don't put words in my mouth.
---
How many people have you seen reminisce about vanilla AV and how it was soooo much like the modern zergfest it is today? Most reminiscing about AV revolves around older mechanics and far, far longer matches.
---
I'm simply pointing out that for a very sizely chunk of vanilla fans the definitive version of AV was not the final version. We can debate until we're blue in the face how much the meta has changed and whether or not you can realistically go back to those long ass matches, the fact is people salty about 1.12 AV--and there are A LOT of them as you can objectively see--disagree that it's "the most complete" version, let alone the definitive version.
---
There should be a gear based matchmaker
---
Why punish random low gear 60s pitting them vs r14 premade?
---
Loads of servers will have guilds from private servers. Its classic, a LOT of players are now fully experienced in all of the content. Compared to vanilal when nobody knew anything.
---
But if you think about the classes which have different roles/specs (tank/dps/heal)
---
Priests dps and healing specs are viable for raids
---
Warriors tanking and dps specs are viable for raids
---
Why can’t Paladins, Druid and Shamans dps/tanking/specs be viable for raids? (Ignore tanking spec for shamans obviously)
---
Like damn, atleast make 2 specs viable for raiding
---
Don’t give me that hybrid tax bullshit because that doesn’t explain why warriors and priests get to have two roles in raids when a hybrid class has only 1 viable role.
---
Furthermore, being in meme raids is not a satisfactory answer

T1 is the coolest priest set
---
And more hardcore does less than 4 hour raids too. But because of another reasons ;)
---
This guy got way to many time tbh, lol
---
It feels impactful and artificial. Getting 87 crit rating doesn't mean anything to the average player. But everyone can understand 1% crit.
---
You know that the original wow was sub based, long before ‘actigreedsion’?
---
Would still be faster to ignore terrain. Also, you could just afk while flying in a straight line instead of having to make turns and avoid trees and mobs.
---
I personally think it would stand a better chance of appealing to a wider pool of vanilla fans if it would capture the most memorable, iconic versions of content where possible. I'm not convinced that a 1.12 snapshot of the tail end of vanilla is the most "complete" or "authentic" experience. It's just the easiest, which to be fair is probably the most pragmatic path. I just don't agree that it's the most authentic, iconic path.
---
It'll still be authentic and fun and great, I just think it could be slightly better. c:
---
Now this is epic
---
We did this too, the best part is - all pets on a clother and watching him trying to do something.
---
Honestly, I just wish the minelayers were still in. They were the best part of AV.
---
Troll mage FeelsBadMan Is there any reason to pick undead over it for PvE?
---
I can only speak from the perspective of a resto druid but basically:
---
1. Dungeons are super easy to heal. You'll be healing the tank most of the time if the tank is skilled at keeping aggro.
---
2. Raids arent that bad either. "whack-a-mole" is a correct description (as diabloman8890 put it). And you'll quite often have healing assignments done by a healing officer meaning a few of the healers will focus on one or several of the tanks.
---
What? I have to wait til level 40 to get a mount?  Good thing that'll only take a couple of hours. 
---
-retail tourists probably 
---
Short answer is: It depends on your guild. Some guilds will be flexible-- with plenty of DPS Warriors (or alts) to OT/MT older raids.
---
Classic has lots of 'carrots on a stick'. Once you have Thunderfury (as one example), you may be able to sit out and let someone elses alt (or a dps warrior) main tank the MC runs.
---
What if they pick wrong?
---
&gt;instant grarification rewards
---
Exalted AV can take from 30-50 hours of playing on a AV BG weekend with extra rep. If thats INSTANT...
---
Good thing they arent soulbound so I can sell the old ones
---
Guess that isn't Freewind Post either, cause there isn't a point to climb on in the south-east of Thousand Needles (as far as I know).
---
As stated earlier druids are viable in raids as tank and they can do reasonably well as mele dps
---
I used to farm Arcane Crystals in the bug tunnels in Silithus

## North American Classic Prelaunch Server Group for Questing, Dungeons, and Healthy Server Pop
---
📷
---
The goal for the group is to make sure players have leveling groups for questing, dungeons, and battlegrounds.  We also want to jump start the server economy, and make sure that which ever server we join it ends up being a high population with a great faction balance.  
---
It is critical that we make up a good chunk of the server population.  When i started playing World of Warcraft many years ago I was lucky to join a great server with an even faction balance with high population.  I was lucky. I started to play in vanilla, and the server did not unbalance till Mists of Pandaria.  The launch of Vanilla World of Warcraft servers is going to be chaotic.  We can expect vanilla servers to spike in population at launch, then dip greatly after a couple of months.  If we can ensure we have a great  chunk of the players on the server together we can **help ensure that players have a great time and form lasting connections, thus saving our server from population collapse**.
---
This group also offers peace of mind for players who invite their friends to the group.  Though I started WoW on a great server, **all of my real life friends started on different servers.  This left me playing alone most of the time.**  I would find a good guild now and again, but great times in a guild were made when you are in with a group of friends.  If you invite all of your friends to this server, and they invite theirs, and so on, we can make sure that **all of our friends will be with us for this great WoW adventure**.  This way when it comes time to start playing Classic World of Warcraft all of your friends will know they can just check this group to find which server to join to find you, or if you start playing later you will know which server to join to find your friends who started before you.
---
I need to clarify that **this group is not a guild**, nor will everyone in this group be joining the same faction.  This is much larger then a guild.  Though this group will host a guild for players if they wish to join. **We do intend to join an American PVP server** in the American Central timezone.  This give most players better shot at playing closer to the own time no matter where in America they live.
---
I hope that you will consider joining my group.  I am working hard to make sure this is the best shot anyone has for an amazing Classic World of Warcraft experience.  **You don't need to do anything in this group but join, and remember to check it when you get ready to play Classic WoW**.  I hope you would take the step to invite your friends to.
---
Our target goal is 2000 players.  We have **over 250 players spread between Discord and the Battlenet social tab** on the Battlenet launcher. 250/2000

**Additional information about classic WoW launch**
---
Classic Won't be free, but will be lumped into the regular WoW subscription. So if you pay for one you get the other.
---
Classic is expected to launch this summer. I heard June so I am saying June
---
Classic Patch content will come out in phases. Last we heard was Class balancing was going to be based on patch 1.12 drums of war
---
Engineering is 110% absolutely mandatory as a warrior raid tank.
---
Relationship goals
---
i recently tried to level without any quest addons in unfamiliar Faction ( leveled night elf druid ) in an unfamiliar zone ( Darkshore )
---
i have to say.. leveling untill ashenvale without addons made me engage more into the story.
---
but to answer your question. Questie is the most famous one.
---
I do. Stop acting like you speak for every one. 
---
Just one char, not even a bank ?
---
In dme u cant solo for thorium
---
Iirc you gotta kill boss to open the exit where the veins are
---
It will release on July 16th
---
My bad but my point for shamans and Oakley’s still stand
---
Any video guides for stealth mining?
---
But wouldn't you be just as pissed losing it to an auto attacking warrior?
---
If we dont count the 1% drop epix, Maraudon princess ring is pretty damn good for the level. For horde hinterlands epic area trinket. DME Satyr bow. 
---
Peak stealth farm being in nax for frost runes but u get id locked so not good as a main if u plan to raid nax
---
It sure is the priestiest looking set
---
We already have one hybrid clas topping meters in dps and doing the best tanking in the game ppl should stop saying hybrids when they mean support/healing classes
---
Right? Like, if as a pally I try to enter the group as dps and you need me to tank or heal, I'll do it but you got me fucked up if me conforming to what the party needs is going to rule me out of ret gear.
---
Pve realms love bgs
---
especially as horde u get very quick queues
---
No
---
Don't know of any videos, but here is a link to a map of where the Dark Iron spawns are inside MC and BRD. If its not showing on the BRD make sure to change floor to the Detention Block.

---
october 2017 (announce of classic) until october 2018 (summer 2019 release date) went by relatively fast
---
october 2018 - february 2019 went by relatively fast
---
but fuck me...the past 6 weeks with all these rapid fire updates have got me F5ing like a mad man and now im impatient 
---
im having a cartman moment...need to find butters and get him to freeze me for a few months.
---
For 40m raids, you need to run them all. Unless the guild has a massive roster of additional ppl. 20man raids are usually considered "optional" to do twice a week (after reputation gear). So most likely you are doing those \~once per week. PPl that need enchants can pug or do guild alt/main runs on offdays.
---
Id say for a higher end guild you will do 3 raids in one night and 20mans+ony on the 2nd. At naxx progress level you are going to drop MC, 20mans and ony off the list.
---
Sharding for the starting zone (as stated by bliz) is ok. Sharding for the rest of the world no.
---
It would at least be very close to me quitting if the world is sharded.
---
nice *TBC* footage you have there, completely unrelated to classic. 
---
Dishonor
---
The exile does not choose his babylon.
---
Alltho The clickbait is not 100% false. Rooster has been playing on almost every Vanilla private server and will go Ham in classic this summer.
---
Just letting you know, you dont want to meet this man on the battlefield.
---
For me it's just not wanting to be a little gnome, I'd take the human.
---
Rating scales with level.
---
A tooltip add-on would fix his issue.
---
You can also pickpocket all them pigs in the Razorfen Downs if you want to do absolute braindead farming.
---
Sharding for the first two zones is alright. Beside form redridge gangs you wont see much pvp anyway and even redridge will be a save zone in the first few weeks. From level 20 onwords it's a no go.
---
Holy pvp is too good to pass
---
Pocket a good warrior and you do a lot
---
The Arcanite one?
---
Yeah tank as arms and collect ur heroism set for pvp
---
One day maybe upgrade it
---
I know that there are recipes as quest rewards while leveling. Are there any that you’d lose and be sad you couldn’t get back? Or are they all lower level (or otherwise inconsequential)?
---
I mean, I totally forgot that Tauren Hunter was a thing which kind of proves your point..
---
I personally rather play a character I want to look at for the next few years instead of CharOp so I'm kind of on your boat here
---
it was a knockdown effect, similar to what a few mobs do  
---
it made you literally fall on your butt for one sec, it wasn't even on the same DR as any other stun  
---
OP as hell, got nerfed eventually, because fun detected 
---
Triprunners are also very good for warriors from 30-40 when you hopefully get scarlet pants. The 18agi translates to 36 armor which makes them have only like 20armor less than mail contenders. 
---
The 18agi also translates to 1 1/2crit and 1 1/2 dodge, so they are marvelous for warriors too!
---
For a dead guy... He sure has a nice chin.
---
Bonus perk priests make good money through dme lasher farm
---
(mace)  
---
it was the most op thing ever once Nether Vortexes were available
---
Addons do most of the work
---
You just gotta spam mana pots
---
2 potential healbots
---
Warrior it is
---
Wait what rocket boots in vanilla
---
U can make an alchemy alt
---
Only needs lv 35 
---
Carrot on a Stick. That 3% speed buff was always my first trinket, and it was good enough to make people go out of their way for the Mallet of Zul'Farrak.
---
It will also ruin half the game because you won‘t have to read quest texts anymore and will have a huge arrow in your screen pointing to where you need to go (my opinion). 
---
Personally I will play Classic without Questie for this reason. It will make questing a bit more difficult but I think it will be more fun. If I really need help finding something I‘m gonna ask in the chat or make a Google search. 
---
There is s macro that rotates mining and herbalism
---
Its on ownedcore forums iirc
---
The autoattacking warrior will be cut off the raid sooner or later. A fully buffed paladin doing the damage of the autoattacking warrior will not, because he does everything right except the class obviously, therefore he will remain and soak up gear. 
---
The last straw is PvP 2handers, because a ret will then go to BGs and bother everyone in a more competitive environment with his nondamage with Ashkandi.
---
Every ret joining a BG and losing can chalk up the loss on him giving himself BoF and not the warrior next to him. 
---
Go Alliance. Gnome Warlock is S Tier
---
Rogue tier is not essy to get tho
---
&gt;When people know that private servers are in fact stolen intellectual property yet they still support them, and pay them What does this make of those users? What does the law say about buying stolen goods from a fence in your country? In mine its still a crime even if I were not aware that the goods are stolen.
---
Lets get something straight right now. Without private servers, blizzard would have NEVER launched Classic. And, you as a user, are fully without fault here. Its example 100% legal, for you to watch pirated tv-show off youtube. Its youtube thats liable, not the person using the service. Doesnt mean dick if you dont or do know its pirated or not. Its still legal.
---
Druid?
---
True, but remember that after level 22, a rogue can disengage a fight by vanishing.  
---
Also, they are not that much gear dependent: you can find on the web some video of a rogue dueling without stuff and the leather-working dagger.    
---
Yeah but waiting 64 levels is painful
---
Is aq20 hard too? I always stopped raiding past zg
---
What if you play rogue just to get tier2 then just pvp?
---
You wont get scarab lord unless you are the leader/Officer of one of the 2-3 best guilds of the server.
---
If you roll on a PVE server and want to do BG (assuming cross realm will not be a thing), do yourself a favor and roll horde, you will enjoy instant BG pop.
---
Thank you mr
---
How did I miss the wiki lmao
---
I feel you bro, sometimes it's just refreshing for a new change in scenery and themes. After being horde for years on retail, and horde starting on pservers. I made a dwarf Hunter and am having the most fun of my entire wow career.
---
&gt; I discovered when you charged while falling he would flap his arms above his head wildly during charge. This was my favourite thing in the game at that time. 
---
True Dwarf.
---

---
Questing is faster than grinding when there are quests to do. There are times (like in the mid 40s) where grinding is kind of mandatory. I like to grind a bit in the late 20s and 30s too (because paladin + exo).
---
If you'd *rather* grind than quest, I do think it's a good idea to hit Honored with at least SW or IF. For the reasons you mention-- it's cheaper. If you'd *rather* quest than grind -- then no worries, do that. But remember that Tanaris has Ogres, Wetlands has drakes, Desolace has undead &amp; Arathi has syndicate. :)
---
Woke af also means less hunters. In Classic we'll see way more of them...
---
Yeah, that's the misconception. You will have the fantasy of laying down the pain... and then you crit for 700 hopefully and the opponent will just walk away from you. 
---
Retpaladins rarely do any damage. Even less in classic with /sit crits being disabled. 
---
That's a good point on the Draenei immortality, I agree with you on that.
---
I was mainly talking about the 5 heroes from Warcraft 2. Here is an excerpt from wowpedia on the Sons of Lothar final stand: 
---
"On Draenor, Turalyon and Khadgar agreed to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side. Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival."
---
I've always felt that they would of been caught in the destruction of draenor. That being said a pocket of unnamed soldier from the expedition could of gotten lucky and hid in caves away from the destruction giving rise to new characters introduced in WoW. The Alliance also had Night elves who went along with Maeiv to hunt down Illidan in Outland and the broken Draenei.
---
You need to have a WoW-account so technically you'll have to have bought the game at some point in time.
---
Free-2-play always turns into pay-2-win. Its never a good idea.
---
In vanilla you could only track 1 resource at a time. We will have to see if it is the same in classic (my assumption is that yes, it will).
---
Even if the grass is greener, I wouldn't be. I can't live with that decision.
---
You would hope but I know people irl who just can't understand the concept of percentages. Some conversations are hilarious 🤣
---
The average hunter player I guess haha
---
What about a 0/26/25 retreckoning or 25/26/0 holyreckoning that bring blessing of sanctuary, nightfall and do not need on warrior loot? Indeed, as a nightfall bot you don’t really need dps offset and will be fine with T1/T2 that the paladin do not really need as they will prefer lether/mail stuff with a lot of +heal.
---
I think that in that state of mind, you can be accepted in raid as you will bring great blessing, assist dommage with nightfall and won’t pick loot from pure dps.
---
Tell me your thaught :)
---
They may look massive, but in reality, the zones aren't too large to run around in
---
You just made me realize that when I made my first character back in early 2006 I was 12, soon to be 13. I'm currently 25, soon to be 26. 
---
Which starter zones are the easiest for each faction? And is it worth it to run from a harder zone to an easier one if you choose a race with a more difficult area and are a weaker early class?
---
Is that thing covered in tape? So it's basically ruined?
---
Lol what
---
1-10 is okay for me.
---
You can try devilsaur farming with skinning, the skins sell very well on pservers and should be a good farm for classic too. Rogues fit into the pvp environment and stealth helps a lot too with contesting enemies.
---
Watching some yt-videos of surface people playing Witcher 3 I'd not get my hopes high.
---
They need to play on lowest and even cut the resolution down to get unacceptable framerates.
---
Not talking 30 but 10-15.
---
The I7 seems to do a tad better but still not an option in my book
---
go down through this chain thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4u4hv/moneygearing_optimization_pick_gathering_and_buy/ej9c6on/
---
good farming is braindead for everyone
---
- Sapper charges
---
- Grenades
---
- Aoe tanking shield
---
- Resistance trinkets
---
- Arcanite dragonling trinket for Fire mage dps buff.
---
- Gnomish battle chicken trinket for melee dps/tank threat
---
the BRD map shows nothing
---
dont u get raid locked for MC?
---
That's probably because Moonkins do decent dps while also providing actual good utility. Moonkins outdps Hunters in the latest stafes aswell..
---
Do raid locks in Vanilla work per boss kill or by if you just enter the instance?
---
Just remember to tryhard your dps with consumeables etc. I am not talking about being elitist just that if they are kind enough to bring you atleast do your best bro
---
They are only big on the maps so you can click on them. The zones aren't any bigger than vanilla zones where. 
---
Really? The /site macro won’t proc the reckoning? How do you know for sure? Is it vanilla memory?
---
Depends. 
---
Farming bugtunnels in Silithus for arcane crystals or DM:E jump runs where you have to keep watch whether the satyr is level 56 or 57 and if hes 57, you have to wait for him to face away from you, are really not braindead.
---
The same with crocodiles in Zul'Gurub where getting into striking range as an AoE farming mage is an immediate oneshot by the mobs. 
---
There is a plethora of farming methods that certainly are more engaging than farming level 35 pigpeople in RFD.
---
Obviously if are watching some netflix, you do not want more difficult farming, but the absolute easiest possible which is fair.
---
I’ve always played alliance since I began playing the game myself in TBC, I’ve had horde alts but I’ve never played them seriously. When classic launches I plan on rolling horde, don’t know what class I’ll play yet but I’ll be going horde.
---
Thought you guy might find this interesting, I certainly did. I think it puts things into perspective a bit. 
---
If you plan to be a successful ranker then yes, engineering is mandatory. If you plan to pvp casually I suppose it wont matter at all.
---
whats wrong with double warlock? its a decent synergy and you can do epic mount quest together to save money. 
---
its not like raids only need 1 warlock. you'll be able to raid with 2 warlocks. aswell as you can do 5man with 2 warlocks quite easily aswell and its not that bad.
---
with 2 voidwalkers you might not even need a tank :D. and you can heal your pet. 
---
2 warlocks are fun group dynamics.
---
anger and tears mostly.
---
Thrashblade from Maraudon quest. Also 2h axe from SM quest for alliance.
---
I listened to a lot of grime then 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Still blasting some of the emo music though here and there 
---
I've played on this server at max level about a week now.  I can honestly tell u that A LOT of boss are tuned WAY down.  The blood funnel mechanic from Hakkar is pretty much non-existent.  All the encounters are a lot easier, so I have no doubt Naxx is tuned completely wrong as well.  I'm sure in a true Blizzlike server, Naxx is going to be a lot harder than it is on Vanilla Gaming
---
Im in this dilemma. I also started at tbc launch and played a night elf back then but after a few weeks started playing horde and have been playing one up until now. I really want to play a night elf again in Classic because i love their lore and take me back to the very beginning when i started wow. But im really afraid that ill start missing the horde after a while when i will already have put a lot of time in my night elf. I dont have time to play 2 characters especially not in Classic 
---
I think people underestimate the amount of gear that will drop for tanks in raids, if you dont nitpick threat building items like rings/trinkets/amulets that you compete with the dps with. T1 and T2 is purely tanking gear, meaning you have 2-3 guys that you want to give that gear. Tier are guaranteed drops. Your 3rd fury warr will have \~full tank sets after a while.
---
Usually MT is resistance and max threat builds so OT's can do more of a defensive build.
---
Another thing that you have is TIME. Ill bet blizzard will go with original timeframes, meaning you are grinding purely MC for a looong time.
---
I wasn’t being serious. Have you never met a British person before or played on an RP realm while flagged?
---
Because we Role Players like a fight as much as anyone else, probably more so; But we also don’t want to fight fair.
---
In the end I found PvP servers to be a bit boring really because most of the time you wouldn’t meet people of the same level, the only real time you get to gank someone on a PvE server is when they outside a dungeon like Scarlett Monastery while flagged. 
---
Just having Skinning alone and vendoring the leather should be enough to get you the mount at 40. Provided you don’t waste money on other things along the way.

---
Hey not sure if you’re joking, but just in case, the item level (65) refers to the power level of the item.  The required level to equip is 60.
---
Not at the moment, I let my sub go on hibernation at the start of WoD. I’ve not really looked back since but I will actually buy a PC (which I don’t currently own a modern one) to play classic when we have a release date. 
---
Turn on my undead and banshee queen? 
---
#NEVAH!!!!
---
IMHO I think if you consider " which could limit the amount of people willing to play it. " of the game it is very simple choice by Blizz.
---
Do you want 2 games with each 50k viewers or one game with 100k viewers. 
---
It's pretty much safe that they will not split it, for exactly this reason. 
---
What would be really cool, if all the streamers decide to make kind of a Template for the Title, so you see very fast if its classic or retail.
---
The 'Let me in' meme ca 8,000,000 BC, colourized. 
---
I'm planning on doing the same. My focus will be on dungeons, wpvp and maybe early casual raiding.
---
From what I've gathered HOTW is fine for healing dungeons and raids up to MC. Though we see with gear the guy in the top linked video did AQ40.
---
No the gray item is from TBC and is required 64
---
&gt;Added in patch 4.0.1.12941
---
Heresy!
---
I believe he was referring to the stoppable force, as it requires lvl 64
---
Fresh air.
---
There will be no “fresh server feeling“.
---
Server will feel dead to begin with, but it will be better when out of starting zones.
---
It's sad, i really hoped to experience the starting zones full of players. But i think i will still give it a try.
---
Glyphs, I like the idea of customizing your spell effects.
---
Would rather it remained simply visual changes, maybe they can implement it one day.
---
Relatable. Inb4 delayed until 2020
---
I always choose priest. Bank alts so I can heal myself while running through mobs of enemies to the city 
---
Replies are correct, was referring to the stoppable force as a joke.
---
But thanks for giving me the information and not just being a dick about it :)
---
Well, I can't tell you which you will find more fun, but think about the specs you would do this at.
---
Both have pro's and cons. For example, shaman can pug-heal and ele-PvP in the hybrid 30/0/21 spec very well, no need to do respecs! (the nature swiftness for healing also works on offensive spells for nuking in PvP if needed).
---
Priests don't have a nice hybrid like that (though they do have other nice builds of course). However, maybe ask yourself how likely it is that you will get Benediction from your (pug) MC raids. Once you get that, you can switch it to Anathema and start *melting faces,* which is what I assume you want to be doing. You would obviously still need other decent gear, but the weapon is very good. It's shadow power (69 I believe) is very close to rank 14 spell power staff (71 I believe).
---
There are several ways but every single way people list really depends on one thing.
---
Self control.
---
Buy only skills you need. 
---
Sell everything.  
---
Don't AH blues or greens because they're minor upgrades.  
---
Take some time on great trash mobs (STV cats!). 
---
TAKE SKINNING AND VENDOR EVERYTHING.
---
Follow those steps and really have self control and you'll have gold to spare.
---
Bonus tips that aren't needed?  I always level fishing and kill a few hours a week just reading reddit and fishing for gold.
---
Go tailor/ench...  farm linen, make greens, DE and make wands to sell on AH.
---
Offer to run groups through WC and dm for 1g per run.
---
Boomkins
---
Search for taladril's spreadsheet
---
Pick up all grays+whites and vendor them. Some grays are worth 20 silver and those things drop a lot. Just with those you can net like 5g per day while lvling. Dont waste gold on anything and dont buy useless spells. Ask random mages for consumables so you dont need to spend money for those.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about my class, you little n00b? I’ll have you know I am a lvl 60 High Warlord hunter. I also have a fuckton of macros and I have completed raids you havn't even seen before. You are nothing to me but just a lvl 12 nobody. I will shoot an aimed shot so fucking far up your ass even Ant-Man won't be able to find it. I have multi-shots the likes of which has never been seen before on Azeroth AND Outland, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit on Reddit!? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting the guild of Hunters and your character is being targeted right now so you better prepare for a platoon of hunters forming across the horisont in every fucking zone you ever enter. We're gonna be chasing your sorry ass all over the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor too. We can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my PvE talents. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re fucked, you goddamnn00b. I will shit Immolation Traps all over you and you will burn in it and I will laugh as the flames slowly melt your face!
---
Loot all mobs. Never liked having to loot every single npc individually
---
I miss these.
---
[RP-PvP Realm] - Rare item that may or may not be in the game upon release.
---
Sorry if I annoyed you with a ”smarmy” comment about 1.12 and no changes – what ever that is (English is not my mother tongue, as you properly noticed reading my post).
---
What I try to argue, is that for me cross realm BG’s where a tremendously positive thing when introduced, and that is why it is important for me to air my opinion, in the hope that other who has the same limitations as I do, would speak up. I really enjoy to participate in battlegrounds with my friends, and that became an option with cross realm battlegrounds.
---
"*At naxx progress level you are going to drop MC, 20mans and ony off the list*"
---
No they wont because:
---
a) They will still do atleast binding runs for TF
---
b) They will want/need ZG hearts and ony heads for raidbuffing.
---
Have you done this? If so are there any leathers you would recommend **not vendoring?**
---
Dranei. I'll miss the space goats. 
---
I live in the third world. There are no such laws
---
he's a beaut
---
Oh! They right!  Man, could have sworn stoppable was a crap av drop to tease you until you had the rep for unstoppable!
---
I did Skinning and Leatherworking in Vanilla and always had enough. Leather is easy to come by and many people will be skinning while leveling as it's the most efficient gathering profession, so I don't think there will be a huge player demand for leather early on. 
---
Vanilla isn't "hard" in the way that the bosses have some really high tech mechanics etc. It's hard because you kind of need to play with friends to make it work.
---
Elemental shamans are ranged warriors in the meaning that you have to be social with couple close mates to fully excel. 
---
Purging manashield, frost armor and ice barrier will leave a mage a lot more open to big crits from warriors, WF totems allows your warrior to oneshot clothis.
---
Without a warrior at your side, you are honestly diminishing your elemantal shamans power by a good 50%. 
---
If you are more of a solo player, priest is better. If you are a social group player with good mates, elemental is better.
---
If dat leak is correct, we'll get a release date during Pax East this week.
---
Yeah i guess. Have you tested if its worth using the leather to create stuff and then vendor the stuff? Or do you think the raw leather is worth more? :) 
---
I've noticed a lot of extra interest in druids leading up to classic.  I'm all about people playing what they want to play, but they also need to understand that druids are shit, and it will be extremely rare for a guild to bring more than 2 to a raid.  I hate myself so I'll be playing one.
---
Never compared it, so I'm not sure. 
---
Raid lockout is only after a boss is killed. 👍
---
Having enough gold by 40 is easily doable as long as you don't spend money needlessly. You just need to do some simple stuff, like making sure you always have all the quests when you go to dungeons, buying larger bags as soon as you can afford them, trying to finish as many quests as possible in each zone, and selling everything you possibly can on the AH. This will become more viable as the server ages. Bags, crafting materials and non-Soulbound quest items are typically popular on the AH, plus any BoE items with good stats for their armour type - e.g. chain armour "of the Bear".
---
The challenge only really comes in if you're following some kind of ultra-streamlined levelling guide that maximises XP per hour without regard for other factors, or if you're trying to level up a crafting profession alongside it. Those are all generally a net negative on income until you hit 300, and sometimes even beyond then (reputation grinding for crafting recipes was either very expensive, or very time consuming, usually both.)
---
Only if your shit tbh.  I topped healing in MC last week as a druid, but I think that's because of a lack of skill on our other healers. (It also takes complete knowledge of the class, proper addons and proper macros.) Druids should always be below priests and shaman (don't know about paladins, I'm horde for life)
---
Thanks for the explanation mate. I personally prefer the longer non-zerg ones, so I understand the frustration. 
---
Alright :) I might just test it before launch
---
H*ckin' got 'em!!!!
---
As a horde player, I never realized that hunters are the only mail class on alliance... that's crazy to me.
---
Really? That's not what some other people are saying
---
I hadn't heard this but looked it up, is this based on the thread on mmo champ?
---
Both specs need a ton of gear to have fun and own in BGs. 
---
Free weekend?  Is that a normal thing?  I've been dying to check out my old characters (Not enough to pay 15 bucks though.)
---
It's been leaked on more sites than MMO and the source is usually ccorrect
---
These shoulders used to look like wooden planks with feathers. Troll Shaman rocked them best imo.
---
This is pointless and stolen content 
---
I would not play Classic on a tablet. 
---
Exactly. Armor reduction mechanics are absolute wrong on the ps-servers which means more dps from the melees there. Worldbuffs? With a cooldown, so you can't just turn in every Ony head you got. Flasks? Have fun finding the lotus without ps dynamic spawn. Boss mechanics aren't working great or don't do enough demage etc. Nax and raiding will be way more harder than on ps. Not as hard as in 2004. We got better, we know the startegies now. Still way harder than in this vids. 
---
It is for me. If Sharding is implemented at launch, I won't be playing at launch. I'm already not that interested in the early rush, and I'd rather step into a server that already has a diverse level population, and I'm willing to wait for that. Literally the only reason why I'd be interested in playing at launch is for that launch day chaos, surrounded by hundreds of strangers all frantically trying to co-ordinate themselves to get their quest objectives.
---
If launch day plays like any other day in WoW, but with 80% of zones completely empty, I see no reason to play at launch.
---
I think we're well past all those stages by now and those of us on this subreddit will just dive straight into "I'm spending every fucking moment i possibly can playing this game, whether it be 2 hours or 18 hours straight"
---
Pickpocket runs yield the most gold per hour and it’s very consistent. If you have stealth talents + prep then you can run BRD, and if you don’t have stealth talents then you run RFD. 
---
Hardcore vanilla fan here, and I agree 100%.
---
You betcha I am going to grind yetis while listening to soundtrack to your escape by In Flames, just like I did 14 years ago!
---
That would be total anarchy! But fun though!
---
Agreed! 
---
So what's AV like now on retail, just our curiosity?

Wtf bro
---
In the US with more than 300 million people, TV ratings are done on a sample size of 41000. And billions of dollars depend on those ratings. In my country of 10 million people, official political surveys are done on a sample size 1000-2000 people.
---
You could argue that this wow survey might be biased because the people of this subreddit don't represent the future wow classic population perfectly. But this sample size of 10000 is in fact so large that most statisticians would drool all over it.
---
Agreed, questie is way too much handholding for me. ClassicDB has maps with quest giver locations for when you need to find some quests for your level and don't feel like blindly exploring or just grinding a level or 2.
---
Lol if there is a dagger as long as a katana, pls link
---
/r woosh 🤭
---
honestly i prefer ratings because they allow for finer tuning, you kinda can't give half a percent crit
---
Yes it is, no that often tho. Btw you can still access the characters list without being subbed to the game, you just can't log on any character higher than 20, if you just want to check them out :)
---
1. Bags - this should be your priority, no matter how many skins you pick, if you dont have room, it's useless
---
2. Vendor everything - dont bother with AH, it's a fresh server it will take a while for economic to establish
---
3. Maximize your class sustain - dont buy food and water, learn how to sustain with talent procs/bandages, it is doable and you will get food/wwater drops anyway
---
4. Buy the skills you need, skip everything else
---
5. Dont spend money on gear, just dont
---
6. Plan ahead and be consisten, the mount should be in the back of your head from level 1, play the game as if the objective is to get the mount. Why? Being able to move from point A to point B faster will equal to fatser leveling.
---
But we only have ratings because we have 1000s of random epics that need stats. In vanilla there was finitely many epics so you could choose the ones you wanted to have crit. The problem is retail blizzard is lazy and can't be assed to make unique items.
---
I am going to be playing by myself for the most part. I work nights so I'm usually flying solo.
---
I personally hope they avoid sharding the Barrens and Westfall. If not in the starting zones, this is where you sink in time and meet people you end up playing with, would suck if that gets mixed with sharding.
---
*-Assuming Direct Control-*
---
Yup, my main is and always will be a priest, who will have tailoring/enchanting . . . because.
---
After I get my priest sorted (no DM means this will take longer than I originally thought).  I'll get a hunter alt up to 60 for grinding/farming (I've done this on multiple PS, it works).
---
So, have you made your choice?
---
Seems interesting but I think I'll just go as a healer as I usually do haha, only this time I'm kinda torn between druid priest and holy pal. I would really like to play a nelf. Any suggestions :D?
---
P.S. i didn't choose the healbot life, the healbot life chose me.
---
don't vendor devilsaur lol
---
Sell it until you get to rugged/thick IIRC.
---
First of all, did you notice the word PROGRESS ? 
---
A) After you get naxx down to 1 day raid, then you could go get TF's again. For some this could take 1 reset, guessing others would just raid more days to get a chance to get a TF. Much easier to do 2 split raids at phase I and II when you dont have that much content.
---
B) depending how the buffs work, you might have massive amount of heads ready (if its on 6 hour CD example). At naxx level, nobody can take the head of your main raid. They will all have it at AQ progression.
---
C) Since we know now to PREPARE everyone will get the DMN echant mats ready and get numerous enchants prepared for T2.5 and T3 gear. So you dont have to do the worse version of the enchants and get 7-8 enchants / run compared to 1.
---
Tried to find a ele/resto ele shaman gear list for pvp. Didnt find anything concrete but people said rank 13 set is bis.  Are they wrong? 
---
Started in TBC which was still vanillaish but I’m very much looking forward to enjoying Azeroth leisurely instead of something I had to hurriedly panic my way through get to Outland and a flying mount ASAP
---
All valid points. I suppose we'll see how wbuffs, cooldowns on aforementioned is implemented etc.
---
Silver-Thread Cape and Black Velvet Robes 
---
I'm sure they wont have it in those zones for that point; you actually start interacting with people for real. Also, the barrens is waaaay too much of a zone for sharding. You have to come back to it at higher levels. No way they'll have sharding from 10-30.
---
Whats wrong about the armor reduction?   
---
Ill let you know that on the most modern pserver Kelthuzad has around 4600 armor, which is 1600 too much. Most of the others are supposed to have 3700 as well. 
---
Troll ftw
---
Aaaaand that's how with ended up with current WoW. We've come full circle!
---
I barely ever read the quest descriptions, I just looked for key words like "south west, castle, along the northern coast". Even then you can skip the first paragraph as it is flavor text and just skim the bottom one. Then if I wasn't sure I googled the quest, this was #blizzlike during #vanilla.
---
I got my fix from pservers while waiting.
---
I thought only Asian players had ret dreams.
---
I can't think of any that are important enough for you to miss having it at level 60, but there might be some, I'm not super well versed with every profession.  I'd say most of them are inconsequential though, for an example there is a horde alchemy recipe, from a quest, which teaches you a health potion that is exactly the same as the weakest health potion.
---
I played an orc warrior in vanilla. Gonna check out IF bridge and have paladins on my side this time.
---
It's in his pre-raid gear consisting of blues. He then uses BWL gear and lands slightly above 500 and BiS lands around 660.
---
**&lt;Guild&gt;** 
---
Moderate | PvE | Based in the UK | Horde 
---
**About us:** 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
**Our Goals:** 
---
\- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal. 
---
\- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
\- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
**Expectations:** 
---
\- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
\- Actually showing up! 
---
\- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
**Looking for:**
---
We will be showing preferences to melee DPS such as Arm/Fury Warriors, Rouges and also healers
---
**Schedule:** 
---
\- The days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
\- Time will be 7:00PM GMT and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. 
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game. Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: https://discord.gg/m2j9mgZ
---
A talent in the ret tree for pallys to give a small percentage of damage as healing to the raid would be amazing.
---
And then put a talent in the prot tree that does the same but it's a small percentage of damage taken or damage blocked or something.
---
Good wands. 
---
I know naxx locks you if you solo to take frost runes
---
so prolly the same in mc for mining?
---
Potatoes and HKs 
---
**&lt;Pertento&gt;** 
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun 20:00 - 24:00 CET (with Monday an extra raid day for progression)
---

---
so the most important ones are the ones named first?
---
I think it was originally planned that Druids were gonna shapeshift and fill multiple roles in a raid but the players found that filling one role was more efficient as Druids just didn't have the mana to continuously shapeshift or something like that, so they probably thought that a Druid would be shooting in some starfires while healing or something.
---
Nope, they're basically unkillable
---
Just put it out with BWL or ZG, gives non raiders something to go for. Increases number of instance runs. All good.
---
At the moment I am like 80% Priest and 20% Warlock, but there is still time and it's not final... What about you?
---
...i just want a nice non-combat pet that everybody else doesn't have. 
---
green wing macaw or tranquil mechanical yeti keep me company all the way to 60
---
BGs and such I presume. 
---
This topic is even more interesting when leveling. Some people tend to forget, that you go to Dungeons, because you want the shiny stuff that increases your efficiency while questing.
---
If I sacrifice myself to heal or tank a dungeon and because of this people won't allow me to roll on damage gear, while simultaneously playing a pure DPS role... yeah that sounds hypocritical to me.
---
I cant heal enemies to death, Carol..
---
But I normally informed potential loot rivals to prevent trouble and most of them were fine with that.
---
Yo op check out Smoothing Groups, it'll make your stuff look a lot better and teach you where you need to add more geometry etc. See the tower on the left looks smoother than the one on the right. It's because the one on the right has no smoothing groups so each face is smoothing independently of it's neighbour
---
📜  **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU Alliance** guild that intends to roll on a **PvP** server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
***What to expect*** 
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.  
---
 We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server, but we don't plan to raid on it, as it is just there for us to jump on and have some fun now and then, and also test out the classes and make our final decisions until launch.
---
**Raid dates:** Thursday --&gt; Tuesday
---
**Raid times:** 7:50 PM GMT  
---

Then there are people that played on Private servers for free for a decade now :D BUT those wherent present in internet cafes i guess.
---
So despite all those private server thingies I am one of those who have actually cleared Naxxramas way back in the day. I've been a holy Priest all that time. I've "farmed" Naxxramas, reaching 8/9 set pieces and 28/40 legendary fragments - sadly that's when Burning Crusade hit...
---
Naxxramas WAS hard. It really was. However: the most difficult part for everyone was to understand all those bosses and mechanics and whatnot. There were no youtube guides. And even for the few guides that existed back in the day - try getting 40 people to read those guides.. even nowadays it's impossible for even those mythic clearning guilds to have all members be truly prepared. Back in the day it WAS impossible. That's why we had to fight fight fight and learn learn learn and eventually kill those bosses.
---
I remember our healing frustrations on the patchwerk fight. Until we had a proper rotation of healers and spells so we all got our 5 second spirit tick in until we had to heal again. I remember Anub'Rekhan and the insect swarm that ticked for fucking 1800dmg every 1 second. Good thing I had 3200 life so i was totally able to survive one tick!
---
I remember all those farm days in between raids to farm for mana potions and - more importantly - mana runes, as those really gave you the edge since they were a different cooldown.
---
Ultimately though: once we've killed a boss the content was actually not that difficult. It was really mostly figuring out how things worked as the mechanics were a huge step up from everything we had seen up to this point, AQ included. So basically it's just like raiding today.
---
It wasn't really THAT challenging. Surely the first weeks. But just like mythic raiding today, it's biggest challenge was to have a constant roster of people that could raid a set number of days a week and actually perform well. Bosses would fall eventually. And naturally, mechanically bosses nowadays are far more difficult than naxx ever was. But for what it was back in the day without all the knowledge and tricks we know of today... naxx was hard. (That being said: Sunwell Plateau (unnerfed variant) was way harder than naxx, too)
---
If they go against their promise of only sharding a bit at launch then yes.
---
Ill be going stage one and skipping the rest to 5
---
get up 8am start playing and go wtf its 11:40pm i don't want to go to bed yet man i'm going to fall behind.
---
Before the announced 6 phase thing, I was really hoping it got released between BWL and AQ40. I think they're trying to play it better safe than sorry of people complaining it invalidates anything, but really as long as it doesn't come out before BWL I don't see an issue. It's a very expensive questline and takes a considerable period of time. I remember how cool the set looked for rogues so I tried to do it on mine back then and just doing the first three pieces cost me like 350 gold and after that I'm not sure if I spent any more since I couldn't ever get the boots to drop despite killing Rattlegore an obscene number of times. For a lot of players who started at the very end of vanilla or TBC and hear about it they think it's some WotLK-era idea but it's honestly much easier to get full T1 and several pieces of T2 than get the T0.5 set, not to mention cheaper. 
---
I think more people that can't raid will having late morning/noonish weekend pugs available to them compared to retail vanilla so this set will mostly just be for a lot of hybrid classes wanting an alternative pvp set or just people wanting them because most of the sets look really awesome. 
---
WHICH ////// ONE
---
The Goblin/Gnomish Rocket Boots you get from their respective engineering specialisation.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?itemset=386
---
The set has: 81 spell damage, a few % spell crit, no spell hit. You'd have to be insane to wear that set over off-pieces from PvE and the best pieces of the R10 set.
---
Nobody ranks Shaman to 13 or 14 on private servers because the gear is itemized for Enhancement. Its stats are weighted for enhancement. It has a bunch of melee crit and str.  
---
You'd have to be insane to push beyond rank 11 as Ele/Resto.
---
Wrong, im gonna be on the character creation screen having deleted 67 characters already, thinking about the next im gonna creat thats DEFINATELY gonna be the one... 
---
During classic the strongest effect overwrote the lowest one. Better dots will overwrite the weaker one. Same for hots and debuffs. The same applies to armor reduction. On many ps ( I definitely can't say if every ps is doing the same thing) debuffs and armor reduction in generall ads between the classes which is simply wrong. Druid debuff ads to warrior debuff ads to rogue debuff. So instead of 1000k armor reduction as max from the strongest ability, you will have 1k from this one, 500 from another one and 700 from the last one. I'm not even talking about the armor of the boss (which is also just a wild guess. Ps owner don't have the numbers. Most likely they are right with their guesses but still.)
---
same as me, when they remade thottbot, I keep checking thottbot now for blue posts.
---
On the other hand, the entire reddit is dangerous with their ads everywhere
---
Do you really want a date though? I think the pain will be even greater if I knew the date....
---
Sounds like a brillant solution Fredmonroe. I would subscribe to that :)
---
Not in my area tho
---
I have several irl friends who are interested in Classic who have either never played WoW at all, started in TBC or one friend who played for like 2 months in MoP and thought it was garbage because dungeons were a breeze and not at all like what he was led to believe earlier iterations of WoW were like. It's going to be fun playing with all of them.
---
There is a 1h mace that Blacksmiths can craft that has a chance on hit to dispel a magic effect. You use this weapon on the pet while the lock gets CCed so he just can't immediately reapply the SL buff.
---
Why is undead priest more popular than troll priest? J thought PvE racials pegged troll as better than undead. Correct if I'm wrong please because that was my planned character

That's basically the best all-around spec you can do.  There's nothing wrong with it at all.  Yes, there's a little bit of a tradeoff, but that's any spec.
---
I wouldn’t worry about the reputation, it’s not that important. Grinding will probably be better if you find a good, empty spot. Quest areas will be quite packed so it’s safe to except conpetition for tags and quest items.
---
You're probably right. I sill wanted to give Dave Kosak his props, I read his comic every couple of years to quench my thirst for vanilla WoW.
---
it taste like warm!
---
What's your attitude towards people with small children?
---
Ah you just mean graphically then? I took your remastered way possible to mean with quality of life improvements etc. Things to make the game ''more accessible'', since that's apparently the most important thing in the multiverse right now. 
---
gObLIn LaND mInES BroOOoO
---
Expose Armor and Sunder Armor don't stack on any pserver I know of. Faerie Fire and Sunder Armor do stack, as they did on retail. You could have easily googled this.
---
Sword of Omen and Vanquisher's Sword.
---
the problem is not the sample size its where and when the survey was made.
---
its like going to the city at 13:00 PM on a weekday and ask people about their occupation.  
---
this sort of survey would be massively skewed towards pupils, unemployed, stay-at-home parent or shift workers.  
---
I was in an AV once and was guarding the bridge with a rogue who was dual wielding these babies. It was the most fun I've ever had in AV.
---
I dunno if it's laziness or not, the issue they tried to solve with ratings instead of percentages was making old gear irrelevant, essentially increasing the amount of crit rating you needed for 1% crit with each level you gained (This is why you get weaker as you level up). Otherwise some trinkets from classic would be BiS forever just because they have 2% crit on them or whatever.
---
From what I remember, the i7 thermal throttle down to i5 performance, so for gaming, they're about equal. They might have improved this for the Pro 6 though, so take it with a pinch of salt. Performance should be good enough, WoW runs on a potato if you lower the settings but I wouldn't buy it to play Witcher 3. Witcher 3 is one of those games where you really want to maximize graphics to enjoy the views and get immersed.
---
Only by the minority. 
---
&gt;No fucking clue why.
---
Because its pretty fucking good?
---
The fact that my combo points can disappear simply by untargetting my current target. 
---
Frost Mage. The second best flag carrier. The best character to get the flag out of the flag room and bring it to a druid (if there is a druid on your composition).
---
Decurse is essential because of CoT. 
---
Have high mobility/survivability 
---
Amazing CC
---
Great damage
---
Can peel 
---
dont fucking change the game
---
It's a mature guild with a mature attitude, we don't expect people to put their lives on hold and we know that we've (mostly) all grown up now.
---
There will be short breaks during raid evenings, and whilst raiding hours aren't flexible, as long as we have reasonable notice ahead of time and you're not in some critical raid-ending role, it's fine.
---
Its math, they arent guesses. Theyre accurate with 99% precision. And the armor matters a lot since youre discussing reduction. The value of reduction is higher the lower the armor is. 
---
The data also had impossible roles, like tank priest or heal warrior, which I attributed to mistakes. But tank shaman could be something people actually might believe to work, so I left it in. The mistakes were also all very low in percentages, 0.1 % or 0.2 %
---
For a an Alliance warrior, Bonebiter. For a hunter, the mara scepter and Verdant Keeper's Aim!
---
Omg all these names... what a blast from the past! I couldnt remember my guild name but it was Skyfang, Tarquinas Legion after that (or maybe before) I wasnt very geared but raided everything but AQ40
---
I speedrun using a combination of grinding and questing, and by the time I hit 40+ have enough reputation to get a discount on my mount, no problem. The trick is to get a great, efficient path going that smoothly runs you through the right content at the right level.  
---
Rep is only really a factor to me if I wanted to do something specific like get a different class mount - it generally doesn't mesh well with efficient levelling, but there's no reason you couldn't design a path that optimised rep gain as you levelled.
---
The real key is not wasting gold at the AH and not buying skills that aren't necessary. Without farming you might need a few more levels before getting a mount, but usually you can scrounge the gold very soon after 40.
---
Also hit rank 3 in pvp for a discount!
---
We like to be as flexible as possible to fit around peoples circumstances and I can't see it being too much of a problem. 
---
1. I've only played classic on private servers, during MoP when I actually enjoyed some parts of the game. I started playing mid/late 2007 (TBC)
---
2. Honestly, this is so hard for me to pinpoint; for years I'd been on autopilot with WoW. It's literally the only game I've ever played since  I discovered it. It's amazing to think how much WoW has had an influence on my life without me even realizing it. I've always stuck up for Blizzard (I don't mean that in a negative or positive way, I don't hate Blizzard at all), justifying the changes they've made with "they're just keeping up with the times" but as far back as Cataclysm, this game has just never felt "right" to me. WotLK was by far the most time I've put into the game, mainly because I was no longer studying, I had a seemingly endless amount of time to play and I was playing with IRL friends that made it even more fun. Although WotLK was my most time /played, I still remember the discourse of 3.0.2. This patch was the start of a slippery slope for WoW becoming an homogenized mess. I remember people praising the patch, myself included, about how it allows players to access content they could never before because of time restraints due to IRL commitments. I can't help but change my opinion on this these days. Who cares if you can't see all the content? The most I raided in TBC was Kara and Gruul's Lair and I loved every minute of it. Myself and plenty of others enjoyed their time during classic/WoW without even obtaining a piece of high-end gear. While I'm sure there were plenty of leavers from classic to TBC, to me, BC still at least had the spirit of an MMORPG. The game wasn't meant to please everyone but if you stuck around, you know why you did.
---
3. See above
---
/end nostalgia-yet-not-nostalgia-filled spiel
---
MoP is looked upon fondly? By whom? It was a terrible idea and a terrible expansion. Pandas are a joke race and don't belong in the savage world of Azeroth. The whole expansion was nearly as bad as WoD.
---
But of course everyone's opinion differs. :)
---
Look, a deal breaker no. Disappointing yes. I think 99% of people here will try wow classic almost regardless. My hype is so high at this stage, personally I’ll still give it a go. 
---
As they’ve said though, Sharding is only to solve their launch populations issues. Will that creep in? Doubt it. But, having a private server style Zerg launch is completely out of the question for Blizzard. 
---
As far as I'm aware you can't say the name of the servers

A friend of mine, would stealth into Brd and kill Lord Incendius for his Ace of Elements card. he was pretty well geard, though with some fire resistance gear or a resistance potion. 
---
From Deadmines, Emberstone staff for casters. Pretty much BiS till level 35+.
---
No, because then it's not a true PVP environment. It's easier to try and RP on a PVP server than it is to PVP on a PVE server due to the PVP restrictions.
---
Alright, are you using the **reddit app on your mobile** or straight through browser?
---
They haven't even confirmed Oceanic servers yet.
---
My pain will be a lot smaller once I can book my work off for 2 weeks during launch
---
Depends what is important to you in the game. Personally, I'm all about PvE and then also PvP to an extent. Ever since I tried raiding with paladins, I never wanted to be without them. It's just so comfortable.
---
Oh yeah, at end-game paladins are beasts in PvP as well. Horde might have the upper hand in terms of racial bonuses, but I feel paladins' utilities outweigh those overall compared to having shamans.
---
which one works for raiding and stealth runs? ideally including Preparation
---
either swords or dagger
---
I’ve been shaving for years, keeping my inner neckbeard hidden from the real world.  This summer it shall be released
---
Not sure we should be encouraging any priest's boner. Universally speaking.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Contact Kyte#1707 on discord for more information! 
---
Lupos still looks cool and would be useful in raids, but yeah no different to other doggos. It won't ruin hunters.
---
As others have already clearly verified: You have no idea of what you are talking about.
---
Since I do not know the calculation for the margin of error and confidence levels, I used an online calculator for it. I assumed up to 10,000,000 possible classic wow users, which I am sure will not be reached. With a confidence level of 99% and a margin of error of 1.3 %, the needed sample size would be 9.806, which we surpass. Both margins are extremely accurate. So the sample size is definitively not an issue here.

A decade later you guys still namedrop legendary players at the time. Nowadays you don't even know who is in your own guild.

I mostly follow tech subreddits, but people are usually uptight there as most techies are. I like that r/classicwow's community is not as uptight.

1.12 AV would still often drag on if there weren't any premades.
---
Yeah there have always been servers with really crazy ratios. But overall maybe it is more akin to the numbers here? The sample size of people who chose PvE is a lot smaller than for PvP. I think it was about 2k PvE and 8k PvP
---
necrophiliac 
---
Getting to raid? Sure. Just don't expect to get gear outside of hand-me-downs at least for quite a while.
---
no thx
---
Don't forget pickpocket RFD

Sharding is completely fine for the starting zones honestly. I’ve heard so many streamers give their little scenarios where it’s bad and it’s honestly painful how disingenuous it is. For instance tipsout tried saying “but what if you meet people and form friendships at the start” I’ve played through the launch of every major classic private server literally the only thing people wanted to do in groups was kill the mob for the quest item say ty and leave. This fairytale scenario people try to paint just doesn’t happen. No one wants to sit at Milly’s farm for 40 minutes waiting for grapes to spawn and to kill Defias.
---
69 likes. Stop liking it now guys.
---
I see flintlocke I upvote. 
---
One side note,  how likely is it that people would recognize the reference if I made a female gone mage named Bloodrose or orc hunter Roktar and named every pet Bunbun 
---
HahHa indeed
---
IS A CAT DURID FOR EAT SUM1’S HED &amp; STUFF?
---
OMG YES LOL !
---
Honestly, I don't have a problem with gear being useful for years to come. Hopefully with the supposed level squish blizzard will remember that they have 5+ expansions of content that could useful again with a little fresh paint and effort. 
---
Eh I think a lot of people are gonna use their sick leave/vacation to enjoy a good early grind
---
Spelling it in weird ways makes no impact, the mods simply remove anything that promotes the name of specific Pservers.
---
I would argue that 29/11/11 ist more of a 1vX hit and run / kite spec for open world pvp and duels while 30/0/21 is better for BGs and large scale open world pvp.
---
Because in vanilla both factions have their own advantages and disadvantages. Geographical differences (Ironforge OP), paladins and shamans (which makes melees slightly stronger on H but casters stronger on A) etc, which adds reasons to play both factions.
---
In TBC all that balance is thrown out the window, horde ends up as the objectively superior faction and it becomes like 80/20 without enforcement.
---
&gt;How did a single dps taking agro lead to everyone dying? I
---
cuz some bosses do some crazy cone damage or whatever tailswipe and delete lots of people at once
---
Started mid to late TBC, first max lvl chara in wotlk. Have a few days /played on private servers and many more
---
/watched in vanilla content on youtube, so I know what I'm getting myself into :)
---
A lot of bosses had "cleave" attacks that if a dps grab aggro could mean death to half the raid, for example Onyxia breath attack.
---
You play lock and don’t worry about it ;)
---
If you want to post something about a Pserver. Simply state that it is from a Pserver, but NEVER mention the servers name. Anything seen to promote a Pserver will be removed, however if you are doing a general comparison or a simple scenic shot, you should get away with it. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E0obZZVAGbobtho pretty much the stereotypical frost mage mage build has some room for variation depending on what your doing/hit gear might want to put some points into imp blizzard if your doing lots of AV etc
---
hunters a little harder, BM is godly early but you need to transition to intimidate/scatter or mm/surv when you and your opponents get more gear
---
As far as I remember, in case a dps takes agro, the character just got knocked down very fast. Perhaps this means, that the boss or the trash was kited to another position which leads to a different behavior to the rest of the raid (e.g. boss needs to be faced against a wall or some other mechanic to prevent damaging the raid).
---
In my opinion, the encounters in vanilla were a way more difficult than nowadays.
---
The problem is that this subreddit is working together with the Blizz CMs and as such they need to distance itself from private servers. Besides there is a subreddit for posting privateserver screens &amp; questions etc.
---
No, what we see at PS launches is not vanilla like. I much rather have sharding than dynamic spawns. 
---
Bosses have timers so it's also a race for time, for some fights.
---
If someone else pulls aggro, if the tank doesn't pick it up fast enough, that add could start destroying the rest of the raid pretty quick and when the tank CAN pick up the add, the mechanics for the boss will probably lead to several large hits to health for different phases where you need to start pre-healing the tank for those hits so the heal goes off immediately after the tank takes damage. With extra baddies beating on the tank you can see how the tank would get killed quick as you wouldn't be able to heal through all that damage.
---
So, you either don't have enough damage to kill the boss before an enrage or you pull add and can't heal through the damage fast enough. Not enough damage, not enough healing.
---
Ahh, Shaman items
---
I’ll accept priestiest, but it is close with devout. Coolest has to be t3 for me though.
---
Tfw there are useless buff on the vw and you have only 1/10 chance to remove the sl buff
---
definitely, I would even say that 29/11/11 is more of a fun spec to play in the open world with,  30/0/21 is better for most 1v1 matchups 9/10 times. Feral charge as balance just adds utility but it's not a must in any match up. But being able to heal back 60% of your hp instantly is a must against most classes when they hit you with a burst combo
---
People wanna tell you how to play a MMORPG lol...  there is no right/wrong way to play an open world rpg
---
Potentially, but first lets get the game out and ensure the foundations are in place before we start trying to change it. One step at a time. It was big quick design decisions that put WoW in it's current state.

**&lt;For Fun&gt; - EU - Horde - PvP Server - Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET) 
---
You are not required to make both raid days every week. We respect that you will have commitments in real life and understand that comes first!
---
**Introduction**
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvP server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. This means we accept people of any class or spec, even if it’s considered sub-par. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.
---
**Expectations**
---
A casual and relaxed raid environment.
---
A friendly atmosphere both in and outside of raids.
---
Social events available for all guild members at any level (with prizes!).
---
An experienced and mature leadership team.
---
A “for fun” attitude to everything in the game. That is what games are for after all!

Spirit tap is what you need when Solo leveling. At 60 for PvP you'll respecc to shadow and go Blackout
---
In 1 hour you will get a bunch of downvotes because of the "no changes" people.
---
To plan the time after Naxx it's way to early right now.
---
Sure a lot of people (including me) would like some kind of fresh touch at the "end" of classic. 
---
The majority of people just want classic without anything "new". Their argument is right, as soon as you implement the "first change" everyone will beg for the next "great idea" and sooner than you might think you get to the point of retail wow. I totally understand your point and party agree with you, but for the greater good I don't think this will be a good idea.
---
That is the entire point. In the next - what is it going to be 3-4 weeks the EU sanctions their intellectual property addendum. Youtube, twitch and co already announced that this means they have to enforce the restrictions on the content on their websites similar to how they were force into action by the music industry. 
---
In a couple of weeks a simple kiddo reporting a streamer or youtube content creator with private server material on it demonetized said content and puts the entire accounts at risk.
---
Also the 'I know its wrong but they are providing me with it on a simple link - therefore I'm innocent' wouldn't stand a chance in hell given the current law in the states and when the EU forces their addendum onto those big companies it will be youtube and co who's going to shut down their users to pull themselves out of the fire
---
Kargoz guide. Always great to recommend here. No matter what the class.
---
Please, read my comment again. I'm not arguing no changes, I repeatedly stated that I would have absolutely no problem with the T0.5 quest line being implemented on release. I simply pointed out that Blizzard's design philosophy currently seems to be avoiding changes like this, making such an implementation unlikely.
---
Alliance has a quest drought 30s to mid to upper 40s. We dont have major base in desolace, tanaris, easy access to shimmering flats or a base outside it with quests, a base in badlands, a base in STV. Duskwallow is worthless for alliance.
---
Yeah. Instead of pulling ONE mob for sure you try to avoid both by walking by in the moddle knowing, you will pull both. And you do. 
---
Every! F*ckin! Time! 
---
given that this won't be an option for the next 1,5-2 years it's probably bankrupt him if he waits for it :D
---
I ought to, been playing it since 2008. I was just saying maybe it was better in order to play on the legacy servers is to just pay once like buying a game say 59.99 and then just play without a sub. But obviously people think the subscription way of paying is better so..
---
Having nobody else to gear never really happens in vanilla. A lot of the items a ret pally wants are the same  ones contested between dps warriors, tanks, and depending on the slot even hunters+rogues. The same items people keep rerunning mc for, long past the point of being sick of the place.
---
"Oh no, we got nobody to put that onslaught girdle on, let's give it to that one pally for his ret gear!"  
---
Is not a realistic scenario to ever happen.
---
If graphics are the deciding factor for people to stay, I'd say "fuck 'em".
---
You are right. Feral charge can also be clunky if you have issues with latency. But it can also be very funny in certain situations. 
---
My blood is no longer pumping blood,  but ice cold Mountain Dew.  Cheeto dust fills the cracks between my chapped lips, as the pile of hot pocket sleeves on the floor seeks to bury me in a pepperoni-scented grave.

---
Why not just tell everyone to pick the alphabetically first pvp server or the first pve server that starts with S or something? 
---
As soon as they give us a release date god damn it!
---
Haha, I did that too.   FFs, I used to even put weight stones in my weapons thinking it'd make my paw go pew pew just a little faster.
---
You're still going to have starting zones full of people, even with sharding. It doesn't create "shards" that contain only 6 people.
---
App.
---
Lol lots of people are in the same boat saving up their pto waiting for a date 
---
First I thought about rolling a lock, then I considered a priest and now I'm leaning towards mage... The more time you spend thinking and comparing, the harder it gets to choose lol.
---
Any proofs Blizz is cooperating at this level you mention?
---
Wow dude that was cool as hell, is that a series? Makes me want to roll alliance when classic hits.

I'm fairly certain that your combo points would only disappear if you used spells on another target. Untargetting would not remove them by itself. I think. 
---
Ah, nvm. You arent here to talk about the game... byebye.

As a Warrior, don’t you *need* to upgrade your weapon along the way? Serious question. 
---
1. The launcher. Migrating terrain data into "patch.MPQ"...

2. That installer with that epic sounds

3. The players asking how to play it
---
4. The problems of low view distance and slow computers (and how I upgraded my computer to get better in PVP)
---
5. That old good style of patch notes, I spent so many hours reading them while the game was updating
---
You'll never get away with it, with that attitude.
---
Barrens chat is C O N T E N T B O I S
---
I'm gonna roll horde this time, but I'll still gonna PvP an alliance (Previous main) for the nostalgia - Westfall, Lakeshire and Duskwood are awesome levelling zones. To answer, I think it's definitely worth trying out the other faction

TBC had some of the best models for rogue gear ever ! I miss the season 1 set. It was perfect

---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/

May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

I jumped in last night on a server and played a lvl 10 priest i have for some hours. The graphics are..horrible :D I tottaly forgot that in my desire to go back and play vanilla. I think updated graphics would be so cool, i think it could prolong the succes off Classic WoW
---
Nice staff you got there.
---
ye would be nice if they added an option to up graphics, then evrybody can have it as they want
---
Yes you do. But you don't have to buy it. There's enough quest rewards and you can always run a couple of dungeons if you desperately need an upgrade.
---
It's possible, let's hope rhey don't.
---
Warriors may be the only exception to this because they are really gear dependant and you are right, you must invest in weapon if you want a smooth leveling experience. But still you can avoid overspending by doing dungeons and with a little bit of luck you might as well not buy a weapon at all.
---
My Undead priest will do everything to get Whitemane's Chapeau. Because he has taste and style.
---
I am the conductor of the loot train!
---
I expect it to be a mess. Having the opportunity to abuse the imperfect balanced is both refreshing and annoying. People just need to accept that and not take it so serious. 
---
Chances are, you're not going to be the Scarab Lord (if you know what I mean).  
---
Not just pet happiness, managing pet aggro can be a huge pain in the butt.
---
we were told at blizzcon that they are going with the 16 debuff limit from the start.  As we have learned they are listening to the community so it is subject to change but there hasn't really been an huge effort to push for 8 slots on either here or the official classic forum. 
---
There is no proof Blizzard work with the forum. But Blizzard themselves have said that they keep an eye on the classic community on reddit. Which is pretty much this community.
---

---
Damn, I can sense a huuge wave of sickness all around the world coming this summer. I hope humanity can fight through it!
---
Yes well... real estate is a lot cheaper in Orgrimmar. 
---
This is a very recent idea and stand at odds with the entirety of how Classic works. It's going to be unfair, but that is good. 
---
I think Retail does an alright job at creating an equal footing though. 
---
For many dungeons druid and paladin tanks are good enough.
---
Most bosses, especially the big dragon bosses, have a cleave as well as tail swipe of sorts. So one warlock going nuts and you have your entire raid being hit with either a cleave or tailswipe. If you pull agro you’re supposed to run back towards the tanks position to reposition the boss back, usually one cleave will take out a good bit of healers and dps however, usually leading to a wipe. 
---
By total did you mean average? It appears to be the average percentage of players. 
---
Used it on my ret Pala, before that it was the spear out of av
---
I remember most of my Vanilla guildmates better than my high school classmates. 
---
I started in tbc as a casual and got into raiding in wotlk. I played nostalrius from launch till the end.  Nos wasnt that different from how i remember tbc as far as leveling &amp; professions go. 
---
&gt; the first one seems quite innocent to me.
---
It depends on how you do it. Anything that can encourage people to play on pservers is against the rules here, not only direct encouraging but also indirect/implied.
---
Naming a pserver can be innocent or not depending on the context. For example, you can name Nostalrius while talking about how the pserver "movement" pushed Blizzard to release Classic, or something related to it.
---
Or you can talk about pservers in general terms (not specific names) while doing comparisons to retail o while talking about stuff not possible anymore (just examples).
---
But if you name specific servers that are currently running, it could be seen like an an encouragement even if just implied, something along the lines of "hey look how good is this server" thus indirectly suggesting people to go play on it.
---
&gt; I took yesterday on Elwyn Forest where there a bajilion of corpses near the first murloc village. Would it be removed?
---
If you post it without any specific reference to the server where you took it, maybe with something along the line of what  will happen again when Classic is released, you'll be fine.
---
(I fondly remember murlocs and kobolds being among the deadliest mobs ever).
---
Just avoid names and anything that's not relatable to Classic.
---
Sharding barrens. I mean just why? Barrens is one of the most beloved zones, and where people start making friends and grouping up. Sharding barrens would be a dealbreaker for sure, that's just insane.
---
I feel like people have been brainwashed to think that sharding isn't as bad as it actually is.
---
Nope, you can play perfectly as a ret, but you'll still get out-dps'd by pure classes that have just a basic understanding of what they're doing.
---
Mages and locks basically spam one button. Rogue's rotation is super easy and threat is not an issue for them. Warriors are the ones where some skill is needed, but it's nothing impossible.
---
If any of them get out-dps'd by ret, they need to be replaced. Which isn't that hard since they're the most played classes.
---
They utility they bring is mostly meaningless. If you have group that's plays optimally, most bosses will die before they can do anything dangerous. You can push Ony in P3 before she does a single deep breath, you can kill rag in P1 and not worry about using FR gear to deal with adds, etc etc.
---
It also significantly reduces the cost of raiding. You'll wipe less and clear faster, thus need to use a lot less consumables. 
---
There's just no benefit to the raid to bring meme specs.
---
I laughed so hard omg
---
Why are you talking about STV and sharding, if sharding is planned for like level range 1 to 10 ?
---
The classic plague/flu of 2019.  It’ll be written about in the history books
---
Yes, which is why the auto-attacking warrior needs to be removed from the raid.
---
Also spell resists are fucked
---
The amount of time I've wasted by trying to be smart...
---
Next picture will say something like:
---
Did I just spend 5 minutes doing my shores, eating dinner, walking the dog, take a dump, buy groceries and brush my teeth?! 
---
I bet I can do some of that simultaneously next time. 
---
Free weekend? I don’t play retail even when it’s free.
---
I'm kind of hoping someone makes an addon that pseudo-replicates the Achievement system for you, and I'll probably be interested in it too, even if it's something like a notepad.  Because yeah, I always liked achievements (actual ones, not the ones just for playing the game).
---
PvPing in vanilla with 250ms will give Australians an authentic and nostalgic gaming experience.... 
---
I can relive the glory days of chasing ememies and not being within melee range, despite nearly standing on them.
---
AND only  us southerners know about the little teleport enemy players do when they die whilst running at 250ms.... you may have crit them with a Shadow Bolt in the doorway of the flag room, but their bodies will pile up under the flag. Lag gives all classes Blink.

That's because it's a new quite elitist trend to talk about racials for PvP. Most people just went for what they prefered in terms of appearance and lore. I don't remember racials ever being a thing in WoW PvP honestly ... Big players who actually influenced the community through videos never min-maxed these. Swifty played Night-elf instead of Human/Gnome, Pat played Tauren/ Drakedog undead and not Orcs, all known alliance hunters were Night elves despite Stoneform being way better for PvP, etc. I'm unable to name a single Orc Vanilla PvP video maker. Nobody cares about racials outside of a small band of current Min-Maxers who are very vocal about it.
---
Since they have option to disable all of that, sure, why not. If i can choose what to use, i dont care what others use.
---
Always find a mage get food/water for cheaper before going out questing. Vendor food is hella expensive. 
---
chain reactions triggered from said mistakes and tight enrage timers with brutal enrage buffs or cd removal on abilities (which basically boils down to the same thing)
---
examples:
---
ragnaros: sons of flame breach your defenses and reach your raid. Blue bars are sad. Sad blue bars = green bards are sad ... or they will be sad very soon because there is no blue juice to heal them anymore
---
BWL:
---
Vael's  chain cleave. Oh he was facing in that direction. Now 10 people are dead. In a DPS race that's called the 2nd guildbreaker of bwl
---
Dragons and dragonkins with breath attacks in general. A breath into the raid (range dps, healers, or into the melees on the way back to the tank) means dozens of dead people and enrage timers don't give a flip about the crispy piles of scorched mystery meat  that was your raid mere seconds ago
---
Naxx - don't get me started on naxx, but technically you could probably get away with one character dropping out to an aggro death at faerlina - if that doesn't screw the sacrifice and overall raid dps up
---
What a badass and a revolutionary. 
---
Dude the staff! Im so jelly, damn thats the shit. 
---
There is a 1h somewhere that has chance to stun on it
---
That’s what vacation time is for. I only work 8 hours a day. Gotta feel the other 16 somehow.
---
Haha the face doesn't match to my name.. !"§$%&amp;... The Hair doesn't match to my Skin "§$%&amp;/(.. Spending more time creating the Chara then actually playing it. :D
---
Huh... later this year my hunter will be 15 while I am 29.
---
Yes, if you're not in a hardcore progression guild that micromanages your in-game choices. 
---
Then the question is: does the mount paid for by Skinning save you more time than you spent on Skinning.
---
It's the ratios over the whole data set. In contrast to the "Alliance" and "Horde" ratios. I think "average" could be misleading.
---
Maybe, maybe not, but not everyone is looking at the clock and trying to do everything as fast as possible.
---

---
I know no changes is best and such but.... a change that 0.5 set would be released at a much earlier stage (maybe with ZG.. or in any case just before AQ40) would be nice, it's going to waste again otherwise.
---
I will be one of 8 female Dwarves on the server
---
any healer and hunters to some extent.  
---
healers cause you get an almost equally easy group invite as warriors and hunters because you hardly share any loot with other classes.
---
Anything that brings arcane shot above 183 damage bro...
---
Have you checked out [vanillafriends.com](https://vanillafriends.com/) ?
---
OG rogues farm lbrs. 
---
sounds like every dungeon when someone says "we can skip that trash just hug this wall over here..." end up wasting more time corpse running
---
I liked the Glyph system as well. Would be a huge gold maker if it was a cosmetic system when applied to weapons and armor.
---
You've got windows don't you?
---
I dunno, I’m planning to take off a week to nerd it out. Already told the wife, who just rolled her eyes in an amused way. So I’ll skip the anger/denial part and go straight to acceptance.
---
Yeah tho its all easy to organise
---
Like for vael you need only 1 melee dps that knows the positions and u mark with a raid icon so the idiots can just follow him
---
Hi, /u/restivoiii
---
During vanilla I've raided as resto druid, TBC I was the guilds OT for all content and cleared pretty much all content in this xpac. After TBC my playtime decreased but I kept playing dungeons ... and levelled a lot of alts, with multiple warrior tanks.
---
I'm looking forward to Classic, to relive and mainly "redo" everything. As during my times in vanilla wow I was young, stupid and made many mistakes regarding my class/playstyle...
---
The dream is to level up a warrior tank and get some reputation on my realm for running dungeons/raids as a tank. Though my fear is that available playtime won't be sufficient for raiding :(
---
Pretty much every Horde melee and caster will be Orc and undead respectively, both male, as there's no blood elves. That changes data from what we'd see on live, i.e. blood/night/void elf majority minus new allied races, 99% of which would be female.
---
Only non-elf females will be human on Alliance, which still have a decent male pop too.
---
Tl:dr no blood/void elves means mostly male characters. Makes sense tbf. 
---
I'll sit patiently, waiting for sharding to turn off completely as not to ruin my first impressions and read things about it everywhere :P
---
Skinning and farming beasts
---
Yea my friend plays one and I hate it. I am gonna try to convince him to go horde for classic just to stop him from playing a gnome.
---
Perfect, thanks!    
---
Is there an export image feature I'm missing, or did you just use screenshots to make your image?
---
realistically how long should I expect to be farming soul shards for per day?
---
The quest one around 30 lasts a long time
---
Then ally wars get another good quest weapon
---
We were doing chromag the other day and a lock kept jumping the 2nd tank in threat when time lapse breath was coming.  It was a fun couple minutes and a few of us were rewarded with losing our beautiful buffs
---
Yea, there are some variables. The more people getting ranked also means more ranks. When the system first releases it is going to be insane. It will be a little easier to obtain later into the servers life. I really don't know how people do it.
---
Spending 8 hours playing classic WoW sounds like a win if you ask me!
---
Was a video out about turning some skin into items to vendor it's like 6s per minute average. Great for afking while at work or something but the time to craft makes it pretty meh if you're able to actually play then killing mobs is far better.
---
i remember farming AV for many weeks to get this.
---
Or craft nightband as a lw and vendor it or disenchant
---
My friend and I started playing this weekend.  Wes got to Lv3 and started yawning and we hit Lv5 and got bored and we called it quits.  I want to make it into a dungeon to see how different it is but man...  p.s. Vul'jun was in the starting area and killed a raid boss possible queen of the naga? Wtf
---
We got to Lv 12 yesterday, did a quest in Durotar where I got inflicted with a dangerous curse and it transformed me into a strong demon with +25% crit and regen (meaningless).  Most RP destroying Mary Sue shit ever, right in the starting area.  So we started leveling through BG's which is a thing.
---
None of our abilities cost mana, don't have cooldowns longer than a couple seconds, and we have no fear of getting killed.
---
God I can't even digest how much has changed.
---
Everyone has that one guy on the server EVERYONE knew about. Best possible gear every patch, with the most rare mount, sitting on a mantle on the bridge in Ironforge, letting everyone gawk at them. That guy on my server was Bane - Human paladin. He was the one to get the Scarab Lord title on the server. 
---
Point being I remember this guy, and I loved the way you put it, I don't remember anyone in my guild when I was playing Legion.
---
Maybe not
---
But
---
During the skinning grind u also get leveling xp so its not time wasted
---
Maybe you are lucky and find an epic to sell
---
Alternatively take mining
---
Search for silver ore and dont smelt it
---
A few weeks into a new server there will be lv60s spending a lot ( even 3-5g an ore) to powerlevel their blacksmith and engi
---
But i like me. I want to be me in a fantasy world. I enjoy games more when i relate to my character and that usually means they are some guy who is a fish out of water in a fantastical world
---
It was meant to be a series, but the second one was never fully produced as far as I can remember. Definitely one of my favorites! 
---
I've done some BRD farming on a Pserver.
---
First you really want to respec into sub for it, it can be done as combat, but it's too much of a pain in the ass due to how slow you'll be and getting constantly spotted by mobs, making it almost not worth the effort.
---
You can farm around 40-60g per hour depending on how efficient you are and if you have mining for dark iron.
---
You'll get a ton Major HP pots that sell well on AH, lock boxes, a few gems and more Gut Rippers than you'll know what to do with. The rest of it comes from pure currency or vendor trash. Luckly you can sell all of it at the bar in BRD.
---
It's not quite as good as what mages and hunters can farm, but it's better than what most other classes can do.
---
Problem is, it's mind-fucking-numbingly boring and can also get pretty frustrating due to mobs resisting pickpocket and killing you.
---
Wrong sub, dude.
---
Where did you get the data? Was it another survey?
---
Also, for your class breakdown. A hint should be put in that paladins and shamans are only available for one of the factions, thus the actual population in their respective faction would be about twice as high.
---
Also, the data regarding the class breakdown you have here leads to similar results as all the other surveys I have seen.
---
I've used only one day of my vacation time since the Blizzcon 2018.
---
To think there wasn't BiS or best spec tree setup is short sighted. 
---
I remember having to use a guide on how to setup my paladin (only for one raid but still a raid ) a few weeks before TBC came out. 
---
It was expected of you 
---
&gt;able to actually play then killing mobs is far better.
---
That makes sense thank you.
---
So if possibility im going to the toilet i can make some stuff otherwise just sell raw leather :)
---
I remember playing on Khadgar - Horde with a Warlock named Sayde and a druid named Helga I think.. we were in a guild called Essence of Evil - Pookkie was our leader, Locain was a rad rogue who helped me get my first epic (Fiery War Axe on my melee hunter.....) then there were others. The names are a distant memory but I couldn’t tell you the guild I raided WoD with so..
---
Smart boi
---
There's nothing wrong with that. You just don't want to be expecting world of roguecraft levels of power.
---
I found that the wife did the same eye roll and scoff when I told her I would be home for a week playing classic.
---
It must be so hard for non gamers to wrap their brains around the fun and dedication we put into a game we enjoy
---
So about the 1 dps pulling aggro wiping the whole raid. The way threat works in vanilla and tbc is that the tank will have aggro, and i order for you to get aggro you will have to do his threat + 30%. So if he has 10000 threat you need to get more than 13000 in order to take aggro. This means that theres always a couple of players at like 11000 threat or 12000 threat, so if 1 person get aggro and dies, the tank wont get the aggro back, as the person with the next highest threat takes aggro, so the person with 12000 threat. So the boss will keep killing players until the tank gets aggro. And in especially classic the locks get a lot of aggro (hunters do too, but they can fd) so if a lock takes aggro the boss will run away from the tank making it harder to get the aggro back, and the boss will just kill enough people until you cant do the boss. A reason behind why it works like this is that taunt doesnt work on most bosses, so the tank cant instantly taunt the boss back to him. 
---
amen, brother
---
Horde 4 lyfe
---
We will never have that fun again
---
Its gonna be much more tryhard now and robotic

When this subreddit was formed, I wasn't a moderator here, not joining until early 2018. However, my understanding is that r/classicwow was trying to differentiate from r/wowservers (which was a much larger subreddit than r/classicwow at the time), a subreddit that catered to private servers. As such, the rule was instated to essentially ban the naming or promotion of private servers. The only exception to this is Nostalrius, as it obviously had significant implications in the development of Classic WoW. We very rarely have ever banned anyone for naming or promoting private servers, but we'll remove posts and usually send a message asking the person to avoid it in the future/direct them to our rules (#1 and #4, primarily).
---
So, the question about a screenshot from a private server? Hard to say and it's at least somewhat a grey area. If you post a screenshot from a private server of Elwynn and title it "I've always thought Elwynn was a great low-level zone," well, there's a good chance it'll be left alone. Obviously, a lot of guide videos that come out are probably built on private servers or personal/local hosts of a private server repack. The main outcome we're trying to generate on r/classicwow is to 1) focus on Classic, not private servers and 2) direct any meaningful private server discussion or advertisements to r/wowservers.
---
We're not always perfect, and there's going to be some variance depending on which mod sees your post first. We communicate frequently between one another to get second opinions or to ask "hey, was removing/not removing this post correct?" to try and all get on the same page, but even with that, we'll moderate somewhat unevenly.
---
tl;dr: your post of an Elwynn screenshot might be fine, but it's case-by-case.
---
EDIT: As a side note, people that try to post around the auto-filter that removes private server names, by using special characters or spaces or whatever, will actually result in getting themselves temporarily banned. It's one thing to break the rules without realizing it (I'd say we're very lenient in that scenario), it's a whole other thing when there is obvious intent to circumvent the rules.
---
Wake me up when spring ends.
---
Id say like 20 hours-30, compared to what, 600+ in WSG and AB? Sounds balanced
---
Tauren hunter reporting for duty!
---
It will be the same in many ways! Even with all the resources we have access to now! A lot of people will:
---
1. Not be optimized.
---
2. Altaholics so they will always be sub-optimally geared.
---
3. It will still take long to level for the average player and people will die. 
---
4. World PvP will distract and slow people down. 
---
5. You will actually have to rely on other players.
---
Could go on and on but there will be many ways you can set yourself apart and stand out.
---
Yes 1,5 % is too much for mistakes so there seems to be some self challenges going on here. 
---
Play however you like. if you wanna go in blind that's your choice just as going in prepared is our choice.
---
Many of us have been playing on private servers throughout the years. Personally what im looking forward to is being back on official blizz servers and all that comes with that. 
---
This is weird, every time I played on a private server, I saw hunters everywhere, but in this survey it seems horde hunter isn't that popular, I wonder why.
---
Hunter is an amazing class for levelling, farming gold, PvP and solo content.
---
Sure their dps isn't nothing special but they have good utility and buffs like furious howl and trueshot aura.
---
I would recommend a Kenmore combination toaster and oven with at least  a 3 amp heating coil and  nonstick pan over a surface pro..
---
The Kenmore would also cost less.
---
So can Arms if they do it right.
---
While you might want to spend some money on gear as a Warrior there are very few skills that need upgrades, and you can do fine with most being just r1.
---
Maybe for the first two months of launch or if you were a BRAND NEW player. Anybody with a modicum of experience back then, just like with any MMO, worked those things out fairly early on.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/ElitistJerks](https://wow.gamepedia.com/ElitistJerks)
---
That's why good tanks in Vanilla were so highly respected and sought after.
---
But I dont think anyone believes to be a shaman tank in late game. It's probably more about tanking some dungeons while leveling ... which can work.
---
The biggest takeaway for me here is that Cataclysm appears to have been the most pivotal post-launch moment in WoW history.  I'd love to know what Blizzard's internal metrics say about what happened to the subscriber numbers during that time.
---
For what it's worth, WotLK is the last time I really played WoW seriously.  I tried Cata and just didn't like it.  I've only dabbled since then.
---
&gt; Its gonna be much more tryhard now and robotic
---
Not in the pug scene. People won't have typical raiding talents, they will have leveling / grinding / pvp talents, just like in vanilla.
---
I'd say if you're in a "try hard" guild, then most of the dungeon groups will have someone with raiding talents, but I'd suggest that was how it was in vanilla too.
---
As far as being robotic, runs aren't shorter, they're not easier. We just have more info, so **some** of us know what dungeons we need to get those big upgrades, so people might be more picky about how they spend their time.
---
Dungeons will still need coordination, as far as "mage, please sheep the moon" or whatever, but there still has to be communication. You won't see much in the way of live's dungeon silences.
---
You will be super mobile as a Druid and able to spread heal with HoTs. You’ll just be hurting for mana pretty fast.
---
It's true that in Classic, class balance is as terrible as it gets, but at the same time, because the game difficulty is so dramatically lower, it also doesn't really matter.  That said, there are some extremes that are still quite difficult to deal with, like Protection Paladins as you said.  But Priest race doesn't really matter.  Fear Ward's not that big of a deal.
---
There is BG queueing in Classic, but it requires an NPC either at a capital city or BG entrance.
---
Druids are great healers; the problem is people looking at them as only healers.  However, I don't understand what you mean about Druids being a "legitimate hybrid" in Classic.  In my opinion, a hybrid in a video game means a character class that can seamlessly do multiple roles one after the other or simultaneously.  This is NOT Druid in Classic WoW.  They only do one thing at a time, and for some reason, people could not get that through their heads back then.  If you want to play a Druid as a hybrid, you can do that in BfA and have been able to since Wrath.
---
I'm excited too for a TBC and maybe even a Wrath server.
---
&gt; How did a single dps taking agro lead to everyone dying? If one dude having the wrong gear meant everyone died, then it sounds like encounters where always a close call, if something so small could make a difference.
---
Eh, I feel like most of these stories are exaggerations, if not outright apocryphal.
---
DPS pulling aggro and wiping the raid were pretty rare, and it generally only happened early in the fight.  "Wrong gear" really wasn't a huge deal, unless it was a healer or tank.  Even then, you could normally adjust unless you were attempting a progression fight.
---
Out of the hundreds of raid wipes I experienced in vanilla, I'd say maybe 1% were due to some individual failing.  The remaining 99% were raid-wide fails - learning the fight, collective gear level, etc.
---
i totally get this
---
Aggro doesn’t really mater when it comes to breath in the second phase. The problem was the cleave attack and possible tailwipe (knocking people into whelps).
---
Nothing would make me want to play with people less than spending an extra hour or two collecting raptor heads in the barrens while in a group of 5. You will need to collect 40 of them at around 20% droprate, competing against tens of other people.
---
On top of that, these magical friendships you will form will quickly disappear when most people quit around level 20.

**Guild Name and location**   
---
&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance  
---
**Language**  
---
English     
---
**Guild Type**   
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with mandatory PvP Events     
---
**The Philosophy**   
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.  We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm first and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.     
---
**What we expect of you**  
---
 We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out, as long as you have a mindset that’s willing to learn. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay, and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay.   We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release. May this be on the (hopefully) upcoming Test Servers, or meetings of some sort in the guild. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.      
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule**  
---
(GMT+1) Wednesdays 18-23   
---
Thursdays 18-23   
---
Mondays 18-23   
---
During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up     
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge! [https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj](https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj) 
---
Just don't run it under a blacklight.
---
You are thinking of deep breath, im talking about the normal breath attack all dragons use.
---
you realise that catana is cut?
---
I had the opposite experience, the reinforcements created the tutrtle meta. 
---
1.11 AV, everyone rushed, when 1 side was losing, most people would just give up because turtling was pointless. Maybe 1/5 games people would turtle, but it was in the minority.
---
When reinforcements hit it was awful. Whenever i played in WotLK or BC it was ALWAYS a turtle with people doin crap like capping mines every game for resources. 
---
Every game would start out as a race, but with reinforcements it no longer meant an autolose if you were behind. So instead the losing team would turtle and try to squeeze out a win.

# &lt;Always East&gt;
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/ 5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have 46 Discord members. Of those, 37 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We are leaning towards EPGP at this time. The leadership has taken years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the tank who shows up the most often for raiding (whoever has the highest attendance and the points to spend on it at that time.)
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

---
These stats are deffo interesting but it's nice to know most people still choose flavor &gt; minmax.
---
I will roll a tauren hunter, which is theoretically the worst horde race for DPS, but that "Say hello to my little friend" gun pose our bovine friends have is just too good to pass.
---
Also, /moo.
---
Maybe not if you have downtime minimised already, but I find the delay to be very tolerable. Certainly more tolerable than grinding at 40 without a horse, even if that's faster.
---
But that's just a matter of what fits your play style. I don't care about efficiency. I have other goal, like completing every dungeon quest at level.
---
This will buff warlocks compared to the other ranged dps, however... Even though this is a straight buff to 1 dps class, it's unlikely to make a huge difference.
---
There is still a HUGE lack of +spell hit gear until ZG patch with bloodvine set. Remember, warlocks have no spell hit talents for destruction. 
---
So the damage buff to warlocks will make them even "swingier" where you could still miss 15 times in a row and do almost no damage for the fight, or you could hit every spell and get some crits, and pull aggro from the start of not paying attention, remember: warlocks get no -threat talents for destruction.
---
Yep and that's why vanilla is great in my opinion i still remember a lot of the guys i raided with,pvped with and just had fun with, in Legion or hell even the brief period i played BFA with i just purely remember my real life friends everyone else is just a non factor.
---
Still remember to this day PvPing and raiding with a guy named Broderick on Stormreaver US - Second most hated warrior ( though it was pure envy from everyone ) as he had every 2 hander you could think of and got Grand Marshal - Dark edge,Corrupted Ashbringer, Might of Menathil, Everything.
---
The most hated Warrior being Buttons, Fucking little gnome we would run FFA so the GM could take the gold for the Gbank, and he ninja'd the first Dark Edge and the rest of the loot from C'thun.
---
You can already play with upgraded graphics just play the retail version. Don't come and taint this version of WoW and ruin it for the rest of us.
---
People have been playing vanilla private servers. With old models for as long as wow existed. I don't see them ever complaining.

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The    Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally   created   in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest   corners  of  the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over   the  years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the   Burning   Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of   the   world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary  force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The    Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for   all  your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our    Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events  taking    place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however  that    concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be     introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We    wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will  often    spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even     outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
We need things like this in retail
---
I like to do skinning and herbalism/mining depending on race/zone, skinning is 100% guaranteed to be used in every zone enough to make money and level it up consistently, and then I pick the second one based on which will be more common in the zone (mining in Durotar for example)
---
I am curious as to where his data comes from as well, I have not seen the source with 18k entries.
---
r/copypasta
---
I don't that Classic is your cure. I think that Classic is your reanimation, and this sub is your life support up until then.

---
***A guild or community for parents playing Classic!***  
---
Back in 2004 when I was hyped like everyone else to check out this new MMORPG, having children was literally the last thing on my mind. I happily wasted many years of my life sitting in front of the computer in those halcyon years between finishing school and looking for a job. Now, almost half my life later I’m stoked to relive those early days albeit with the restrictions imposed by my 10 month old daughter, wife, mortgage, full time job and all of those other fun things that come with being a parent!
---
This time around I have nobody to join me on this adventure and I thought maybe a guild aimed at others like me could be an awesome way to create a community of people to enjoy the game with this time around.
---
Many veteran players remember the best thing about Vanilla being the community feel, and it would be awesome to develop a reputation for mature (yet fun!), veteran players available to help others. If you saw someone with our guild name above their head you know they’re going to be great to party or dungeon crawl with, or be able to hook you up with some alchemy, mage food etc.
---
Due to the time constraints imposed on us parents we’ll likely not be raid focused, however don’t think I wouldn’t love to as I never had a chance during Vanilla. If we can make it work, so be it. If you want to just sit in town and craft stuff that’s great. No expectations.
---
I’ve not decided yet if I’ll main Alliance of Horde, so that’s up for debate. Ideally we’d play on a PVP server. I know not the best idea for ‘casual’ players but I’d like the full experience.  
---
**Requirements to join:**
---
* Very loose although it’s obviously a guild aimed at parents.
---
* I am UK based and will therefore likely play a EU server
---
* Of course all genders are welcome, it’s only named Fathers of because Parents of... doesn’t sound quite as good. Maybe someone will set up a Mothers of !
---
* Prior WOW experience isn’t necessary. I played at launch until WoTLK and that was it, so when it comes to anything recent I’m pretty useless. Hoping most members will be vets though.
---
* No minimum play times, I’m hoping I can squeeze a couple of hours a night (he says, hiding this post from his wife..) and the odd bit here and there at weekends etc.
---
* Leave the ego at the door please.
---
I know we are a good few months off of launch but always good to get out ahead, if there is a decent interest I’ll set up a discord where we can get to know each other ahead of launch day.
---
We have a Discord, please do join even if you are a parent and have a guild already, we are establishing a community of parents that will be playing Classic. [**https://discord.gg/eq75evx**](https://discord.gg/eq75evx)
---
Sell shit. Do quests.
---
If you play on a pvp server Engineering -&gt; Iron grenades.
---
I'm probably going to put in for a week when it is announced too. I could probably have 2 weeks or more saved by that point but I doubt I could take more than a week. I think I would just plan to play and see how far I get, not necessarily aim for a particular level. I more so just want to be apart of all the launch excitement because I think that enthusiasm will be very special and unique for the time and I want to be their.
---
Be aware Questie is unlikely to be available in any form for Classic, unless they are able to develop a mod on beta before launch.
---
I feel like this mindset is not super helpful for a healthy and sustainable classic.
---
Oh god. There is actually such a site... for a game... a decade old game. Gotta look into that. Thanks for sharing.
---
You can run classic on a private server on a tablet today at 300 FPS 
---
My personal opinion is no, not noticeably. Some zones run in a more streamlined fashion such as durotar (you work south to north), whereas somewhere like Elwynn is a little more move south then east then west again. In terms of quest difficulty zones with more caves and group quests can often be a challenge. 
---
If you care about time/speed running then I’d look up a guide for that, else I would go with what you want to do for enjoyment (likely staying in the 1-10 zone). Most people only run across the world for the 10-20.
---
Chris Rock: Never Scared  
---
"Clear Heels!!"
---
I played the demo, and it did look better, but still very dated. More ground clutter and draw distance doesn't change poor low poly count models.
---
I thought those NPCs were "hostile but neutral" to Alliance, IOW, they're red, but they don't attack on sight. You have to attack them before they attack you. I may be thinking of how they were in a later iteration of the game--Wrath or something.
---
I mean, they're not so bad and the game's not so hard that you can't clear raids with Druids of any spec.  And that's all it should come down to.
---
I thought you played PVP because it was fun, not because of the rewarrrrds.
---
"Clear Heels!"
---
Wouldn't it be better to unleash the reckoning stacks with SoR? As far as I know SoC won't proc on the extra hits while SoR does
---
So long as it remains in the starting zones, it won't be a dealbreaker. You spend only 2-3 hours in these zones, the quests you join up for are very quick, and most players are still deliberating if they even want to stick with their character.
---
Sharding of Barrens and Westfall however becomes a big issue. These zones have longer quest chains, more quests that require grouping, more resources to compete over, and most importantly, this is where you start forming instance groups.
---
People do not pay for private servers. I am of the opinion that private servers not having a fee was always their best selling point for most people. What makes people leave private to come to classic if the same experience is available for free?
---
Like others have said, BiS lists and class guide were formed pretty quickly in vanilla, so I don't know who you've been talking to.
---
And it's not like you wont have a vast amount of lazy people who don't want to bother to look things up and they'll just ask gear/class/quest questions in Trade and Guild chat, like always.
---
You do know what BiS means, right? Regardless of the chances of getting something, if it is the best in slot then... Well, I'm sure you know what I'm going to say. Now, if you say it's a realistic BiS, then sure, that'd be different. Then again, people wouldn't take a ret (and definitely wouldn't give it gear over a Warrior) so they wouldn't get half the gear so this post is pointless.
---
Classic WoW will have battlemasters, but if you play on a PVP server, I have no doubt about world PVP!
---
Jimmy got ganked outside!!
---
We should fight for him!!
---
Exactly this, I haven't taken any days off yet this year. Will be taking 2 weeks at release to play all day :p 
---
I won't be going full no life so not sure I'll hit 60 in that time, 12 hours a day over the 2 weeks will get 7 days played, I've done 60 in under 7 days played before but that was with lots of rested time which I won't have.
---
Wasn't there a full buffed Ret-Paladin who pulled off 1.2K dps on Patchwerk ? 
---
Sell an epic, lol. 
---
Yeah the feeling of not knowing was a big part of what made the FIRST experience so good, the exact same experience I had when I first played Runescape back in 2003. But that doesn't mean that classic will be a bad experience when you're returning, the game is still good, the sense of community is there, the need for farming to get anywhere is there, etc etc.. and those were the reasons the game was so damn good and became legendary amongst the gaming community.
---
There's a reason private servers are doing so well that it even sparked Blizzard themselves to finally realize that there's a BIG part of the community that wants the old game back.
---
Priest T1, T2, T3, T5, T6 were all beautiful. 
---
As a quirky side-note; when the Black Market was introduced in later expansions, the tier 3 sets lost their class restricted transmog rules = my warlock is running around in full vestments of faith as a joke. :P
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
It's been so long since I've played, and playing a new class/race itll still feel the same. Just nostalgia alone is what's going to make it 
---
They are, I agree, but in my experience not many druids play tank, and even fewer paladins, so it doesn’t fix the shortage.
---
Yeah im planning on not wasting any money. I will take skinning. Thank you!
---
Don‘t forget about the Diablo1 Tristram Theme!
---
Savage
---
4head
---
But if you arent oom, ever, why wouldnt you be able to afford them? Whats purpose of having 6k mana and 10% less healing if I will never empty 5k mana pool with constant potting?
---
Apparently you have to blindspot him
---
Awesome. Thank you. Any tips on which bags to get and the best way to get them? Also, how do i know which skills i have to buy and which ones i dont have to buy? Im planning on playing a rogue
---
Biggest tip is do not buy every spell from vendor. That's like 30-40g right there.
---
Good luck getting more than onyxia and a few bosses in mc  with pugs
---
31 Ret is a pretty solid 1v1 spec that can beat just about anything that can't kite you. Once you get T2/2.5 the stun or repentance + holy light = back to ~100%. Given that you can do that twice in 1min and also have a bubble you are difficult to kill. Combine that with a solid 2H and ret becomes formidable. 
---
I plan on playing alliance for classic but I've been playing horde on pservers and it is nice to see just how different the experience is for the other side
---
Thanks. Im not planning on following a guide. I want to focus on my mount and maybe start doing professions later on. So the only thing i should be spending money on is bags at the start?
---
If you skin all beasts from 1-40 and sell what you get, you'll have enough. You should be around 300 skinning by the time you're 40. Keep or sell on the ah all of the thick hide you get. If you're 37-38 and you don't have more than 50g, I would recommend grinding the beasts in SoS or STV (if you're brave). You can easily make the rest of the gold there through grey items and skins. 
---
Thank you!
---
Your never oom with constant potting because you go for efficient heals I assume. But if you went for more inefficiency, it would happen, wouldn't it? 
---
Haha i know but  im not gonna play a lock
---
Is that OG Tigerlady I see in group?
---
Ask mages, good tip thank you
---
Warlocks are pretty amazing in pvp actually. For good pvp guides i would recommend checking out the Nostalrius class forums.
---
Also here is one of my favourite "vanilla" (priv. server) pvp videos and its a warlock [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0)
---
&gt; Ah, nvm. You arent here to talk about the game... byebye. 
---
correct me, but you are in the reply chain whereby I've given the complete answer to the OPs question. Why PvE and older than 1.9 patch servers pvp specs suggest no stun procs in talent builds along with what has changed with 1.9 to make them viable
---
You on the contrary have done nothing other than trying to defend the theft, abuse and violation of blizzards property for personal gain - just because it is your hobby?  
---
Now that's leaves me a bit puzzled  who is not here to talk about the topic of this thread
---
Junc was the best PVP hunter on our server. I still remember that to this day and I never spoke to the guy once. 
---
your kidneys
---
i played in a hardcore guild back in the day as OT.  we did a few bosses in Naxx but then our MT and GM ended up leaving for Death and taxes and the guild kind of broke up after that.  also found out our MT went on to become a multi rank 1 glad and pro LoL player for a bit but he was always insanely good.  But during progress i had 100% attendance, partially because i was in college and had a good amount of free time, but i also enjoyed playing a lot.  
---
i stopped going to almost every AQ 20 and ZG after we did it a couple times.  but i was at just about every 40 man.  being in college i maintained a good social life.  most progression was during the week so usually fri/sat i had time to be social, but that is really a guild schedule thing.
---
So much this and then when it finally drops a tank or hunter rolls for it and wins. 
---
Is the imp quest available at level 1 immediately upon entering the game?  I always thought you had to complete that first kill quest for it to open but a current pserver has it available immediately. Was real vanilla that way ?
---
Why would you assume cross-realm will not be a thing? If Classic is based on 1.12, wouldn't it make more sense to assume it will be a thing? And I really hope it will be.
---
Cutesybutton(H) and Lobomos(A) first two warglavies and guild leaders of the strongest guilds of their respective factions on Cho'gall. Isle of Quel'Danas was a blood bath for months.  Honorable mention to Handoverfist sitting 16k hp unbuffed up on top of org bank. 
---
Based on what exactly, your opinion?
---
Alliance hates Fel magic. Not surprised but just interesting looking at that warlock distribution.
---
I would look for some guides on youtube for rogue , Kargoz on youtube has pretty decent guides for every class. As for bags, I would google which mobs has the highrst chance for a drop as well as which vendor sells bags. The game will be a grind fest, I am not sure but I think humanoids have the highest chance of dropping a bag, but I might be wrong, hope that helps :)
---
If you mean if I allow myself a regrowth here and there, I do like it rolling on tank (if im swiftmend).
---
As 24/0/27 druids literally never go oom since they only spam 2 ranks of HT which is the most efficient way of playing the spec, they also give their innervate away cause they just wont need it, while swiftmenders are "allowed" to use on themselves. 
---
I mean I said I see the value of hotw spec, especially early on when gear will be dogshit and mana pool even worse, and defo for someone who wants to have same spec for farm/raid/tanking dungeons.
---
I just dont see the point in keeping it once mana is less of a problem.
---
They never were restricted because the only way to obtain them were class specific quests.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
except dwarf priests get free invites
---
The response.  Remebering when people played av in vanilla.  How they play it on pservers...
---
DRAKEDOG!  Felhunter in the streets, Succubus in the sheets.
---
They're a ton of fun.  You'll never feel like you can't hold your own when you're fighting out in the world all the way to Lv60.  They've got some of the most consistent burst in the game.  Compared to frost mages, they do more damage with the tradeoff survivability.  Fire mages are mushy and lack the utility.
---
For PvP you should be using all of your pets except Imp.  Just depends on your comfort level and what you're expecting to be up against.
---
Only in dreams..
---
Warstomp is very underrated. It's saved my and won so many battles.
---
Classic is a very deep and "wide" game, there are tons of things to discover and keep your sense of wonder engaged, especially if you never played it. trust me. 
---
the info points you mentioned is a VERY surface level. ya, for ppl that never played it, it might create this appearance that its everything about the game to wonder and expect, so whats the point playing, but its not. its like 20% at best.
---
i've been playing on private servers for years, and still constantly learn new things, even on a basic level. like "damn i didn't  i know it".
---
also, joanas vanilla guide came out in vanilla, remeber? 
---
its just ppl in 2004-2005 that nostalgy about it, were too young or inexperienced in the internet so they didn't know what to look for. so for them it was all alone experience. there were movies, there were guides, there were nerd forums, there were trendy specs, there were op stuff ppl do, and copied from each other, everything was there back in the day. now its more, and more polished, no shit, but still.
---
ppl always looked stuff up in the internet and "spoiled" info. 
---
~
---
also i don't knwo why some ppl expect and its hard for them to comrehend that its not 2004, but 2019. I don't know why some category of ppl expect similar "virgin" experience, and then they get dissapointed and frustrated, when finally they realize its not.
---
personally i never looked at vanilla wow in 2019 like that. its really dumb to expect something like that really. noone even going for it, when ppl were signing a petition. 
---
I've got just enough free time to play 1-2 hours a night, so...I'll hit 60 around June of 2027. Then I can really focus on that fire resist gear over the next 5-7 years.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I think people that actually hit 60 will be a different looking set of data, for sure. 
---
You’re saying I can actually get my rep rewards in decent time and not have to dedicate whole weekends on end for months to get to exalted, all because some ass who should be playing on an RP server has to turtle for hours? Oh heavens
---
I’m gonna take the 15/20 min average AV all day, along with the rest of the non-mouth breathing population  
---
i feel this 
---
I'd say azeroth level 1-30 and then you can choose between Outlands, Northrend, Pandaria, WoD, Broken Isles and KulTiras for 30-60 but that's just me.
---
Pretty much, yeah. Upgrade your bags when you can afford it and don't make extraneous purchases and you'll make it easily, even if you're a chain wearer. 
---
The 60 population will look very different. Some people won't make it, others will reroll.
---
I’m in a bit of a unique situation (maybe?) in that I played both quite heavily during Vanilla. I initially rolled Alliance and was heavy into PvE on my rogue and go through AQ 40. Then I quit for a bit and rolled Horde and played an enhancement shaman focused on PvP. Got him to rank 12 before the honor switch happened. And then I continued to play horde until about wotlk. 
---
So while I’ve already done the faction switch and experienced a fair amount on both I’m still struggling and ultimately might do both again. Playing alliance has given me a ton of nostalgia lately on pservers, but I’m torn in that I want to play both a shaman and a pally. I’m just gonna focus on having fun, I’ve had my hardcore raiding days, I’ve had my hardcore PvP days, and now I’m gonna be somewhere in between, probably with both factions. 
---
Yeah I figured it was mostly personal preference as I only have vanilla experience in Durotar and the nelf zone, but I can say with 100% certainty that the nelf zone is like 3x harder than Durotar, especially when it comes to the amount of 1 person only can get loot even when grouped and the spawn time is 3 years bull shit (fucking stupid ass dresser) or the 500 caves with 3 million mobs each
---
I think it's a bit of both. The values were starting to get out of hand. I prefer the more manageable numbers.
---
They could have modified the engine, but do we really need players with millions of HP doing millions of points of damage to a boss with a billion HP? Why not slash four zeroes and get this back to numbers people can understand?
---
In another thread we found a few possible reasons for that:
---
* For PvP you would want to go horde because then you don't have to face WOTF. Since fear is a very important factor for WL PvP, this reasons seems to make sense.
---
* If you also look at the race distribution, you can see that undead is by far the most picked race for WLs. This might be due to the class fantasy favoring undeads.
---
So it probably boils down to flavor and a little optimization regarding PvP.
---
I remember once i started on a fresh private server and made a fortune by selling bloodstone (i think?) ore that i mined from arathi highlands
---
you need 2 of them for a quest in booty bay and i would just grind mobs in that cave and farm that ore and sell them in stacks of 2 on the AH (and neutral AH) and i made quite a lot
---
it dies off quickly when the influx of new levelers dies off
---
Tirion?
---
Make a name that you think is witty, get to level 20, realize that it's a stupid name or it shortens to something stupid and you just can not spend the rest of your time with this character
---
My opinion... unless you are in some hardcore PvE guild, those advantages are pointless. You can make up for that stuff by just bringing more consumes and knowledge. PvP racials are so noticeable, like orcs. Also people generally just like undead models more so they should go with what they like. 
---
Uh yes you can
---
10 agi on a warrior = 0.5% crit
---
Group of 4/5 dudes looking for a horde, east coast raiding guild. Aiming for raid times that end before 11:30 est if possible. We come from a top 40 US raiding background with multiple dps parses that reached #1 during WoD and Legion.  We also love pvp. Not pushing for world 1sts, but aiming top of server as we have had previously. Various Raiding experience going back to Vanilla. Message/comment if you are a guild looking for a group like us.
---
So far we have a warrior(tank/dps), rogue, mage,priest(healer), hunter. 
---
Thanks! I definitely want to level in NE zone, I love that Ban'ethil Burrow Den area. 
---
^I ^might ^be ^sick.
---
Classic is my city
---
LET'S EAT UNTIL WE THROW UP!!
---
Vanilla item names were so great. Something current wow lost long ago was the feeling of getting a long sought item with an epic name.
---
Classic will be my fourth time i've made a new account, gotten to 60, and raided AQ. Never got to Naxx though, i either quit, was too slow, or a p-server never got to that point. Aiming for Naxx in classic cause it's official servers, and i don't feel like i am wasting my time as much as on a private servers. Spending 16 hours straight is easy. The hard part is having a social life and work while doing it.
---
I spent a lottttt of time farming crusader orbs in tyr’s hand. Looking back, it was really inefficient but it paid for my epic mount. 
---
I don't know how to feel about flintlocke anymore. The guy who made Flintlocke, Dave Kosack, was hired by Blizzard and proceeded to cause the post-cataclysm everything-is-a-joke Azeroth - partly, I guess, because the humor in flintlocke was so well received.  
---
&gt;  hunters because you hardly share any loot with other classes.
---
rogue ferals?
---
Back in vanilla over summer break, I got a rogue all the way to 60 in under weeks real time. I hear nowadays it’s not that hard with private server people but for 14-15 year old me it was an achievement. I didn’t eat or sleep too much. 6-7 days played. 
---
[This](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/sluggy/images/0/0a/Bunbun.JPG) is Bunbun tho.
---
There was a recent poll that someone did that basically showed that lots of people will do 2 gathering (inc skinning) and then drop one at 60. I would think this is reasonable for making gold. 
---
Rogues are better farmers than most other classes at 2 things:
---
- Ooze covered thorium veins in Silithus. Rogues can stealth into the silithid caves to reach nodes a lot easier than other classes can
---
- RFD ghost mushroom run. I mostly did this while farming Coldrage Daggers for Viscidus. There are either 4 or 5 ghost mushroom nodes that can be easily picked up.
---
Devilsaur farming (with a friend, preferably) or Black Lotus/herb farming still probably pay more than those 2 options
---
I never found pickpocketing to be especially lucrative, but this may have been due to incorrect rates on private servers
---
Definitely thinking of a different item.
---
I used Earthshaker for the same thing. It’s like Unstoppable, 2h mace, around the same damage (62 or 63dps), but the proc is an APE 3 second stun/knockdown instead of a single target 1 second. You could stop the whole bridge zerg with 1 proc. 
---
[deleted]
---
Idk about them but I wasn't clever enough at 13 to think to make an alt just as a bank.
---
Maybe your kids need medication or something cause like 50% of my guild has kids and they seem to do alright
---
Wow, way to mislead people. I pretty clearly said that it has around a 0.3% effect, because the number of bank alts is insignificant compared to the amount of people at endgame. 
---
I shouldn't have to explain this, but if you have 10 characters at levels 1 to 3 and they are 100% Warriors, it barely moves the needle when you have 1000 level 60s.
---
Interesting that you chose not to post the 50-60 range...
---
I was always told 3 points at least in spirit tap. Brings your downtime WAY down.
---
Every 40man raid - yes. Tho you will probably have 2 "MTs" and another 2 warriors that will pick up tank loot next. 
---
So with that in mind, once BWL is out, you can probably skip some MCs or bring an alt (assuming some can cover for you). But yeah, once aq40 is out you probably still wont be able to dodge BWL, since it takes bit more brain than MC or 20mans.
---
Friend and me (prot warr and rdruid) leveled alts of each others classes so we would swap to our alts and raid was losing nothing (never brought alts to naxx tho).

---
agi gives more than just flat out crit, it gives (depending on class) attack power, dodge, armor and crit where a stat like crit rating just gives you crit. it makes for a easier time fine tuning and balancing equipment pieces imo
---
Once the aq war effort starts Rep is a non issue
---
It's 5 in wand specialization first. Your base Regen is so high that you won't even need the spirit tap yet
---
E'kos in Winterspring. Elementals for GFPP, GNPP etc. Any open world mobs that provide some sort of raid consumable.
---
I forgot the./s. It seems it's a must on this sub.
---
I've done that as well :) I usually listen to the game music, but when I've muted it and listened to my own, I wind up always associating those songs with gaming moments. Die Antwoord reminds me of grinding in Valencia in BDO, and Azealia Banks reminds me of powerleveling in SWTOR. I've never intentionally managed to make that link though - I'm going to try it!
---
Hell yeah! I love the vibes. 
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but won’t Rogues be the best farmers until Phase 2? 
---
BRD stealth runs will be an option at launch. DM won’t be out for months. 
---
Is there something I’m missing?
---
Fury got buffed somewhere in the middle of vanilla. It was also super gear dependent and the gear that makes it function just wasn't around yet.
---
No chance
---
Very fresh server? Go Spirit Tap because it will be difficult to get a WAND. (Here) [https://youtu.be/7--FKSEXkFw] is Kargoz' video on how to rush wands on a newly released server. 
---
Mature server? Get a wand ASAP, the DPS is insane and mana free. At most, alternate points between Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap. 
---
I have a few family members that are really into them - I just haven't found a blend that I like enough to want in my own space. I stick with Eucalyptus when I'm getting sick, basically. Candles are more fun :) 
---
6-7 days played on a rogue is good even nowadays so you must've been playing a lot. I'm going for 6-7 days played on hunter for Classic :9 
---
Unbreakable! Come on, bro
---
Pffft. Troll is the best horde race and female troll is best troll. 
---
Your op asks why people aren’t up in arms then suggests blizzard should do it your way because people are up in arms.
---
Which is it.
---
It's actually closer to 100 to150 depending on class
---
Okay okay, 0.1% (you) will be a female troll too. 
---
Pf, that was me this weekend.
---
On the bright side, 48-103 on a priest in 2 days.  Woo.
---
depens on if you can get your hands on a good want ;)
---
People got it in a day or two when AV first went in during vanilla without the bg ever finishing. The first AV on proudmoore lasted three days and many were exalted on day 2. Win/loss is not the only way to get rep in that joint.
---
&gt;. Aiming for Naxx in classic cause it's official servers, and i don't feel like i am wasting my time as much as on a private servers.
---
I have the same issue. I have been a hardcore wow player since late vanilla and have owned many accounts over the years on retail and private server. But i have never been able to fully commit to private servers the same way I can official ones because I feel like im wasting my time when its not a real blizzard server :s
---
This is like when people claim it's not good just nostalgia.
---
Then you play it and realise that that is bullshit
---
Was sorting the order your characters were in on the selection screen available on the demo?  I thought i read it was, but that was months ago and i cant remember...
---
They did make a trailer for the second one, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyFEPZ5MpK8). I think the guy who produced it is now actually working for Blizzard. 
---
I was going to suggest a talent in the Ret tree that makes Consecration also heal allies that stand inside it, but I forget that Consecration was a Holy talent at the time.
---
Getting exalted with the other factions allows you to ride their respective mount. 
---
I have a fever and the only prescription is more ~~cowbell~~ Classic WoW blue posts
---
Seems like fun content. At first glance I would think they should implement it whenever they go for the dungeons loot tables revamp (AQ phase?), especially if you can get additionnal catch-up gear from the summoned bosses. 
---
Unrelated question: are the 0.5 quest chains class-locked or can you get, for instance, the rogue 0.5 as a feral druid if you have the shadowcraft set?
---
There are some tricks I've read about Tailoring &amp; Entchantment, to quickly build your own lesser magic wand. Also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/al39rw/vanilla_wands_spreadsheet/) thread shows a nice overview of wands. Maybe it is helpful for you :-)  
---
If you are able to get a wand by level 10 I would start with wand specialization. I will only invest 3/5 in spirit tap this time, because in most cases it proccs often enough to secure me a steady flow.
---
But I will start together with a rogue and around 10+ we will meet with warrior. Therefore it does not affect me as much as others, because we plan to stick together most of the time and my main job will be to keep my minions rolling. :-)
---
Hey thanks!
---
You’re right, my bad.
---
Warriors are the least hybridy tanking class. It makes sense that they're the best tanks.
---
Great point... I wonder though if people taking the survey just pushed what they think will be fun? When they start playing they may change their mind. This is the question.
---
I ended up farming eternal fires and sold them on AH, I was a warrior and knew fellow warriors would eat them up, if not anyone else. Had mount right at 40 plus some plate gear.
---
I am too old... eight more will probably kill me now...
---
Just get 8 piece tier 2 :P
---
I just prefer to see the full item stats listed as it is on the item, instead of a select few.
---
*shrug*
---
Not to get your hopes up too much but ... Boomkins do provide crit for 4 casters, and once ZG is out and Bloodvine set craftable that makes them even fine.
---
The flaw is, you reeeally gotta be good to have guild let you raid as one, plus you will put in more effort than other casters. Major mana pots on cd + innervate should be enough to keep you rolling, tho you might still oom on super long fights.
---
Personally I would often spec boomkin for content that was on farm or 20mans, those fights were short enough to not oom. But yeah helps if you have a good relationship with your guild, so you compromise on healing when needed and boomkin whenever setup can afford.
---
myep Ive seen even warriors use spirit gear for the first  20 levels or so cuz of how strong it is early on
---
HA! You're not wrong.. 
---
Main reason why I only played range in vanilla. Literally impossible to catch ANYONE as melee..
---
They couldn't do anything to fix it, the ship has sailed.   
---
There would be an uproar over anything that incentivices forming communities again, because in order to have incentive to form communities, you need the path of least resistance to be the community solution, and the only way to do that is pull back on quality of life features like LFD, lfr, titanforging etc.  
---
Those who enjoyed the community aspect of wow has long left, and the people remaining want their LFR LFD low skill instant gratification bonanza.  
---
You can complete the game by being afk/ on follow,  
---
do it for a few weeks and you'll have pretty high Ilvl to boot.  
---
The incentive to group up is purely for the "fun" of doing hard mode,  
---
good gear and the story is easily accessed without grouping.
---
The hardmodes you will be doing are the same encounters you've beaten 1-3 times before on different difficulties, before facing the final "difficulty where a few more sparkle effects might be thrown about.  
---
If you rush leveling and avoid dungeons, wont you fall behind in terms of gear ?  
---
I think you need honored or revered with your city for mount discount, dont think exalted adds anything.
---
With other cities exalted lets you buy their mounts.
---
I sure do hope item levels are hidden in classic. Though item levels didnt determine if an item was good back then anyway. Either way, I'd rather not see it and deal with it again.

Yeah, but the argument was that orc warlocks make much more sense in WoW than undead due to lore reasons. Thrall's statement shows they are ostracized and unwelcome, so it's ok to think they wouldn't be very numerous, or would hide themselves and not become adventurers in the world. 
---
Meanwhile, the forsaken have no such quarrels with demonic magic, and it actually fits them very well. They broke free from the control of the Lich King based on their force of will alone (represented by the racial will of the forsaken), and warlocks control demons and fell energy based on their force of will, as is written in the class's description in-game ifrc. 
---
This is spot on, even if literal lists and guides weren't a factor, word of mouth and "mentoring" from higher level players will more or less produce a general consensus on specs and items to seek.
---
There really isn't much of a reason to farm your races rep since there isn't really any relevant rewards and especially since you'll be nearly exalted with them, if not exalted with them, just by leveling as most quests give rep. The biggest reason people farm rep is to earn the other racial mounts as probably 90% of people will ride around on their races mounts for all of vanilla.
---
Are we sure that retail vanilla base regen was as high as private servers?
---
I see, thanks for your replies so far guys. I'll keep it in mind for when I work out the details when applying or replying to guilds :)
---
I know right, now a rogue is creeping in my mind... I havent thought that hard even when I asked my gf to marry me.
---
Hotw spec is worse for healing, there's no denying that. But you keep it for all the other stuff you want to do outside of raiding. The guy above probably doesn't have much time to spend on the game, will probably have less gold to spend on respects.
---
From then on, knowing he won't have the optimal healing osec, we're trying to minimize that. Since he'd have more mana, he should itemize for more +healing and maybe use healing that are less efficient Lana wise than you would normally, but heal more. 
---
T0.5 is targeted to the non-raiding casual player who still has access to the gold &amp; the ability to form groups to go out &amp; have some challenge in the game at the point it becomes available. It was never designed as catch-up gear, although there are a few exceptions where some pieces might actually be worthwhile for raiders. If you want catch-up gear, go farm ZG or AQ20 for the most part.

Arenas.
---
Been playing since season 1 and honestly arenas are the best part of WoW to me.  I'm hoping vanilla pvp is as exciting as I remember it to be and that I'm satisfied doing bgs because I'd really just like to stop playing retail all together 
---
Spicy
---
Also, possibly, because you don't have much of a choice about what gear you use for the first 20 levels 
---
&gt; In raids it will dies I pretty fast as healers won't heal it and you won't either as your ranged range is 40 yards which you aim to stay at and your mend pet range it 20 yards (30 with 3 t1 set) and it's a huge dps loss. 
---
so u stop dps to call it back for heals?
---
Not everyone made or makes banks (even if they should)
---
I know I never did lol
---
Honestly I dont think that should have ever been considered a problem. My biggest gripe with BC and all expansions going forward was the fact that it made all content before it obsolete. It would have been nice to see Blizzard take a more horizontal approach to progression. Not completely, but some middle ground between straight horizontal progression and what we got. 
---
Panic at the Disco
---
Fall Out Boy 
---
so many albums of that era bring me back but these two bands old cds in particular really bring me back to when I was like level 20-50 I must have spam listened to them for a few months straight 
---
I've heard of plenty of people alternating the points - so that whether you get your hands on a wand early on or not, you can still keep it. 
---
Seems like the easiest option for me, since it's harder to regret your choice ;) 
---
I can already see the legions of hunters with full Herod gear, just because they can. 
---
*Cries in warrior*
---
One thing I was always kinda dissapointed by was the 3D art didn't match up with that badass 2D art.  Woulda loved it if the TUF was more like a mace version of the Arcanite / Spinal reaper.
---
Don't get me wrong the spike pig mace is neat and all, but it just lacks that "doot" factor.
---
I would go Spirit Tap first. New server, fresh start, there wont be much wands in the AH and the other option is to grind it if you feel like it.
---
First wand you can get from vendor is at lvl 15. I agree that you will have plenty of mana and maybe Spirit Tap is overkill, but that means you will be very well sustained on mana and you can pull a mob after a mob without having to drink say every 3-4 mobs, it's a speed that shouldn't be neglected.
---
Loved BWL. Also have a soft spot for ZG and AQ20 mostly because we ran them so much as I wasn't in a guild that could support 40 raiders by the end of vanilla.
---
Yes and no.  The starting area regen is pretty well established.  But we don't really know how quickly / at what points it is supposed to taper off.
---
My priest will be 14 while I am 30 /cry
---
The most extreme direct example is baron geddon. One person gets the bomb and doesn't move out and kills the raid. But I don't think you mean that.
---
The best example I can think is something like a patchwerk fight or Vael. We're in a enrage timer fight and one DPS dying could significantly impact the success.
---
Honor
---
Depends a bit on the class - professions definitely help, but a big part is also to avoid overspending. 
---
Don't buy items from vendor that are slightly better than your current items, especially don't buy new green or blue items at the AH (there are some exceptions), only get your most important spells (training spells is super expensive in Vanilla). 
---
Why do you think the wrong sub? I have not played a retail since Cata and just wanted to refresh the memories on the charrs I grinded there while waiting for Classic. Took me about 1 hour to get screens, check the ruined MtHyjal and logout from Ashenvale peacefully, not even bothering checking the current state of WoW :) 
---
Plays in a submarine
---
It's not about knowing or not, just a fact that with lower pop servers it's going to be way harder to find people to raid. Pservers are so easy to find people cause you have literally 10-13k pop around the world at different times logging on. When u play on a eu or us server it'll be capped at 2.5k-3k and many of them won't even be raiding or only on at prime times.
---
Yup.  Exactly why I didn't buy it
---
They had good damage as long as they had mana.
---
And we seem to be in agreement, nothing wrong with that approach - until you hop in serious raiding pants.
---
I remember actually spamming r2 with that spec, but it was with around +1k healing from gear so r3-r4 would prob be more safe play in begining.
---
We're not but I think in the demo the Regen for priests was still pretty high. Plus I think each point of spirit gives a flat amount of Regen so it makes sense for your base Regen to be so high in the early levels especially since priests get huge bonuses to spirit as level rewards
---
It’s going to be different now that people have knowledge and understanding about the game that they didn’t while it was current. It won’t be easy though. I believe it was estimated about 1000 players total fully cleared Naxx before the release of TBC. It was quite the feat at the time
---
Awesome, you should check his bags and bank! Bet there's some sweet stuff in there based off your gear /smirk
---
Keeping a solid roster of 40+ players geared and ready to progress through Naxx is trickier than it sounds depending how good and fast your guild clears content. I am of the opinion that mechanically it won’t be too hard compared to modern mythic raiding, but the roster is tough. 
---
They already did that, it’s called The Burning Crusade.
---
Draw-backs would be low mobility and squishy-ness without good gear. Otherwise they were pretty great.
---
&gt;get up
---
&gt;think I'll play a quick game of AV to increase rep for those sweet epics
---
&gt;sunsets, it's still going
---
&gt;fuck I'll try again tomorrow
---
&gt;get up, try AV
---
&gt;It's the same AV
---
I still remember the character names of my two best buddies from Vanilla through TBC, on Executus-EU.
---
An undead warrior named Plätburk, and a tauren druid named Tauraz. I lost touch with them a long time ago and always wondered if they'd ever come back to WoW. Man, I miss those two.
---
But we must not look at the past with sadness and regret. Rather, we should look upon the future with excitement for all the new awesome friends we will make, and re-live through the glorious world of Azeroth once more!
---
/neckbeard out
---
This sub is barely 60k ppl. Classic will have more players then that. Problem solved
---
If you don’t like farming consumables nax prob isn’t for you. Search for hamsterwheel gaming, he just released a video as he was in the same boat at you (not completing nax) until recently and then he went to a private server and finished it and talked about his experience in doing so.
---
That said if your in a consistent raiding guild for vanilla and vanilla is out long enough there should be no reason why you wouldn’t eventually down all the content...
---
TLDR: you need to farm consumables to do nax for progression. That’s just how it goes in vanilla sorry, not everyone just gets to do all the content cuz they want to.
---
Wow awesome! ok that burst would be fun to use then
---
I envy people like you so much :), I will get 2 hrs every other day tops, including weekends. Real life has me by the balls.
---
2 raid nights with 7-8 hours total, 40 brained people that know how to play their class, good coordination and assigns.
---
On top of that few weeks of progress so everyone gets their FrR gear sorted and to sort 8 tanks for 4hm.
---
Im sure with 3 raid nights it would go faster but 2 wont be a deal breaker.
---
Once everyone knows what to do it just comes down to raid leading and coordination.
---
ok i will have to check out those guides eventually. nice PVP vid too
---
In Vanilla, I figured out which BRD bosses I could solo- it was a couple, though I forget which.  I was an enchanter, so this gave me access to a lot of enchanting mats, which was a good way to make money.
---
The mats to do the fiery enchant also came from soloable dungeons, as I recall-  I remember picking up money from that.
---
Short answer, enchanting is good on a rogue because you can get the mats easier than most.
---
This is kind of what I have been hoping for all along but I'm not sure it is likely. It gives them a chance to kind of "start over" knowing the consequences of all the design decisions that have been made through the years. If current WoW was made with the same design philosophy as Vanilla, we would have a completely different game... I am super hyped for Classic but it sure would be nice to have a chance for new content that is great, too. If they continued Classic into some sort of WoW 2 or something I would totally play it. 
---
I still speak to some of my old friends from vanilla, 10+ years later, have them on FB etc.
---
Yeah I agree with you, I feel like having some element of permanence to gear is a huge deal, and one of the reasons that vanilla itemisation was really good. When you got any slot upgrade it was a pretty huge deal and they lasted ages. I was wearing the 2% crit Blackhand's Breadth (spelling?) trinket for ages and ages. Having said that, you do have to draw a line somewhere, because otherwise you have to start putting like +10% crit chance on items to make them worthy upgrades. I feel there's probably an elegant solution in the middle somewhere. But that is one of the things that makes official classic and private classic servers so appealing, the knowledge that there isn't a full gear reset every patch.
---
Did you only read the title?
---
250??? man i had 350 - 400 on Dial up and then down to 300 with ADSL. you must of been in Sydney or something with decent cables.
---
I know, it's hard, but it takes more than one guy to take down a behemoth like WoW. It takes a whole board of directors.
---
To give you an idea back on a previous private server the average cost to raid naxx on a progression run was about 500g a run, and about 350g on a run when it's on farm. I did some calculations and if you compared illegal gold prices to the price of wow tokens/general gold inflation. That would be the equivalent of each mythic raid attempt costing about 3 wow tokens per person. So to have the time to farm that all 40 people would have to be pretty unemployed.
---
Where's the sleep dopesmoker guy
---
If I’m not mistaken they had a 3% crit aura for their raid
---
Dat rogue dps.
---
Well, druids are more or less taken to the raid for brez, de curse and to not waste loot, so in my opinion it doesn't really matter which pants you wear. But alright, we seem to be in agreement.
---
Why does that name sound so familiar? Did he release a video or something? Did you play on Bleeding Hollow?
---
Behold!  
---
the field where we grow the fcuks that we give about retail   
---
gaze upon it   
---
and see that it is barren
---
A warlock’s curse of shadows boosted a moonkin’s damage, as it increases arcane and shadow damage taken by the cursed target. You’re probably talking about the elemental shaman who missed out on the warlock curses. 
---
Aged like fine wine.
---
You will still have full guilds moving from private servers to classic. And tbh, Blizzard hasnt said anything about server population, have they ? They could initially aim for 4-5k per server to keep them healthy.
---
No, that would be really stupid as you'd lose a lot of dps. It's only really worth it to heal your pet if it has furius howl and you dont have to heal it more than once or twice on a long fight. Because furious howl will benefit all 4 melee's in your grp. And only when you get to later raids where you do less dps than everyone else. 
---
To the people that dont know about furious howl, its a pet ability with a ca. 15 secs cd which make your next attack do ca 50 dmg more, its aoe so your whole grp (not raid) gets it. 
---
What I was trying to say by your highlighted sentence is that your pet wont do a lot of dmg in raids, as a lot of bosses have aoe and thus requires you to heal it if you dont want it to die. Which will result in a big dps loss. 
---
not for leveling, the worst class to fall behind is warrior, and you only need a decent weapons, and quest will provide you those. But i highly recommend doing dungeons as you level, no only that is fun, but also is a great way to meet new people, and make friends, and thats really good in vanilla.
---
"topping the charts" for healing is fucking idiocy anyway.
---
Just wear the tranquility set bonus, spam it every cd and hot everyone.
---
They get a 350% armor modifier so they're pretty tanky, you can't cast heal spells while you're in moonkin form unfortunately but at least you're tanky while you're in it.
---
&gt; But obviously people think the subscription way of paying is better so..
---
No, but most aren't so entitled that they think companies give shit away for free.
---
Pros: you are buffing 4 casters with your crit buff so (assuming you are good) when you sum up and divide your joined dps it might show to be worth having a boomkin. You bring a combat res too!
---
Cons: you gotta work twice as hard to be competitive, you gotta mana pot on cd, you have to leave form to innervate yourself and lose GCDs for it. On long fights you might go oom for good, but yeah sign a pact for more innervates from restos.
---
Nah, SWC EU. There were probably a lot of Juncs to be fair. 
---
The problem with being a 29/11/11 Druid is if you're caught in caster form, you instantly die.  Moonkin gets bear armor so it accepts a bunch of trade off to solve that issue.
---
The reason is so they don't die to physical damage out in the wild.  Rogue repellent.
---
Because if your world doesn't include raids then the gear is not that big an issue. Think of that guy you know who mostly picks flowers, or farms outdoor stuff, or does questlines and reps. He doesn't need gear past what he can get in dungeons and crafted and likely doesn't care too much about it either.
---
There were a ton of casuals who made the world feel like it did, I expect we will see many casuals in an official classic that you would not see in a private server for any number of reasons. 
---
Most every class has one good raiding spec, not just your pet class.
---
Belt, leather belt. Leather belt ^belt ^belt ^belt
---
I really love faction conflict in vanilla. I shall see you in battle and give you the honor of my blade!
---
Much as I enjoyed AQ, BWL will forever be my favorite. Another Warlock in the guild was on satellite internet that couldn't handle the Fun\* that was the Suppression Room, so I'd multibox both Warlocks through it. 
---
Gonna do Eric Cartman and freeze myself.
---
party only but that's a hell of a boost anyway
---
Druids are best tank healers out there tho.
---
I think the fact that TBC wasn't that far away kind of turned off some "semi-hardcore" guilds from getting too worked up by Naxx.  With Classic being locked, I think many more people will clear it with time.
---
Yeah it gives all that. Don’t see how that’s a problem. But for a fury warrior you’re ONLY concerned with the crit, and you obviously don’t get the AP. 
---
I much preferred this system to the “x rating” one. Stats felt more valuable.
---
You can go either way, just adjust your playstyle to get maximum of your talents. Get a wand, go wand talents and only do few casts+wand shit to death. If you go spirit tap first do more casts (and still try to wand the last % so you are closer to the 5s regen rule).
---
&gt; New server, fresh start, there wont be much wands in the AH and the other option is to grind it if you feel like it.
---
The chat will be FILLED of ppl trying to sell these early on.
---
I only briefly played vanilla, at that time i was 12 and i used to watch my dad and uncle play. My uncle had me farm AV for him so i at least know how to be a shitty arms warrior who cant stance dance lol. I started my own account about midway through TBC. Leveled a hunter to max and I've played ever since.  I've tries a few vanilla private servers but i know they aren't 100% spot on so im excited for classic. I've read a bunch of guides, and watched many videos so i have a firm grasp of whats going on. Im gonna enjoy actual talent points again. The only negative stuff I've seen this far is everythings expensive, leveling a warrior is painful, and im going to miss mounts at 20 lol. The true struggle now is to figure out what to level first! 
---
I understand it's faster, I'm just saying that a lot of the time spent was because you were getting all the rep from kills if you weren't in a group. You only got rep from your kills. Once everyone was in a group rep chat was spammed with 1s, 5s, and 10s from people killing opposite factions, turning stuff in, capping, etc.  If you weren't in a group you missed out on all of that. 
---
I have the Surface Pro (2? i think?)  - and it runs vanilla private servers no problem at all.
---
Raiding might be an issue, but levelling and pvping is more than fine.
---
Rivers?
---
In 2004-05 I also was on dial up. Back then I had around 400-500 ms trying to play on my server, Spinebreaker - US. I'm on NBN currently and trying to PvP on retail I get around 200-250 ms connecting to US servers.

Engineering will be better for you, enchanting will be better for your guild *IF* you also plan on grinding out some of the more difficult recipes (Crusader, Timbermaw rep for 2H Agility, etc). 
---
Engi is bis pve and pvp proffesion once you wanna get into those pants. Your guild will prob have dedicated enchanter who will have all recipes aswell.
---
Btw what bags you mean, mooncloth? They arent bop tho?
---
Enchanting isn't useless while leveling, it's convenient to Biff you're gear with extra mats you have without needing to drop gold. It's also pretty convenient since enchanting is one of the most annoying professions to power leveling and disenchanting greens while you're questing is a convenient way to level it pre 60.
---
As for which you wanna take, I think the standard advice for these profs applies. If you want to make gold go enchanting, if you wanna pvp go engineering

**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**     
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST, days TBD (likely Tues/Wed or Wed/Thurs, TBD by a guild vote)
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for all roles - even some nontraditional specs if you're an active, dedicated player. Having experience with the content isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary. With that said, there are some key positions we're looking to lock down before Classic launches - if you're interested in **tanking** or if you're interested in **leadership** **positions** and your overall goals align with ours, contact us.
---
**Contact**: If you want to have fun, clear content and be a top guild on the server, here's how to contact us:

I see that diet Bloodfang Hood look. Checks out.
---
The "DPS" Priest spec is a utility/support spec in raids because the SPriest isn't going to deal a lot of damage himself. It is also boring as hell. I personally wouldn't ever play it again. Not even if the best guild on the server would ask me. It and DPSing in general is way less challenging and skill expressive than healing.
---
Both Warrior raid specs suck in PvP and even though fury Warriors can dish out a lot of damage, they aren't even good gold farmers/grinders like virtually any pure DPS class. So basically a raiding specced warrior is locked into raiding and 5man content in terms what they can do well. Great!
---
Bottom line is almost every class' raid specs sucks outside of raids and a good portion of them even suck inside of the raid in terms of what they actually do there. Raiding isn't about *you* though, it is about the guild and accomplishing something together. So it doesn't matter if *you* can fullfil role X with class Y, because someone else can do it optimally and you can do Z optimally anyways.
---
Every spec being raid viable or even optimal is a completely arbritrary balancing goal and doesn't have to make the game better (see: retail).
---
Ret was fine for horde. Alliance didn't get SoB which was like a 15% dps loss and created mana problems. 
---
In 2004-05 I also was on dial up. Back then I had around 400-500 ms trying to play on my server, Spinebreaker - US. I'm on NBN currently, and back when I was playing retail I recall getting 200-250ms connecting to US servers. 
---
Hoping sarcasm, since bears are great. Much more viable than you might think.
---
Not a chance. 
---
i mean look at that they recognize losing to eachother 13-15 years ago. This is crazy, really! As you said, I have no clue who these nonames are in my guild nowadays (:
---
I think it's only 110% for melee, while it is 130% for ranged.
---
I would love for them to move up and beyond phase 6 by  doing progressing the game but keeping it in the vanilla style and keeping it in Azeroth. Leveling would be a great an simple way of advancing the game and adding new content + skills but it would also make alot of content outdated. 
---
I think one way of keeping the game going is by adding new zones that were planned but never made it, like the dragon Isles. Level 60 zones that have quests that are all about attunement to new dungeons and raids, gaining new class skills and class items, grinding reputation or even gaining additional talent points to go with updated talent trees if they decide to move towards the pre TBC tree.
---
Make these areas difficult and dangerous with rather high rewards. Maybe there are only elites so you will need to group up? Not sure. But I do that that adding additional levels would ultimately be detrimental to the game overall unless they decide to go the TBC route.
---
Hurricane is available to all druids independent of spec, the patch that brought in Boomkins as the 31 point balance talent made Hurricane a baseline skill instead of a talent.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server.

In 2004-05 I also was on dial up. Back then I had around 400-500 ms trying to play on my server, Spinebreaker - US. Times were rough..
---
You can only get enchanting to like 50-60 with disenchanting. Having a DE lvl 5 alt and dusting all shitty greens will make you same amount of gold as if you were 300 enchanter, minus the money invested to leveling it.
---
Its literally worth only if you were your guilds enchanter with rare recipes (and willing to sit in capital spamming your services).
---
I reall hope you are right. But can't see that happening at launch or even the following day. But I hope you are right because I am going to need one.
---
&gt; They arent bop tho?
---
I know, but I wanna make them. Besides I love being able to craft my own gear. I really like that shit
---
A good portion of bosses are also immune to taunt. So loss of aggro for the tank and he's unlikely to get it back easily until the aggro puller is dead.
---
I would suggest that they just expanded all the content that there were traces of in classic, but was never implemented. 
---
For example put some content on Alcaz island to continue that questline, put some more content in Azshara.
---
Maybe a new Raid or some new dungeons, but the gear should be sidegrades of existing raid tiers / dungeons, maybe doing something similar to the upcoming gear from 8.1.5 (gear with interesting effects, but not pure upgrades from existing content).
---
Maybe use CoT to introduce some "none vanilla content", if they have a good reason to introduce any of it.
---
It is one of my favorite parts. Seems like in retail people don’t care much anymore. 
---
It's fine to speculate what ifs, but what you are proposing is actually developing another MMO. As long as Blizzard keeps retail running there is no chance for them to start a new project to compete. The reason we are actually getting Classic is because it's "done"; There are no skills, talents or items to balance and develop. The art, quests and dungeons are already there. They "only" need to figure out how to run the old assets on their current systems.
---
If Classic is successful then the most likely path is to keep releasing new (F R E S H) servers. They talked about how they are not just slapping this together and throwing it out, they are doing work so that this project can run for the next 15+ years. There might be TBC server talk at Blizzard, but I would think that they take a look with just Classic first. Even then I would expect at least two full cycles before anything happens (going from fresh to Naxx twice).

**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!

GOD IM SO HYPED FOR REAL CLASSIC FUCK
---
Yup, the map jpg is the original layout.
---
First reason: Moonkin dance to boost morale. 
---
Second reason: If your guild manages to achieve something, you can say that your guild is so good you even have a boomkin.
---
Third reason: Any self-respecting moonking would also farm this [bad boy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13937) for even more aura buffs. 
---
welp cant help ya there then xD
---
Get assigned a tank and keep rejuv and regrowth hots rolling. You won't need as much ht spam. Overhealing is irrelevant if you weren't going to go oom anyway while healing the "standard" way.
---
And yes, you are probably giving up some healing no matter what you do, but you can now off-tank with better mitigation and threat than a fury warrior, and even do decent kitty DPS with some manual crowd pummelers when extra healing and off-tanks are not necessary. 
---
How did you killed Huhuran then? You need to farm shit ton of GNPP and nature resistance gear? You need 8 tanks, flasks for dps check fights and frost resist gear for sapp + KT.
---
Oh yeah I’m aware of that. I was just trying to say that the damage will be slightly boosted by your spellpower so Hurricane’s damage is a bit more powerful on a boomkin. Hurricane’s spell coefficient is quite low (~30%) so I agree it doesn’t make much of a difference. 
---
#nochanges original servers were 2-3k depending. Yeah a guild from pservers will have a roster already but I'm talking about all the other players coming. Pserver %of population will be so low compared to total it doesn't really matter.
---
I really hope this is the mentality that can form on the servers. I really hate todays' constant thinking about meta and shit in every single game, I want to experience the chill days of vanilla where people weren't tryharding so much (I know there will be some, I'm talking about the vast majority of people). That's why I hope that blizzard doesn't touch ANY difficulty levels in terms of making them harder, so things like racials DON'T becomen mandatory (I'd hate having to roll a dwarf priest). 
---
So few of them that never played vanilla are currently on the blizz forum browbeating those who want the earlier version of AV. Likely the same players who won't last a week in vanilla much less level up to where they can play AV.
---
I’d love them to progress the game uniquely. I love the idea of going into TBC again but it would split the player base even more. I’m also not interested in playing after TBC, so if they followed up with WotlK I wouldn’t be too impressed. 
---
I’d say keep the level cap at 60 though, maybe more talents so you would have to make more of a choice? I dno
---
New gear buffing holy damage to make smite priests better would be brilliant too 
---
Yep, agree completely 
---
The favorite pastime of every 14 year old UD rogue! And OP, apparently. 
---
First and foremost, Loot everything. Your biggest investment early on should be the biggest bags you can get your hands on. So many people leave grey items on corpses, Its the first big mistake I see people making.
---
Second, regardless of what professions you want at and game, you should always start with skinning. Everytime you kill a skinnable mob you basically just made your own resource node. In most cases I would just sell off your leather to a vendor. Though there is usually a market for Thick Leather (used in making larger bags, you might be able to trade a few stacks for some bags as well) and outside of that theres always a market for Rugged Leather.
---
Third, and probably most importantly. Don't train spells you wont need, as well as spell ranks you wont need. For instance, Rogue Kick and Frost Nova for example have multiple ranks. However the only thing those ranks actually do is increase the damage done (Frost Nova actually costs more mana for a tiny damage increase its never worth using max rank imo)
---
Four, Don't spend large sums of money on low level gear. Couple silver here or there is ok, but  don't spend money on twink level blue items. Its just not worth it in the long run.
---
Using these 4 tips, u'll usually be floating 120-150g and that's before you play the auction house. In the early days you will see some people selling some incredibly rare items dirt cheap. If you can pick up a Freezing Band for 50-100g you could easily sell it in a few weeks time for 250-300g
---
True yeah you can just store up your mats on your bank alt and pick up enchanting later.
---
I remember farming some nature resistance gear yes. I never used many consumables as far as I remember, other than flasks and mana pots perhaps. Then again I was only a poor Ele Shaman.
---
Until a MT has TF he can't really skip MCs.
---
The Smurf Guild on Dalaran
---
Read the old wow novels like rise of the horde. They're well written and some of them lead into classic
---
Dont worry, ppl with tailoring+enchanting will want your collected cloths (for their profession(s) levelup). So might not even cost arm and a leg.
---
Dwarf Priest LF guild.
---
NA | PvE (open to an RP server) | Alliance | Tu/Th/Su Pref Raid days, 7~10ish Central time (8-11 Eastern).  Somewhat flexible there.  
---
Im looking for a guild thats probably somewhere between more casual raiding and semi-hardcore.  I cant no-life raiding, but i'd also like to make reasonable progress.  I used to do that a fair amount on retail, but lost the drive to raid there with the endless gear treadmills and all the extra 'required' stuff that i dont enjoy (M+, mainly).  
---
Ill be stopping to smell the roses a bit as i level, though i expect to level *reasonably* quickly.  Will likely take a few days of vacation (depends on what i have left), and will be playing weekends, etc.  Some of that depends on when it launches, though (later in the summer = better for me)
---
I intend on playing holy, and would love to find a guild where i can heal some dungeons while leveling, etc.  
---
While raiding is my main focus, i'd like an active guild with a nice social scene.  Part of that is for grouping while leveling/doing dungeons at 60, though also just for the social aspect in general (getting to know people, chatting when i should have been in bed an hour ago, etc).
---
When you entered WSG on Kel'Thuzad - german, you could basically leave if you saw Adolfo (undead rogue) and Quarktasche (tauren warrior) and the premade.
---
They took dumps on everybody.
---
I distinctly remember the warrior equipping full dark iron set for shits and giggles when he saw me as I was firemage. 
---
My 200damage fireballs were really dispiriting for me. :(
---
What people say they will play and what they actually get to 60 are very different charts. Most warriors will wash out before even level 30 especially if leveling solo. Pserver populations are not an accurate indicator of what live servers will be like due to all the casual players.
---
There will be a lot of mages, rogues, and hunters. Everything else will be below that in terms of population numbers. Good warriors will be very hard to come by and tanks even more so. Not sure where the druid situation will end up. But Im guessing lots of players will wash out of druid due to terrible mana issues in low gear and lack of rez.
---
As a mage enchanting is never useless.  The issue is usually the market is saturated, as in there are lots of enchanters, and there are very few ways to make an income beyond a few raid based recipes.  You can create a lvl 1 bank alt just for disenchanting things and then finding someone else to chant your gear or make you mana/wizard oil/wands.  Its worth noting that IF the game progresses to TBC there are some very nice enchants that are exclusive to the profession.  In vanilla its really only worth having 2 or maybe 3 enchanters out of a guild of 60-80 players, unless they are alts for DE.  If you are unlikely to raid then you may as well not get enchanting at all, engineering would be far more practical.
---
Engi is the better overall pick, even more so on a PVP realm. It offers you even more tools for staying alive and more ways of doing damage.  
---
You are literally min/max'ing if you take engi on a mage, and honestly you really dont even need to consider this until you are respec fire for AQ/Naxx.  My advice would be start with chanting and IF you get some of the recipes from MC hang on to it, if not swap for Engi if you see other enchanters with more recipes than you. 
---
Enchanting almost requires you to farm rep (argent dawn/timbermaw/cenarian circle) if you want to make any income at all, as only these and rare recipes will get you any tips at all.  The only chants you can demand payment for are those that drop in raids. 
---
If you decide to level enchanting it is expensive and you will struggle to get your mount at 40 especially if also training tailoring.  
---
Engi:- min/max
---
Ench:- gold sink
---
HTH  
---
I always appreciated the utility of coat racks on my armor -- when it's cold outside the coat is easily accessible, and it can be hung easily while indoors.
---
This is what I had in mind as well. All those places on the original map of Azeroth we could see but never click on. 
---
Even while doing AQ40 you'll be running MC every week for bindings. Getting TF on your MT is one of the first priorities of a guild. It's also worth noting that it was a lot LOT harder to tank pre-WOTLK due to the way aggro worked and warriors not having so many ways to actually get back aggro. 
---
You'll need to do a few high level dungeons to see what I mean, people will be dying a lot till you get the hang of it. 
---
Aedak and Ming on Lightning's Blade
---
I would gladly pay for a WoW 2 or expanded classic. As much as I adore Vanilla, we know where it ends. 
---
It’s always all good until someone nice drops lol
---
tool song name. checks out
---
I think blizzard would rather raiders (who are a tiny % of the players) are not affected by the existence of D2, and really do not care that raid gear will make acquiring D2 a cake walk.
---
It should be released with ZG at the latest.
---
...on a private server...
---
well this is just why wow has changed to what it is in retail, the constant need to add new ability's instead of keeping what works and add new content instead.
---
Yeah power creep of gear would have been a concern in this sort of system. There is probably a middle ground somewhere. My suggestion would be something like, some expansions focusing around a certain playstyle for each class and have gear that augments and enhances that play style accordingly. Or certain gear unlocking new types of spells.  Similar to how GW2 specializations unlock new weapons and skills for each class. 
---
Who knows if that was ever thought of or if it could have ever worked in WoW.
---
Isnt there a wand early on in Westfall?
---
In related news, does anyone know what level you have to get enchanting to to train the wand recipe?  Wowhead/classic.db have the levels they go yellow/green, but everything shows as 1 for orange level, which doesnt tell me when i can train it.
---
Its tagged as Humor, but this is reality.
---
I'd enjoy them taking the elements out of expansions that were well received and adding that vanilla style to them. 
---
As Horde, I would farm the shards from the nagas in Azshara. Close and really easy to kill (their level is green), you could replenish your stock of shards in 15-20 minutes.
---
That is logical i just wonder if the survey respondents are more inclined to focus in general than the wider audience of wow. Then again this might be a self fulfilling prophecy that turns the casual player into thinking that they can only get into groups by being X race Class combo.
---
No I won’t miss it. I hate standing in town queuing. Makes the world feel small.
---
You can also ninja skins from opposing faction farmers
---
If you're an elitist jerk and/or believe everything you  read on the internet without any source, sure.
---
Really? If D2 is going to "invalidate" your raid content, then you are doing it wrong. It is arguably much harder to complete a D2 set without having raid gear, with the reward being much weaker.
---
Personally I liked queueing at the Battlemaster. You got to wait with other people waiting and get to see some high levels to make friends. Going all the way to the BG was a pain, but meeting in org is a good QOL compromise. 
---
Play other games. Sekiro just came out and it's fun as hell if you want your teeth kicking in. Maybe avoid RPGs and especially other MMOs.
---
This is good advice. I'm going mining/skinning. When mining, vendor the stone, horde the ore.  Vendor all the skins until thick leather. 
---
(People always complain that skinning is a waste of time, and if you spend more time above getting it leveled up they might be right. Skin the low level skins just enough to level your skill until thick leather.)
---
I have a job and family so the try-hards will naturally level faster than me since ill have less time to play. Then when prices are good sell your saved ores and valuable leather on AH when they power level their professions.
---
Yes, there is for Alliance. Spark of the Peoples Militia. Easy to get. So always go wand spec first, then Spirit Tap.
---
Was not in vanilla, even battle masters I think were a detriment to world pvp.  All your suggestion will do is increase open world griefing, its been done on private realms and the consequence was constant gank squads in any zone with players above 50, making levelling questing herbing impossible. 
---
on paper that makes sense, and for most it does.  But when you have 25-40 people there is always 1 or 2 that have greater lag, are distracted with spouse aggro or kid aggro, heck even something on TV catching their attention.  Sure all the "idiots" can follow, but if one follows a little to slow, the cascade begins.  Sure the 1 dead could be just a dps, or it could be the 1 druid brought so no battle rez, or one warlock so no curse anymore making it harder to beat the timer.
---
From what I remember of raiding in Vanilla was one mistake tended to have a bigger impact that current.    Heck even a class standing in fire too long meant more heals on him, draining mana on healers faster, and with blue bar being a valuable commodity this could mean OOM earlier than expected, and the cascade begins.
---
Did you actually do the D2 questline in vanilla? Because you are displaying some hefty ignorance about what it takes to acquire it.
---
500g a run?
---
you are thinking of try hard guilds.
---
apart from shadow pots and frost pots naxx does not require much more except tank flasks (covered by gbank) and caster flask maybe
---
i cleared naxx on pserver (without world buffs) with semi chill guild and def did not spend 500g per run.
---
I chose not to post the 50-60 range or 1-60 range because the person I responded to originally was talking about how the "Sub 30 Population is 33% Warriors" 
---
There's a difference between a quality of life change and making something easier.
---
Running down to the the fucking silverwing sentinels to queue in retail classic was NOT an enjoyable experience, no matter what Rose tinted Goggles say. 
---
I always loved queuing at the battlemaster and was sad when it got removed. Granted I didnt PvP a lot back in actual vanilla but when I did i loved going there and watching all the other pvp'ers standing there. Talking with other people of my class getting tips and just inspecting all the high ranked people :) 
---
They ain't half bad at world pvp. When 50% of the populations of the server are warriors and rogues, being a moonkin out in the world is a pleasant thing.
---
You still need to put in work to get ready for it and get consumes for it.
---
The among of raids required to progress it, is a lot less, but the pregearing and all that is the same.
---
If you can do the D2 content without raid gear, then you've bloody well earned it.
---
covered by gbank? 
---
If locks had blink I wouldn't even think twice, but it's such a great tool I think I'd miss it too much
---
Same man. For now I have Game of Thrones coming in a few weeks and then when thats over Stranger Things season 3 will be there. 
---
“Jerk”? Whoa now. 
---
I remember this kid Farthu, tauren druid, always talking about how much he liked pandas...
---
I never saw him again after vanilla but i hope he played MoP and got to have his damn Panda.
---
First wand recipe is learned as soon as you learn Enchanting.
---
No the idea is about longevity of the game... I am a big believer in leaving the game untouched until the end of Naxx, it's a proven project. It was proven in its original format and every p server in the years since then.
---
The fact is however, these will not be combined US/EU servers. The populations and number of hardcore guilds currently located on 1 server will now be spread across several and eventually, the game WILL inevitably die if it doesn't produce more things to hold its population. 
---
So while YES no changes is a glorious thing to preach, good ideas and thoughts only add to the pool of ideas the Classic team has in there arsenal if they ever do decide to do horizontal content. Everyone providing no ideas, no content, nothing of value other than the word no, are purely opening the doors for Blizzard themselves to be the creative ones, which will only land us where we were before. 
---
You do like literally 5 runs of mara solo and you got the NR, and you only need 2 pots per attempt/kill, and most guilds don't wipe more than once on progression because the boss isn't rly that hard.
---
The thing is, even when we didn't know everything, you still looked up bosses and watched videos. You knew what you were going into roughly. Most people ran DBM and other addons. Knowing what you're in for doesn't diminish the fun of actually doing it.
---
For me the biggest difference between Vanilla and the current game is you could not do it alone in Vanilla. You needed your guild, you needed your friends and you had to find 39 other people to get good loot. And the good loot lead to better loot, there wasn't any way to just skip MC entirely. Each raid's gear unlocked the next level. Sure, you didn't have to wait to have everyone fully geared in MC before you could go into BWL but if you're in dungeon blues and try to hop into BWL, you probably aren't going to have a good time. There were incremental steps to take and your gear wasn't made irrelevant the next time a raid came out. 
---
Because cross realms BG is what killed server communities back then.
---
&gt; have a fun, massive, perpetual war zone
---
That is what Tauren Mill/Southshore is for. :)
---
Classic isn't going to be what classic originally was :(. How do I overcome the aspect that I won't have friends to experience it with?
---
I didn’t mind it. Just because I liked it doesn’t mean I’m looking through rose tinted glasses. The retail wow feels small to me because it’s just queueing constantly. Once the leveling is done, you only leave for WQs which are terrible on their own.
---
Pretty fucking hardcore to be honest.
---
1. You bring around 800g worth of consumables every Naxxramas raid
---
2. To get those consumables, depending on class, you could spend between 4 to 6 hours every day farming them
---
3. You need a lot of resistance gear (frost resistance primarily). And you can't just pick whatever green with frost resistance only, no you need to make a very expensive epic frost resistance gear that actually has some stat added along with the resistance. Those ain't cheap, and getting revered with several factions are required. You could count in at least 30 days and a shit ton of gold just to get the gear if you're very efficient
---
4. Before even heading to Naxxramas, people met at the Yojambe Isle to receive the ZG world buff, which requires turning in Heart of Hakkar, which in turn requires you to raid ZG and kill Hakkar in order to get the buff.
---
5. Then people go to Orgrimmar to get the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer world buff, which in turn requires Head of Onyxia or Head of Nefarian. Either of those requires killing Onyxia first or Nefarian from BWL.
---
6. You're not ready yet. Before going to Naxxramas, you should have at least one Warlock at level 20 with full bags of Soul Shards in order to provide yourself Soulstone, Healthstone and to summon members.
---
I'm probably forgetting things, but maybe now you're at least ready to ENTER Naxxramas (that is if you're attuned to the instance at all).
---
Congratulations, the easy part is over. 
---
I disagree on the point where old graphics are not a strong selling point. Just look at Old School Runescape its graphics are horrible and has a larger player base than RS3. 
---
How much would you say you spent? Thats pretty sick though. Most guilds I talk to who raid nax have to farm 100s of gold in consumables
---
Look, I'm not making a value judgement, run whoever you want in your raids. But there are facts about how the game works, and boomkins aura not making up for their lack of dps compared to a real caster is a hard fact that doesn't care about your feelings.
---
Aren't paladin better? 
---
If you have access to Greater Magic Wand, whose DPS is way too high for level 13 (?), definitely wand spec. 
---
Make new friends with the people on your Classic server!
---
The game is still good and worth to be played
---
That’s the beauty of classic, never was it easier to find new friends and communities in WoW :)
---
Can someone tell me how Warlocks are suppose to have the correct pet up in WPvP? For trying Warlocks I found out that a huge amount of their strength vs different classes is having the correct demon out(felhunter for locks/mages/priest) but if you are running around in the world with a felhunter out, wouldn't you just get DUMPSTERED by a good rogue enganing out from stealth? Seems like the only real choice is to get naxx gear and go SL spec with voidwalker out, and then you can sac it and summon the demon of your choice depending on your opponent..
---
I didn't consider the possible griefing that you mention, valid point there.
---
 I also had experience on PS where queue command was implemented very late on, when naxx was out, in order to pretty much bring more life into the game sincw server was at end of journey. It was welcomed very warmly from playerbase then.
---
But yeah I can see how griefing could happen, sadly.
---
You will be find healing with no points in holy up into your 50s provided you have some +healing greens and whatever +int pieces you collect along the way. That enables you to focus your spec more on tanking. Start with getting consecration first as that makes it much easier to get aggro, then go down prot to BoSanc. Holy Shield is a super nice talent for both mitigation and threat but optional in my experience. I like using a hybrid holy / prot build so I can heal or tank at 60.
---
Brutal. Savage. Rekt
---
Admittedly, I don’t know what the oomkin rotation was weather it was casting wrath(nature) or starfire(arcane), but it would make sense to take advantage of the arcane, like you said. But, nonetheless, it was arguably better to bring a mage in place of boom kin because of mana efficiency and bettter dmg regardless of the 3% crit.
---
They're really fun in PvP. 
---
Basically you seduce/fear them, and have them watch you cast a devastatingly long soulfire that will take out a significant chunk of their hp.
---
They have better CC potential than fire in PvP but mage has a lot more complimentary talents across the three trees. 
---
You're squishy if you aren't soul link spec so that's a problem. Warriors have the ability to break a lot of your CCs. Also, if you play alliance, seduce/fearing Undead will not work because of their racial. I promise you more than 25% of horde will be Undead.
---
For destro, I really recommend succubus. It allows you to CC them and then get your soulfire off, or shadowbolt if they're low. You can then use shadowburn or conflagration to finish them. 
---
In a fresh ecnonomy, being able to generate large sums of gold and putting and endless amount of Major Health Potions on the AH is quite a powerful perk.
---
Unlike AoE farming which may only generate ~20g/h before AH sales, rogue pick pocketing is almost entirely removed from dependence on the current server economy.  With significantly less players and an anticipated slow economy start, rouges being able to endlessly pickpocket and inject large sums of gold into circulation.  
---
Boring? Sure. Repetitive? Definitely.  Safe and free of competition? Absolutely! Its probably the most reliable way of making gold without sitting by the AH playing World of Economicraft.  With Classic having "unnerfed" (compared to private servers) BRD pickpocketing, you should be able to generate ~50g per hour, possible even more with the toggle-able auto loot on and being specc'd Sub.
---
This doesn't also include other potentially synergies with spending a lot of time in BRD such as disenchanting, mining, rep grinding, etc. that could all lead to even more g/h.  There is a reason private servers have nerfed BRD pick-pocketing in various ways compared to Vanilla. 
---
You can't solo these mara bosses with most classes also it's not 5 mara runs( all mara nature resist loot gives less than 100 resist and it's not enough for soakers )
---
Whether you like cross-realm BGs is totally different story than assuming whether it will make the cut in to Classic.
---
Really?  Damn, thats...really pretty easy, then.  Getting cloth could take a bit, but im planning on going tailoring anyways (not sure if ill keep enchanting off the bat or drop it for something else), so getting some stuff to DE shouldnt be a big problem.
---
&gt;Judgement scaling increased by 20%
---
The end
---
Didnt play much on ally so I forget they exists. The raids I did on my ally alt I dont recall being super impressed by hpalas. 
---
Well I played dps on that char so I also wasnt bothered by checking heals. I do remember they had an insane resto druid + insane hpala. In the end, imo, it always comes down to the player himself.
---
When Runescape classic dropped and it became gigantic, didn't the devs start adding content to it?
---
Dwarf priest really???
---
Looks like horde get one in the barrens a couple levels later, though its an escort quest and doesnt have other weapons with it.  I could see the Westfall one being easier to get done because you could group with a warrior (i assume theyre going to want that 2H sword), pally, etc.
---
I think being able to queue in cities is fine.  I have very fond memories of having my level 29 twink being parked in TB and being able to duel with other 19/29/39 twinks on Hunter's Bluff waiting for queue to pop.
---
IIRC, TB was the only city in the game where you could duel in the same place you could queue for BG's at.  Best place for twinking.
---
What helped me most back in the day was having a bank alt whose only function was to be a savings account. 
---
Made 15g that day? Brilliant, send 10g to the alt and made do with the rest for repairs and skills etc. Never touch the alt, except for the mount.
---
Then I got lucky and found o a Lei of Lilies at Level 38, which sold for 15g on the AH, which brought me over the threshold.
---
If they were to increase the cap to 70 I think it taking as long as 1-60 would be too much, make it take 5 days tops (played time), even that would be pushing it tbh.
---
That being said I wouldn't mind new races as long as they made sense and were from Azeroth (Goblins good, space goats bad, add High Elves to Alliance and fuck off with Blood Elves, keep the Horde ugly!)
---
Also new spells every level is too much, that's 90 unique spells you are asking for, which very easily could end up with us getting into retail territory where every class starts to do the same stuff. I'd say 4-5 new spells each class would be fine, 1 at 62, 65, 67, 70 or 62, 64, 66, 68, 70.
---
Definitely keep Shaman on Horde and Paladins in Alliance, it just makes sense lorewise and the addition of each class to the other faction was stupid.
---
Fuck flying mounts for sure, if they feel the need to add a new set of mounts make it a 120% or 130% ground mount that way there is progression but the speed boost isn't blatantly op, and wPvP isn't ruined like when they added flying mounts to Azeroth in Cata.
---
The raids at 20/40 man is good as well, although they could/should also add 10 man dungeons or mini raids too, that way there's more PvE content for groups of different sizes.
---
For arenas I agree to an extent, although they could also make it an alternate way to grind the PvP gear available through BGs/HKs already.
---
i play melee dps so just little bit more than on farm raids using regular consumables jujus, agi etc. it was some time ago. our melees did not flask titans
---
2 day guild, so 200-300g per week?
---
only gold sink was loatheb progression but that was pretty quick
---
Why not just make a whole new game in classic spirit instead of updating classic wow? If that happens we're in the same place we were before classic was announced. Players wanting legit vanilla servers.
---
It'd definitely be interesting but I don't think they can pull it off properly it would be better to just make a new game that inherits some of those classic wow design principles. And it would be a lot more exciting as well, a whole new world.
---
Many guilds used alts of GM’s and officers to hold items with illegal account sharing, which was the reason for guild banks being made.
---
They could just include vampiric touch for shadow priest and I’d be happy 
---
Level 60 cap, mount Hyjal encounter?   
---
Azshara mountait battleground or world boss? (for those who knows the GM locations connected to old Hyjal) Uldum world bosses and all the encounters that were "missing" from Classic and could be implemented pre-TBC:  
---
Lower Karazhan, Old Ironforge, Ironforge Airport, Undercity Top Tier, Wetlands mountains camps, Hyjal, Silithus farm,  Dark Portal invasion...
---
World bosses and encounters would be great after Naxx progress.
---
you wont do naxx as a casual
---
Yes, an alt designated as the gbank.  People mail stuff to the alt.  Server I'm playing on hasn't even opened AQ yet and we've got 60+ black lotus farmed up in preparation for Naxx.
---
Raiding in Classic shouldn't take very much in terms of consumables for the first two tiers.  Once you have your epic mount you can start amassing your stockpile of consumables for the harder fights in AQ and then Naxx, or just fuck around with your gold and complain about having to farm, farm, farm! just to secure a weekly spot in your raid group.
---
Yeah at times when I didnt pvp much I wasnt even thinking about it. We would do couple guild premades in a row and thats it.
---
But as I started to solo queue more for ranking it just felt like being locked on the battlemaster &gt; ah &gt; bank route while i could be herbing or farming.
---
Utah here, also! Noticed that DI sticker and checked the comments for other keen eyed Utah'ns. Noice.
---
It does I deed come down to the payer. But pa'ly are by far the best single target healer in the game, so I did suppose you play horde. 
---
Engineering is the literal classic wow god profession. If you want to be competitive Engineering is the only way to go. Both PvE and PvP.
---
&gt; If you don’t like farming consumables nax prob isn’t for you. Search for hamsterwheel gaming, he just released a video as he was in the same boat at you (not completing nax) until recently and then he went to a private server and finished it and talked about his experience in doing so.

---
But then what happens after 70?  What have you solved exactly?
---
Wait should undead even be able to eat bread? Or like actually need to eat/drink at all? Aren't they basically reanimated corpses who can think?
---
I still remember the name of the best guild on the server (it wasnt even close) from back when i started in Wrath. (over 9 1/2 years ago now).  Im actually back on that server, but theyre not still around.
---
...shit, i remember the name of the top guy on my server when i played Maplestory (i know, i know)~15 years ago.  Oof.  I cant remember what i had for breakfast yesterday, how the hell do i still remember that lol
---
Do you know anything about TBC.
---
1. TBC raised the level cap to 70.
---
2. TBC expanded the talent trees.
---
3. TBC added spells and abilities , a lot of them.
---
4. Classes were still unique. 
---
5. TBC made hybrids viable.
---
6. TBC didn’t stay in Azeroth. But then again no expansion reused zones.
---
7. TBC brought paladins and shaman together, at the joy of both factions. No one wanted to stay apart.
---
8. TBC added arenas.
---
What you described is TBC 
---
It's really hard to say how representative the data is of what is actually going to happen. Afaik the survey was only done in this subreddit, which probably puts some bias into the results. I think it is representative of the knowledgeable WoW vanilla crowd, but not so much of the ones who don't know much about it.
---
Wow, is that real? I honestly would have expected *at least* 35% warriors. 
---
If warlocks had blink they would be so brokenly OP in pvp.
---
Thanks god they don't.
---
Depends on what Patch the'll go with crafted weapons and gear tho. if they go 1.12 crafted gear and weapons then sure. However it could be that they put them behind the same 1.10 gear lock as a few other items. 
---
Well it's still a pretty penny, and if you're a caster who needed to have flask it'd be even more
---
Have a lvl 5 alt with enchanting so you can DE all your greens instead of vendoring them
---
What a time to be alive! You had the people who were ”just” famous on their server &amp; then we had the super celebrities like vurtne who were famous across all realms. And if I recall correctly there were quite a lot of actual celebrities who played back then, during vanilla-wotlk
---
Been playing on private servers since 2013, so kinda setting myself some last goals there and if it all aligns well will be right on time for release (with couple weeks to take break aswell!)
---
But yeah if I werent idk how would I manage the wait really haha.
---
Most efficient way I've seen is to start off with skinning and leatherworking, but also save all your cloth if you want to level with tailoring.  Level leatherworking enough to get the first green piece, make a bunch of them to DE, then switch to enchanting/tailoring, DE them and make the wand.  Everything you need for the wand sans the DE material can be gotten from a vendor for cheap.
---
They haven’t said that they’ll only use it for the initial zones, that was just an example of when they might use it. If you read what Ion actually said, it’s not far fetched to assume that AQ gates being sharded is on the table for them. 
---
Halira, trade chat troll incarnate. From vanilla through Wrath, if any discussion was ever going on in trade, this guy would show up. Without fail.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
I remember some PvP related stuffs as well, but that's the one name that immediately came to mind. Moonglade EU.
---
&gt;   Sure all the "idiots" can follow, but if one follows a little to slow, the cascade begins. 
---
if you that bad then you are replaceable
---
Just to expand a little, I personally pick up tailoring and herbalism.  I then mail EVERY green item that is BoE to an alt for disenchanting.  Sell herbs all the way to level 60, then swap to your enchanting by using up all the mats you have stored on your alt.  If you have tailoring levelled you should be able to max enchanting in about 3 hours just burning mats and a trip to Uldaman (you can do this solo at 60) for the trainer.  You will use fewer mats this way but its costing you all those green items value.  You can recoup some of this by selling the wands and mana wizard oil you make while training.  You do exactly the same with engineering except those green items are sold and once you have your mount you invest everything in to engineering.  
---
Herbalism is actually a very good money maker right from day one.  You can ALWAYS get buyers for briarthorn, stranglekelp, swifthistle and more herbs of higher level, these can be gathered from as low as lvl 12.  If you want to make serious money then hang on to herbalism until you are literally about to start raiding.  You can possibly fund your epic mount in a week if spend enough time herbing.  
---
I forgot one of the best benefits of enchanting, the social one.  You will get a reputation FAST if you get recipes early.  You can dominate a realm if you are dedicated and part of a successful guild, and having those faction recipes can even get you an invite to said raiding guilds.  If you get a reputation as a honest and reliable chanter you can make a steady income in a city while chatting or waiting for a BG to pop.  I enjoy social interactions and messing around in cities, so this really suits my play style.
---
FYI Azshara Crater [https://i.redd.it/lomrhtz0o1k11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/lomrhtz0o1k11.jpg) 
---
800g per raid? Not every guild requires you to have every single little consumable in existence and there are guilds that are fine with not smashing through all 15 bosses in a couple of weeks.
---
Well without LFG and xrealm and shit you make friends preeetty fast
---
You know I've never played or been interested in WoW but i like reading about all the stories you guys have. It makes me feel like I've missed something integral to a gamer's childhood.
---
&gt; People always complain that skinning is a waste of time
---
my issue is how quick it fills the bags
---
its gonna suck the first 20-30 levels when u get better money for decent bags
---
ikr
---
It will be in the 1-12 zones for like 1-2 weeks. It's not gonna be a big deal at all imo.
---
 **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

I'll have you know my *Pissing in Bottles* profession is leveled to 300, my talent tree is fully specced to *Unemployment*, my race is the *Dweller* and my home is *The Basement*. My motivation to reach 60 in less than a week is as big as your mothers fat ass
---
Wand is easy to get before level 10; you really don't even have to work at it.  Pick tailor/enchanting and make brown linen robes to de, or if you really want to be efficient start with leatherworking/skinning and still save all your cloth.  All the other mats you need are purchased from a vendor.

&lt;Sanguine Hibiscus&gt; NA - Alliance - PvP  
---
Introduction: Sanguine Hibiscus is a casual raiding guild organized by vanilla veterans with an emphasis on community and cooperation. For us, WoW is a platform for shared experiences and a shared sense of mastery.  
---
How we play: While leveling, we will run dungeons, share group quests, and help each other get attunements. At 60, we will establish weekend raid and BG nights (both optional). Our top priority as guild officers will be to groom and gear a consistent and comfy raiding team and make steady progress through the content.  
---
Raid loot and schedule: We are scheduling raids for Saturdays at 1:00pm EST and will probably add a raid on Sunday afternoon when new content is released. We use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system with separate lists for weapons, class-restricted gear, and other gear. For details, visit the “About the Guild” page on our website.  
---
Who should join: We are recruiting all classes and all levels of experience. If you have friends or family who are playing, they are welcome to join. Our goal is to facilitate enjoyment in every aspect of the game.

---
Well, they've got the cannibalize ability, so they definitely eat humanoids. 
---
Makes more sense that they would still need the energy to keep everything moving, unlike zombies in pop culture that are powered by... well, nothing. 
---
&gt; its a pet ability with a ca. 15 secs cd which make your next attack do ca 50 dmg more, its aoe so your whole grp (not raid) gets it. 
---
only 15 yards
---
if u call back the pet so it wont die then it loses range to melee
---
Flintlocke! Oh man I'm going back to read all of those before classic, I loved these! I used to read them and 8 bit theater back to back and vgcats, dark legacy and wow I read a lot of internet comics.
---
I think that used to be my youtube before youtube.
---
When you have no control over something there is no point to stress about it. 
---
Oh my christ. A Graphics "toggle" wouldn't effect you in any way. Get off your high horse. 
---
As you can see from my comment I say the Mechanics/Gameplay are what I'm looking for and that there is nothing wrong with the Classic graphics, simply an observation that they are indeed an eyesore by the standards of today. 
---
Hey man, if youre willing to check out a guild that raids W/T/Sat a little later than you mentioned then check out Filthy Casuals. our website is [https://Filthy-casuals.com](https://Filthy-casuals.com) I realize the days / times don't line up perfectly for you, but if youre interested we'd love to have you.
---
We're a guild that wants to clear shit fast and hard, but we also dont require a certain amount of raid attendance and the only benefit we offer the "Raider" rank in the guild is for sure raid spots. Raider rank comes with an undecided amount of raid attendance. 
---
Also you need a lot of players who consistently do not mess up, or you can kiss your farmed consumables and your clear, goodbye.
---
I can't stop thinking about the famous song "Overkill" from Motörhead when reading this.
---
Ofc I wouldn't like to be negative, so respect (and envy) to all people who will "use at least 5-6 hours a day" just to prepare for Naxx/or I'm baited.
---
Wasn't there a Boomie in the world first KT kill? Or was it something else?
---
I know one. I think it's called Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
I hope that means I can play Shadow in PvE.
---
Hardcore guilds will clear it soon after it’s out. The rest will clear it at later stages. There is more time now because they won’t put tbc right after naxx release now. 
---
Just because you use a gbank doesn't mean you don't spend that gold per week farming. 
---
Can't go wrong with the Voidwalker. 
---
Yes, Felhunter is ideal for fighting other casters, but the utility it gives you (silence and dispel) is more or less equalized by having a 2k+ Sacrifice shield - instead of interrupting a caster or removing CC, you just face tank the burst. In the end, you're slightly weaker vs classes you already perform well against, but have a much better chance of surviving a Hunter or Rogue getting the drop on you.
---
Damn, unfortunately thats just a bit too late for me :(
---
I also assume i'll be better off on a server on EST/CST for easier grouping.
---
100 is more than enough for soakers and casters/healers don't need any protection.
---
Of course
---
I'm from the darkside.
---
I'm a multiboxer. 
---
Warrior + 2 auto attacking wands and heals.
---
I’d recommend going desolace instead of stv. That was what I had done. Night elf side the whole way as far as I could through feralas. 
---
oh this community would lose their collective minds.... 
---
100? Try it in classic and tell me how it was :D. Don't tell me about pservers cuz they are shit and inaccurate.
---
I agree with you on that haha

As long as it's only up to a point, no, I don't mind. People level at different speeds depending on their preference, ability and class, so all you need is to shard the 1-10 zones to allow the powerlevelers to get ahead of the curve and leave the zones. They'll be done in a matter of hours and forget it was ever there to begin with.
---
Totally unsharded launch night chaos would be funny for a while until you realise it's going to take hours to get to level 6 and you're actually better off waiting and *not playing the game you've been waiting for*. 
---
I really doubt they'd even consider sharding past the level 0-10 zones for Classic, they know it would backfire hugely with the community they've spent this long earning good will from.
---
Ah the placeholder bloodfang
---
naxx is honestly not that difficult. 800g per raid in consumables? that's an exaggeration if i've ever seen one. most guilds won't pop 2 flasks in one night of naxx raiding because you don't need to for the first 5 or so bosses. Only starting at patchwerk do you need to flask. after that flask wears off most ppl are cool with calling it a night and coming back later in the week to finish 4hm/sapph/kt. Other than that, all the consumes are the same as the previous tiers of raiding except for shadow protection potions - which are easily solo farmed (grave moss in SM).  consumables are not the reason naxx is a challenge.
---
That would be insanely awesome! But I don't think blizz would do that.
---
I like your idea and I would play it!
---
Depends if you are actually going to grind reps for ench recipes and try to be your guilds enchanter. Ench is pretty sweet but mages cant really boss farm for large brillaints so its not really going to help too much money wise without rare recipes. 
---
The play is to probably level tailoring and ench at the same time, then drop either for engi if you want it. Having engi while you level is fun, but without mining you will have to buy all the ore which isn't possible as a leveler without a sugar daddy.
---
Tailoring is cool for the cds and bloodvine bonus, but zg patch isnt for a while anyway-you just have to decide what you prioritize. 
---
Have minimal vanilla experience, played a ton of legion and a couple other expansions though. Thinking of going human lock, I’ve read alli locks are more sought after than horde and wanna do the alli leveling path. 
---
I’ve read some here that locks are fairly simple to leave with and can pve and pvp in the same spec. Biggest downside I’ve seen is managing soulshards and the fact that to be great there’s a ton to do. Am I missing anything?
---
For professions, thinking tailoring/enchanting. Tailoring for some gear, enchanting simply to de and ah junk instead of vendor. I figure ah will be flooded with herbs/ore/skin early. Is this a sound logic? 
---
I was looking at it like pulling the good spells from the future expansions and adding them in. I think we as players could handle the addition of them and more options for different play styles would be nice. It does sound like a lot with 90 unique but all classes have has at least 10 new spells given to them since Vanilla. 
---
If they do this they could alienate a LOT of people.  Personally I dont see this as a race, but thousands of people cannot wait to race to be the worlds first 60 in classic.  It would have a negative impact on company image to do something like this, so highly unlikely.  
---
Now if you said the same about a beta phase, yes I could see them literally putting a test realm up BEFORE they announced it.
---
I will never forget getting mesmerized by two guys from my server - Sylvanas EU (Horde)
---
Kasapin - lvl60 Orc Warrior with Ashkandi and Crown of Destruction 
---
and 
---
Dzo - lvl60 Troll Rogue with Thunderfury
---
I remember standing on Orgrimmar bank roof top, I was a poor little lvl27 Orc Rogue and inspecting those two for an hour, and then i see them talk in my language (Serbian) and getting blown away 
---
yea, when i found this subreddit i too got sucked in and now check it all the time. 
---
there is no escape
---
This is Blizzard. Even though we are getting lot's of news its unlikely they will do a stealth drop.
---
Remember, this is the company that will release when its ready (TM)
---
I have been trying to think of other drops from them and can't think of one single time they did early. 
---
All that being said.. I would LOVE it ASAP and wont mind eating my words at all :)
---
My personal preference would be make Shadow act like Shadow did in Legion. A unique play style that rewarded high risk. Instead of Discipline turning into the bubble spec that they had so much trouble balancing make them the return mana to the party spec. Overall, I just want those unique play styles back.
---
Playing other games.
---
From retail? Very little. Maybe the barbershop since it has no real impact, sometimes you just realise 20 levels too late that you don't like your beard. As long as they didn't add *new* styles I'd be totally fine with them putting this in. Transmog can GTFO though. 
---
Just signed up and found 1 player from my old guild. Hopefully some more sign up!
---
Me either but would be pretty awesome. Can you imagine if they dropped it first day of summer without saying anything 😂
---
I know this :)
---
Thank you! Are there any specifics you like or dislike more than the others?
---
Realizing that nostalgia aside, it's still a great game. You have the chance to make friends within the game, new friends, a new start. 
---
What happened in apex legends sorry? Everyone was banging on about it as recently as 5 weeks ago when I started on pserver.

Graphics were the least of Classics draw back then. In fact it was pretty subpar compared to the games of it time, even though it still looked good in a cartoonish way.
---
Besides, they would have to change all of the environment as well. Just changing the models will absolutley make your eyes sore from how disjointed it looks.
---
&gt; without a sugar daddy.
---
I got a buddy that is going Mining+Skinning that said he would help me with mats. I'll get him drunk and take all his ore... 
---
You won't need a hardcore guild to clear Naxx now, you'll only need a stabile and dependent one that doesn't split up every week.
---
The day they announced their game is the day it went live.
---
The one month old baguette is harder than steel. Who knows how long this guy holds it. At this point it's at least blue mace.
---
Yeah + gameplay wise how would that look?
---
I confirm undead eat bread. I eat bread. And i just looked in the mirror and i am 99% certain i am an undead at this point.
---
Placeholder bloodfang flex. Love it 
---
This subreddit and all the videos on youtube got me to cave in and decide to go back. The urge was so strong I downloaded and started an Orc Warrior on a pserver so I can test how I want to level when Classic releases.
---
and then get over it in like 1...maybe 2 weeks
---
Oh I'm not arguing, or even disagreeing that it's their mentality. I just think that mentality is silly and I hope they reconsider.
---
It's like if you go to a dine-in Mexican restaurant and they forgot to give you chips until after you ordered and now a bunch of guys are like "WELL WE DIDN'T GIVE YOU CHIPS THE FIRST TIME! IT WOULDN'T BE THE FULL EXPERIENCE"
---
They're already introducing 12 patches worth of content in 6 phases, so stuff's already getting moved around and happening simultaneously when it didn't. The worst case example here is that there is a very good item in a slot casters can't use all that well in the first place so it's not super powerful.
---
I'm playing a warlock and was leaning towards tailor/herbalism for money but considering enchanting. Will I not be dead broke with enchanting? Also being a warlock I won't need to save that initial 90g for 40.
---
&gt; your whole fucking character panel turns an ugly color when you have a debuff.
---
Is this an option?
---
Nothing.  That's the best part!
---
Possibly some seasonal servers for FRESH
---
Screenshots like this kibosh any argument that you 100% need 100’s of gold worth of consumables to raid. It’s nice to have, but not many people stacked 7 different types of potion, flasks and elixirs. 
---
haha I don't know... we might not see posts about it because they'll all be too busy #nolife-ing but they faught for 12 years or so for classic servers so they got some Spunk
---
You can also get a pretty quick/easy wand in Loch Modan near the Trogg ruins area in the east, if you're absolutely sick of Westfall.
---
I'm coping by playing what I played before Warcraft: Everquest.  
---
Daybreak launched two new Time Locked Progression servers a little over a week ago and I'm thoroughly enjoying a Dwarf Paladin on Mangler. I'm enjoying it and it keeps me from being anxious waiting for a release date for WoW Classic.
---
I really enjoy these discussions (And it's certainly led to a lot of discussion in [discord](https://discord.gg/classicwow)), mostly because I've been advocating for a post-Vanilla Classic since before Classic was announced. 
---
Whilst I do really enjoy these posts, I tend to come to the discussion from a very different angle, with a focus on preserving content for future replay value rather than maintaining vertical progression. I feel that's more in keeping with the spirit of Classic (more so than the spirit of Vanilla, certainly), as I believe that a lot of the call to arms supporting Classic was inspired by a desire to be able to play old content, engage in the old story lines, run old dungeons, and grind the old grinds, just as much as it was a desire to engage in the old-style gameplay. I feel that your idea certainly seeks to preserve that gameplay, but doesn't do much to preserve that clear desire to be able to run Molten Core again, or to be able to try and reach Rank 14, should PvP progression move beyond that (which I've no doubt it would, were vertical progression retained). 
---
Before I start addressing your points, I'd like to shamelessly plug my own alternative for post-Phase 6 Classic, I wrote this initially before the announcement, and then re-wrote it several months later, [Reconsidering Progression in Classic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dn_W3tjsqXXkQdoQ7QWL9UvIZ1KOIm3jk6BPMbWIIHI/edit?usp=sharing). 
---
I feel I made adequate points about raising the level cap (Because sadly the decision really is a choice of vertical progression OR content permanence, as further direct item improvement at Level 60 opens a whole can of worms detailed above, and content does not tend to stay relevant AND satisfying to engage in with constant vertical progression) above, and there's plenty more in my write-up, so I'll skip ahead to Point 2.
---
&gt; 2. Expanded talent trees. Talent trees being removed was one of the biggest mistakes made by Blizzard. In an MMORPG players love choice. Removing the choice from filling out an entire tree and simplifying it down to a talent every 15 or so levels and only having 3 options goes against the RPG aspect. With the new cap they should expand the talent trees to WoTLK length and allow players to gain 2 new talent points each level from 60-70.
---
I think this is self-defeating. At the point of Wrath of the Lich King players were firmly one spec, primarily because whilst they had got 10 more talent points their primary tree had also grown equally. In order to have their final talent ability a player would need to spend 31 points in Vanilla, leaving them 20 points to spend anywhere else they pleased. This meant they could, to a degree, have their cake and eat it. They weren't so heavily weighted towards one particular spec. Along comes TBC, now you need to spend 41 points to get your signature ability. You've gone from having 3 fifths of your points in one tree and 2 fifths in another to having 2 thirds in one tree, and 1 third in another. It's suddenly getting a lot harder to call your role flexible. Suddenly your weighted a lot more heavily towards one spec. Along comes Wrath of the Lich King suddenly you have 51 points in your primary spec, and 20 wherever you please. That's 5 sevenths in one spec, and 2 sevenths in another. Can you really call your build flexible anymore?
---
Sure, you've got just as many points in other trees as you had originally, but aesthetics matter. You're not a hybrid, you're not almost half one spec, half another, you're splashing a few left over talent points. If you have $10, spending $5 seems like a big deal, if you have $20 dollars, it's not as big of a deal. It's that kind of logic, because you have so many more points the points spent elsewhere have less of an impact on how you interpret and perceive your character. A Rogue with 51 points in Combat and 20 in Subtlety is a Combat rogue, a rogue with 31 in Combat and 20 in Subtlety is a lot harder to call a Combat rogue. 
---
&gt; 3. A new spell/spells every level. In TBC as I leveled my Priest I gained several new abilities these included, Shadow Word: Death, Binding Heal, Shadowfiend, Prayer of Mending and Mass Dispel. Blizzard has a wide range of abilities to pull from other expansion releases for example Mind Spike and Mind Sear or a Warrior getting their Banners back.
---
Sure, but there's two very significant concerns here. I'm not outright against this, but I think it's worth noting.
---
First: Bombarding the player with toys makes it hard for that player to feel rewarded or to appreciate those toys. Receiving a new spell in Vanilla is incredibly rewarding, because it has likely been a very long time of actual /played since the last one (after the first 20 levels anyway). By the point of level 30 a less experienced player could spend a whole 24 hours before they unlock a new ability, which makes that ability an incredibly impactful reward. As a general rule of thumb a full toy box that is overflowing is a lot less exciting than a toy you have been wanting for a long time. 
---
Secondly: Introducing abilities, especially abilities designed for later expansions, proposes a very real risk of breaking apart vanilla gameplay. Much of later design is based around trying to provide every class an equal opportunity in every circumstance, a Paladin tank should be as good of a choice for single target tanking as a Warrior or Druid (for example), and later spell design reflects that. I'm not die-hard against Paladin tanks, but I don't want them to be as good as Warriors in every situation - their design should be as AoE tanks, with relatively poor performance in single target encounters, compared to Warriors and Druids. Later design does not reflect this. 
---
And again, Vanilla players almost invariably like this design, classes should have different roles and niches in encounters, and they should not all be designed as equals in all situations, with only differences for the player playing them.
---
Introducing enough abilities can significantly change the flavour and playstyle of the class, especially if those abilities are actually good (ie, worth introducing to begin with), let alone the balance. Without invoking the slippery slope fallacy, introducing those abilities to those classes is what made those classes what they are in Battle for Azeroth. I'm all for introducing new abilities, but for example why do Rogues need an Area of Effect ability? Isn't their single target damage, crowd control, stealth, and lock picking enough of a niche to make them desirable in a party? Do Warriors really need more gap closers, when their biggest Achilles heel is their need to be in melee range?
---
**Regarding your fourth point I don't think anyone here will disagree.**
---
5. Buff the specs that suffered in Vanilla. TBC did a lot of things wrong but also a lot of things right. Buffing and fixing specs like feral druid, protection paladin, shadow priest, balance druid and elemental/enhancement shaman should be done again. I’m not advocating for any class or spec changes in Classic. Just if they decided to go the expanded Classic route.
---
Sure, but do it intelligently. Referring back to those niches, and specific roles. Protection Paladins should not become what they were in TBC - a single target tank as good as a Warrior and an AoE tank far better. They should be a solid choice for an encounter with adds, as consecration is a fantastic ability, but for single target? Bring a Warrior. For a DPS race? Bring a Druid for their impressive threat output. And so on. 
---
Hybrid DPS should be lower than pure DPS, but they should be as desirable in 5 mans through to 40 mans, and that should be done by presenting them as DPS stims, or because of their flexibility. As it is content does not encourage this well, but again this is part of what leads to that Vanilla gameplay. Shadow Priests are the best example of this done right (almost). Depending on how competitive a guild is they will make sure to bring someone spec'd for Shadow Weaving, a very competitive guild will bring a healer who will maintain it (and this should be discouraged, as it prevents Shadow Priests from having a functional DPS support role), a guild that wants to get bosses downed but isn't racing for speed clears will bring a Shadow Priest, a guild that is moderately casual will bring perhaps two or three. This is how Hybrid DPS should be designed, as it provides a different role to a pure DPS role, and whilst that's not to say a class with a Healing spec shouldn't be able to have a pure damage role (like Warriors do), I feel that for the sake of maintaining the spirit of Vanilla gameplay, that should very much be a minority of Hybrid roles, exclusively for Classes with multiple damage trees (Shamans for example, and potentially Druids - as their Cat Form can already stand up on its own). 
---
&gt; 6. Keep Expanded Classic within Azeroth. I loved the Outlands and Northrend but I believe it wasn’t the best for the community of WoW as a whole. Shattrath and Dalaran separated players and kept them out of sight of lower level players. Seeing a level 60 ride by you on his mount as you were a lowly level 20 gave players a goal to strive for. Having them stop and help you with a difficult mob or to protect you from the opposing faction gave a real sense of living in this world.
---
Ultimately I agree with you, assuming the level cap were to increase. If it were not I believe that this risk is perfectly manageable:
---
First by the removal of Shattrath/Dalaran, for two reasons. Destination to destination Transport should always be avoided as it results in uncontrollable world shrinkage, if players do not have to undertake a journey to engage in content the world begins to feel smaller. The second reason being that neutral cities break down faction rivalry. For this purpose I'd introduce two new smaller cities on the scale of Booty Bay (with similar access to services) for each city (In the case of Outland I'd align them with the Draenei and Blood Elves - as NPC race allies of each faction). 
---
Secondly there should be nothing offered on Outland/Northrend that outright supersedes anything offered on Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms. Items crafted from ingredients gathered on other continents should offer different bonuses. Whilst these may be the best consumable, enchantment, or equipment for certain characters, they should not be for all characters. 
---
Thirdly access to the new continents should not be localized in one single area. This results in players becoming effectively trapped on their new continents, and not travelling for the sake of convenience. Imagine if every time you wanted to run Stratholme and you were in Zangarmarsh you'd have to run the length of two continents to get there. Your first question would be "Can you summon?". For this sake there should be multiple ways to access a continent, from a variety of places. None of these routes should be forms of 'destination to destination' transport, but instead transport from one mildly inconvenient place to another, forcing you to travel through the world. For example, consider getting to Dire Maul as an Alliance player in Ironforge. First you take a Flight Path to the Wetlands, then you run to the boat, and take a boat (functionally the same as a portal in this case - the placement is the key component, not the aesthetic here), from Theramore you again take a Flight Path, and begin riding your mount. Scattering more gateways to any other continent across the map helps to combat players not engaging in the world outside of their current focus, but care must be taken to assure that all those gateways are just that bit mildly inconvenient, to avoid world shrinkage. 
---
I'm not sure, is cross realm BG a 1.12 or a 2.0 thing ? (2.0 was a vanilla patch but with TBC talents and QOL changes) 
---
And anyway since Blizzard seems to listen to the community, I hope they won't include cross realm anything.
---
It really is a case of "you think you do, but you don't" here.
---
I'm playing on a classic server and the enemy castbars mod I'm using works maybe 1/10th of the time. Is there an addon that actually has it working?
---
BWL was such a refreshing change from MC by virtue of the fact that the trash didn’t respawn...when it took multiple days a week to progress, it was a sanity saver.
---
in the past, they've sent out beta invites and such without announcing a beta before so it's not that crazy an idea for some people to get beta invites and then they confirm the beta a couple hours later.
---
this is why you have to always keep yourself updatwd on your bnet account for wanting to participate in a beta. there is a beta sign up process so you want to be in there! 
---
I'm in the same boat. We killed Twin Emps by the time Naxx came out, and decided that the first couple of bosses in Naxx should be easier than C'Thun, so we killed Instructor Rezuvious and Anub'Rekhan. Then the news about TBC slowly killed the guild.
---
This time I'd really like to clear Naxx, but I simply can't put more than two raiding nights into the game anymore. I really hope there will be guilds with similar schedules so slowly but surely, I can finish Naxx.
---
They should release Kara tuned for 60s 
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?!
---
*cough* *cough* sorry boss I suddenly came down with a highly contagious disease and I have to go home immediately and not return to work for awhile.. I'll be back when I'm better
---
Same. Pally on Selo. Just can’t do pre Luclin EQ anymore. 
---
Since my Rogue will definitely be an alt and get nowhere close to Naxx.... I don't see too much of an issue lol.
---
Good to know it ID locks you anyway. I assume the Frost Runes won't regenerate until after the lockout expires?
---
Yeah i really miss paying those 13€ a month too :D
---
(just a joke, I'd rather have an official Bliz server that won't disappear too, my experience on a pserver stopped with a lvl 33 hunter).
---
Fresh
---
Ya maybe seasonal servers or a TBC server you can copy your characters too
---
Wtf is that hunter topping the dps meter?
---
Too early to say.  They’re playing this whole thing by ear and gauging reactions.  
---
I’d like to see an eventual BC and WotLK launch, before they start a rolling “hardcore” mode for the expansions post cataclysm, the idea being there are no content droughts.  
---
IDEALLY the end state is all the expansions have a server where you can hop on and play THAT expansion with all the other people consciously choosing to play THAT expansion. 
---
That deadly pan deeps 😌
---
If you actually use GNNP and dps the boss it's not bad. 
---
But ofc because you were a shitter on retail then it must be impossible.
---
i was interested in the same thing
---
My concern is if a tablet could even run classic when it comes out. I was debating buying one for on the go play 
---
Yeah the Barbershop is a nice feature. Especially good for the RP community 
---
Alright ty man!
---
Garona(US) - Deathb - undead mage and the wpvp fights. Temujin - troll warrior sitting in Org with the epic sets. And Tinybaby - gnome with the ridiculous AH items.
---
I still remember these characters after all these years. We were a launch server, but slowly died into a ghost town. We never had the top tier of raiders, but it was home for me and my friends.
---
Nah, we're all gonna be here bitching how all the servers are full. Ahhh, the good old days...
---
I mean, you can send Enchanting mats that a Rogue acquires to an alt with Enchanting, but it does save mailbox hassle I suppose.
---
&gt;Graphics were the least of Classics draw back then.
---
Now we all know, you have no clue what you're talking about.  It was a large part of their success, better graphics than their competitors, was very impressive for the time, also said by Bizz themselves at the 2006 Blizzcon.  Please sit down.
---
Yes, and osrs is 5x as popular as rs3 on bad days, and 10-15 times as popular on good days. Goes to show that when you do something right originally you should try to emulate it rather than attempt to reinvent the wheel every expansion.
---
Not just the roster, but consumables.  You could spend all week farming to spend your raid nights wiping over and over, without a kill in naxx.
---
I started listening to Rise Against a ton while doing the hunter epic quest. The how-to-video had them and sugarcult on a couple of the fights. 
---
Looking for a guild
---
NA RP-PVP or PVP
---
My faction is still up in the air. Played Horde through WotLK, but I'd be willing to go Alliance
---
I live in CST and my evenings are pretty free most days 6-12 P.M.
---
I'd like to find a semi-hardcore raiding guild. Tanking was when WoW really grabbed me, but I didn't start tanking until late BC. So I've been tossing around the idea of playing a warrior, but I'm not certain on that. I'd probably end up choosing something else if a guild has too many warriors anyways. It would probably end up being druid or shaman/paladin. More than anything I enjoyed the social aspects WoW once had. Mostly, I'm looking for a friendly guild that'll be enjoyable to raid with.
---
I made so many friends playing on private servers it's crazy. The population is really high but there are also less english speakers so it's not that many more people to interact with than a high pop Classic server will be. Literally doing random quests, dungeons, battlegrounds resulted in a lot of random conversations -&gt; "hey i added you" -&gt; we're randomly doing UBRS or BG's or something together a month later at max level. The game just lends itself to meeting people, if you're the kind of person that likes making online friends.
---
Considering the stealth classes are Rogue and (Feral) Druid, which are melee, I was more than happy to try out my mage. 6 years later and it's still my main. 
---
Being a resto druid spamming healing touch and the odd rejuv. I genuinely remember almost nodding off to sleep during our 4 hour BWLs.
---
I still like it a lot, but, it taught me a lesson in playing either a dps, or a healer with an actual healing toolkit that might require some decisionmaking, like a priest.
---
ANAL  Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker 
---
He dead, he can see you full of dread, but most improtantly, he hab de bread.
---
Well, they kinda have to have like 50+ raiders able to spend 1k gold / week for raids only.
---
I'd say pretty damn hardcore, if you ask me.
---
first rank 14 alliance on my server in vanilla (Dunemaul) was Rave, a rogue who got it doing only world pvp if i remember right
---
Dunemaul was awesome, we had Tales of the Past 2 filmed on our server and I joined in with the battle scenes :D a pala from our guild was in a close-up shot when they spoke to the tauren druid.  his name was Greddy
---
Oh my God the suppression room lag. My computer could not take it either, luckily I was a mage and not particularly needed
---
I feel like melee dps gets away with there not being a "melee dps" flask. Meanwhile healers are probably expected to get distilled wisdom.
---
cos restor druids suck even more, and as a raid you rather want an other healer and you take 1 druid just for the buff, cos you still need pawn buff and battle res from druid, so moonkin comes handy for that. he also boosts other mages with crit aura. utilizes leather spell gear, and doesnt need on mages tier pieces, so mages in the raid gear up quicker.
---
restor druid on official vanilla will be even weaker, cos regrowth on private coded that way that it count +healing twice for direct heal and then for hot, when it should be just once.
---
they also can tank some things. i remeber doing zg on ps, and moonkin just swapped gear and tanked third add just fine.
---
they also have sleep cc, which come handy in many instances. like ubrs. also can dispel and abolish poison which is potent in instances like stratholm undead, when you have a priest healer. and some others. (priest healers cant remove poison).
---
their aoe is decent. they pwn with gear. and duels.
---
Yeah, I could agree with you, unless Blizzard does some last minute change it probably wouldn't have much of an impact. Everything is going to be waaay easier than it was for people in actual retail vanilla because people are so against tuning the bosses at all even though we have 1.12 talents among other things like knowing mechanics inside and out and guides being literally everywhere now unlike 2005.
---
It was so boring going back on a pserver and playing a healer because even in a really casual guild that allowed bad hybrid specs to play we'd cruise through a boss so fast I never felt like I had to manage my mana as much as I did back then. T0.5 at any point probably wouldn't make much of a difference especially when you think that a class like a warrior could have spent 1/3 of that time farming BRD and likely have a good shot at HoJ and Ironfoe and way more gold :p
---
Happened a lot on private servers. The plague lands become unplayable 
---
Substitute 8 for 20. 😂
---
Not a big deal to be honest. I was happy on Nostalrius and would be happy on Nostalrius 2.
---
Naxx was only out for 6 months before tbc.
---
with end-game gear they could do huge crits so they were OK in pvp.  in a raid... well the mages/locks in your party would love you but you wouldn't exactly be top 10 dps!  
---
quite fun to play in general though!
---
if you have a casual guild i'm sure they'll be fine with it... people talk about min-maxing shit but a rogue who is lazy will do less dps than a diligent boomkin
---
I think you should get to 60 first.
---
Then do the pre-raid BiS grind.
---
Then get your gear from MC, Ony, BWL.
---
Then ZG, AQ20, AQ40.
---
Then wipe endlessly in Naxx before you have all your gear from there.
---
Then, if you're still playing, you can start thinking about what's next.
---
And all of this is assuming that you're not going to level alts.
---
Ive never played on private servers before so this is all news to me. I imagined classic WoW with no one talking to each other in groups like on progression servers. This actually excites me to play.
---
&gt; But we don't really know how quickly / at what points it is supposed to taper off.
---
But we know the math.
---
Priests and mages: 13 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick (2s)
---
So there's a base of 13, and +5 (from 20 spirit) at level 1. It only goes up to +8 or +9 from spirit at level 10 when you can start allocating stats.
---
So spirit tap from 10-14 will grant something like 11mp2 from spirit tap while casting, or you can boost wands for +25% damage and frontload damage and use 5SR to get 22mp2 while wanding.
---
Go wands first.
---
Bit of a tangent, but it's crazy to me that anyone cares about world firsts in a 15 year old game. Who cares who the first 60 is? It's been done a million times before, or "world first" bosses. It makes no sense.
---
It's almost antithetical to the reason we want Classic back. Rushing through the content we all love just so you can say "world first Ragnaros" a week after launch while everyone else is just enjoying the levelling and all that is so bizzare. I can't see anyone really caring about world first raiding stuff in a 15 year old game.
---
800 goldof consumables PER RAID lmao
---
Can vouch for healer farming. I played holy priest, and barely ever farmed.  I’d pick herbs if it was on the path to where I was going, though.  We went 11/15 -thad/4h cucked us.
---
Bring it.
---
I'm gtg. I've been gtg for about 10 years.
---
Is this story any different for warlocks? I was also planning on doing tailor/chanting at lvl 1
---
Tabasco pizza fucking gross bro 
---
Yeah, the tough part about Vanilla raiding is having 40 people with the patience, endurance and time to get it done, the amount of preparation needed is one of the biggest challenges about it. It's a very different challenge from retail raiding which is first and foremost about execution (not to say it doesn't require any of the other things, but definitely not to the same extend).
---
Yeh i've been reading quite a bit bout how threat works right now. But as you say: i'll need to do some of those dungeuns to really feel and understand!
---
Yeah, i saw that one as well.  Looks like the level required is a bit higher, though it goes yellow at a similar time (16 vs 15).  
---
The Westfall one requires a couple other quests before it, though is available at a lower level (9 vs 13).  Probably doable a few levels earlier if you can get a party together, which might be pretty easy with as many people will want a wand/good 2H weapon.
---
Not really, casters have it hardest for sure.
---
Melee dps need a lot of elixirs (shit stacks) and 3 types of jujus, plus scrolls.
---
Healers dont even need to flask outside progress raids, you can get away with intellect elixirs alone (pretty cheap too).
---
I would usually either flask or use elixirs (intellect, mageblood, was maybe something more).
---
If you are performing well and not going oom (spamming greater mana pots on cd, also cheap af), noone will complain about not flasking.
---
&gt; i cleared naxx on pserver (without world buffs) with semi chill guild and def did not spend 500g per run. 
---
And you did that like 6-8 months after Naxx was open, right?
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
on a pve server u can get by
---
and the night elf racial can help any other class
---
but in general its difficult.. stealth brings a certain peace of mind and the ability to skip things
---
I can not.  I mained a Rogue and Mage, in TBC mages got Invisibility as a skill which made me ultimately decided to change my main.
---
For Classic I'm not playing Rogue again so Nelf Druid it is!  Stealth is even more valuable now that I'm more casual.
---
Modified 🤣
---
Most of those are things he said he wanted to see done differently. 
---
no it was proper progress. took like a month to kill KT which was similar to other non try hard guilds on server.
---
Good one 😂
---
I've got an SK on p99 that I go back to here and there. I love it, but p99 has a few quirks that rub me wrong, especially the the enforcement of the stripped down client. No spell sets? wtf guys.  
---
Agnarr initially attracted me back to live with it being PoP locked, but I resubbed the day before Mangler and Selo went live. I figured WoW Classic will be out well before Mangler gets to PoP, so for me, why not go and enjoy original, Kunark, SoV as I wait. yeah, SoV wont be out before classic, but who's to say I wont wind up subbed to both.
---
On private servers.
---
Will be a whole different story in Classic. 
---
&gt;there is no right/wrong way to play an open world rpg
---
Open world rpg? You are right. This is a multiplayer game though.
---
fuckign supression room tho.
---
Not that it was too hard, just learning it was frustrating, and also in the end its still a huge PITA to do every week. 
---
I'm probably never gonna que while levelling, it's fun to travel and go through that process once or twice. But it gets old pretty quickly in my opinion.
---
I only plan to do BGs at 60 anyway, so doesn't affect me much.
---
Was that ming the rogue who made the videos and wrote blogs on that website that I can't remember the name of? Or just another guy named ming
---
&gt;Right now we're trying to restore 2006. Once the game is out there next summer we'll listen to the players and do what's right for the game but we'll have to see. - WoW Q&amp;A, Blizzcon 2018
---
in translation yes they will bring TBC  *IF* there is enough hype for it
---
and I kinda suspect they will be on new servers
---
BGs and raids, because you're good in pvp, and pve. The only issue with rogues is the sheer number of them in vanilla.
---
Best bet is to headbutt your garage door, fall into coma for 3 months and wake up at release.
---
&gt;  The rest will clear it at later stages. 
---
There won't be any except hardcore guilds.
---
"The rest" will be in BWL, MC, ZG and AQ20.
---
How is paying 60$ for a game it being free you dumbass?
---
Spoken like a true programmer. 
---
It is the same with a different representation. 
---
And it is easy for Blizz to reduce the impact of rating one with levels. 
---
I agree! I love seeing snapshots like that of inventory from the past 
---
wut
---
2 and 3 seems the most realistic and cost efficient for blizzard in my humble opinion. Doing seasonal launches every once in a while could push people to restart classic from the beginning and it’s only a matter of coordination on which patch to deploy. If all the assets are in the client already, it does not seem that difficult.
---
The hard part is communication around the phases outside the game, like on the website (maybe you can in the server list, explain in which phase the server is).
---
The main question is “is Classic is going to be such a success that blizzard will also roll TBC?“
---
But I clearly think that seasonal launches should be done like it was done in Diablo 2, with the ladder.
---
Having 40 organised and motivated players will be the main issue.
---
I think our knowledge of game mechanics and online databases will even out a lot of the hardships.  But having a system for farming consumables optimally (so no one player is carrying the guild/group) as well as managing loot assignment so that the guild group gears up at an acceptable rate to clear content... All possible, but it's going to be spread over months, and as soon as one 'geared' player changes spec or stops showing up, it can create a cascade of players putting themselves before the guild...  
---
Or more commited players may get frustrated by the speed over progress and jump to a 'better' guild and create the same issue if players feeling they 'have' to put themselves first or they are getting ripped off by the guild...  
---
Let's just say you have a full MC clear per week... That's 10 bosses with maybe 3-4 epics each... So at best one item per player...  But that's not how it works with random drops and duplicate drops...  Some players might go weeks without loot.
---
Then if you are gearing up your 'best' players first, you create a new problem.  Your best will get bored, they won't need to farm MC anymore while your trailing players will get frustrated that their DPS/HPS isn't getting better...  Now both end of you team are frustrated with MC, but for different reasons...
---
So I think the game will be easy, compared to the social management...
---
real talk lol
---
Honestly speaking, 16 debuff slots is still too few.
---
To do damage as Shadow you need 2 debuff slots, one for SW:P and the other  Mind Flay besides Shadow weaving.
---
That is a hardcore guild in Classic, because keeping it stable and not losing members, implies good progress. Good progress implies heavy use of consumables and hours or raiding.
---
Which, BY DEFINITION...it's hardcore.
---
Favourite raid in classic was probably ZG, it may have been naxx if I spent more time in there and they didn't remake it in wrath, I just get a lot of nostalgia and good feels from ZG. Love the style and everything about that stv life.
---
Of all time it's probably between any of the BC raids + maybe ulduar, BC raids were just so good, kara, TK, BT, I really hope the progression leads up to a BC legacy server too personally. 
---
Definitely understandable! It is pretty late for the east coasters. Its even a little late for me being Mountain time, but a lot of our members work late unfortunately. 
---
Good luck on finding a place, and you're always welcome in the FC ;D
---
I want to level a hunter but i'm afraid to not having enough money to buy mount at 40. I have doubts with profession paths:
---
\- Mining / Engi : Trying to have Engineering up to date while i level. Most of the mining mats are wasted to level up engineering so is not generating gold at all. At least I have bombs and some funny toys to PvP while leveling.
---
\-Mining / Skining or Herbalism : Save ores i need to level up Engi later on, sell all skins and plants in the AH for profit. There is even a more conservative way, saving herbs too until I have enough to level Herbalism to 300.
---
What to do?
---
Think of it as a player knowledge handicap.
---
To make rogues cry.

So a Boomkin and 4 Elemental Shamans?
---
Sounds like one Hell of a firing squad to me.
---
That’s my plan. How in depth is the 40 mount? I know the 60 mount is a loooong chain. 
---
Honored: 10% discount on bought items from vendors. 
---
Exalted: You can purchase the mount of this specific race. 
---
I think in today's world we will easily be able to progress through Naxx as a casual guild. Back then people were idiots, didn't have stable internet connections, or good enough PCs to really play the game. Now with better PC's, better interwebs, and a better understanding of classic I believe everyone that wants to clear naxx will be able to clear naxx.
---
It may still take some time, and consumable farming will need to happen, but I think its possible even casually playing. 
---
You have. And hell I was married when it came out and it was still integral to my life.
---
I alternated 1 point in each and it felt really good. At 40, I respecced to Shadow Form, and put my next 5 points in wands. 
---
You can use discipline school, iirc.  So shield should fall under that.
---
Yeah most guilds I was apart of had bother and sister guilds that we usually raided with just because of the fact 40+ people keeping pace with gear, without consumeables, knowledge/skill of bosses and will to keep trying over and over is insane 
---
Stop posting this 8 times a day.
---
Dude, my brother and I rolled on a private server last week. We spent ALL weekend playing.
---
My only question is: Where the hell did the Weekend go? It's Monday and I'm stuck at work wishing I had a way to play. Friday blurred into Monday.
---
A popular private server had bg queue button and it didn't end well...
---
Horde was the dominating pvp faction on that realm so they had long bg queue. With the bg queue button they would camp every single alliance 50+ flight point and hub day and night to farm levellers on an industrial scale. It was a TERRIBLE experience to level as alliance due to the bg queue button. We are not talking about normal world pvp but just pure farming of honor every day day and night. They would stand at a hub/FP and teleport to a BG, and after the BG teleport back to the same spot and just continue ganking. You would die over and over trying to use the Flightmaster and everytime you landed you would die. That gets old pretty quick.
---
After some weeks they was forced to disable the bg queue button for lvl 60 bgs. That damn button was the main reason I quit that server.
---
It's VERY dangerous to add new convenient functions to Vanilla. It can have dire results...
---
BWL was really cool and shows the real skill of a guild.
---
back in vanilla i feal good after defeating nefarian every week with the raid group.
---
and T2 set is nice and powerfull 😊
---
I cant wait for the 5 man dungeons. Not sure if i go to a raid again.
---
You're going to make new friends in Classic, I promise dude.
---
I am completely with you, I wont be rushing or racing but there seems to be plenty of appetite for it around here.
---
Nah
---
Barely.
---
Large reason why I plan on having my rogue for solo play. Being able to stealth around in cities and gank is too good to not do.
---
Grind Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Why type all that out, realize what you said is wrong, and still post it?
---
There is also one for a quest in silverpine.
---
True, but it's a skill I need to master.
---
Holy Paladin looking for a mediumcore raid guild. Class / role / raid leader experience. Goal is to clear current content while current.
---
US / West coast / 8-12pm PST raid times / PVE / Alliance
---
I'll be rushing to 60 week 1.
---
The great thing is you just need to make a macro to equip/unequip and it resets your breath so you can use your normal wep.
---
Man I forgot about Baron Soosdon!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Sword spec? Buy cheap shot, kidney shot, sinister strike, and eviscerate. Rank 1 every other attack. You want all tanks of stealth, but other utilities you need someone smarter to tell you. Point is, by 40 you can save like 8g by skipping ambush and backstab. 
---
What’s the point of this? No changes
---
Exactly, they downvoted me becouse 1) they didnt try it on a private server with huge population where is impossible to play wsg and arathi 2) they have no fukin idea of how that system works. It old and not good against years and years of players from private servers.
---
No different at all, I play locks as an alt quite often and usually pair tailoring with herbalism.  Warlocks are less dependent on pots than other classes, so either ench or engineering is the choice if you dont want a money making gathering skill.
---
&gt;  Typically a person that does Naxxramas use at least 5-6 hours a day just preparing for the raid. 
---
And those will have to be like 50 players / guild. I mean...for one guy it's damn hard. Having like 50 guys in same guild able to put out 5-6 hours/day for farming only...only the top hardcore guilds will raid Naxx. Like 10% of the guilds.
---
The rest...will be in BWL and some AQ40 bosses.For ever.
---
It would be laughable if it was bop. There were lots of things that needed early fixes cause they made no sense and blizzard got those things fixed. Undoing the fix would just degrade the game.
---
Because I don't like deleted posts, and there nothing wrong with admitting you're wrong.
---
The people in this thread are RACEist
---
And any other class/spec.
---
1.Buy as few skills as you can. 
---
2.Don't do any crafting professions as you level, its a lot of gold.
---
3.if your'e starting on day 1, money is going to be VERY tight on the server. You don't make very much money from AHing. My tried and true method is to kill anything that drops Tiger Meat and to cook jungle stew from them to vendor. Pair it with skinning and vendor all the skins. Its a suprising amount of gold for your level. 
---
Honestly, I kinda like the idea of leaving it BoP until the ZG patch. It's more authentic, but would also put a bit more pressure on the high-end raiding guilds as they wouldn't have flasks as readily available/at their disposal.
---
But, honestly, I don't care enough either way. Not gonna be upset about either direction.
---
Exactly why I plan on leveling either alchemy or engineering instead of skinning. I’d rather have the items I’m making to help me grind than to level skinning only to retrain it. 
---
its not hard at all.  they make playing lock more fun, instead of grinding gold you get to do a little chain other classes dont get
---
?
---
I agree, but some people also want the most authentic experience possible
---
Wait, what's the argument here? Why shouldn't it be tradable?
---
Fair enough I guess 
---
but that doesnt mean there's one way to play it, multiplayer games always have multiple ways you can play them
---
The most ideal idea though... would be to Keep Classic intact.. retconn everything post Classic, and start new "retail" with Vanilla design in mind. 
---
Look in your spellbook. All spells under the Holy tab you can't use - rest you can.
---
Ah thanks, I didn't know that
---
straight up AH sell EVERYTHING. I've done it multiple times. Cloth/Leather/Random Drops, sell it all on the Auction House. You will net a profit every time. 
---
Originally it was BoP until ZG patch (1.7)
---
Some people want the most authentic experience possible
---
It is if you use X-pearl lol. It's a pretty basic raid frame UI.
---
Even if you never have a windfall, you should have your mount right when you hit 40. Even if you’re unlucky, level 42 at the latest. 
---
 A popular private pvp server had bg queue button and it didn't end well...
---
Horde was the dominating pvp faction on that realm so they had long bg queue. With the bg queue button they would camp every single alliance 50+ flight point and hub day and night to farm levellers on an industrial scale while waiting for a bg to pop. It was a TERRIBLE experience to level as alliance due to the bg queue button. We are not talking about normal world pvp but just pure farming of honor every day day and night. They would stand at a hub/FP and teleport to a BG, and after the BG teleport back to the same spot and just continue ganking. You would die over and over trying to use the Flightmaster (you cant use it while in combat) and everytime you landed you would die. That gets old pretty quick.
---
After some weeks they was forced to disable the bg queue button for lvl 60 bgs. That damn button was the main reason I quit that server. You can still gank while in queue without the button but it will only really work on 10min+ queue and cut down the time available for ganking with like 3/4.
---
It's VERY dangerous to add new convenient functions to Vanilla. It can have unexpected dire results... The Vanilla ranking system does not work well with a bg queue button.
---
I'm not really concerned, as I'm no tryharder in mmo and I don't think I will clear all the content.
---
But I still ask myself some question.
---
Guess I can't
---
Nop, because it doesn't not answer the question.
---
Hoping for TBC but the option but the option to just copy your vanilla char would be awesome, so you can still keep raiding vanilla for some time.
---
Nevertheless, its too far to predict and imo not worth stressing about yet.
---
And they’re much faster than the tank, making it impossible to get agro back. 
---
I would like to see BC and WotLk as well, since I wasn't here when it first launched.
---
A lot of trash in 5-mans have cleave, but that’s never stopped a Rogue from standing in it. 
---
Nothing
---
Wat? 
---
That’s retail wow spellbook, not vanilla.
---
Oh shit I forgot about that. I wouldn't mind making black lotus flasks even more scarce until ZG to be honest.
---
Old baguettes can be used as a mace.
---
Yes, it was the Rogue
---
Ah yes pickpocket will come in handy!
---
AQ 40, all the bug civilization was so creepy and interesting to me even today
---
No, but the way you play it affects others, which is why those other players want to tell you how to play, or usually, how NOT to play.
---
Such an iconic leveling item. it was the first item I actually lusted after and grinded (ground?) SM for
---
I spent also days killing people in ungoro, i was a rogue so i had no problems with that, but it is a pain... you have to wait for the kill and for the right moment.. collecting one mark at time from a lost battleground  (wsg or arathi) is less impegnative. AND you want the exalted reputation for the epic gear... Basically you have no choice... you are forced to afk bgs.. we are speaking of milions of honor per week, those that downvoted me have no fukin idea.
---
Really depends on what you call later stages. As it seems to be now, you will have all the time in the world as a guild to clear it. Surely the casual guilds will clear it at some point.
---
There's a couple videos out there of Boomkins raping people in both WPvP &amp; WSG.
---
It is also possible to do reasonable top-10 dps in later stages of the game, if you know what you're doing &amp; take the time to farm sufficient consumables.
---
Some people like the challenge of making it work. You can always roll a Mage &amp; be an instant top performer with no effort, but what fun would that be?
---
My guild cleared up to 4 horsemen without flasks and only required an elixir and food.
---
Right because as soon as people do things better on pservers than people did in vanilla it's because of pserver bugs ofc
---
&gt; LFG and xrealm
---
You know what, you guys like to beat this narrative to death but my bnet friends list is more players who were not on my realm then were.  There's nothing stopping you from sending a friend invite to someone on a different realm after a pleasant encounter.
---
Those results are so extremely far from reality on private servers. I mean, human warrior being #1 is no surprise, put paladin #2 and druid #3? That's just insane. Druid has been by far the least played class in basically every vanilla WoW server that has ever existed, retail or private. I'm prepared for some differences between N*st-likes and Classic because a lot of players will come in not knowing the vanilla "meta," but it's still very questionable to see the universally least played class rank near the top. That makes me doubt how much these votes can be considered meaningful.
---
I always liked the resto/balance druid spec that goes to moonglow in balance, good healing with some alright spell damage on the side
---
Too early to plan. They will develop Classic at least 2 years.
---
Im planning on being ahead of most people so hopefully stv wont be too big an issue
---
I personally understand why they might not want to tweak gameplay elements for the sake of fixing Vanilla's "mistakes". As it stands, Classic has the potential to generate a good amount of revenue with very little money spent on maintenance. If Blizzard started balancing things, they would suddenly need to spend more resources and manpower to keep Classic running.
---
People are still idiots and it wasn't the dark ages or something. PCs and connection were fine. Still, if people are just bad, they won't clear naxx imo
---
big damage abilities has a signficantly higher chance than dots. IIRC fear ward triggers first but I could be wrong. Either way it's definitely worth getting unbreakable
---
Im torn between druid and shaman atm, stealth is a convience that i would really miss in the open world, it was fun just to follow people around like a creeper
---
Id choose subscription model any day of the week when it comes to mmos. Better that than any kind of paid cosmetics
---
Sounds like you need some [Waitmate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbr7B1OVa0g) friend
---
2 years is long indeed!
---
I like Option 4 a lot, and I hope it happens. A lot of people are wary of that, saying that if they add new things, we'll just end up with retail again. I disagree, and here's why: The goal would be different this time around.
---
The first time around, they added in new things which aimed to reinvent the wheel, to innovate. They didn't just want to add more zones and dungeons; they wanted to shift the status quo to give us exciting new reasons to come back to the game. This means revamping the talent system, massively changing how abilities work, getting rid of ammo, etc. Sweeping changes rather than simply adding more content.
---
But this time around, because retail is already a thing, still being iterated upon, the goal for classic wow can easily be to continue adding content of the same kind, without needing to innovate. This is very similar to how Oldschool Runescape happened.
---
Originally, Runescape was being developed as most games are, which meant innovation. The game changed over time in major ways. Eventually, a lot of people wanted the old version of the game back, and they gave it to us. But this time around, they didn't re-implement the same major changes as the first time, but *nor did they leave the game stagnant*. They add in new things fairly often, but the goal of these changes is not to innovate, but simply to expand upon the game in its current state, its current feel.
---
I would love to see WoW do the same. Instead of coming up with exciting new features for each expansion, just keep making "more vanilla". Make new continents and zones for us to quest through, but instead of making them feel like BC and Wrath zones/quests, make them continue to feel like vanilla quests. Make new dungeons and raids in those zones, but again, instead of changing how they work to feel more innovative, make them just feel like even more vanilla dungeons and raids. Granted, this advice is a little vague, but I am assuming most of you understand the point. There's a way to add more of the same, rather than iterating, innovating, and refining. The latter is how you handle a game when you want to keep impressing with new things, but also how you lose fans who only want to play the original "version" of the game. The former can still maintain the "same game", while giving us more and more to do.
---
Add onto this that in Oldschool Runescape, the devs come up with ideas of what to add, but they let the community have a way to veto those proposed changes. If 75% or more of players approve, then the change can go through, but otherwise, the change does *not* go through. This is a good way to safeguard. Even without this, I think Blizzard could approach new vanilla content with the goal stated above, to expand but not innovate. But to add on this kind of vote system would be an extra safeguard in case they come up with an idea which the community feels is too big a change. We could tell them "No, thanks."
---
Yup taking 2 weeks of lol
---
Khadgar EU or NA?
---
It's good to scout out what you'll want to main so when release comes you'll know what to direct your initial release energy on so you don't up with a day played on something you don't like.
---
No sry senpai i dont know japanese words U_U
---
Oh, for sure dude. Even at like level 12, you'll see a pack of 2-3 mobs and pray inside that a priest walks by (or a warrior, if you're the priest) on the same quest. Dungeons require a bit of communication even at low levels, and there tends to be a lot of chatting while you wait etc. Then once you factor in no cross-realm, you end up running into the same people that you also have more reason to talk to due to the nature of the game. It really does encourage the social aspect of the game and I think that's definitely a lot of the charm, which makes me glad because being meeting people online and doing cool stuff together in-game is pretty timeless.

Man On The Moon II: The Legend Of Mr. Rager
---
It was on repeat all through levelling in WotLK. Every time I hear a track from that album it sends me back to levelling. 
---
🔥 **&lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore  🔥 
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD. 
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)

Yeah, going Horde for the first time (well, furthest I ever got before was like 18). Will be super interesting to see how the other side lives. Apparently horde have a better leveling experience overall and I've done the early Alliance zones *so* many times that the thought of another round isn't very appealing.
---
I was on archimonde in vanilla so most of the famous players I remember were from &lt;Nurfed&gt;.   
---
Vhell - undead priest and GM, i think he casts video games now or something
---
Noktyn - undead warrior, guy who got the loot table bugged legendary neck in MC
---
Ogretorixx (or something like that) - undead rogue with thuderfury
---
Graff (again, not sure on spelling) - tauren warrior with hand of rag
---
As someone who's played both on pservers, BoP until ZG is way better for the game.
---
As a priest, what abilities should you buy while leveling? 
---
My SO is going to be playing a priest, and I a rogue, and I'd like to know what things are essential and what she can pass on so she has enough money (or close enough to it so that I can lend her some when/if needed) to buy a mount at 40. 
---
I've never played a priest before, so I have no idea where to even begin, but the reason I'm torn is because I imagine that she'd want to play shadow while leveling, but we'll also be running dungeons so she can get a feel for healing along the way, so her needed abilities are going to be much more numerous than mine, but just want to make sure we don't blow gold on things we don't need. 
---
Thanks!
---
unless its unarmored mounts, or latency, or server downtime, or the original difficulty of raids, or the final version of AV. XD not making a jab at you just saying
---
Destro lock (assuming you skill down all the way to conflag), were lots of fun. Some significant skillcap if you wan't to become really good.. and you'll need some decent great. Just dinged lv60 you will struggle if majority in a BG outgears you significantly, specially good Rogues and Warriors. After you  get all your slots purpose it gets better and BWL+ gear you will realize how powerful Warlock is.
---
You can't get both nostalgia and the feeling of unknowns at the same time.
---
That's just how it is. People asked for classic they did not ask for a fresh game similar (but different) to vanilla.
---
I remember Fujin (Warrior) - server first r14 on Ragnaros EU. Oh my did he rek ppl...
---
**&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
PW:S is in the Discipline school, you can cast all non-holy spells.
---
In complete agreement. Mainataining a roster of active raiders will be the biggest challenge. My guld is pugging in BFA now just to go to 15-20 people. Without cross-server options, pugging will be harder in Classic too. My biggest fear is lack of people availible to do the content.
---
Keep in mind that if you wanna pvp it might be a better idea going gnome.
---
So you voted BoP, how do you feel?
---
Well, new psev is coming out mar 30 If you are interested. Just to scratch the itch maybe? 
---
Reputation from leveling is basically useless in classic. All you want is honored with your faction for discounts and that is really fast. 
---
I wish this was real so much
---
it buffs melee dps more than it buffs warlocks tbh.
---
Looking better than Everquest is hardly an achievement.
---
Remember that Doom 3 came out the same year.
---
Yeah but tryhards gonna tryhard
---
The cool Mannoroth kids have a Bnet group set up ready for classic. First PvP server to open the gates -- second overall.
---
This is how I feel about classes that don't have self heal.
---
What do you mean I have to sit here and eat food like a peasant?!
---
There was a dude named Tiberium on my old server who used to spam Seinfeld jokes in /2
---
Oh, totally. That's why 1 to 30 is skewed. Thought this was about the endgame class pops, my bad.
---
Hi, /u/OG_Goob
---
&gt;4.New Classic content. They build upon Classic WoW, adding expanded content. This scenario I think would be the most exciting as long as it was handled correctly and the one I will be talking more about. They have the ability to view what changes they made throughout WoWs history and avoid those mistakes. 
---
This would indeed be the most exciting scenario...which also makes it the most probable AND the most profitable. Let's not forget that Blizzard is in the money making business. Classic might be a passion project, but it is also a damn good opportunity to make a helluva money...IF it's not static. And anyone with 2 working neurons will not ignore such an opportunity.
---
However, Classic should always be a permanent option, regardless of what is coming after. There should always be Classic servers.
---
Blizzard, atm, have 2 choices : TBC or post-Naxx Classic content. I think both are probable, today, but I also think that post-Naxx Classic content will become much more popular 1 year into Classic. I might be wrong, but it is possible. And since it is possible, I think Blizzard is preparing for this possibility, because a DIFFERENT FORK for WoW is clearly the financial winner. Would bring in more money compared to TBC. Much more money. And Blizzard still wants to make money.
---
Thing is, you can't really increase lvl cap to 70 and in the same time keep Classic gear relevant. It will not work. Level cap should always be 60. No new talents. No new skills. Buffing certain specs could be done, but not the way there were buffed in TBC. Slight buffs for certain classes could be done, but it will have to be very small...because of PvP.
---
There is plenty that can be done for a Classic post-Naxx content, as long as Blizzard goes OSRS voting system way...but more restrictive. One year into Classic, everyone that is lvl 60, have at least 30 days time /played and participated in killing at least Ragnaros, should be able to vote. Everyone else, not, because they do not have the necessary game knowledge to vote objectively enough.
---
Giving Blizzard free reign would be a big mistake, for a post-Naxx Classic content. They will fuck it up. Only with a restrictive OSRS-like voting system a post-Naxx Classic content can be successful. 
---
It seems that I was way out of touch with this thread. My b
---
I assume it's the same mechanics that Entangle Roots operates under.  Druid with thorns on can accidentally break their own roots from thorns damage from melee attacks.  Higher levels of Entangle Roots have a lower chance to break.
---
With that being said, you can probably break fear on the first tick of curse of agony or whatever.
---
Gonna sleep too long and when you wake up "Classic WoW" is gonna mean cata
---
for warriors that's very true, however rogues can't use axe so basically all the rogues want swords on both sides
---
Guilds that couldn't kill Instructor Razuvious were no where near the execution skill needed to clear Naxx. 
---
Your guild was not even close.
---
People don't understand how sharding will be used and how it works but whatever make your own choices i couldn't give a fuck.
---
not how Counter spell worked, shadowbolt was destruction, fear was affliction.
---
It tended to lock out X school and X type, so counterspelling fear locked out all shadow spells and affliction spells.
---
Interupting a priest's holy heal would lock out all holy spells and all holy school typed spells like shield/inner fire.
---
Might be some small exceptions but this is by-in-large how it seemed to work and never game me problems.
---
Bonus trivia you could blanket silence a warriors shout and IIRC, a hunter can't trap while silence. This last one I didn't test until TBC but grounding totem absorbed hunter's trap, makes sense seeing as how frost reflector reflected it.
---
Literal nightmare.
---
If they went back to the days of shadowneld not breaking until aimed shots end, could easily make an argument for it
---
I did play tbc as a tank, wotlk as a tank and legion as a tank... the hardest tanking was in legion where they introduced mythic dungeons with levels of difficulty. I was doing +23 when i left wow again (the top players of the world were at +26 +27 usually)... all the tanks i met in the old times were usually nothing special but they were acting like girls because they had that privileged spot in the guild, hard to replace...
---
I used to think this... but then I realized it is basically like a speedrun of an old game. People enjoy that stuff so let them do it. I think it will be kinda interesting seeing what specific strategies they use, etc..
---
Someone will correct me if im wrong, but your going to want to get wand spec (in the disc tree) and spirit tap in shadow, then the rest in shadow.
---
You want to dps the mob down with dots and mindflay until about 20-50% then wand dps the rest down.
---
You only regen from spirit after you haven't casted a spell for 3s (or is it 5?), so you want to make sure you finish the mob off with wanding so you get the full effect of spirit tap.
---
If you have a decent wand, they can do almost as much dps as your spells so then you don't have to drink as much.
---
Mage is superior and more fun in every single aspect of the game.
---
Choose mage.
---
the frost gear too
---
worldofming.com
---
Sigh. Let's repeat the dance for the thousandth time.
---
1) The whole project came about because Vanilla is not available. So no, no changes to Classic. If they did that, what then? Shall we petition them to bring back Vanilla *again*? It's asinine.
---
2) Who decides what to include in this "Vanilla+"/"WoW 2"/whatever? You? The players? Blizzard? There are a million ideas and no one will agree on anything. Classic is a known thing, guaranteed to satisfy a lot of players. Any new thing is a big gamble. Why would Blizzard try and appease a (let's be real here) minority group of players who all want different things anyway? The only thing making a lick of business sense is to bring Classic TBC.
---
3) Let's assume Blizzard do create a "Vanilla+". What will be in it? Most people who worked on Vanilla originally have left Blizzard by now. The current designers are the proud creators of BfA. What do you think they will create? Or will they listen to the players? Like they did during the existence of WoW? Players will want *conveniences*. Enjoy your Group Finder, flying and super RNG loot. Let's be honest here. The Blizzard of old which created WoW Vanilla is dead. Blizzard will *never* create anything like it again. If they create a "Vanilla+", it's guaranteed to be *not* what you hope for.
---
hm that must be why when I look at naxx videos I see people with different guild names

---
Add it to the pile boys.
---
I mean, they're just a sub-par DPS like most of the hybrids, so they don't have a defined purpose. Druids do bring good stackable utility (Rebirth, Innervate) so it's not the worst "off-meta" spec in the whole world to raid with, but it's definitely an underperformer. In that regard, you could say that they have no purpose. Some people just like playing funny and uncommon specs, and since the first tier of vanilla raids is likely to be completely trivial, we might see some moonkins knocking around for fun in guilds that know they'll be fine without some min-maxed setup.
---
The 3% crit aura *technically* mitigates the shitty DPS a little, but it's not something that actually translates into the spec being statistically worthwhile. If you translate specs into simplified power levels, a mage might be 100 and a balance druid would be 60. Giving four mages +3% power basically elevates the druid to 72, so still way behind.
---
Another problem with these unorthodox specs is gearing. There just isn't proper gear for balance druids. This means they have to compete for cloth, and most raid leaders will be hesitant to give prime caster gear to a weak spec that doesn't make good use of it. Of all specs, balance druids probably have the worst itemization because even the druid sets that do try to give DPS stats give a strange mix of balance and feral with no optimization either way.
---
Warlock will be underpopulated by comparison and you'll be more of a unique snowflake.
---
Choose Warlock.
---
you are suggesting not taking Spirit Tap until level 15. Vanilla regen is not that high.
---
I remember drinking a lot before level 10.
---
Witcher 3 is orders of magnitude more demanding than classic wow.
---
u didnt even do lasher farming?
---
Numbers well into MoP were made public and can still be found. And yes, there is a decline starting with Cata.
---
Sharding starting zones (1-12) is fine. After that I would like to have to compete. 
---
Using the 1.12 client. Not the classic client, which is actually legion adapted to read the old db format 
---
I don't think you can track minerals and herbs at the same time in vanilla, so it might be easier to do Mining/Skinning or Herb/Skinning.
---
Wow. I always thought that Each 5 man group would have to complete BRD separately. This looks awesome.
---
You can’t fish, open your map, or use stratholme holy waters while in Shadowform. Keep that in mind.

 They weren't blood thirsty orcs. They were an entire race that were mislead by one of the most powerful demons, and looking for a new home after the demon's plans decimated their planet's elements/ecosystems. This doesn't excuse them for their actions, but painting them as mindless creatures looking for blood is crazy. Also the current Horde is not similar to the old Horde. The current Horde is made up of freed slaves (current Orcs), nomadic peaceful nature lovers (Tauren), psychologically damaged minds trying to find their place in this world after being ripped out of the afterlife (Forsaken),and an indigenous tribal group that historically has only dealt with its own affairs (Trolls). I guess if someone were to cherry pick the histories of what they saw in the horde they could be bloodthirsty villains, but the same can be said about a lot of the alliance's history. 
---
IIRC, you only needed frost for saph, which required killing all 4 wings. I never got that far, though. Is there anything I’m missing?
---
I would quit my job and play.I would rather them let us know when it will drop so I can get all my shit prepared.
---
but also its a common thing on pservers to buy gold
---
I know top raiders in some of them bought thousands so they always had bis boes and all consumables etc basically raidlogging
---
I like leveling a balance druid as an iron man challenge.
---
&gt;A wand will make up a large chunk of priest dps, so try get decent ones.
---
Thanks! That much I have seen on various forums posts and guides, I've even been doing some research on the Classic DB to see which ones we can get that are bis or close to it while we level. 
---
That said, since we'll be leveling w/ both quests (where she'll be damaging) and dungeons (where she'll be healing), what abilities should she NOT be buying? I'm assuming that she's going to want all the heals (even max ranked once, despite down ranking), shadow word pain at max rank and Mindflay (does that come w/ ranks as well?), so, should we just focus on those and ignore the rest? 
---
No. It doesn't. You can have original AV and people will still rush to the end. It is and always was the players that dictated the AV meta, not some patches by blizzard.
---
That's ok! You don't have to see it. There's plenty of people who are going to be watching that "World First Classic MC Progression" thing on twitch while they play.
---
I would be pissed off as I don’t have a new pc yet 😂
---
Think of AQ20 as ZG but with more mechanics and less CC involved.
---
For pve racials are kinda meh for either, you are rarely low enough to get value out of berserk and you aren't often chain casting even if you did, wotf is also pretty situational in pve but much more useful as a healing spec in pvp, shadow is sort of a tossup, dp and wotf vs shadowguard and hex of weakness
---
&gt; Server I'm playing on hasn't even opened AQ yet and we've got 60+ black lotus farmed up in preparation for Naxx.
---
I remember my old gm farmed about 300 and that was during mc/bwl phase much earlier XD never shared anything it was prepared for later raids but the guild disbanded by then
---
Give him a beast of burden to help carry his merchandise. 
---
I remember always seeing the human warrior Danny in IF.  I think he was MT of Ruined and/or Renaissance on Proudmoore. He was always decked out in the absolute best gear. I’m pretty sure I inspected him in awe every time I was in IF. 
---
I can picture a few more r13+ toons I would always see, but I’m struggling to remember their names.
---
the most people will never see naxx because skill and gold required.
---
its funny when people think naxx is easy 😂 this shows me there have no clue.
---
Don't repair gear unless it's completely broken. You might upgrade it before then, so repairing would be a waste.
---
Don't buy any skills except the ones you actually need for leveling.
---
Don't buy gear. If the mobs are too hard, then move to an easier area, or seek out quests or dungeons that have useful gear rewards. In certain specific situations, it's okay to buy wands or other weapons when no rewards are available.
---
I don't think you're a VI 
---
Yeah after a certain point you dont want to leave your guild for whatever reason, but maybe your raid day changed for the guild  or you missed out on a night for a reason, youd hit up the other guild you run with  to make up for it and it is much less "pug-ish" if you run with people you semi know.
---
&gt; I mean, they're just a sub-par DPS like most of the hybrids, 
---
To be completely fair, balance druids are probably the most sub-par DPS of the hybrids. 
---
eh at least the flask doesnt get removed
---
melees have to redo everything after a wipe
---
I would be more likely to play Hunter on pserver because I am not really invested in it as much as classic, never know when it's gonna go down etc
---
ah yeah, that's the one, good times back then when pvp scene was actually pretty huge - nobody believes me if I say it was these days.
---
Reflex the rogue on Dragonmaw (US) he was a tyrant 
---
Yep. Only time I needed to flask as priest was progress on patchwerk. Still used any other pots elixirs I had on me.
---
&gt;I'm assuming that she's going to want all the heals (even max ranked once, despite down ranking), shadow word pain at max rank and Mindflay (does that come w/ ranks as well?), so, should we just focus on those and ignore the rest?
---
Ya, that will probably work fine. She can probably safely even skip a couple ranks of heals as you get close to 40. Mana is usually the limiting factor in healing not throughput. 
---
did melee dps need resist gear?
---
Ideally you can make an alt the enchanter to avoid dropping skinning, but re-leveling skinning isn't much of an issue.
---
Nope, real vanilla. The numbers work pretty well and there are only a couple encounters where bears have real problems. Warriors outclass them going into T3 content because their gear is so good but until then bears have a ton of upside.
---
If you're a Mage, then you have to suffer by losing fights against what you could have been.  :(
---
Warlock is the superior choice.
---
Dots are more fun. Mage has no dots. Choose lock, also healthstones are neat.
---
I may as well be dead as long as classic isn't out 
---
zzz
---
You mean what if an entire system of processors can't run the game and their response is, "We know about this issue."? Yeah. I can see the issue being a big one if that happens.
---
Lovely FPS
---
Siege of Orgimmar
---
His video is very misleading, as he points out the Cost on his server is horribly inflated. 400g in mats is like 400g. Anyone can do that regularly
---
I'll still never forget the Night Elf Hunter Grand Marshal Shattuk. From Magtheridon he was my nemesis we spent hours each week killing each other in silithius.
---
They would have to decrease the range you get HKs at do disincentivise ganking for honor.
---
Currently a 60 would be encouraged to roflstomp a ton of lvl +43s as they would still be green and grand honor and HKs. Because of the hit tables the lvl 40s would have terrible miss/resists.
---
Alternatly they could remove the penalties for level differences so 3-5 people could gang up on the 60 and have a decent chance to fight them off.
---
Weren't their words "This is to let as many people as possible experience it without technical issues such as server capacity...Realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic)"
---
That sounds a lot like it has to do with server load.
---
To be honest, if we're getting into abstract ideas like this, you'd probably still have more firepower with just 5 ele shamans. However, 5 balance druids would be hilarious, they'd be completely untouchable and could kite whole groups of people infinitely.
---
Plus, I would imagine that you probably have almost no spirit on gear at lvl 1-15.
---
The choices!!!!! Do I want lock cookies or to share food/water with the world? ;)
---
Nef is my favorite boss.
---
But overall raid, I say zul'gurub.
---
I just like the bosses overall and the atmosphere.
---
Exactly. i think the best metric for that is the split to see how many had played on private servers. The people that have overall are usually way more interested. But overall i think its a smaller number than the grand total of people who will end up playing Classic in the long term. How much smaller i cant say.
---
TM v. SS was great once and a while. If they removed the handicap level differences make in pvp it could be a lot of fun having 10 lvl 30s stomp a 60.
---
Yep I am with you on this, my rules would be for instances imp, for open world void, for BG's then you are worrying about situational pets.
---
Nothing personal, but since you presented yourself as a game designer/developer, I would be remiss to point out that your proposal is one of the worst I've heard.
---
For starters...raise the cap to 70. That's already a terrible idea and one of the biggest issues with TBC -- that it obsoleted all of Azeroth as everyone moved to Outland. But since you're not adding Outland, where are you going to put all of the level 60-70 zones with 100+ hours of content? Where are the level 70 raids? Why would anyone even do any of the level 60 content now?
---
Nope, and I do t even know what that is.  Healing was never really a problem with our guild and we had a full roster of intelligent people which gave everyone some leeway.
---
&gt; Or more commited players may get frustrated by the speed over progress and jump to a 'better' guild 
---
Guilds will try to steal tanks from other guilds to do 4h
---
and losing a good tank can kill a guild
---
Good ol days when you knew guilds/people on the server! Good Ole Horde Thunderlord! 
---
ah, it's not the real thing though. wish we had the nitro boots from wotlk
---
A big niche? 
---
The amount of consumables required for this raid is insane we are about to start it on the private server i play on and good lord i need 100 greater frost protection potions.
---
Honestly I got super hyped during the announcement, realised it was probably years away, forgot about it and carried on with my life until about a week ago when it suddenly hit me that its somewhat *close*. Since then it's been on my mind a lot, I'm swapping which class i want to play in my head constantly and I find myself on this subreddit an awful lot. I figure it will probably be hype for me from now until release, and 3 months ish of anticipation isn't all that bad considering how much of a vanilla/BC/Wrath fanboy I am and all I've wanted since Cata is those days back.
---
Doesn't spirit scale non-linearly, and having more adds more? (i.e. going from 200 to 205 is more value than 20 to 25)
---
Or is that not for mana-regen, for something else?
---
They're fine healing when there's another pally or priest in the party. If the druid is your only source of res then it's a pain anytime someone dies.
---
Hi, /u/Jakeca
---
We raidet naxxramas with a boomkin.
---
But we are talking about a player with the best boomkin gear available in aq40.
---
He was the mvp of the mage group.
---
I think for him it was not a class but a lifestyle. He never played anything else in the next two expansions, than this damn boomkin.
---
The only thing that keeps me away from rolling a hunter is the nuisance to compete against other hunters to tame some of the rare pets like Broken Tooth or Lupos.
---
Blizzard actually said the time required for 60-70 would be roughly equivalent to 1-60. Did someone actually do it in 28 hours? That’s probably less time than required for 50-60. 
---
Oomkins are great. Awesome damage! Can hold their on meters! They only have one problem: Being called Oomkin for a reason.
---
They are no good if they can't keep up with the other DPS by going OOM 1 minute into the fight. I have no actual data, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are competing for the top spots during their uptime. At least hurricane is extremely powerful as an AoE, but that itself is an 1-min(?) CD which really is not good. They need their own innervate &amp; can't stay up with mana potions. And to top it off, they only cast a single spell for their entire WoW career.
---
They are just gimped for PvE, sadly.
---
The comments in that thread are awesome. Really a testament to the time.  
---
I still have my characters in my old raiding guild on my server and every now and then (when I'm not CRZ/sharded off my own server) I get people to stop and blow up my whispers with "#~!@$@# is that THE "guild" from Vanilla/TBC?!!."
---
Hi, /u/qUxUp
---
Your guild had "Group Leaders" damn...that's organized
---
Oh yeah, boomkin is an interesting pvp spec, the ranged firepower of a mage + plate armor is a great combo, but this thread was going up to somebody claiming the aura as a raid advantage, which it's just not.
---
20% of players immediately look to the least-played race/class combo and decides that's the perfect combo for them.
---
They said the demo rates were absurdly high and have fixed them per a post a few weeks ago
---
I started on a private server in November, had multiple people message me after seeing my name in world chat or passing me in Ironforge
---
Melee pretty much requires a titans to survive in progression and chromatic resistance can be helpful for saph/kt. They also definitely don't get off easy, melee probably have the most consumables to pop for an attempt behind tanks. 
---
Hunters get off easy. No relevant flasks for most content, and you just pop a mongoose once an hour (feign death means you'll almost never lose it early)
---
Its been.. Very long, but if I recall correctly, yiu need to have enchanting to disenchant the BoP items you acquire.
---
&gt; Before even heading to Naxxramas, people met at the Yojambe Isle to receive the ZG world buff, which requires turning in Heart of Hakkar, which in turn requires you to raid ZG and kill Hakkar in order to get the buff.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Then people go to Orgrimmar to get the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer world buff, which in turn requires Head of Onyxia or Head of Nefarian. Either of those requires killing Onyxia first or Nefarian from BWL.
---
its a stupid point
---
a guild that wants to do Naxx probably cleared aq40 or most of it and is thus well geared
---
that guild should then easily do zg/bwl ( probably altruns)
---
&gt;You're not ready yet. Before going to Naxxramas, you should have at least one Warlock at level 20 with full bags of Soul Shards in order to provide yourself Soulstone, Healthstone and to summon members.
---
1 guy farming 50 shards ( mobs) isnt that big of a deal

Hunter loot.

And casuals are gonna keep being super toxic about it

Drool harder, senpai. 
---
&gt; ose proposed changes. If 75% or more of players approve, then the change can go through, but otherwise, the change does not go through. This is a good way to safeguard. Even without this, I think Blizzard could approach new vanilla content with the goal stated above, to expand but not innovate. But to add on this kind of vote system would be an extra safeguard in case they come up with an idea which the community feels is too big a change. We co

New raids that add Off-spec Tier Sets would be sweet.

I originally rolled on Archimonde with The Regulators and several guilds from the Bloodfin SWG server.  Tried to make my character with the same name as my SWG character and found an enemy from SWG had taken the name.
---
We ended up leaving Archimonde for Laughing Skull due to the server problems.
---
Always wondered what happened to those from Bloodfin that stayed behind
---
I'm a vanilla noob, what's that addon that tracks your buffs duration on the right side of this screenshot under damage meter addon?
---
&gt; only the top hardcore guilds will raid Naxx. Like 10% of the guilds.
---
&gt; The rest...will be in BWL and some AQ40 bosses.For ever.
---
myep it sucks
---
&gt; because or World buffs CD, you can't just go back and get the W buffs after a wipe, like on private servers.
---
yes only the ZG one is kept through wipe. Some people may even get ganked on route to naxx and lose buffs :))
---
They removed the requirement to "buy" wow a few expansions ago. A subscription will get you access to everything up to legion in retail and wow classic when it comes out.
---
Yes, a French player did it. 
---
This but without the surprise/depression/regret.
---
1. Skinning and Herbalism/Mining - Vendor the skins and AH the herbs/ore
---
2. First Aid - Even if you don't use the bandages, that's free monies if you vendor them as they're worth more than the raw cloth.
---
3. DO NOT BUY FROM THE AH - the only caveat to this is if you're good at playing the AH and use it to make money. Buy low, sell high kind of thing. I'm terrible at this so I avoid it. BUT Don't buy your gear from there - just level with quest rewards and item drops from mobs/bosses.
---
4. Be a Warlock or Paladin - just for shits and giggles ;)
---
5. Don't buy all skills - there are plenty of skills you can avoid buying as they are money sucks at earlier levels.   
---
I see you used the original Khadgar model for the statue. Take all of my upvote.
---
Lol nothing to be toxic about. Classic was beaten 14 years ago there's no reason to rush through it
---
1 frame to check health, 1 to check mana and 0,5 to make a screenshot.
---
You don't seem to be aware of all the zones in Azeroth we didn't have access to during Vanilla. I'd start with those. 
---
Boomkins are 100% arcane damage. CoS is necessary because it helps both Arcane &amp; Shadow damage.
---
The only time a Boomkin might want to do Nature damage in raids is on trash that dies faster, since Wrath has a lower cast time than Starfire. Or if the raid is melting bosses, where a couple wraths at the end might do damage where the boss would already be dead while starfire is still mid-cast.
---
Yeah you will have to drink in vanilla. 
---
They don't oom any faster than the other casters, really.
---
I like the idea of adding content to Vanilla wow once the phases are over however I think a lot of people will be against that idea. It's sort of why we're in this position right now, however if you're using any model in this situation I guess the one to follow would be OSRS.
---
Personally I think the best thing for Blizzard to do once Classic has been out for a couple of years and the phases are complete is to just fork off "classic" into the typical BC expansion (as you mentioned in scenario 3), either give the players a decision where they can move their character to the legacy servers or just let them copy over their characters to these BC servers.
---
I mainly think this because BC was my favorite expansion, I think Blizzard did a superb job with it and pretty much everyone I talk to holds BC at a similar (and in some cases higher) regard than vanilla. Of course, there is always the case you could do both, but I feel if you take that route there's just too much going on, BC servers, Vanilla servers with new content, bfa + content currently ongoing, you risk splitting up further what already might be small communities, and let's not forget that's what the majority of us miss. (the community).
---
If I had it my way Phase 7 would be the release of BC and that would be the end of Vanilla once again, but obviously you recognize pretty quickly that there's a problem here, this will continue and continue until we're back where we started, begging for classic again. A bit of a paradox, which I guess is why the forking off with character cloning makes the most sense, but this could leave to dead Vanilla servers.
---
If someone is arrogant enough to say something like that, or a location IRL etc without specifying, you can guarantee it's an American.
---
The new content was also essential to OSRS being more popular.  I remember around a year or two after it launched it stagnated hard because everyone was super bored.  Maxing in RuneScape also takes exponentially longer than it does in wow so once Naxx is out the devs really need to consider what they're gonna do next.   Even if they don't add content for a while after Naxx, if we know something good is coming people will still be subbed. 
---
God, that is the age old question for us caster types eh? My first character was a warlock I leveled to 39 and second was a mage I leveled to 60.
---
Overall, I found warlock to be a bit more fun. The class quests are amazing, it’s fun to have a little demon buddy, the felsteeds are awesome. 
---
With that said, if you want the best raw numbers, go mage. 
---
r13 set is very good for Warlocks (for PvP). Most classes begin to replace the r13 items in AQ and then completely (or almost completely) replace them in Naxx
---
Wether or not you need to respec for raids really just depends on how hardcore your guild is. I think most guilds that are clearing all content will expect their raiders to be an optimal DPS spec but there will definitely be more casual guilds that don’t care if PvP players show up to raids with a suboptimal spec
---
I don’t play Warlock but I’m pretty sure SM Ruin does good DPS while also being viable in PvP. Someone with experience playing a Lock might correct me on that. Shamans definitely should respec to deep Resto for PvE.
---
If your raid can beat cthun, the spider wing in naxxramas should be no issue.
---
The problem for us was the tbc announcement, our raid went boom after that. 
---
I'm going to raid semi progress and expect to get pretty deep into naxx. 
---
Maybe not kelthuzad, but we will see.
---
But I can tell you without a doubt, don't bother without consumables. You don't need an insane schedule, but you sure need to be buffed. 
---
Some bosses take forever, other bosses are a dps races. You need those sweet manapots.
---
Private servers feel very off on bosses like Anub. 
---
We can get a rolling pin, but never the bread.
---
Once you know the rule, then you can learn the exceptions.
---
Weapons for melee is one of them.
---
Yeah you definitely need PvE items to make Eleresto spec work
---
Shadow priest for the worst of both worlds 
---
i dont know all the names anymore, but i remember a lot of cool situatiuons and encounters with other players in classic. cant even remember my regural mythic groups names
---
Yes I know that's why I said they should emulate their success rather than try to reinvent the game every xpac, osrs is constantly adding new content but they keep it in the spirit of osrs, and they listen to the community, so heres to hoping we get similar treatment
---
&gt; New raids that add Off-spec Tier Sets would be sweet. 
---
Now that is a great idea.
---
Is destruction  even viable in classic or is it mostly afflicition?
---
If you have to ask, warlock isn't for you.
---
I'm a 29yo EU-(rp-)PvP brit bro with enough vanilla experience. I'm looking for an alliance guild of focused peeps who want to progress steadily and enjoy all vanilla has to offer with a real community emphasis.
---
Not interested in loosey goosey guilds who accommodate noobs in order to give them a place to fit in OR guilds who are so focused on progression that they're willing to go through undue stress to attain it. I want to be with high skill level players who don't lose their shit when things go wrong.
---
Will play mage and am happy to raid 2 or 3 nights a week. If I sound like a good fit for your guild hit me up with a pm.
---
Don't level enchanting.
---
Don't ignore professions (dual gathering will be a return on investment).
---
Don't pay attention to the price per item, but the price per slot.  If you have one item that is worth 2s, and another item that stacks to 10, and each is worth 90c, then the stacking item is better to keep.
---
I quit WoW shortly after AQ, this was to focus on University.  My guild pretty much stalled progress in AQ (vague memories of getting to Huhuran)
---
I started raiding on a private server in December, AQ opened in February.  My "semi hardcore" guild got to Cthun but didn't have enough regular raiders to consistently get 40 people for Cthun attempts.  Semi-hardcore required world buffs, consumes and flasks.
---
That guild disbanded after 4 weeks of AQ, I joined a guild that had already downed Cthun and had stopped requiring flasks.  Most guilds on the server have downed Cthun now.
---
I don't think Naxx will be too hard but the expectations are to have enough protection pots, flasks and consumables to last until everything is cleared.
---
Elkano's buffbars I think.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
People would probably just hold on to all of them and dump them on the ZG patch
---
Thanks so much!
---
Thank you :)
---
Some speed levelers suggest leveling with a single weapon type to keep from having to train weapon skills. This is easy with a Hunter, because they only have 3 weapon types. But, how realistic is it to level a warrior using only 2handed axes from 20-60? Also, was are some good quest rewards for 2h axes?
---
I miss Elitistjerks so much. Thanks for reminding me.
---
Yeah because of course we gotta wait for the project lead to get on his Reddit account and personally answer this. 
---
Because that’s the only way you would come close to getting an answer. Until then the best answer is not to worry about it. Be here where we are discussing classic wow.
---
"You're a priest, you have to heal!" for bonus suffering.
---
most pvt server raid guilds have 2 assigned raid nights lasting 4 hours each.
---
Check out “Frostrodamus rags to riches leatherworking” he’s got a youtube video that touches on a couple things that you can do that with. It’s in the same video as an enchanting thing with wands.  
---
No more clog dancing, sadly.
---
won't be possible in classic
---
We had Class/Role Leads. Without delegation 40 mans are a nightmare. 
---
Hi folks, is there any spanish speaking guild? in NA?
---
Its funny, those things that some posters are worried about getting in their way of WoW (like..... their lives), are the things that will keep me from ever playing the game toooooooo much. I just bought Sekiro on Friday and only ended up playing it for about an hour on friday night and then about 3 or 4 hours last night.
---
My wife spent the entire weekend beating Kingdom Hearts 3, I took my father in law on a tour of the house we're building, and I did a bunch of other random stuff (including eating at IHOP). As much as I have a burning desire to play Sekiro (its suuper fun) I don't even mind that I didn't play much this weekend.
---
If anything, WoW is even BETTER because its happening in a great time in my life. I want to min-max and be the toughest warrior tank in my server..... but I also feel no compulsion to rush to 60 and burn through the game.
---
It feels so good to be free of that whole "shit I gotta rush to the level cap to raid and just ignore the entire game" plague that has gripped the game since post TBC. Now I just want to enjoy it. Period.
---
To keep it in Lore:
---
FWP is a work in progress, so the paths are still in place as they continue to develop. At Thunder Bluff, they demolished the temporary access paths after completing construction for security purposes.
---
For a more practical explanation - they were probably unwilling to make a Horde safe-haven where the Alliance's sole approach is to take the elevator. Not that the walk up the path is any safer, but that would be my guess.
---
PCs and connections were fine? I believe a lot of people were still on dial up around that time. 
---
I had a lot of people in our guild too that would just crash randomly lol. 
---
I think there are a lot of bad people out there that wont clear naxx still, but it will be 100x easier to clear Naxx in todays classic world than it was back then just because of the information and technology in todays world.
---
If they release content after classic it better be TBC.  Everything you say about the changes you'd make are "the way TBC did it" except #6.  Everything you say about keeping the spirit of Vanilla I disagree with, except for #5.
---
So guilty of this. I once literally spent 3 days in front of the character creation screen unable to decide. I always sat down thinking IDC im gonna create a toon and literally stood up after a few hours not playing a minute just creating and deleting characters. 
---
Mind flay, Psychic scream, PW:S, SW:P. That’s basically the Shadow priest’s entire rotation for leveling. You also want a few heals, but you should both train first aid because Shadow form costs quite a bit of mana. You also want Fort. And a few heals for dungeons, mostly greater heal and renew. Inner Fire is also good for tankiness. In a perfect world, the priest would tank for the Rogue. 
---
Care to expand a bit ? Harder but more loot because the mobs are higher lvl ?
---
&gt; need 100’s of gold worth of consumables to raid
---
who said you need hundreds a raid for BWL?
---
for naxx yes yes you do
---
I worry that there are many who think that current private servers = exactly how vanilla was, which is false.  Now things like BiS items and talents (though most will likely be accurate) are 100% going to change when classic launches, because they have the source code.  The creators of current Private servers have done great work, but by their own admission, a lot of programming and math in the game is guess work, since they don't have the source code.  Some examples that the Esylum guys have mentioned is they don't know how much armor bosses had, or how specific talent procs worked.  Though it may seem small, these have huge differences, even between different private servers.  
---
So prepare, or not, the truth is either way all of us WILL be learning together. 
---
I think it’s a meme from pservers to be honest. They’ve artificially made bosses hp higher, and buffed boss damage (especially in Naxx) as they didn’t want to underestimate. 
---
&gt; when you sum up and divide your joined dps it might show to be worth having a boomkin.
---
It's not worth it. Miles off being worth it actually, because the value of a mage or warlock (depending on where you are on progression) is so absurdly skewed. 
---
I try my name with so many titles and roleplaying ranks. Like if im a paladin it should sound good eith “Vindicar” etc. Also yeah, the nicknames, shortenings... naming a character is so friggin hard.
---
Yeah, SL Warlocks are borderline impossible to kill as a Mage because you do 0 damage and they resist half your spells. Most good Warlocks play Destro specs because they have way more burst potential and a higher skill ceiling, and Warlocks using this spec can be outplayed as a Mage it’s just a bit of an uphill battle.
---
I was on the fence as to whether or not to mention Warlocks as a soft counter to Mages and I decided it would be a bit of a stretch. Also tbh I main a Mage and was very focused on not being biased in my evaluation of the Mage class
---
Different strokes for different folks. If gets them excited about the game more power to em. I have less free time than I did as a kid. Just looking forward to slowly leveling my way through the game again 
---
I'm on the same boat, which kills me because its really making me think I'm not going to be able to enjoy it as much as I did when I had time to spare. 
---
for bwl all my warlock used was 2 elixirs and food.. sometimes a flask on progression. I dont even remember farming runes.
---
you dont wanna know XD
---
Since there were very little limit.
---
and raids lastet very long.
---
20-40 Foods
---
60-120 Different Elixiers
---
20 Flasks
---
40-60 Different non Crafting consumables. Like Some Beer and Scrolls
---
One area where alliance locks can have a difficult time is pvp. One of the most dominate races on horde is undead and "Will of the Forsaken" can make it very difficult to get fears off on people.
---
Lol the struggle was real 
---
Why do you disagree with what I think would keep the spirit of Vanilla?
---
Strongly dispute. They got a talent review in 1.11 or 1.12 that made them stronger and helped them scale better to not get passed up as fast or as hard by warriors. 
---
They are a top 3 dps class for the entire game, except for late content in AQ40 and Naxx where they can be where Warlocks finally turn on in their scaling. Then it's top 4. And they'll bounce around within that four depending on the fight. 
---
They are not weak at all and if you polled people on the weakest class in vanilla, Rogue will not get many responses. No class is particularly weak because A. Blizzard would balance super obvious deficiencies and B. because what even is the definition of "weak" or "strong?"
---
Rogues are one of the best PvP classes in the game and they are a perennial dpser for all of classic content. And they level faster than any of their melee counterparts except for feral druids. 
---
Wand Spec, for sure. Even if you don't regen, you don't need to even cast as many spells once your wand damage is beefed up. You can add things to your rotation later once Spirit Tap comes online.
---
I know it sounds wrong but idk a different word
---
This weekend I joined the Light Hope pserver. I've never played on a pserver and I really stopped playing WoW shortly after TBC so I missed all of the modern retail stuff. I was really surprised at the authentic feel of Teldrassil, it's really identical to what I remember. To scratch that Classic "itch" try doing a timed 0-12 just for fun. You can get all the nostalgia feels while solidifying some strategies for quickly getting out of the lowbie area when Classic hits. Here's my time spent at each level if you want to compare for fun :)
---
**1:** 3:48, **2:** 6:50, **3:** 10:13, **4:** 16:12, **5:** 18:03, **6:** 20:50, **7:** 28:55, **8:** 47:58, **9:** 1:12:48 (9-10 was mostly spent failing to do Relics of Wakening solo), **10:** 54:15, **11:** 43:03, **12:** 46:58
---
I also died 9 times unintentionally, mostly doing Relics lol.
---
Let me re-phrase:  those would be very Vanilla-like.  I disagree that those are good design elements, as a lot of those changes are things I liked about TBC.
---
Better is subjective. 
---
NA | PvE / PvP | Alliance | Fri[/S](https://www.reddit.com/u/Th)at/Su Pref Raid days, 5\~10ish Central time (6-11 Eastern).
---
I plan on going Holy or Disc for raiding. I like leveling and pvp as well and plan to have lots of alts (But not for raiding).
---
I am looking for a group of people for initial quick leveling. I want to group up with a few people to get out of the starting zones quickly.  I am debating on if I want to go with my main for launch or a NE hunter for a smoother launch.
---
Today the gaming industry is way more developed and streamlined. That means more products and that increases amount of garbage. There are great games every year. If not from big publishers/devs studios will always deliver something original created from passion. Just like Blizzard did ages ago.
---
ICC. 
---
for 1 month of raids maybe lol
---
Yeah, I feel like trying to raid MC, having designated class / role leaders to whip people into shape was more or less mandatory. Way, way more difficult for a raid leader to keep tabs on 40 people as opposed to the modern 20. Plus, since classes actually had some flavor and brought something UNIQUE, it required some in-class organization to most effectively spread your buffs / place your totems etc.
---
I just don't know how I feel about healing in raids. I resto sham healed in wotlk for a bit and it just wasn't my cup of tea, I've traditionally played caster dps. Maybe I'll enjoy the challenge this time around
---
Can’t wait for these - I at first wanted to straight level to 60 but I think I’ll do it like last time. Stop and PvP until I get every other bracket rewards, they were decent for some classes, mostly melee if I remember 
---
Dark iron ore and blood of the mountain in brd
---
Memba red alert 2? 
---
That's not how bfa's spellbook works.. you have 1 tab for your spec regardless of spell classification.. also as a shadow priest they don't even give you any holy spells.. your heal is a shadow spell.
---
in classic, you have 4 tabs in your spell book.. general.. then 1 for each category of spells (based off the 3 talent trees).  for priest, this is holy, disc, and shadow.. So you would be able to use spells from the discipline tab of the spell book while in shadow form.  Mainly, PW:S and Inner focus.. Discipline is mainly buffs though overall.  I don't have a link to what each tab contains right now but from memory it's spells like: shield, inner focus (talent), inner fire, etc.   The sorting of abilities seems to be broken on the wowhead page.
---
This doesn't have to do with school though.  you can see the school for counter-spell purposes here:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/priest#spells:50-2+9+1](https://classic.wowhead.com/priest#spells:50-2+9+1)   priests only have shadow and holy spell schools for this purpose, (and arcane if you're a night elf priest)
---
And abilities were not homogenized. Hunters had to do X. Mages had to do Y. Warlocks just had to look cool. Ya know, different roles. 
---
I'm just working on my massive prep list.  
---
I'll probably burn out just before launch and ruin everything.  
---
Hunter is the one class I can definitively say doesn’t need engineering to PvE or PvP effectively while leveling. I’d say go for the money and raise engineering at 60. 
---
It's a tough battle right? I've tried playing other stuff, but all I think about is going back to playing vanilla.
---
you go to diremaul east and solo the lasher packs ( normal mobs like lv 54 or so) spamming holynova looting greys and some other items
---
sometimes find a herb or a book
---
supposed to be worth like 50-100g/h depending on luck but the base 50ish is vendor money
---
I am aware how you got them. And none of it required raiding. Which was the point of the gear. It was a "gimme" to people who weren't raiding.
---
Lots of personal and guild preparation as an Officer. No other games interest me at the moment.
---
I'm barely coping.
---
I think now that investors are so heavily involved in the game making process - contributing to short deadlines and in game pay structures, games have declined in quality. Solid games are far more rare now, but also replay some of your old games, I have some nostalgia behind games like 40k fire warrior, and playing it back made me realize what absolute garbage it was. 
---
did u need NR gear as for 40?
---
Sekiro right now. Haven't thought about Classic all weekend.
---
I've still got Games of Thrones, Avengers, Days Gone, Wu-Tang/Public Enemy/De La Soul, John Wick 3, Rage 2, Download Festival (Tool!), E3, Crash Team Racing remake and Toy Story 4 all before July. Assuming it comes no sooner...

&gt;"...that said, the first few weeks when everybody is packed into valley of trials, when everybody is packed into Elwyn, we think we can use sharding there in a **limited** time, **limited** way to solve the initial launch day load problems while making sure that in the long run as server communities solidify there's a healthy population in the world for everyone to live in."
---
I don't know, that seems pretty clear to me. 
---
Pepe is officially dead
---
That happened in 04-06?
---
Chances are you’ll be able to find a more casual guild that would let you raid as Elemental, but if you want to easily nab a spot in a top guild you’ll have to go Resto.
---
While it might seem like a pain to have to respec, one thing I will say is that as a PvPer it’s really nice to be in a great guild that clears everything super efficiently in 1-2 nights. In a more casual guild you’re likely to spend 4+ hours in BWL but the hardcore guilds can knock that shit out in &lt;1 hour and you can probably swap back to PvP spec after 1 night of raiding.
---
50g respec also isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. Most classes have some kind of dungeon farm that lets them come up with 50g in an hour or so.
---
What's it like having friend to play with? Lol
---
This is correct but people are calling you wrong for whatever reason.
---
When you go to the trainer (or look at your spellbook) spells are divided into Holy/Discipline/Shadow. You can’t use the abilities under the Holy tab, regardless of the school of magic that they technically fall into. Shield is a “holy” spell in that it uses the light, but it is a discipline spell.
---
You can alternate the points, it's what I did on my last priest.
---
If you want to fill one up first though, I'd probably recommend wand spec. The first 2 wands from enchanting are huge, and with the wand damage you do, you don't need to regen that much. Use Renew instead of PW:S, and the only other thing you cast is SW:P. Pull with Smite if you are really high on mana (happens all the time especially after you get Spirit Tap - but throwing an extra Smite now and then is less valuable than 25% wand damage)
---
Can you message me the name? I'd be interested in this, but seems like naming pservers on this sub isn't allowed.
---
Same as you. Doing quests, dungeons, and profs. to refresh myself. 
---
Also trying different talent builds to see which I find fun, or useless.
---
It was my understanding that during classic UBRS could be done with 40 people as well. Am I mistaken? 
---
I mean, you're saying "15 years ago" but the including games from all different time periods.  Heroes of Might and Magic 3 (one of my all-time favorite games) for example was 1999, and the "Complete" edition containing both xpacs was 2000.  Not sure that's a really fair comparison lol
---
Well, I'm in a guild of completely new people that I never played with before! Don't let anything stop you from reaching out and finding a guild to call home!
---
I'm building my new PC on Saturday, then I'm going to download Fallout games with mods and play those for awhile.  
---
Oh, rip. I’m getting confused with a whole bunch of things today.
---
I can tell you from an outside perspective the worst part is getting all 40 players to be equally skilled and react quickly to mechanics.
---
I've played more challenging games mechanically like dota 1-2, starcraft 2, and tons of shooters that all require 2 weeks of muscle memory to feel "settled in". In wow for most DPS classes you could sit a new player down, clear your bars except for needed abilities and within 2 or 3 fights an intelligent person shouldn't have any questions left. This is a video game afterall.
---
Work you're way up from fallout 1?
---
wow had many iterations over the years, things get a bit fuzzy :)
---
Was this representative of your typical FPS during 40 man raids?
---
Limited just means it won’t be permanent in a way retail has it, they have nowhere confirmed that starting zones is the only place where they’ll end up using it. 
---
Dude I was thinking about doin the same thing lol
---
Gathering professions help, but some people are just good at making gold. I usually have like 300+ by the time I hit 40. Although I don't quest much I usually grind which probably helps.
---
Both classes have great utility but the warlock abilities tend to be more favorable for group play which makes getting into dungeons easier. There will always be a few of each in raids so at that point you're competing to be the best of your own class.
---
Both classes can solo level but I would give the edge to mages because they tend to be more mana efficient (at least as frost) and you can make your own drink/water. Also, you have teleports to major cities. Warlocks have their own self-sufficient talents but getting a free mount at 40 gives you a head start on saving money for the 60 mount and will cut travel time as many people still don't have enough gold to buy a mount and skill at 40.
---
Stranger Things is just one casual WoW Classic session long though (9-12h).
---
If you are going for the warlock aesthetic, both Orcs and Undead just feel like SUCH better vessels for demonic energy than human or gnome. 
---
I actually just did some levelling with a gnome warlock and thought it was pretty cool, but that miniature character eventually started grating on me. UD warlocks 4 lyfe.
---
Back in 2005 I usually hovered around 10-12 in 40 man raids, I played on the family computer but i think a lot of people did back then.
---
I wonder what was the real reason they removed all of these.
---
I'd expect more Mages than Warlocks regardless of faction, but you're right that it'll probably be a more noticeable difference as alliance.
---
Was that the vid from the server were Conc was scaling with attack power?
---
Well starting in TBC Boomkin was legit.
---
Great info:)

PvP balance specs usually don't take moonkin form.

asking a question practically can frame the issue in a way as to make objective standards unless you are really being a philosophical hardass. Have games gotten cheaper, more abundant, more diverse in style and genre, better writers, more reliable to work, etc.
---
When you ask a question using a subjective term, but levy that term against mostly objective preferences of people, it can be a question of objectivity.
---
Obviously a mac user.
---
So, did you win the shoulders? 
---
Don't forget MOH:AA
---
Even 400g is on average 8 hours of farming for almost classes... per raid... so 16 hours a week of farming just for mats on top of your raid times prob 2+ nights = lots of farming. Think his point still stands.
---
5 Warriors ONLY ?!?
---
BLASPHEMY !
---
I am completely aware of those zones. Is there 100+ hours of leveling content in them?
---
Why will anyone do BWL, AQ or Naxx at level 60? These were all huge problems created by the level cap increase in TBC and your solution does not address them.
---
TLDR: Not really.
---
Detailed answer: You can bring a Moonkin for the 3% crit aura and he will be able to pull his weight. The hard part is finding someone dedicated enough to play a Moonkin. Overall, it's not a great spec for the person playing it. Raiding Moonkin has very different talents from a PvP Balance spec, so you still have to grind gold if you want to do both. You have to roll on cloth to compete in PvE, so a lot of the gear you're getting isn't very useful in PvP. (Druids *need* leather in PvP - although the rings/trinkets/weapons etc are much easier to get if you raid as Moonkin rather than Resto.) The big thing is that it's harder to find a slot in a group as a Moonkin than it is as a healer or tank. Druids are blessed with the ability to fill the two most essential roles - healing and tanking - and that makes it very easy to find groups. Moonkin sacrifices that ability for the novelty of playing Moonkin.
---
Overall, there's nothing wrong with it. If you get good gear you will be very well-known on your server as the geared Moonkin guy. If that sounds fun to you, then go for it.
---
Crysis is 2007 so, 12 years ago.
---
I am quite sure the wait is killing pretty much all of us.
---
Most commonly at level 60, you will see Runecloth bags which sell for about 3-6 gold each and are 14 slot bags.
---
Traveler's Backpacks are somewhat uncommon and are 16 slot bags that usually sell for 20+ gold each. There are a few other 16 slot bags that you can obtain either as random world drops, a boss in BRD or Mooncloth bags which are crafted by Tailors. One 16 slotter, the Demon Hide Sack is obtained through a quest in Swamp of Sorrows.
---
After that, you'll see Bottomless bags which are crafted by Tailors and are 18 slot bags and could sell for over 100-200+ gold each.
---
Other 18 slot bags are Onyxia hide backpack which is a bag from... well... Onyxia raid and is an 18 slot bag. Panther Hide Sack from Zul'Gurub raid. 
---
The only non-raid, non-crafted 18 slot bag is the Supply Bag which is obtained through reputation grinding with The Argent Dawn after the patch that releases additional Argent Dawn quest objectives &amp; reputation rewards
---
The food here is...weapons-grade.
---
Shhh ! 
---
Anyone remember Pavle(UD Shadow priest) from Laughing Skull (NA)? Always liked that guy.
---
More like /join WorldDefense
---
I’m pretty sure right when the honor system was launched you could see peoples’ ranks on the channel. I would join just to see the high rank people talk about raiding the horde wsg portals. 
---
&gt;Classic was beaten 14 years ago
---
Right, and that's why no one speed runs old games. Plus it's not like it's a multiplayer game where getting there early gives a competitive advantage. 
---
Casuals gonna keep being super toxic.
---
Objectively, the games are technically speaking, "better" now adays. Better graphics, higher fidelity, etc etc.  
---
However I think they were definitely more fun back then.  
---
To add a few to your list, Age of Empires, Halo, CoD (4, MW2 especially), etc..
---
The boomkin aura will increase the DPS of 4 casters in your group by like 2%. This means that by bringing the aura, a boomkin passively generates around 8% of the DPS of an average mage. Do you think that a boomkin can also actively generate the remaining 92%?
---
Warlocks had to endure the wrath of the raidlead if they did not banish properly!
---
No, Sadly I can't find it anymore but the Guy also managed to pull off with Fury-Warrior over 2K Dps and as a melee Hunter 1K dps
---
I mained a mage and feel the exact same way about ports.  I keep going back and forth on whether or not I want to main a mage or warlock once classic is released and the thing I keep coming back to is how much it's going to suck not having ports as a lock.  
---
IIRC from my warrior 14 years ago, the best trinket combo in the 40s is the Rune of Duty and Rune of Duty.
---
You can get your D1 and D2 sets by playing however you want and not being subject to the whims of raid loot hierarchies. You can also go for your PVP set, which has some really good items. 
---
But most raids will not permit you to bid on loot they think other classes should get unless nobody wants it.
---
Enhancement shamans are the very worst when it comes to DPS, and elemental shamans have problems throughout most of vanilla where a lot of raid content is highly resistant to nature damage (they become okay in Naxx, though). Shadow priests are really bad DPS as well and take up multiple debuff slots, the only reason to bring one is for the shadow damage debuff. As far as hybrid DPS goes, balance druid is actually decent. Just not good enough to have a concrete reason to bring one on a raid.
---
I know they do, but it's because having 9-10 people you know that are solid you tend to talk to them like a lot. In LFG or XR sure you might meet some cool people sometimes. Most of the groups in live don't say more than 1-2 words the entire instance. 
---
Everyone before this was a potentially new instance partner you'd play with for a long time and level with. If you had a really good group it wasn't uncommon to have the entire group add you. 
---
If you played before XR 2 years after its introduction I highly doubt the XR thing would still hold true. At this point it's been so long that naturally it's that way. 
---
I would not even have bothered with the game had my framerates been that low, hehe.
---
why do you care
---
In terms of difficulty, If your guild is able to clear Twin Emps, then you will be able to clear atleast 10 of the 15 bosses in Naxx as they range from pretty easy to somewhat challenging. The last 3-5 bosses in naxx range from quite challenging to very hard.
---
Nah, and Frost gear is pretty simple too.  All the main pieces you'll use for Sapphiron are either crafted or drop from bosses in Naxx.  
---
Avoid AH for the first 2 weeks.
---
Loot EVERYTHING.
---
Vendor EVERYTHING.
---
Have Skinning and vendor all the leather.
---
Have Mining/Herbalism (for after you hit 40 - next is epic mount, and ores/herbs will sell "ok" after the first 2 weeks).
---
Make sure you always have the largest bags you can afford.
---
Banking alt for ores/herbs (use it as a mail bank).
---
Select what skills to buy / upgrade.

I lover Warrior leveling, its the best RPG feeling ever. You are by far the worst Leveling class, but at 60 with a littel bit of Gear you are like 32523532% more Powerful than while leveling.
---
I couldn't tell you a single person from my mythic BfA raiding guild lol. I still remember 50+ people from Vanilla
---
I do remember how he did it.. He stacked the Paladin Debuff which made the DPS of the Paladin go insane. That's why.
---
I'm half tempted to do this. Normally I just go feral since it's fun and fast, but I really want to try the balance tree. Never properly used it.
---
I will be playin. Warlock . I have played warlock retail for a very long time like 7 years or something idk. Also I dislike playing overrepresented things so gnome warlock will be my go to.
---
I did really want Atiesh, but I doubt anyone will consider giving it to a warlock and not a mage. So I suffer in silence 
---
Damn and I thought playing with ~15FPS was bad for me back then :D
---
Yo you guys are also in Utah? Dope
---
Yeah, but he goes on to say "to solve initial launch day issues." He doesn't say, "and other areas of the game that may draw large traffic."
---
There is absolutely no evidence to support the idea they would use sharding anywhere but the initial zones. 
---
No. You want some classes for specific mechanics (ex: mages for spam decursing healers on last boss) but there's no need for NR gear. And the NR gear in AQ40 is only needed for the 15 melees that will soak hits on Huhuran anyways.
---
No.
---
It should be BoP up to ZG patch at least.
---
If not always.
---
The other casters don't oom though.  Warlocks have life tap, mages have evocation, mage armor, clearcasting, and mana gems.  It's the penalty of playing a healer: infinite mana trivializes the role.  One of the best parts of TBC talent trees was they gave hybrid classes DPS efficiency without trivializing resource management for healers.
---
My wife has played a paladin off and on since TBC and she wanted to play one in classic. So, we started playing on a..... non public server and both rolled paladins. I knew what was up because I leveled a pally to 60 back in the day. We made it to level 16 before she said "fuck this" and we made it to level..... 8 before she realized what was up.
---
She didn't REALLY believe me all the years of me telling her that you just auto attack. Now shes looking into Druid and rogue, haha.
---
**Don't buy anything from the AH**
---
There.  That's it.  Successfully employ this strategy and you shouldn't have much issue getting the necessary gold to afford your mount when you hit level 40.  
---
Not really, you just happen to be remembering the good ones.  There were plenty of games 15 years ago that flopped.
---
sekiro
---
that's it
---
Idunno man, that weapon skill boost on humans means you miss less which means more damage so in PvE it really helped.
---
PC culture
---
Not hardcore at all. Sooner or later every Guild with enough active Members will do it. 
---
Priests have three spell schools - shadow, discipline, and holy. All the heals were holy. PW:S and PW:Fortitude are the only two discipline spells that come to mind but I'd imagine something like Mind Vision probably fits in there too.
---
So you can use shield because it is a discipline spell, not holy.
---
Generally speaking, yes, much better.
---
Well don't lie, tryhard who are good also care, haha.
---
I'm min-maxing for the first time in classic so i'm pumped. My goal is to make the most un-killable Tauren Warrior ever.
---
So tanking raids you can do with 2-3 hours a day easy.  Raids should only take about 2-3 hours anyways and if you have 2-3 hours a day on off nights to play youll be able to get your dungeons in, and consumable farming in. 
---
Main tanking raids? probably not... MOST guilds, not all... Will already have their main tank assigned but there is PLENTY of room for off tanks.  
---
My guild has it set up where I will main tank all of progression and then after progression is done we will have the other warriors that want to tank a little bit, tank bosses. It will be a way to let everyone play what they want a little bit. 
---
I didn't get hooked into anything for like 2+ years. I got hooked on Dota 2 Auto Chess, and Apex Legends now though. I'm so glad to have something to tide me over till Classic. I was really planning on it being WC3 Reforged, but now it seems like that'll be coming out *after* Classic, which seems pointless to me!
---
Enhancement shaman though.
---
Longarms was a hunter who made High Marshal every week on alliance. Apparently he was some kind of retired vet who had all the time in the world to play. Everyone hated him because nobody was ever able to gain Rank 14 weapons for months on end.
---
Ignite would like to have a word with you. 
---
I think the hard part is most guilds already have their main tanks assigned. Youll have to get in good with a guild that is leveling up and prove yourself to them, or create your own. 
---
Mark of the Chosen from Maraudon quest. Guaranteed item for doing the quest, strong as hell for leveling as a melee class such as warrior/rogue/feral.
---
Although subjective, I would argue yes. 
---
Boomkins spam Starfire, which does arcane damage and benefits from curse of shadow.
---
Shamans were SOL regarding curses though.
---
Probably.  I know I got the whole set back then.  I still find it looked the best.
---
isnt the chinese version of the game that cannot show things like skull head?
---
Yep, only the White Land Owners should be able to vote!

I wonder if he uses the unarmed attack animation when hostile or if he just brains you with a baguette.
---
We did have Thottbot back in the Vanilla days. 
---
Yes, some players did not look at the external sources of information, but a lot of players did. 
---
Even with BiS lists, optimized talent trees, and all of that available information, it's important to understand WHY these options are optimal. Without taking the time to understand the reasoning behind, you can actually suffer by blindly following a simplified guide on the Internet. (For example, a Pre Raid BiS list can lead players to make incorrect assumptions about what their class really wants on their gear because what they need is rare on Pre-Raid gear).
---
If you blindly try to have your Warrior Tank use the Fury/Prot build for max threat because you see a top raiding guild require their tanks to use it, you will most likely have a bad time when you have just dinged 60.
---
Having information available isn't a bad thing, you still need to put in the work to understand this information.
---
As with most parts of modern human civilization, it's no longer feasible for everyone to start from scratch because what we deal with is becoming more and more complicated. Leave it to the enthusiasts to spend hours doing detailed testing and information gathering.
---
I would say we should be thankful for people like Bill "Aftathott" Dyess.
---
Aaaaaaw yeah you're right about that one :P
---
My 2 cents.
---
According to the record holders for fastest leveling, the most effeciant leveling is done through a combination of quests and grinding, specifically grinding and killing everything in your path while completing quests. 
---
But I would ask what your goal is, are you wanting to enjoy the journey? Then do whatever you want :)
---
Do you want to get high ranked in pvp? Then you shouldn't be racing to 60. You should be racing to rank 14. 
---
Don't mention the private server name.
---
And it will be fine.
---
Warlocks have to farm for shards every raid and I'm pretty sure they don't stack so you can kiss a bag goodbye. Also mage's have the best 5 man cc in the game with poly. 
---
Go mage and never look back. 
---
FUCK BARLOW!
---
&gt;Looking better than Everquest is hardly an achievement.
---
???  Who do you think they were competing with?  Whos player base do you think they were trying to take?  What game do you think had to largest impact on WoWs development?  Everquest
---
Marginally better graphics on 1/10th of the content isn't nearly as impressive.  You also failed to recognize that the graphics will always be years behind when development started for a MMO.  Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 were much smaller projects, made with newer tech and didn't have to worry about MMO problems such as high computing requirements lowering their player base, when WoWs major goal was to attract more casual players than Everquest.  I hope I don't have to explain how MMOs take more resources.
---
Have you read John Staats book?
---
yup, bunch of offended gimps
---
Which class levels slower? Its ok that youre fine with leveling a rogue but every other class even warrior can kill more mobs. Getting ganked is not about killing the guy its about how much time you lose.
---
Vanilla was cleared 14 years ago. Not classic. Also you never really beat an MMO, that's part of the point of them.
---
I still remember the best PvPers and our first Rank14 on the Server. I still remember by favorite Guildies in TBC. 
---
And in Retail I could not name a single Guild thats on my Server right now. 
---
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.
---
Thats why you need to invest in his company before it goes public. Its all business strategy really.
---
Dark Iron in BRD while you pick pocket. Torches in Lyceum lol.

Your preraid set is completely wrong, you want something like this [https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12cca6a80be4965f706a27dd61c61ed2fd004e0879979e4d429bae49460b56c95f1a0e1f1a064f68afe80316721664e587ef643e61c74a3cf7fb7bbe6c2fd11962b466385814b0e627f92467600673bebf52c99fa1b5f9a7a9620a1821c760d95531ec10c5641e349fa61d7d03ad1209ce78158b17b89f6020fb642e5f7a7d76707892575e01041252b0ec443899274e70e68bedfe8faa8c0282d8ee41ac1d62e278eb0aa65ce](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12cca6a80be4965f706a27dd61c61ed2fd004e0879979e4d429bae49460b56c95f1a0e1f1a064f68afe80316721664e587ef643e61c74a3cf7fb7bbe6c2fd11962b466385814b0e627f92467600673bebf52c99fa1b5f9a7a9620a1821c760d95531ec10c5641e349fa61d7d03ad1209ce78158b17b89f6020fb642e5f7a7d76707892575e01041252b0ec443899274e70e68bedfe8faa8c0282d8ee41ac1d62e278eb0aa65ce). I understand you're trying to be 'realistic' but if you want to play ret paladin you need to put double effort always which includes getting the best possible gear.
---
Naxx is my favorite because of the atmosphere and encounters, but C'thun is my all-time favorite boss fight.  
---
Alternate timeline reboot!

I'd love this but I give it an 11% chance of happening.

You forgot running up to people and screaming "moooo-sqwak!".
---
OG Mal'ganis rep it up. Also had Goon Squad
---
I got my lvl 40 mount in vanilla on my first character, "warrior"  around lvl 42.
---
I bought every skill just because and used the auction house a little bit.  Simply save up and penny pinch and you should have it by 40 easy.
---
My guild was almost the exact same.... The TBC announcement made all the gear we were working got feel pointless. Guild started to die and I sold my account. Really wish they'd either waited a little longer or at least held off on announcing it.
---
I loved how hammy Nef was.  He has my all-time favorite player death emote: *Foolish retch!  Your friends will join you soon enough!*

Did you know that people keep doing the Kona Ironman every freaking year? And thousands of other races? And they keep trying to do it faster and faster. The same freaking races! It’s unbelievable!

Ah, good old says of carpet bombing my enemies with dozens of Soviet zeppelins.  My WC3 and RA2 were the glory days of RTS.
---
IMO, 15 years ago the only way a developer could make money off of a game was to sell a physical copy of it. And generally, they only sold a single copy to a single gamer. 
---
So back then, the only real monetization scheme was to make a game so damn good that as many people as possible would be interested in purchasing it.
---
Today, the gaming industry has evolved dramatically. Games like World of Tanks can make money hand-over-fist by catering to literally a playerbase of no more than 5,000, but giving those 5,000 people thousands and thousands of dollars worth of things to spend money on.
---
DLC wasn't a thing, or at least, wasn't a thing that studios looked at while developing the game. When the first paid DLC content began being released, they were practically mini-expansions to games. Now, we get shit like Destiny 2, where the publisher will literally intentionally push out unfinished games with the intention of trying to force you to spend money to get the rest of the game.
---
I think modern studios still make some amazing, amazing games. But I also think a lot of games that could-have-should-have been amazing for the masses end up being narrowly focused on extracting tons of money from small numbers of players. For example, I really WISH I could play the most recent Battlefront and Battlefield games. But the layers upon layers of monetization just make me not even want to try.
---
Obviously even WoW has fallen down this rabbit hole. WoW is no longer about maximizing the appeal of this beautiful world to keep 10 million people subscribed; it has become exclusively about manipulating the excitement existing players have from RNG to keep them subbed as long as possible. 
---
Ya the farming shards part is kinda meh
---
Enchanting is generally something people start at level 60.  There are the brave few who level it while levelling but it's just not efficient.  Best to get 60, get your BiS and start soloing low level dungeons for the mats OR just farming gold and buying the cheapest crap off AH in the level area you need.  Herbalism should be levelled while levelling, tailoring is doable youre just going to have to take a long time to get past the silk stage by farming mobs outside of SM. 
---
And indie/small developer game quality is phenomenal these days. Games like Celeste, Cuphead, Ori and the Blind Forest play fantastically well and look great. You could play solely Indie games to avoid corporate influence and still play some of the best games every year.
---
One thing I don't see people mentioning is the fact that, unless Blizzard announces something, this is semi-permanent. There isn't TBC coming to kill progression through WoW, so instead of having about 6 months to clear Naxx, you have as long as the servers are up and running. I think that should allow for less hardcore guilds to eventually get there.
---
I remember it fondly.. wading through the legions of Nelf Hunters called Ĺégólãs and Human Paladins called Árthås in Stormwind.
---
Honored is all you need for the discount, and you'll get it very easily even with heavy grinding. Exalted only matters if you want to buy another race's mount.
---
That is only a thing on private servers because mobs that would frequently drop nothing have far too high drop rates, as the times they dropped nothing wouldn't get factored in to data collection addons, leading to incorrect drop rates in the database. For the same reason essence of air/elemental air/breath of wind  is many times more common than other elemental reagents, since air elementals would mostly drop nothing.

Get a part time job if you're a student or work overtime in prep for it.  Might as well grind irl if we can't grind classic. If that's out the question, work on your irl strength or endurance. It's always fun to push yourself. Might as well right? The dedication or extra money is gonna transfer over ingame. Either through better health or more money to funnel easy but still decent food!

Mage pros:
---
* Top dps in PvE
---
* Very useful PvP with slows, frost nova, arcane explosion, etc
---
* Teleporting/portal/food and water makes for tons of utility
---
Cons:
---
* Very popular, will have to compete for raid spots and gear
---
* Everyone asking you for water
---
* PvP is a bit of a button mash
---
* Leveling is not as fast as hunter or warlock
---
Warlock pros:
---
* Less popular, less competition for gear/raid spots
---
* interesting mechanics like banish, summon, soul stone, very useful in all situations
---
* wide array of curses
---
* pets, vw tank makes leveling second easiest to hunter
---
* neat lore
---
8 hours is assuming your not on a horrible farming class and your doing something pretty efficient from what I remember... I spent at least a year farming in vanilla making wayyyy less than that before I learned some "tricks".
---
I only got to experience C'Thun a bit later than some, AQ40 broke my guild before we could do it if i'm remembering right.
---
Druids have innervate 
---
Oh, I haven’t played pservers, all my lvl 60 exp comes from retail vanilla.
---
Biggest mistake they made in classic... They clearly realized it because they re-released naxx for WotLK. Wish someone had told them they were killing the greatest raid the game had/has ever seen with that timing.
---
OSRS, WoT, PUBG (with friends, cant play alone), and a ton of podcasts/books I'm reading. 
---
I know the feeling. I started on a pserver when "summer" was first announced. Got to 20 and thought 'meh good enough. Don't want to burn out before release'. Recently went back to my character and I'm now 26 and leveling my secondary professions.
---
It's because there are two groups of opposing players.
---
There are people that enjoyed Alterac Valley as an experience who prefer the older version of Alterac Valley and there are those that are using it as a means to an end for easy loot that just want to blast through it.
---
Imo it's part of the same mindset that led to the mess we have on Live servers, Blizzard catering to people that don't enjoy the content and allowing them to basically fast-forward their way through it at the expense of everyone else that enjoys it for gameplay reasons.
---
One argument is to keep enchanting on your main for potential d.e. of bop items from dungeons / dungeon farming
---
I remember a lot of different people from vanilla to mop. Its crazy to think about. I remember this night elf druid in vanilla that me and my dad would run into in a bg. His name was matapang and my dad would call him out of mana pang. 
---
I played Alliance on Deathwing (US). There was a Horde guild Pretty Pink Pwnies, led by the orc warrior Bru. PPP made my leveling life a living hell. Anytime you saw these guys out in the world you knew shit was about to go down. It wasn't until a couple years later in TBC I would get my revenge, as seen in this horribly cringy video I made of me launching people off the bridge in AV with Christmas snowballs https://youtu.be/P5xe8LpVlBM?t=155
---
I didn't play my Alliance much once I got to lvl 60. I rerolled a tauren shaman on Darkspear, and I vividly remember leveling in Tanaris and being auto attacked to death by Swifty with him using just a grand marshal staff. Funny thing is I actually met him irl a couple years ago and confronted him about this! Even all these years later vanilla WoW is bring people together like that.
---
What makes you think I'm coping? It's killing me slowly.

Ironic when these people just scream NO CHANGES. Yet, they clearly don't understand that there were changes that occured throughout vanilla. So which NO CHANGES do you want is the question here man.

---
Hunters compete pretty well in DPS through BWL. Chrom is a pretty hunter friendly fight as well since you're ranged/physical dps with a super reliable aggro drop; plus, if you have Lupos as a pet, its attacks do shadow damage which get really buffed whenever Chrom goes into shadow vulnerability.
---
Other dps classes really start pulling ahead in AQ40 where hunters lack proper scaling.
---
Includes all instances, instance quests and raid bosses with battle tactics up to AQ40. Sadly Naxx wasn't yet released when this book came out. 
---
Great info, helps a lot thanks:)
---
That's a good idea, I've never read any of the wow books 
---
There are 3 recipes from LBRS (and usually a chest or two) that a well geared rogue can solo. Arcanite Reaper, Robe of the Archmage and Greater Fire Protection Potion recipes all drop close by and sell for tons. But you gotta be like, tier 2 level gear or so with a specific spec.
---
Druids get reflection, clearcasting, and can innervate themselves. 
---
Realistically they shouldn't be going oom anymore than a Warlock should. 
---
But, you know, managing mana is too hard these days. :V
---
Ill be doing thevsane, but the complete opposite.
---
I never rolled alliqnce until post cata, always regretted never leveling to see that content (the lake has always been drained for me)
---
Just Apex at the moment. It's a nice change because it's pretty much the opposite of WoW, really low time commitment and no progression that affects in-game power.
---
I love how unpredictable his Class-Calls are. Like every week it's a different encounter.
---
As a Rogue you always prayed it never came or at least the Tank was fast enough. LMAO
---
2.5 fps...  you fucking warrior.
---
Also good in WOTLK.
---
But this guy lived for the Boomkin, I don't know why. Maybe the big crits? Or playing that fat ass owl?
---
It's a mystery for me to this day.
---
The major issue is that Blizzard as a company isn't trustworthy like they used to be back in the days of Vanilla.
---
Is sharding in the starting zones for the first week or two acceptable? Yes, but ONLY if they can guarantee that sharding will NEVER be used ever again in Classic. And Blizzard does not have the trust to back up that kind of guarantee.
---
Sure, their current Classic team is on an upswing thanks to the 6 content phase decision and the recent news on loot trading, but they're still fighting against over a decade of Blizzard fucking things up.
---
So rather than having to trust a company that has nowhere near the good will for that, I'd prefer no sharding at all and people tough it out for a week, that way there's no precedent for them to add sharding further in Classic.
---
It wasn’t the dark ages, but it was a different time.  An expansion was coming, people were still figuring out why they were playing WoW, and resources weren’t nearly as good as they got as far as information.  
---
Now, if you’re playing Classic and your goal isn’t to just PvP your way to rank 14, the goal is to down Kel’thuzad, and people are so used to raid mechanics that I don’t see many issues gearing up for Naxx.  
---
*Pulls an Apex Legends*
---
Warcraft Battle Royale confirmed.
---
Add me on discord Crimsoneagle#3839
---
Definitely ZG. I loved the atmosphere there. 
---
2 dollars for what is effectively a paper weight. 
---
Depends what you mean. Affliction isn't really for raiding, but it's great for PVP. Opposite for destruction. 
---
There was theorycraft and BIS discussion, but it widely varied on your talent tree.. and that was widely varied. It depended on if you just enjoyed 5mans, or raids, or pvp or a little of everything. 
---
I think the real difference is finding a guild that meets your playstyle. Back in vanilla I played a feral druid. In raids I dps'd, off-tanked, and even occasionally spot healed. My guild was cool with that. 
---
I wasn't sure on the answer to this, but Twitch recently made 'Auto Chess' (a Dota 2 custom game) have it's own channel, so I think Classic will too now.
---
Hey if big universes like Star Trek can do it... perhaps.. one day. in 2039.
---
If I remember my lore correctly, undead don't require food for sustenance, but some of them still eat it because they are trying (unsuccessfully) to recreate that sensation they once felt when alive.
---
Cheerful thought of the day.
---
NO...NO....THEY JUST STARTED PLAYYYINGGG
---
[Here is a pretty good thread on skinning.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/)
---
TLDR; By the time you hit 40 it really doesn't make a huge dent in comparison to the hassle. It gets much better when you are consistently getting heavy and rugged leather, though.
---
Apparently /s posters on here can't sense when being /s-ed.
---
Keeping in mind, we're talking about Classic here, not Vanilla. So, whether you "can raid Naxx" or "should raid Naxx" probably is more of a question of when you want to do it than whether it can be done. Within the first six months, it will be approximately as hard as it was in Vanilla and take probably about as much effort, with a low completion rate to match. Only guilds that could have done it back then will do it in that window.
---
After that, once the full schedule of content is rolled out and all the drop tables are updated to full 1.12 decadence, and given that people have basically infinite time to do it from there on, it may be a different story and may be much more accessible to people who don't have the ability to no-life the game any more. Exactly how easy remains to be seen, but it definitely will be more doable once Classic is fully matured than it ever was in Vanilla before TBC dropped.
---
Debuff limit is being increased from 8 to 16.
---
&gt;The thing about ranking is you gotta beat the 20% decay (which is insane once you go above Rank12) basically you'll need 500 to a million honor per week to both beat the decay and to increase in standings.  
---
This really depends on the server. You just need to be bracket 1. Some servers that 1-2m, some that's 100-200k. My retail server we only had 1 person hit 1m honor, once, and they were on the underpopulated faction (instant queues), horde.
---
Every month you play after the fiftth would essentially be free.
---
It’s all we knew then. Lol 
---
I dunno about you, but on my server everyone got in the raid, even lowbies were invited. The only way you werent in is if you were avoiding it.
---
The hunter one was the most hilarious.  Despite being the easiest call to deal with, there was always *at least* one huntard that didn't have a backup weapon.  
---
BoE 
---
Yes I know. But this is what we did in private servers. I never did Naxxramas in 2006 :p
---
Paladins and warriors are both slower or on par at best.
---
Indeed. And the drop rates for the Robe were really great.
---
Arcanite Reaper is a big gamble, but I always had a Robe in the AH.
---
I still play retail and honestly would love cata, even early mop. The deathblow for me was cross realm. Not seeing the same old ppl, or anyone more than once. I'd take cata anyday if it were my only choice. :(
---
I really remember AQ &amp; Naxx where Hunger were really behind, but I extended my thoughts to BWL, that was wrong :)
---
Contrary to what the outrage lords below you want you to believe...they were removed for chinese localization reasons.
---
So I'm confused. If I don't have World of Warcraft at all, would I have to shell out 60 USD for the game, then another 12 USD for the monthly subscription?
---
Bleh I've started on the last 3 or 4 progression servers on EQ the last few years. Kind of sick of it. I'm just taking a break until classic now. 
---
Rarely as druid! Best of both.
---
This is viable on pservers, at least.
---
Were your mages asleep?  I smashed everyone in my guild as Mage.  Got full T2 on mage, one of my greatest person wow achievements.  Got stuck on Twin Emps in AQ40 and cleared about half of Naxx40 before TBC.
---
See where I said modern WoW, and not vanilla.
---
Any dungeon. You could do RFC 40 man if you wanted until the DM patch.
---
Dwarf hunters can double leveling speed 1-10idf they buy couple of guns.
---
The consumable thing isn't that bad really. By the time Naxx opens, you're probably completely finished with all the random shit you might normally do with a character, like reputations and epic mount and ranking up for PvP gear. You could probably spend like 4-5 hours a week farming and have all the consumables you need, or you might have saved up a few thousand gold by then so you can just dip into your savings.
---
Judging by pserver standards, Naxx is definitely more approachable than it was back in the day. Just having modern hardware and high-speed internet plus all strategies well-known means any decent player can do it. But it still does take competency, so genuinely bad players won't cut it in Naxx. Everyone still needs to perform well.
---
Keeping a raid guild together throughout Naxx is the bigger challenge. By that point, vanilla feels pretty much over and people begin to quit in droves because you know there's nothing else after Naxx. On pservers, a lot of guilds that are totally capable of clearing Naxx on paper end up not doing so because there's just not enough people left. I predict that Classic will have new batches of servers launching periodically to keep things #fresh, and by the time Naxx rolls around, many will be more interested in a new server.
---
MC trash was terrible.  When we were on farm I'd just afk /fol and do my homework.
---
Ignite is a big fucking dot and you won't use most of your dots in raiding anyway. Sure you can use them in pvp but oneshotting people seems more fun.
---
I definitely liked the old cs more than csgo
---
Warlocks don't need stealth because no one is gonna mess with you.
---
&gt;The deathblow for me was cross realm.  
---
Same, but in 1.12 
---
No, theres nothing to buy. Creating an account allows you to play the base game up to level 20. 
---
By subscribing for $15 a month you'll have access to everything in the game except the newest expansion and WoW classic when it comes out.
---
True but blizzard CAN dictate the meta if they want.
---
Honestly I would bet Blizzard is working on some sort of BR right now. 
---
Not sure I can unfortunately, but in general Defias had a great community and scene pre Cata I think. Many memorable RP guilds and in general people behaved much better than on regular PVP servers. There was enough RP to go around as well and people stood in character nicely.
---
Good stuff.
---
I wouldn’t think destruction would be good for pve things such as molton core, but I never played classic so im not sure
---
Honestly depends if you can get a wand, at least on horde you dont get one till the escort quest at the sludge fen. 
---
&gt; 1 guy farming 50 shards ( mobs) isnt that big of a deal
---
Hey man, I'm just trying to explain what we're all doing before Naxxramas. Be it **SMALL** or big efforts, it's the whole picture.
---
If someone asks for the ingredient list for Sulfuron Hammer, would you comment "Hey, its only 20 dark iron bars, no big deal"?
---
What are you talking about 
---
Aww man, the good old no addons, no hotkeys, stormstrike spec healing, 16 healing classes in the raid, no consumes, 2.5 FPS, no WF groups raids.
---
Man this is what WoW was about. Too bad we all had to learn the game lol
---
Thats what I thought. I could have sworn I did UBRS a few times as a 20-40man back in the day, but in another thread when I said that people called me an idiot haha. 
---
It absolutely does. Skinning takes no additional movement; it's just added value onto every beast kill. The time it takes to skin something you already killied is a fraction of your total leveling time.
---
Maybe 0.01% of the guilds if we were to actually count in all the guilds on a server. But yeah, very few will step foot inside Naxxramas
---
Yeah that's the thing, those who mention the warrior or rogue D2 stuff are oblivious to what it takes to acquire it. Apparently that ignorance is shared by Ion.
---
You bring around 800g of consumables per raid, but you probably only use around 300g of consumables if you guys don't wipe much.

Hey guys, really enjoyed chatting with these guys yesterday - hope you enjoy the episode! We covered a bunch of topics but the main one was what realm types we want to play. I'd love to hear what you guys plan to roll on, too!
---
Honestly? I've been no lifing on Rift Prime before it closes later this week. Gonna get lvl 50 for bonuses on the regular server. I'm probably going to burn out by the time I reach 50, but I'll have enough recovery time between Prime ending and Classic launching, and I wasn't planning to power to 60 ASAP anyways.
---
Cool
---
&gt; By subscribing for $15 a month you'll have access to everything in the game **except** the newest expansion and WoW classic when it comes out.
---
So by subscribing I get nothing?
---
I heard somewhere that graphics and visuals are getting more expensive to produce, so if player want to be wowed by state of the art, high def graphics, it might come at the expense of development in other areas of the game. I don't know how accurate this really is, just something I've heard.
---
I play a lot of my old games, and I've noticed I haven't gotten into very many newer games over the years. I think the newest game I've played recently was Final Fantasy XV.
---
These posts are bording onsatire a this point. For anyone expecting TBC servers or an entirely new MMO game tangent, don't hold your breath. Enjoy Classic for what it is and hope that Blizzard takes retail WoW in a positive direction for the next expansion.
---
No....you get everything in the game but Battle for Azeroth.
---
Hell yes! I have friends too who have **never** touched World of Warcraft before. I can't wait to show them!
---
Of course they're being tested, it's just in-house. They'll probably do their usual friends and family beta for more testers, then *maybe* a closed beta we can sign up for through bnet accounts. No reason to think they wont handle this like any other launch.
---
Every other game is competition, especially with a time consuming game like Classic. And if someones main interest were graphics, classic is a far behind on that gamers wishlist.
---
Never read his book but I have listen to some of the interviews with him. John said that the primary factor that made Blizzard games so popular were it's low spec requirements on your PC. With low specs something else takes a toll, usuaööy graphics.
---
Warlocks are significantly more popular than mages now, actually. They're right behind Warriors according to the surveys posted yesterday.
---
I’ve never played rogue. Is daggers or fist weapons always worse than swords?
---
Okey, so I don't get Battle for Azeroth, but do I get classic?
---
It will be more fun if there are loads of problems 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
And bragging rights. The reward was not as great as raid gear, but it was vastly more skill-based and effort-based.
---
God, I loved the world PvP in Felwood! One of my favorite parts of the game.
---
40 pff. Did a 450 man DAoC raid yday. 🤪
---
Thanks for the reply good fellow, I guess sometimes these things happen but if you are keep dealing with these problems concerning YouTube links, then I would recommend you to watch them directly from the **browser.**
---
I remember playing that when it launched!
---
You're thinking about this the wrong way, the Demo was a proof of concept, not proof that they've translated data from their 1.12 client into Cata or whatever.  It's also not possible for players to prove mostly anything that is added is wrong, only present suspicions.
---
So that's what a beta would cover, finding inaccuracies in the translated data... where only Blizz knows if it's right or not.  A beta really isn't necessary as most problems would be wrongful interpretations of memories and/or pserver experience, or as I said, only Blizzard knows if it's actually a problem i.e. Warlock pets unsummon when you start to summon a new one.  Additionally, Blizzard doesn't need to test server loads because surprise, they have more experience in that area than any other gaming company (probably).
---
Beta would be cool, maybe we get one.  Definitely won't be any kind of reflection of the Demo.
---
It's probably never going to be your main spec if you are serious about group play. You will never make it good, but you can make it fun which is more important.
---
Short answer - no
---
Long answer - see short answer. 
---
Last time I ran LFR, years ago, probably MoP or WoD, it was like Lord of the Flies.  Everyone was bitching at each other in chat and wanting to kill Piggie.  People were more courteous in Vanilla, because you had a rep to worry about, and you needed friends to succeed.  I think after the first month's tourists leave, Classic will have a much more mature population overall, because the people who don't want to be social or have to learn to play and pull their own weight will go back to retail.  Then they'll have their game and we'll have ours.
---
Also, I'm not wanting to rush either, other than the first couple days to get ahead of the hard. 
---
Fair enough. I forgot about enhancement shamans!
---
Balance druids go OOM after about 90 seconds so they are only really viable when on speed runs when you already overgear the content.
---
I'm glad she didn't call it quits and is just switching classes. My campaign of getting old friends to play isn't going well.
---
Here's another blast from the past for you(one of the server's 1st raids on MC made up of 3 guilds):
---
[https://i.imgur.com/BfjpJ3n.png](https://i.imgur.com/BfjpJ3n.png)
---
Way before my time, though.
---
Original Rift or Rift Prime?
---
I adored original Rift. It was a great follow up to WoW, especially after having quit Cataclysm. Didn't enjoy much what they did to it later, but early Rift was great.
---
Prime, which is Rift's version of Classic, I played long enough to see that it was not actually Vanilla at all, and was instead just normal Rift, level capped at 50 and with no content past the Vanilla zones. But it was still the live talents and abilities and stuff. So Prime was a pretty big disappointment in that regard.
---
Mine were about 40-50 in general play. IIRC it was 30-40 during raids mostly. I had gotten used to high framerates during the 90s when 3d cards started coming out. Many games before that ran at 20-30 FPS, so that was a big switch I could not go back from. It never occurred to me back then that some would choose to play at frame rates below 20 or even 30.
---
Problem with this is item scaling, u need to be encouraged to do these new "raids/dungeons" but items will start being so OP at that point it won't even make sense (since u need better gear upgrades then nax) and then after that better, and better. With all these dungeons/raids ur gear would be really really op broken.
---
Now u could say "they could change the scaling" but then what? You are super weak when u hit 60 then, u are even weaker when u hit 60 and wanna do dungeons, u might be stronger at 59 then when u ding 60 etc. It would be kinda fucked up. Unless ofc they change all the levels (50-60) and they buff/nerf contest acordingly to the race nerfs. But now we changed so much, so some things could be at a completely diffrent diffculity (like bosses etc). 
---
This is bassicly option 1 above, it's possible but would require a lot of work/tuning.
---
Option 2 is making a new server but releasing everything at a diffrent timeline (so nax might be the second hardest raid, instead of hyjal, uldum, karazan etc etc) being harder and better gear. 
---
So here u might get something like molten core &gt; bwl &gt; hyjal &gt; uldum &gt; ahn'qiraj &gt; dark protal invsaion&gt; nax &gt; karazhan... etc etc. 
---
Bassicly here they would just make the "contest patches" completely diffrent with the newer ones in between the older ones, so gear etc isn't suddently "much better at the end" but just a bit better.
---
This ofc would make them have to tune all bosses in all raids (also current ones) since if u have a raid between bwl/zul or zul/aq then u would have better gear for these, so they would need some buff to compensate for that.
---
This comment is also just to show u their is more things then just "adding new content" they need to be smart about it, make as many happy as they can, still have it be balanced etc. It's much easier for them to say "we go to level 65 or 70 now, and we create new content patches with vanilla phiolofy" but problem with that is now everything at level 60 feels "useless"
---
Does this work? I've read you'll be at around 20g profit from skinning by level 40.
---
Oops, read it wrong. My bad.
---
I’m taking the opposite approach to the preppers. Played vanilla when burning crusade was about a year out. Was pretty young, so in no way did I play well.Never played on a private server. I’m purposely not reading up on the game to refresh my memory. No guides etc. I want to rediscover the game, and wander into parts I never found as a kid
---
They won't, imo. They will want to promote &amp; hype it, instead.
---
I've intentionally trashed NPCs in Southshore just to distract the Alliance scum from their lowbie ganking in TM.
---
They always took the bait.
---
That one lvl 59 Shaman.
---
Pleasure being on, Chimly!
---
Holy shit I haven’t seen this in YEARS. Loved this video when I was a teenager and played rogue
---
Nostalgia is real 
---
Would there be anyway to get a hold of the updated raw data for this survey? The link for "raw data" is a .csv containing 10,176 response whereas the "view other's responses" shows 18,342  responses.  
---
I actually threw together an in-depth survey explorer tool this past weekend that I'm hoping to post for people this week (I'm a Web Dev by trade). As in "show me the stats for all the responses that answered "female" for character gender, "For the Horde!" for faction, and either "Engineering" or "Alchemy" for leveling professions." or even just "Only show me the stats for the people rolling Alliance". I used the responses from the "raw data" link but it looks like that may only include the responses at the time of this original post? \~8,200 more responses is almost doubling the data, so I'd hate for people to lose out on half the responses to explore.
---
As some1 said. Warlocks population will be about same count as mages these days.
---
Its  tough choice for me also.
---
If blizzard sold some kind of “classic package”, full of stuff like this, on launch it will sell a shitload.
---
Sure!  I mained a druid but also leveled a mage during classic!  \*Rotates camera to look behind him.\*  Wasn't really a problem, \*rotates camera back forward, adjusts course, turns camera to the right.\* just had to get used to a different \*turns camera to look to the left, then up at the nearby cliffs.\* style of play really.  \*Rank one arcane explosions randomly.\*
---
Do you have any \*checks ahead, rotates camera back behind again.\* heart conditions?
---
My post kept being downvoted hence my comment. Your /s was detected. 
---
Om nom nom. 
---
Tried a pserver. Tbh i really have had fun but its maxd me go from hell ya cant wait to do i really want to pay a sub to play this game...now that ive vanilla’d again tbc was just so much better imo. Reasons for me being less need to farm hours for consumes, much better pvp system, arena! I honestly think outland has some of the coolest zones in wow history really enjoyed basically every tbc raid and the itemization was so much better than classics which is pretty horrid tbh. 
---
I did something similar on the free weekend. I logged on my old character and flew to the entrance to WSG in Ashenvale and took a screenshot. There was no point in actually playing retail, but I got to take a nice nostalgic shot of my character in her natural habitat :P [https://imgur.com/VzGasN8](https://imgur.com/VzGasN8)
---
Thanks :) I think it came out pretty well!
---
If you think WoW Classic release is actively trying to compete with Apex Legends for example, then I'm just going to let you have this one and move on.  Of course, attact a lot of players is the goal, but lets agree John Staats wasn't lying when he said Everyquest was the inspiration for WoW and that they wanted it to look nicer and still run well on everyones toaster.  We can also imply that an MMO made by the fans for the fans (Everquest players) was the goal and is what made WoW successful.  Many of the devs were EQ players and brought in plents of concepts for that reason.
---
&gt; John said that the primary factor that made Blizzard games so popular were it's low spec requirements on your PC. 
---
True, still better than Everquest which was the point.  I assumed you were trying to say WoW had unimpressive graphics for an MMO at the time, because it was impressive and it was the best.  They used the best technology for meshes they had available, rewrote the code, and made it run better on low end systems per John Staats.
---
They do have group of test players(Blizz employees) running the game constantly according to the now ex-CM. The reason the demo was so buggy/things like dungeon finder visual bugs was simply because they put all their energy to get the version running which was the largest hurdle. After that it's probably just a cake walk for a professional dev team.
---
IIRC 15 was 'pretty good', and 24fps was pretty much the 60 FPS of today, being the same frame rate as movies (also people said human eye couldn't see more than that back then for some reason lol).
---
Automatic looting is the only convenience I'll miss.
---
Yes I'm aware that I can shift loot to auto loot, but its the little things sometimes lol
---
yea but most ppl didnt want to cause nobody would get loot.
---
Hon hon hon baguette?
---
You could pair that with the Lapidis Tankard of Tidesippe (sp?) but you wouldn't be able to equip both at the same time.
---
I was running a dungeon once and the healer was out of water, and the Tankard dropped randomly - problem solved :-)
---
A few thoughts. 
---
Once you get your bags and craftable items, you can drop tailoring (unless you're holding out for bloodvine as well.
---
If you do decide you want enchanting, definetely start with it so you can DE all the greens you get questing. However, keep in mind that will delay your mounts.
---
You'll want Engineering at max level, but it's up to you if you want to level with it. You'll get some fun items, but at the cost of a gathering profession. It's more profitable to gather while you level then dump it for engineering at 60.
---
Agree, tbc zones were fking magical and arenas were amazing. 
---
Where were you when you logged in? Could you remember why you were there? Any interesting items or anything? I love these time capsules.
---
I logged into my hunter after 9 years to find myself naked in gold shire.  
---
Sadly depending on release date I'll just be going back too work after being off for back surgery. A good day for me will be squeezing in 3-4 hours after my kids go to bed. Those rainy weekends tho I'll be binge playing 
---
:D
---
Well good thing we don't live in China then...
---
My girlfriend.
---
Noktyn is an IRL friend of mine who I met after he played vanilla.  
---
I hate that he got name dropped here...
---
I now have to lie to him and tell him someone was commenting that he was the most garbage warrior on the server. 
---
&gt; Druids get reflection, clearcasting, and can innervate themselves. 
---
Reflection is half the passive regen of mage armor.  Druids don't have clearcasting, they have omen of clarity, which triggers on melee attacks.  Innervate can and should be used on other players, and even so it is 2/3 the regen of evocation.
---
&gt; Realistically they shouldn't be going oom anymore than a Warlock should. 
---
What?  Warlocks have life tap.  Warlocks are never oom.  
---
If Thrall is an option, I'm going there. Was my server through Vanilla all the way to Cataclysm.
---
Otherwise, East Coast PVE realm, don't really care about anything else.
---
Pretty sure most raid bosses hit a bit harder than 5-man dungeon trash.
---
8 hours well spend.
---
It was for me. BWL was a nightmare for my poor old laptop. Suppression room was like watching a slide show, and on Nefarian my game would crash during the skeleton rush.
---
Warriors have heroic strike.
---
I’m just taking the piss out of oblivious Rogues. 
---
1.12 AV is a PVE zergfest pretending to be PVP, so they won't be doing it for fun cause they want to PVP.
---
Factor in the rewards being so good and quick to get, and you'll get a ton of PVE tourists doing AV just long enough to get their rewards then never touch it again. Those people will force the zerg strat since it is by far the most efficient.

Wouldn’t they have to translate the jokes into Chinese? Why wouldn’t they just not translate the ones they couldn’t translate and leave them untouched in NA clients
---
Without world buffs implies that they killed it before wbuffs were enabled, which is in the first month or so.
---
Maybe we've just uncovered their master plan to avoid sharding. Drop it while everyone is at work!
---
Just listened to your Countdown to Classic podcast, found myself laughing out loud during your Kazzak story and loved hearing you bring up Felwood and the tubers. I used to battle with Bloodshot over them as well! Forgot about him and Brutalis.     
---
I was one of the Horde you guys brushed aside in that Kazzak story, we were initially pissed at being  outnumbered like usual, but it was fun watching the Alliance guilds wipe each other. There were also some ridiculous early battles over Azuregos, I think our 80+ Horde super PUG rushed over from Orgrimmar and won the server first kill on him, while the Alliance were still showing up.        
---
Looking forward to meeting you in STV or Redridge... leaning the same way as you for Classic, I can't play this game casually but may go hard early on. Nothing beats blowing people apart in some good world PVP. 
---
Okay, to explain everything. That guy I killed was a well known shaman on my server. We played against each other a lot as he was hitting rank13 shortly after I hit rank14. He was known for being kinda weird and naming his orc shaman "Orcworrior" while being in a guild called "Orc Hunter".  
---
You can see him with a lightning shield up hitting me with windfury and frost shock: [https://i.imgur.com/rTW611f.png](https://i.imgur.com/rTW611f.png)

---
The rogue joke means that there could have been a stealthed horde rogue about to pick up &amp; cap the flag while I was took the picture.  
---
(I was real worried about this at the time, but I thought having the screenshot forever was worth the risk. 14 years later, looks like I was right :)
---
Never thought about keeping skinning; I guess you could for the gold and the odd piece of leather needed for some tailoring recipes.  But I usually end up with more than what I need from fishing floating debris.
---
MC was my fav.  It was my first opportunity to main tank for my guild.  I came in after the guild already had most of MC on farm so I was able to “train up” so to speak.  Stehlen Life on Terenas US if anyone’s lurking! 
---
i was thinking after to myself - well unless he means a druid... lol
---
Generally speaking, there were only a few mechanics or situations that would lead to an instant or certain raid wipe:
---
1.  Someone momentarily pulls aggro and the boss breathes on the whole raid before the tank can get aggro back.  This was a concern for all dragon and drake bosses, and anything with a frontal cone attack.
---
2.  Someone inadvertently chaining an ability that requires proper positioning or spacing:  C'thun eye-beam, Venoxis &amp; Zeliek Holy Wrath, Kel'thuzad Frost blast, Thaddius Polarity.
---
3.  Someone screwing up a mechanic, usually by pulling aggro at the wrong time:  Twin Emperors not being grabbed by the tank after a switch (this was recoverable), Ossarian being pulled away from a crystal.
---
The bosses I remember feeling constantly on edge for the whole fight were Broodlord, Twin Emps, Patchwerk, Razuvious, and 4H.  Those were the fights were it felt like one missed taunt, one missed heal, or one inadvertent aggro pull would doom the raid.   
---
It's like reading my own story.
---
None other!  
---
The madlad still plays and streams: [https://www.twitch.tv/tigerlady](https://www.twitch.tv/tigerlady)  
---
Depends on where you fight him.  If you drug him back to Garr's room it was big enough for people to spread out so one person would only blow up a single group instead of the whole raid.  
---
He def has addons, not the dps meter at the top and I don't think that is the standard bar.
---
My memory might be shite, but I remember them being a thing in vanilla 
---
Of course they eat lol. They can even eat and drink at the same time! 
---
Would be an easy way to help/deal with server queues and having to shard. Would prevent people waiting until a countdown timer and everyone logging in at once and crashing servers.  
---
It's interesting to think about. Its not a "new" game in Blizzard's eye, so the normal way to think about things is thrown out the door. 
---
Wat? Mages have a far easier time getting into dungeons, sheep is more reliable, mage aoe is far more powerful and doesn't require that same setup, and everybody LOVES free water and a teleport after the run. By comparison warlocks have a hard time since there are so many mages and people want mages, however warlock gear overlaps heavily with mage and even healers pre-60, so groups are already crowded for your gear type.
---
&gt; I remember drinking a lot before level 10. 
---
You weren't playing optimally.  Before 20, you smite, mindblast, shadow word: pain, and wand until they die.  This method takes full advantage of the 5 second rule.
---
Warlock class leader would put people on curse assignment (curse of shadow and curse of elements assigned to 2 warlocks) and they'd also give banish symbol assignments. 
---
No warlock class leader means you're losing a shit ton of dps from no curse of elements/shadow.
---
It's not arguable at all. It's never 'worth' it to bring a boomkin.
---
YES IT WAS! 
---
So just asking one more time to get this straight; I don't have an old WoW account, but I only have to start subscription to play classic?
---
I used to play a rogue in vanilla, now i have a warlock on pserver. Yes i miss stealth but what you lose with stealth you gain in other ways.
---
Yeah, as soon as you pay the $15 dollars for a sub youll have access to classic.
---
It was a joke. Clearly warlocks are the hardest working casters. &lt;\^.\^&gt;  
---
Kara was my favorite. Opera was just so freaking cool. Lol. 
---
That's the Grand Marshal's Longsword icon as that was my autoattack melee button. The icon matches what weapon you have equipped.  
---
I played a lot of balance in vanilla. The short answer is they have no true purpose.  
---
They can do ok with five mans but when it comes to raiding their mana can’t hold up compared to any main DPS caster. Unless you really have some pull in the guild or really good gear you’re almost certainly going to be asked to heal over boomkin dps. 
---
However, they are fun in PvP. I wouldn’t say great but they aren’t terrible either. Their damage is decent and they have the ability to off heal pretty well. 
---
Playing boomkin is fun but expect to shell out a lot of coin on respecs if you plan on pvping and pveing 
---
Here comes the rain again 
---
Unless you like RPG's. In which case, DQ 11 just came out last year and is fantastic
---
Yes, but I think my point is that in order to "dictate the meta" then they would have to make changes to AV that were not present in Vanilla, which is antithetical to the whole "No Changes" thing. It is a fallacy to claim that if we used a previous version of AV that didn't have NPCs nerfed we would have a more interesting AV experience. Unless you think killing Korrak 90 minutes into the BG adds "fun". 
---
Showing up here and seeing a mage was the best feeling ever! Free food! 
---
And that is enough to clear Naxx long term?
---
Oh wow very cool, what is this BWL thing?
---
ok ty
---
Bro vanilla boomkin pvp with consumes is so good
---
Ha HA! Heresy. 
---
Well i dont believe he has em laid out in any particular order. Most guilds ask that you would bring most of those, or as many that you can get your hands on, though you wont necessarily need to pop all of them. Imo consumes are dependent on how much effort/gold you personally want to invest in a particular raid night. So weigh up your options based on  price and effect and you'll be ok. If your in  a hardcore guild on progression night, disregard all that, your raid lead will definitely expect all consumes and world buffs

---
Lel gl im out.
---
Do you mean to sell the mats or to be an enchanter? 
---
If the former, I would assume it’ll be a gold loss on a fresh server in trying to get your level 40 mount.
---
If the latter, then that’s entirely up to you, but enchanting wouldn’t be high on my list for professions for my main at 60.

Leveling as a skinner is just nice for the extra gold until you get your mount.

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly
---
Long queues are already expected to be an issue. Cut the number of people queuing into two groups for each flavor of AV is very detrimental to queue times.  Also, the differences between these two versions is way overstated. There is no point in having two versions they will feel the same.
---
The first four Sonata Arctica albums.
---
Ecliptica
---
Silence
---
Winterheart's Guild
---
Reckoning Night
---
I understand this point of contention but I also hate it. 
---
No offense to you, but I don't give a damn if someone is doing a bit more dps than me, to which the extra skill is only a very small factor in comparison to gear quality, consumables, spec and rotation. As long as the boss dies and I'm pushing for good damage on whichever class I'm playing, it doesn't matter.
---
And if the raid wipes with a boss at 1%, the leader can blame the race/class comp of the members and be a complete elitist asshole, but should instead recognize that there was a mistake in strategy, communication, preparation, or execution that caused the wipe. When everything goes according to plan, you might be sweating the whole time but your can take down almost boss without being close to wiping.
---
So having stoneform to counter/survive warriors, rogues and sometimes hunters, as well as frost resistance against mages is huge.
---
Also beards

Geneticisbad is actually an AV wolf just used as a furious howl buff bot.
---
TBH I don't think I ever had a Lupos. I think just used:
---
1 normal cat
---
2 Broken Tooth
---
3 Howling Screech bat
---
4 AV wolf 
---
So much misinformation.
---
&gt; You bring around 800g worth of consumables every Naxxramas raid
---
800g? Give me a break, the only reason why that statement would be close to being true is because people could bring a stack of 5 flasks instead of the single one they're going to use. The hardcore probably use 150-200g if they clear it in a night without wipes. The good guilds will use around 500g in a full clear if they take two nights and flask for both nights (and even then, people aren't always flasking). 
---
&gt; To get those consumables, depending on class, you could spend between 4 to 6 hours every day farming them
---
The only thing that makes a bit of sense. But that's why people stockpile consumeables before the raid comes out. That way they don't have to farm for their consumeables as hard.
---
&gt; You need a lot of resistance gear (frost resistance primarily). And you can't just pick whatever green with frost resistance only, no you need to make a very expensive epic frost resistance gear that actually has some stat added along with the resistance. Those ain't cheap, and getting revered with several factions are required.
---
Again, making it sound way worse than it actually is. You can use some greens but they won't be nearly as good as the crafted gear (aside from the rings). You only need your crafter to be Exalted w/ Argent Dawn, and there's no "several factions required".
---
Then people go to Orgrimmar to get the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer world buff, which in turn requires Head of Onyxia or Head of Nefarian. Either of those requires killing Onyxia first or Nefarian from BWL.
---
That's not hardcore. ZG takes an hour. Onyxia takes 30 minutes? if you count the time it takes for everyone to get there. You're making it sound like every single player needs to kill Hakkar/Ony every week, but you just need to have 1 person that did in the raid.
---
&gt; You're not ready yet. Before going to Naxxramas, you should have at least one Warlock at level 20 with full bags of Soul Shards in order to provide yourself Soulstone, Healthstone and to summon members.
---
Complete nonsense. People don't soulstone themselves/others with alts. The healthstone would heal for 200. There's like 5 people that need a summon because their hearthstone wasn't set to LHC per raid, at most.
---
I have no coding or graphic skills (considenring the Classic WoW current goal)... However, I DO hope WoW will take such road.  
---
On top of all you said, I'd add :
---
reduce the gain per level from 60 to 70. The complete opposite of what happened in TBC. So the previous content isn't obolete anymore (I hated that when TBC went live).
---
That strat takes way too long and only serves as a bandaid for having bad players that can't move when they are the bomb for some reason.
---
Have you seen a boomkin with winterfall firewater + growth potion? The most magnificent creature to showcase in any guild progression pictures!
---
Which processors can't run Apex?
---
jcb088 casts wall of text. it's super effective! no but really, thanks for that. I still wish I were able to binge, but I'm not giving up my kidsc education for that, I know what you mean.
---
So are you wanting it BoP until zg patch? Because that's what no changes means. Experiencing the game they way it was at the time. Having it tradeable would COMEPLETELY change both the hardcore AND casual raid prep, as well as money making methods, market, and overall use of consumables to something COMEPLETELY different than what it was like on launch and all the way up to 1.7....
---
He need some milk
---
This wasn’t on Azjol’nerub EU was it?
---
I think a huge amount of people will take a look at it, as long as they are aware that it exists. Probably the majority of people who used to play.  I was watching some folks play an unrelated game on Twitch, and they suddenly brought up WoW and upcoming Classic.
---
However I believe only a small fraction of that will be people who stick around for long. And an even smaller fraction will be those who never played it. 
---
Yes
---
i know ,just adding context in case anyone else scrolling by didnt know
---
Even in fights where there isn't a direct mechanic like a aoe breath hitting the raid, pulling aggro can really fck shit up.   
---
Now your tank is fighting to get aggro back instead of actually pushing his lead over other DPS. Meanwhile other dps are probably still dpsing because they are bad and they are also getting further ahead of the tank. Alternatively they have to stop DPS and if you are too slow to dps in alot of fights you will just wipe eventually for one reason or another. Healers are having to heal all sorts of DPS that are pulling aggro, putting stress on their mana. Lots of bad things happen when someone pulls agggro.
---
Omen of Clarity = Clearcasting
---
It's the same buff, really, just procs differently, and Warlocks can't life tap if they don't have life to spare. Someone has to heal their lost HP before they get tickled and keel over. So it's not much of a gain.
---
they will be BoP until phase 4 man
---
As someone who plays a shaman, yes of course this would be dope (I’m pro resto or ele, but still). However, this opens the floodgates for everyone to complain about reworks. But as you say, it’s all within the vanilla lifespan. It’s a more dodgy issue without the clear cut weakness in the “give pallies a taunt” argument (that ability didn’t exist in vanilla). 
---
They’ll probably just do 1.12 as it’s less gray zones for them to navigate. I’m cool with it. We all know enhance is for leveling. 
---
Sweet :) I approve
---
As a mage you wants to go tailor/eng or tail/enchanting I rolled enchanting because my main goldfarm was soloing strat live and I would disenchant the boss loot and sell the shards was pulling over 1k gold a day in classic which is ridic money bland still owned pvp but so much more utility in pvp with eng
---
I played back from about late 2004-2009.  Then I fiddled around on some private servers.  It comes down to who you know.  Having a buddy to play with is everything!  Play complimentary classes like warrior/priest, rogue/Druid, or some crazy shaman/anything paladin/anything combo.  Find out what gear you need for your class and what dungeon it drops in and run it.  Pick a trade skill like herbalism and sell all you can in AH to get your mount. You’re going to want consumables for everything.  Pick a fight with someone open world and just try and survive, or join battlegrounds.  Get a good guild that fits your schedule and get on com’s!

A lot of vanilla knowledge. You'll get what make us old vets hype that much (you have no idea lol)

I played a lot (spent a full year at uni playing wow and almost failing my classes).  
---
Things that will catch you off guard is likely the long walks once you hit lv30.  Your on foot until lv40, and your quests are world traveling.  Not to mention getting riding skill and mount is something you need to save for.  (100g).  
---
Flightpoints and grave yards are few and spread out.  
---
Example dying in the world boss in Blastedlands and your in for a 6-7min Corps run.  
---
Another thing that will get you off guard is how hard/long instances are. Expect ~2h runs.  
---
Another is running to instances. You need 3ppl in the pug to run to the instance to summon the rest. Don’t be the jerk who don’t run.  
---
Class quests around lv 20.  Do them. Don’t be the paladin who didn’t do the resurrection quest.  
---
Flight points.  It takes 17min from darnassus to the fp near dire Maul.  It was faster to buy a portal to sw fly to bb and take the boat to ratchet and a flyer.  
---
You’re first priority is a pair of boots with speed ench on.  At lv40 spurs for another pair of boots.  And the carrot quest reward from zf.  
---
Learn to love SM it’s quite fast at lv 35-40 and drop good loot 
---
Ah yes Xantim, I recently watched his pvp video again the other day! It was one of the reasons I rolled an Undead Spriest near the end of vanilla.
---
Dps pull aggro from dragon : breath, boom half the raid is dead.
---
Ranged dps pull aggro from boss that do aoe damage/stun : boom healers dead.
---
Dps pull aggro from a boss that have a nasty ability that only the tank can survive and you need to avoid with line of sight. boom whole raid dead.
---
I think this idea is equally as valid as people asking for earlier versions of AV -- after all, it *was* in Vanilla, so it qualifies as not being a change, and I think on a smaller scale, reasonable individuals could agree that it's not a wild suggestion.
---
What I dislike about it is that it sort of comes across as a special concession.  It's "special treatment" for Shamans in the most literal sense of the phrase, and it would give every single other person out there somewhat justifiable cause to start asking for even more tweaks and compromises until we end up in some weird conglomerated 1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12 Frankenpatch.
---
Early on, the team said they wanted to do Vanilla as it was, "for better or for worse."  This, in my opinion, is maybe just one of those unfortunate things that is going to fall through the cracks of the "worse" side of that.
---
&gt;Old baguettes can be used as a mace.

Isn't it historically accurate that some dried breads can be hard as rocks or something?

OCEANIC LFG!
---
Yo looking for an oceanic oz/nz leveling/60 dungeon buddy,
---
Planning on rolling troll priest so ideally looking for a warrior or maybe warlock leveling buddy. Will be looking at a 6-8 hours per day in the first 2 weeks of launch to get to (or close to) 60 and start pre raid bis and gold farming. 
---
I have leveled to 60 3 times so far so I bring a decent amount of exp to the table but my priorities are having fun out in the world (pvp), dungeons et cetera. not interested in 100% efficiency but not screwing around either :)
---
So of your an aus/nz player looking forward to that low ping making warrior playable, hit me up!!!! 
---
Guild Leaders GF 
---
Naxx is in the tbc one ;)
---
&gt;if you are that bad then you are replaceable
---
Agreed completely, however without LFR it means pinging local/trade/group or everyone hitting thier guilds, finding someone who fits the party without overlap, has the gear, the attunement, the consumables, and is ready for a summon or at least close enough, might be enough of a chore that keeping that person in the party with the hopes they'll sort it out might be the better option
---
Why should shamans be the only ones to get special treatment if you want to go down that road?
---
Clearcasting procs in your rotation from range, omen does not.  If you think they are the same, this isn't a worthwhile discussion.
---
Lol i had the same idea. Logged on my old MC/BWL orc shaman, equipped my vanilla t1/t2 gear/jewelry only amd rode to Ogrimmar center. :)
---
But man the deception seeing all of my totems vanished! Where are my totems?
---
I din't even play, logged out in frustration.
---
First time I ever went to Ironforge I was getting framerates between 0.2 and 2 FPS. Pentium 3 1Ghz, 256 MB RAM, MX400 graphics card. Felt bad-ass, man.
---
Dude you were on a decent machine if you had a frame rate that high
---
If by "too long" you mean the time it takes to pull him down the corridor to Garr's room, then sure.  It's not my preferred (because of the bandaid effect you mentioned) strat but it doesn't add any meaningful time to the encounter.    
---
[&gt; I need to prepare for release **in few months**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MR5xe1z-eU)
---
I love lamp.
---
Raid symbols were added in 1.11, they were indeed part of vanilla (but a very late addition)
---
2.5 FPS? Definitely from the mid-2000's.
---
In the early days, the game would freeze at a frame for several seconds when I entered Ironforge. But my character would keep moving during this. When the client had finished loading in all the other players, I was in the trench. I had to upgrade my RAM to avoid this.
---
Nah, this is all Shattered Hand US.
---
Good thing warriors are abundant. 
---
RP PvP server are generally devoid of any actual role players these days since most have left to roll the big three servers. They look more populated than normal RP servers because while the role players have left the anti role players have never had any reason to move because there’s no excuse disrupting an RP event on a PvE server like there is for a PvP one.
---
I used to take both mines as my feral Druid could take em.   Stealth bleed on the just go bear and bash em to death.  But towers by you needed more.  
---
Av was a AoE power fiesta.  
---
&gt;More like /join WorldDefense
---
Actually i did some research and I'm pretty sure world defense wasn't added until burning crusade. I can't find any proof of it existing earlier. I used it the most in TBC but I wanna know if it was implemented pre 2.0
---
Undo AP normalization for rogues please. :-)
---
What I did/plan to do is try and keep level appropriate weapons with me. You’ll always have quests with easier mobs to kill, at this point switch to your less skilled weapon and grind a bit. 
---
You could iq 300 this and couple it up with any +int pieces you have. If a quest rewards items which aren’t ideal, either pick the highest vendor item or pick the one with useable int. put it on whilst doing the above tip and it’ll be faster so you can get back to your main gear asap 
---
Halo 1/2 - yes
---
Everything is slower. The leveling takes a lot longer, but you really get a sense for the scope of the world when you have to actually walk anywhere that you want to go. The normal person will only ever have blues and greens when they are leveling, and most casual players won't have any crazy gear even at 60. This makes it really special and unique when you see people with end game armor or weapons - If 98% of everyone else has relatively average, drab gear, then the top people really stand out. I'd also totally gawk at other people who managed to get a piece of gear that has eluded me despite tons of dungeon runs (Shadowcraft shoulders were my dream, lol) To add more to the walking example, even once you reach 60, it's a pretty huge grind to finally get 1000g for your epic mount. I know people have tons of strategies for making gold today, but back then at least it seemed like a big achievement for a casual player. I also feel like there was a strong sense of faction identity from server to server, and it was common for high level players to come to the aid of players who were being harassed by the opposite faction. I got the impression that once TBC came out most people went into more of an "auto-level" mindset, where there wasn't a lot of working together or interacting with others on quests. Not sure if it's like this now or not, but I remember frequently grouping with randos who were farming the same quest kills so that we could work together and both benefit, which often led to longer unofficial questing sessions where we'd work together for most of the zone. Also, each class had very defined strengths and weaknesses - I was super confused when I logged into my 70 Hunter this weekend (first time in years) and saw that I had a 30% heal ability... What!? Anyways, those are some ramblings. I think a lot of people will come into Classic with pre-defined specs, quest routes, macros, etc. (myself included) but in early vanilla, all of these were far outside the scope of an average player who clicked abilities, chose gear that looked cool, didn't worry too much about stats, and had never heard the word "meta".
---
I spent so much time wiping on Vass I started to have dreams about the fecker. Almost broke my guild but in the end we got him and it was a transcendent moment. 
---
The only other guild that could do BWL on my server 2 shotted him and spent and spent 5 weeks on Chromaggus. We spent 6 weeks on Vass, 2 shotted Chromaggus and killed Nef 2 days before they did. BWL was wired ... oh and fuck the suppression room.    
---
ok. I remember mana regen before level 10 getting buffed in a big way during TBC, but I don't recall it being good in Vanilla.
---
To date I have 53 various spreadsheets that I'm referring back and forth to in order to optimize my 1-60 leveling experience.
---
I have spent WAY too much time trying to make a 1-10 / 1-20 optimized route assuming a crowded launch event.
---
[Redacted] server has a fresh launch this week, and I'll finally be able to test out if my "fuck all y'all, I'm gonna go over here" route really will work within a crowded launch environment, and if I can manage my 3:30 1-10 and sub 10 hour 1-20 expectations with a bunch of other people playing the same zones.
---
Aside from that... more math and more planning.
---
Welcome 
---
There was always a shortage of tanks and healers.  
---
Your missing that the pvp arms warriors is also in those numbers.  And both rippers and arms was good in pvp.  
---
Hopefully we see a beta before the summer, that is my hope atleast.
---
It takes like 1.5 seconds to slum something lol
---
As a hunter I'm skinning the mob while my pet is pulling my next kill. Adds almost no extra downtime at all 
---
I do not suggest like tier 3.5 or so, maybe a mount loot or more class specific loots to support the tier 3 or BiS for the game, or bags or any new plans for craft, even the PVP gear somehow as it was a thing in wotlk as well. You know, to have Naxx the hardest for grind but other content to enjoy wpvp or world events and maybe even encounters to deffend city and so on. QUite lot of work, but worth in the long term (PVP endgame mainly i guess + events)
---
You have to clear extra trash to make room for baron in garrs room. You have to walk back to garrs room. You have to spread out and set up the positioning. Then a hunter has to go back tp barons room , pull garr back. You essentially walk between garr and barons room 4 extra times.

I havent touched WoW for 3 years now, my body is ready for Classic.
---
Seasons like Diablo would be interesting. Except maybe only a new reset everything 1-2 years.

That’s a really good point! And people have a better grasp of how much easier to group as a desirable role. I remember making my very first character I just picked an undead warrior because that’s what struck my fancy on the character create screen.
---
Hey, sorry for the late reply. I think I obtained it from abandonware. I am looking for it there right now, but it appears to be both ToD and BtDP. Not the battle.net edition version. Let me keep looking
---
classic is my church
---
Baksheesh?
---
I tried playing horde, I really did. Several times.
---
I just can't. I just enjoy the feel of the alliance leveling experience much more.
---
Yeah, my main concern is that I’ve noticed while leveling weapon skill is generally 5 less than cap, so if I use 1 weapon, I’ll always be nearly capped. 
---
Just out of curiosity, why are you avoiding west coast servers? I live on the west coast and I was planning on choosing a PST realm for the day/night cycle, playing with potential IRL friends, and maybe playing with Aussies if they don't release oceanic realms.
---
Well said, and I totally agree. I really hope this will be a breath of fresh air for gamers, and a wake up call for developers.
---
HOMM3 is literally the best game of all time. ALL. TIME.
---
I think it has alot to do with the way the industry as evolved since then. There's tons of money to be made and so naturally things will move towards safer investments and less towards the crazy, original games that we saw back in the 90s and early 2000s. I mean, there were plenty of great games back then but there were some REAL stinkers too.
---
Only graphics improved. Actual game design is horrible now. The industry employs psychologists to design games now not be fun but to be addictive and get more money out of you through microtransactions etc. All this greed is utterly destroying gaming.
---
Welp, my memory has been shit all day.  Thanks.

Forget a lot of names but let me try:
---
Hidrosactum - a female undead Warlord (not sure if high warlord) that would always dominate the AV damage score
---
Olympia - a female Night Elf druid that was a Grand Marshal, but it took forever for her/him to get there. I remember some horde intentionally feeding and thorlwing /hug and I and a lot of other Horde were super excited when Olympia finally got rank 14
---
Redcommet and Blackjelly - the infamous, crazy Italian undead mage raid leader and his female undead priest girlfriend. Dude was super hated on the server so the only calibre of raiders he could get were 15 year old retards (like me) who he would yell and and curse at on teamspeak.
---
Eggbert - undead warrior tank who was the maintank for Redcommets raid, for whom Redcommet had to borrow a bunch of arcanite and money from another guild ro build Thunderfurry. 1 week later or less after crafting thunderfurry the dude quits wow (prolly sold his account) so it was MAJOR realm drama.
---
Tower - holy paladin in tier 2 that I have fought hundreds of times on my Tauren Warrior but have never ever seen die once
---
Night elf warrior - forget his name, but dude was infamous for just staying in shadowmeld in WSG until someone was in execute range. Charge, kill, runaway and repeat. Dude was always bottow of damage yet top of killing blows. Everyone hayed him.
---
Female Night Elf shadow priest - I dont remember the name, starts with a X i think, that would absolutely destroy everyone not anywhere close to high end gear. Was the bane of existance for all pvp scrubs on horde side. Was a famoua facemelter.
---
Yeah, my mage is wearing Faith as well. Except the halo, it’s the one piece I don’t have yet. Priests are fine because they can wear the wrath naxx versions, but the t3 is the only one for mage and warlocks.
---
And attack speed normalization for warriors plz. 
---
Okay, azjol’nerub had a very special coordinated PvP scene and the way you described it, made me remember some old times I roll in WSG premade on Tuesday evenings to keep my Sargent rank before I left the server to play on an RP one. I was only invited to this premade because I was a half decent flag defender and that I played battle grounds with many of the crew when they were still lowly blood guard. 
---
Yep, there’s a ret Paladin reading the 1.2.2 patch notes (below) and thinking “they’d better do the same for me then”
---
&gt; Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active.This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that was unintended. 
---
Nah,slippery slope for more changes
---
This could be applied to 1.12's Cross Realm Battlegrounds being a feature as well, cementing it as a guaranteed feature of classic.
---
Many people argue vehemently that it should not be a part of Classic at all, despite being included in 1.12 "warts and all".
---
There is a precedent already set for the Classic team to pick and choose things they decided to be inluded in Classic.  Things that haven't existed within Vanilla's lifespan should not be included at all within Classic, but there are already examples of essentially a "frankenpatch" for Classic.
---
But I’m a melee hunter without a pet.  That’s how  I want to play.  /s

Shan yu was my favorite Disney villain growing up.
---
"How many Alliance does it take to deliver a message?"
---
If you have a decent amount of attack power and crit, with a good two-hander, you can easily 1 shot any clothie. You're probably the only class to do that, and you want more?
---
Heresy
---
These answers are horrible, listen up. Use a dps meter and if the ret paladin is on top they deserve the upgrade. Not all warriors are good players. Getting sick of this classic meta, ruining the fun for everyone. Get off your high horses people.
---
Im after a bad breakup from a six year relationship. I need Classic so bad. I just want it pumped into my veins.
---
They should just fix the most absolutely broken ones, but let everything else work.
---
I'm not. I'm avoiding Chicago servers because I live in the west coast and want lower. Latency 
---
Isn't this from Warcraft 3 / Frozen Throne by repeatedly clicking the character? I've never heard it in World of Warcraft
---
You will rely a lot more on the other players to accomplish your goals, and accomplishing your goals will have a much sweeter feeling.
---
When I was sick of warlords of draenor some guy in trade chat kept talking about Nostalrius and why it’s a better game. Since Wrath I had always come back to wow because of great memories only to find myself bored within a week.
---
I downloaded and tried Nost, and after two weeks I completely understood why I had originally loved the game and what I hated about retail. Since then I can’t enjoy retail anymore. I had to re learn vanilla all over again it was amazing and fun. The nostalgia wore off and it was still my go to game. Hell im still learning stuff about the game... 14 years later.
---
I would bet MANY other people who didn’t want to try private servers will have a similar experience.
---
Hey Tiranouse. Our guild Vicious Cycle is looking for heals. Raid times are scheduled to be 8-10est tues/wed/thu. We in need of an active healer who can level quick so we can start gearing at 60 asap. Come to our discord  https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX 
---
You could only set them in Vanilla if you were in a group AND were the party leader.  (Think that was also true in TBC).  
---
I came in late in Vanilla and I always remember them existing.
---
Warlock tier sets are the best looking in the game. If you're a hardcore raider and know you'll be getting those sets, it's hard to go gnome.
---
The dwarf joke was because it's a drug reference.
---
\`Plenty of great games these days still but it depends on taste I guess?  I liked most of the ones you listed but recent games like Witcher 3, Divinity OS2, Thea the awakening, etc are very enjoyable as well.  And then in between there are also things like Path of Exile, Bioshock 3, etc.
---
So no I wouldn't say the games were better.  They were/are/will be many great games just as there will be many terrible games along side them.  MMORPGs are at a bit of a rough spot for me personally but I have hopes for Pantheon but that will have to wait and see.
---
Ha. I'm gonna level balance, but think I'll save ironman for a hunter.
---
Are you even allowed to take talents in ironman? I can't totally remember the rules.
---
What?
---
I remembered getting some of the world buffs people had discussed, but when people were talking about always having Dragonslayer and DM buffs.... Private server "meta" has really warped what people think classic raiding will be like.
---
I don't understand. Wait... I'm french
---
Holy tree, not holy school.
---
You can use any Discipline or Shadow spells.
---
My fondest memories of vanilla were fishing stonescale eels with my buddies on the weekends before raids 
---
This was my first raid so I had to tweak stuff all through trash, was able to get 5-10fps, def was playable but man those days were tough, hard to convince my parents to get me a highend pc as a 16 year old
---
But in your post you said you weren't gonna play on west coast server time. I'm talking about the timezone, not the server location.
---
I remember ZacharyJ, a lvl 29 twink pally that just shit on me and my buddies over and over in WSG. We thought it was so damn funny. His name still is brought up in conversation all these years later 
---
&gt;until we end up in some weird conglomerated 1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12 Frankenpatch.
---
I mean isn't this what we're already getting? At least until phase 6 comes out with Naxxaramas (and even then, the 1.11 phase of Naxx will be erased), the game will be some Frankenpatch of 1.12 mechanics/spells/talents with progressive content that will not be 1.12. And as far as I'm concerned, this Frankenpatch is a great thing - I think the game would be pretty much dead-on-arrival if it released in an actual 1.12 environment, where all the content is available.
---
&gt;Early on, the team said they wanted to do Vanilla as it was, "for better or for worse." 
---
Well I guess the question is, what is Vanilla? For the vast majority of Vanilla's timeframe, windfury did have double the base AP. To me, it seems fairly obvious that therefore windfury with double the base AP IS vanilla (and if we want to make comparisons, is MORE vanilla than it without). 
---
I'm not sure if you're providing an affirmative argument here that this isn't Vanilla, or are merely stating that the dev team doesn't view it as Vanilla.
---
&gt;It's "special treatment" for Shamans in the most literal sense of the phrase
---
Well perhaps you've sniffed it out, but there can be a lot more at stake here than making this change to shaman and raising them up from "shooting yourself in the head tier" to "shooting yourself in the foot tier." If we allow this in, we could effectively nerf warriors and rogues by reverting the patch 1.8 hit changes for example (and if we really felt like screwing with them, we could undue their talent revamps too, which for rogues only came in 1.12). Further, we could buff hunters by giving lupos shadow damage and by reverting the 1.10 ranged AP normalization.
---
In this sense, we wouldn't really be giving shamans special treatment, because we could actually embark on a pretty ambitious rebalancing project through the lens of just using balance that was present within Vanilla itself. Is this prospect the one that is really causing you pause?
---
I don't know about you, but I kind of doubt that casuals will be able to keep up with 3 raid nights a week while having to pop consumables worth hundreds of gold during each raid.

*[Parties and Raids now can mark targets for their party/raid in the gamefield. A party leader or raid leader/assistant can right-click the portrait of their target to select a symbol to associate with that target. All players in the party/raid will see the selected symbol over the head of the target as well as on the portrait of that target.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/g00/Patch_1.11.0#User_Interface)*
---
1.11 added a few raid/dungeon QoL things. Ready checks, raid warnings, and target of target as well.
---
Why is everyone on one extreme or th other? Naxx isn't going to be "casual" friendly. At least not by most people definition. But with the more readily available information, strategies know ect. it won't be no life exclusive content either.
---
And that makes sense, but so far the only exceptions have been with regards to content flighting or balance-agnostic changes.  Something like this would be the first step towards justifying every other class to start asking for specific versions of balance.  And if we get to a point where we have 1.2 Paladins, 1.10 Shamans, 1.x Rogues, 1.y Druids, it's not going to look anything like 1.12.
---
Haha, here's the video of that Kazzak massacre: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MmVyIbSNA&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MmVyIbSNA&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I remember the horde claimed a bunch of Azuregos kills due to location and horde solidarity. Depending when Azuregos spawned, Vehn, the main tank of Drama, would tell us not to waste our time trying to rush over in an emotionally dead voice, hah.
---
To see us both in STV again would be epic. And I think you're probably one of the few players to have really understood just how good hunter was in world PvP back then. Honestly, I loved that the average hunter just could not do shit.
---
If you're looking to min/max Ret is already the wrong answer.
---
At this point you might as well roll the for the butt you prefer staring at.
---
I like a lot of Indiegames, Rimworld and Stardew valley. But AAA games aren't games. They are a monetization platform disguised as videogames.
---
1. If you're leveling slowly, you will have no problem getting gear as you progress.
---
2. If you played Burning Crusade, it's not that far away from the vanilla experience, just remove a few abilities and ease of access mechanics like portals, flying mount and token vendors. But still a very decent games
---
The whole game is a pro. The slow leveling, the community, the difficulty and work it takes just to get one epic item. Everything is a pro
---
There is however one negative aspect in the game, and that is some classes are just meant to played a healer, even if they have DPS talent trees
---
If your aim is to get raid ready at 60 you're many times further ahead if you're lvl 59 naked than you are at lvl 50 with complete best in slot.
---
&gt; Is this prospect the one that is really causing you pause?
---
Yes, basically.
---
A game with 1.10 Shamans, 1.11 Rogues, 1.8 Warriors, etc is not 1.12.
---
I think it gives some hit benefit, but the main benefit is reducing the reduction on glancing blows. Roughly 40% of auto attacks will glance and do less damage, so reducing how much of a penalty this is, is hugely useful for pve. It’s why edgmasters are BIS for fury warriors, despite not giving any other stats beyond weapon skill. As a paladin I’d imagine weapon skill is more important as every auto can glance, whereas warriors can at least use heroic or cleave to replace autos 
---
This is hilarious
---
rested xp? ;)
---
Im sure there will be loads more than expected in the first month. But the longevity is what Im interested in. And I hope servers dont end up underpopulated/one sided. We shall see.
---
Yup, and MS is still a complete waste of a spot.
---
Horde doesn’t need another pvp buff. 
---
It's the same buff; is all I said :V
---
Heh, funny. My wife is the only IRL person I still know from those days long ago. My old IRL WoW friends have the reverse problem..... in that I'm pretty sure they've all been sitting on their asses somewhere for 15 years playing WoW/League/whatever.
---
It was weird growing up and watching several of your friends just..... not.
---
We always cleared all the trash in Garr's room anyway, so that didn't add any time.  And the trash that was at the entrance to Shazzrah's room needed to be cleared anyway, so you're not losing time killing those lava packs.  Really it's just the extra minute or so running back and forth through the corridor and extra 30 seconds for positioning.  I don't really consider that a large time expenditure, even though I prefer killing Baron at the entrance to Shazzrah's room because it *is* more efficient.
---
Though, this debate is entirely a moot point, because as to the original comment I responded to, just because the Garr room strat takes a little longer to set up is beside the point that using it means a single missed bomb move doesn't kill the whole raid.   
---
24/7 I'm in

Is july really a reasonable expectation for release? I usually expect game devs to miss their targets by a little bit at least, plus this is a unique project.

The variation in quality of games was WAY higher 15-20 years ago. The good games mostly survives, the bad games did not. Now we have in average better games, but not as much variation. So the best games from then are still better than (most of) the best games now. 
---
Rogues literally got their big overhaul in 1.12. All their talents were refunded because it was such a massive change.
---
1.12 lasted only three months and by then most players weren't even playing, instead preferring to wait for TBC to drop.
---
Literally every Rogue is going to be playing a class they didn't actually play during Vanilla, unless they played during that short window.
---
So, I mean... yeah. The devs have said 1.12 is the version they think was the best. They've never said they wanted the most representative version of Vanilla, but the best. That's always going to be subjective.
---
I may have versions incorrect, but if you’re going to give the buffed version of windfury, then surely you’d have to give the broken and near un-useable version of stormstrike? Windfury got a nerf, but storm strike became usable, which at the time was an ok trade off. Not amazing, but it worked.
---
Previously stormstrike wouldn’t give an instant attack, if would reset your swing timer to 0, so unless you had an add on or a macro set up for it and used it with precise timing, it was barely a dps increase. 
---
True but.... so is the AOE stun as a Tauren.
---
No, really though, its more that I played every class and most of the races in my time playing retail and i've done everything within like..... 85% of the best that it can be done. I've tanked/healed/dpsed raids, heroics, pvp, everything..... "pretty well".
---
For once, I want to be a fucking beast at something and identify with it. I want to be that iron juggernaut that is just a monster (both against bosses and other players). I've been an expert of all trades, and I've only really gone balls deep with Rogue PvE DPS back in the TBC/Wrath days. 
---
I'm ready to do it with tanking, and in classic.

I feel you though.
---
Yeah, need NS.

**Glamorama** **(Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!**

Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to **clear all raid content**, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
**Our background:**
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
\-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at GMT 20.00 -23.00
---
\-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
\-          Balanced raid groups
---
\-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
**What we require of raiders:**
---
\-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week for 40-man raids
---
\-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements but wish that everyone has a mature attitude. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We **strongly** believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be **“geared and cleared”** of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are also most welcome!
---
**Loot rules:** We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: *https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing*

 Hey Necro, we're going to be raiding from 8-11 est and in dire need for heals. come say hi on discord [https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX](https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX) 
---
Iron man means don't die.
---
But because retail wow is so retardedly easy, the definition of "iron man" in retail morphed into extra restrictions like "no talents, no gear, etc etc etc"
---
For me its just an endless list of stuff..... Guitar, coding, fitness, web development, reading, cooking, my wife, woodworking, etc.
---
I have so many hobbies and I have a hard time balancing them all. I'm building a house with a 3 car garage! I can't be a cave troll and just sit in one room and play WoW all damn day.
---
I believe they are viable as an off healer. Since they have totems and a few heals. But I believe they were mainly rdps. But I am not 100% sure on this. 
---
Member hellgate London? 
---
So just out of curiosity then - what's your opinion on Nostalrius's so called "Frankenpatch:" Frozen 1.12 with progressive content release (which seems to be what Blizzard is mimicking for Classic)? 
---
Because I love it, but I also played on a private server, and recognize that it might not have as broad of an appeal to people who want their experience to be as if they logged into a fresh server created in October 2006.
---
I raided as a resto shaman through half of vanilla
---
they're one of the best raid healers via chain heal
---
they're good dungeon healers as well, just bring a lot of water and don't overpull
---
Lol its not food at all. Its his melee weapon.
---
Yo Silver you need to keep posting these screenshots! Not only are they awesome but such a nostalgia trip and I also really enjoy the stories you tell in the comments. 
---
Although I'm disappointed by the lack of Zug in this one! 
---
I should have specified but 28 slot bags are not in the game at all.  Herb bags are gated with cenarian circle rep 20/24 slot so you won't get them for a long time and the 24 slot enchanting won't be out until dm.
---
Which clothie is the easiest to gear for pvp? Lock, spriest, or mage? Like many here I will have max 10 hrs/week to play. 
---
Don't even front. They're powered by necromancy. You remember that episode of the Walking Dead with the Necromancer? Yeah you do. It explained everything.
---
Resto shamans are not dps. Shamans in general are healers in pve. Why comment if you obviously have no idea what you are talking about?
---
Yeah I recall quite extensive rules for a formal Ironman challenge as far back as wotlk. Think it was this: https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronManRules
---
Looks like they're hosting a classic version too: https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronClassic
---
I can see doing a simple self-enforced permadeath as Moonkin. The ironman classic rules would be brutal as druid.
---
I've been listening to some WoW Classic podcasts.  My co-workers started one "The Classic Casual" that is pretty good and is from a casual players point of view.  They talk a bit of lore.  Another one I like is "Countdown to Classic", which is like the gold standard. 
---
&gt; The hardcore probably use 150-200g if they clear it in a night **without**wipes.
---
Yeah, but that wasn't the question. When you progress to Naxxramas, you will wipe. You're whole post is wrong because you're are taking the position of a guild who clears everything without a wipe, which really does not answer OPs question at all.
---
I have an idea. I just wasnt 100% sure. God forbid someone tries to help. 
---
Great, thank you.
---
Yeah, same for me. You need to pay a bit of attention and keep an eye on that mana but you could easily clear any of the games 5 mans. The skill ceiling is pretty high as well,  throwing out rank 1 earthshocks to interrupt mobs and abusing poison cleansing/disease totems. A lot of fun honestly and I found chain heal to be super satisfying. As for the tier 0/.5 though, you would be far better off just collecting +Healing and MP5 gear
---
The human bread vendor in Stormwind always stands so you're on his side, and the bread always looks like his dick.

So i'm just selling stuff to the weapons vendors in the trade district and i head outside and OH THERES THE BREAD GUY...... HOLDIN HIS DICK AGAI- oh wait no, that's bread.
---
Look at that vulgar thing: [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/5/53/Thomas\_Miller.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060502081354](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/5/53/Thomas_Miller.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060502081354) 
---
I never played it, so I can't comment in-depth.  But progressively releasing content is different from picking and choosing which "version" of any given class to feature.
---
Personally I am okay with it.  It's a reasonable compromise to not launch the game with a massive swamp of raid content.  And if someone wanted to make the argument that *"PvP was so much better in 1.x than in 1.12,"* I think that's an okay argument to make.  But if they are right, then the entire game should be 1.x.  Letting some classes have things from different patch versions pushes into a version of WoW that never actually existed in much more dramatic fashion than simply gating the content does.
---
&gt; If they change their mind on RP-PvP servers
---
What do you mean ?
---
Wand because you can always drink water if need be. You can't find water to kill mobs faster. Get the enchanting wand right away even if you just drop the profession right after.
---
And bubble hearthing*
---
I agree. I really loved how it had the whole we effort leading up to the opening of the gates, not to mention how weird Silithus was. Then the raid itself was so alien and different. 
---
Raiding it was rough, but boy was it ever cool
---
Mind flay is inefficient damage per mana cost until later in the game so I would advise against it until 30+ unless you have excess mana to use. Your general rotation is PW:S, Mind blast, SW:P and then wand the monster to death. Grabbing a quiver early on is very good as it also increases wand attack speed. You can also pre PW:S, wait a few seconds and then pull as it lets the debuff fall off so you can shield yourself again as soon as it drops from damage. Starting wand attack is not on the GCD so you can instantly use your wand after casting any spell. Kargoz has a great guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY but there are also many other great resources both on youtube, reddit and other sites.
---
If you target another mob even if you don’t attack and retarget your current, the Combo points are gone
---
There's no time limit on Classic like there was Vanilla.  Unless you really want to rush and push those server-first kills, you have all the time in the world to accomplish whatever you want.  So start with a Warlock, and if you hit that mid-30's rut and find yourself longing for the days of playing a Mage, you can always reroll.
---
top raid quality warriors are NOT abundant
---
The answer you gave was kinda the complete opposite from reality so donno how helpful that was...
---
Post naxx content without raising level cap. New raids. New spells/ranks only with books. Also there few ways to emplement new gear without raising pvp power: in new raids u get new sets for non pve specs like balance druid, retri paladin, +frost damage mage set, rogue set with +stealth bonuses, etc but itwm level for these sets equal to tier3. For new raid gear you require gear with specific +attack power/+spell damage vs specific creatures like vs undead for Karazhan crypts, vs demons for Hyjal, vs dragons from Grim Batol etc, without this gear raids will be impossible and this gear is not usefull for pvp. Also some bosses require resistance cap for all raid and other specific items like Onyxia scale cloak.

There is also this

Sure it's enough - but you need to find the right guild / culture for it to work. 
---
I'd suggest making your own guild to make your own schedule.
---
I did this in WotLK - we raided 2 hours a night, 3 days a week, and were able to clear all relevant content at the time.
---
You are crazy if you think you are the only guy in game that has work and a family, I'd wager 75% of the people playing this game are in the same boat; so it won't be hard to find people who are actively seeking a raiding guild on a tighter timeframe.
---
Only thing about raiding on limited hours (and why I suggest making your own guild to eforce and encourage this culture) is that everyone needs to be 100% on time, every single time. We raided at 8:00-10:00 PM (late enough to drive home from work have dinner, put kids to bed, whatever - and early enough to get some sleep for the next day), raid invites went out at exactly 8:00, we expected you to be at / near the instance, and we were clearing trash before 8:05. With such a limited time frame you can't afford to wait for flakes. 
---
The thing is we honestly don’t know how big the fraction of people who stick around will be. Like, it could be 30% for all we know, and that would be huge. We really don’t know. 
---
I think it’s entirely possible that Classic WoW will have over a million active players. I’m basing that off of the fact that there were ~800 000 players on p servers, and I doubt that the number of people playing on p servers constitute the entirety of people who enjoyed vanilla enough to keep playing it if it’s made available to them. 
---
But beyond that? No idea. Even 3-4 million wouldn’t surprise me.
---
They can apply high bust damage in pvp (more viable as alliance since you lack shaman) while still being great flag runners/defenders in AB
---
One of the big difference between old WoW and modern WoW when it comes to community is the server atmosphere.  I am very against cross server/megaserver concepts in anything that is suppose to feel like a persistent world.  
---
The reason groups are like that in modern WoW is because you click a button, get a group formed for you, and unless you add those people to your friends list you will never see them again and there is very little reason to talk.
---
In old WoW you had to talk to people to get your group set up, then travel to the dungeon in one way or another.  That act itself let you get to know them a bit and by the time you got to the dungeon, you were inclined to make it work even if it wasn't optimal.
---
Because you're only playing with the people on the server, after the group breaks, you could be talking in capital chats days or weeks later looking for whatever and you'll see those familiar names again, sometimes even getting a "hey we did x and y some time ago, wanna do z today?".
---
In the same vein, when you're out in the world you'll start to recognize the opposing faction that are wpvp enthusiasts, as opposed to retail where you'll never see the same enemy these days due to the way the open world is sharded now to.
---
They really aren't even the same game anymore due to all those little things.  I'd argue that the community is very important to an MMO and modern MMOs have put a lot of barricades in place to prevent a community from forming.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzYOqIFYaOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzYOqIFYaOY) Yeah so this doesn't happen to you early on while leveling.
---
The demo should not be used as any kind of comparison to vanilla.
---
Also: they have a working 1.12 client. Normally when you test, you don’t necessarily know if something is a bug or working as intended. 
---
Having a reference client on hand should make that decision much, much, much simpler.
---
I’m with you on that tbh.
---
Maybe people will be able to make some addons to recreate that text option you’re hoping for? With classic using the more malleable engine, it might be easy to tweak those kinds of options for you 
---
Before they were part of the game there were addons that let you use them aswell. I THINK DBM had them.... or bigwigs? 
---
Old but gold - choose a class by tier sets which you are gonna get. So back in the day I was a useless retri paladin but with a great shinny armor. It took crazy ammount of effort to play mage and drop it on 48 just to rerroll to warrior. End up vanilla as a guild main tank. Cleared everything and was happy as hell.
---
&gt; I can see doing a simple self-enforced permadeath as Moonkin
---
I'm planning on doing the iron man without any shapeshifting, actually. That means no cat stealth or armor buffs from bear and moonkin.
---
Doing iron man in Classic without talents is overkill. Doing it with white gear only is overkill. Classic is already unforgiving enough.
---
Now I can see a gear restriction with only gear that you craft or find in a drop... i.e. no help from other people or the AH. If you level tailoring with cloth drops that you get, you should be able to wear crafted gear. 
---
Lol shamans are the best dungeon healer by far. You have a self-ress if you wipe and that's HUGE. You have a fast powerful heal with lesser healing wave and and effective healing wave and you have aoe healing with chain heal. Your heals buff tank with extra armor on crit. You can buff melee with windfury and you can break fears with tremor totem and you can interrupt casters and use grounding totem. You also have an aoe slow totem and a frost shock slow so you can kit mobs if you get aggro.
---
Ming is mostly forgotten but some of the big modern 'personalities' became known back then in his blogs and videos like Hafu and Reckful. I'm not saying they owe their success to him at all, but he definitely curated the esport community at a time when it was a joke just from passion and it's pretty crazy how it has grown in the decade since.
---
Seems like you never played WoW. I don't know how much you can help

/cast Aimed Shot
---
I think they know the pressure of making sure it works and is polished at launch which is why they are temporarily adding sharding. My guess is they have no idea of the longterm success of the game or how many players it will keep. Just think since it’s tied to sub numbers at least a million subs will be added for people playing on private should everyone migrate. 
---
I'm on board with no flying mounts. That really was the beginning of the end of WoW for me. 
---
Now there are race cars with sidecars ffs. 
---
I"m playing a private TBC server, and Magic Arena :)
---
&lt; NA Server &gt;
---
To all my fellow vanilla ice cream lovers:
---
I’m looking to get a solid 5-10 people to group with to get to 60 together, crushing levels, the old but gold content, as well as some alliance bums along the way. 
---
At the moment, everyone who has experience and is dedicated that 60 grind is welcome 🙏. And if this goes past the initial 10 people I might consider making this into a guild.
---
I will be rolling an undead priest, I have up to original AQ 40 experience in pve and rank 11 in pvp. 
---
Will be making a discord channel as well in the upcoming days. Looking forward to playing with y’all!
---
You're wrong.
---
I've played on three different classic servers over the past 6 years. I still come back to it, even if I know everything. I'm also super hyped about classic now.
---
You're **dead** wrong
---
Prefer desolace either way 😂 love that side of the world. 
---
But why do you want 1.12 specifically?
---
Will you allow yourself talents?
---
Absolutely. I mained Resto in vanilla and both off-healed and main healed. Chain heal is fantastic and talents make main healing viable. Besides, even if they were terrible healers they'd still have raid spots because of totems. 
---
Biggest issue is mana but it's vanilla so nothing new there.  Resto is basically the only viable raiding spec in vanilla.
---
We even had Thotbott with a search function. You could EASILY find the best in slot for any item slot within 5 minutes of searching.
---
I think they mean no changes as in only make the changes as they happened in vanilla. We are ok with it starting bop and changing to boe after ZG because that’s what happened in vanilla. That’s still no changes. We don’t mean no changes ever. If it changed during vanilla it should change at the same time in classic.
---
&gt;  It took crazy ammount of effort to play mage 
---
?? its one of the most casual classes
---
so mage was hard but then you played warrior tank XD
---
Scenario; I'm a druid levelling feral, collecting int pieces to heal dungeons. I'm doing the Library. Illusionary rod drops. The Mage and warlock both need it. It would certainly help me healing dungeons, but it's not my primary spec. Would needing it be a dick move? If so, when would it not be a dick move? When only one of them needed it? When none of them needed it?
---
If you played a TBC private server, than the 1-60 should be exactly the same as you remembered it, minus the blood elves, dranaei, and ally shamans/horde pallys. That is, unless the private server you played had some kind of bonus XP Perk or something
---
I am extremely excited about the possibility of them adding new content to classic WoW.  I'm also dreading the very real possibility that they'll take the easy route and move to TBC.
---
did you just have a stroke
---
Ragefire chasm for transmog or solo old raids for mounts while waiting for the LFR queue to pop
---
Yes, definitely. I still want to enjoy playing the character. Not dying in Classic is going to be challenging enough.
---
Dude most of us are planning how much time we can get off work to no life the first week or two, I think we all zoomed right past stages 1-5, and are in stage 6: preparation.
---
Yeah. Should be interesting. Planning to blog/record/stream?
---
Play Warcraft III if u haven't already. It's a good lead up to WoW and it's what Blizzard fans would have been playing before WoW dropped.
---
It's also one of the best RTS games and a perfect example of Blizzard at their very best.
---
Uh
---
Is there anything more humiliating than being killed by a chicken ?
---
As far as I can tell, it doesn't appear to be. The pieces themselves don't seem to be class locked. I have no idea what would happen though if you had more than 1 set of Tier 0 bracers in your inventory when you started the quest though. Plus you could only get one set, since the quest isn't repeatable. 
---
Oops. Looks like you posted to the wrong sub. These aren’t options in classic. 
---
&gt; Because you're only playing with the people on the server, after the group breaks, you could be talking in capital chats days or weeks later looking for whatever and you'll see those familiar names again, sometimes even getting a "hey we did x and y some time ago, wanna do z today?".
---
That's the big one, right there. You see many people over and over, so you actually *do* things with them. And shared experience is how humans build connections. I'm sure some of the random players I've run dungeons with in the past few days are great people, but I have no way to connect with them.
---
I am fully aware that my opinions of vanilla are altered through my nostalgia, but my classes are not rose-tinted on this. The community was better because the game design allowed a community to form.
---
Depends on your class in terms  of efficiency.  As a mage I usually opt for instance grinding, when fresh 60 solo SM runs for silk/mageweave for some pretty easy money.  After gearing up I would be aoe farming in Dire Maul until ZG is open, then into there for solo farming of coins/bijous.
---
Consider that resto shaman is the only viable shaman spec for raiding at 60. So the answer is yes.
---
This is a non issue, so don't worry.  You can change the text files yourself to any font you like.  If it's not what you want then change it.  If it's not perfect then you'll be among others that are sharing the originals so you can just drag and drop.  You don't even need an addon.
---
Source: I changed my fonts all the way up through Cata when I quit.  So did many other famous players like Boneshock and Gameking.
---
And before some ignorant clown comes in here, it's not bannable.
---
Something I think people here should think about is this.  With all of the changes to the plan we were given at blizzcon due to community feedback, what do you think is going to happen 6 months from release when the forums are overrun with complaints of how OP warriors/rogues/mages are (because they are), and how much other classes suck.
---
If Classic is half as successful as people hope, this is going to be something the devs are going to have to deal with.  I played in Vanilla, and I remember how loud people were then about class issues.
---
There are a ton if places and ways to farm.  Which are best depends on your class and if you are solo or grouped up.  My plan is farming an area that also lets me grind out rep.  2 birds, 1 stone.
---
My server (Aerie Peak-US) had some notorious people.
---
Maces.. a mace-spec pvp rogue who had been in a really good hardcore guild that transferred before I started playing vanilla, and stuck around when that guild quit.   He would join world PvP groups and get DKs and piss everyone off.
---
Dinka &lt;Avalon&gt; - the scarab lord on alliance.. i was horde
---
Then there were all the players in BGs from the same battlegroup, not my server.. all the guys from High Caliber and other high end guilds on Kel'thuzad.  Also Sylesta and Cures the rogue/priest combo I was terrified of in BGs.  I was so obsessed with them I spent years checking their 2v2 arena ratings in BC/WOTLK/etc.
---
Also some SUPER high end PvP people like Capslock Crew members Inactive, Helldridge, etc. were on my battlegroup.. thankfully on my side!
---
Some people with good memories here.  I don't even remember the name of the first server I played on or the name of the guild I was in even though we raided a lot.  I do remember some epic 1-on-1 pvp battles I had with a rogue because every day for weeks we farmed black dragon scales in the same place.  He was the reason I dropped freezing traps every few feet and would shoot a flair before pulling lol.
---
Got to give the druid https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22632
---
&gt;Very good in world PvP
---
so is mage tho
---
&gt; There's no time limit on Classic like there was Vanilla. 
---
yep its feasible to get multiple characters well geared
---
Human warrior (port, fury/prot when later tiers drop) LF guild. PvE preferably. 
---
I'm looking for a guild that will want a person that will try to progress in raiding somewhat hardcore. I have plenty of vacation time when classic drops, and I want to level and get my pre-40 man BiS as quick as possible. I will be making sure I get my consumables and make sure that I have my shit together. I wouldn't mind having someone to level with, that way it could go smoother.
---
If you want to reach me, I can be PM'd here or I can be reached with Battlenet: Tenkman#1847 or discord: Tenkman1#3914
---
The Elusive Top Kek Warrior... Truly an endangered species. XD
---
To be honest, the "unusable" version of Storm Strike should also go with the unnerfed WF, since it required smarter timing to use properly to get the hit in without resetting the swing timer in an undesirable way.
---
I'd be fine with that.
---
At least it's easy to rebuild if it ever BURNS TO THE GROUND!
---
I'll be sure to look out for Thomas Miller next time I'm in Stormwind on my druid. :D
---
Shaman are so effective at raid healing that Horde can actually afford to run less healers than Alliance in AQ40/Naxx, bringing additional DPS which slightly evens out the RDPS disparity with how good Blessings are. A Shaman+Warrior can just duo a fair number of dungeons (DME jump runs being the most efficient one early on). They are arguably the best instance healers, with built-in wipe prevention, Totems being most effective in 5-man content, and a very versatile kit in general. 
---
Population will impact your ability to find a guild or acquire gear.  But, I wouldn't let that stop you from playing the class you enjoy.
---
If you want less competition then play Shaman, Hunter, or Druid.
---
I really hope so! I actually have a few friends who dabble in .lua so i'll definitely relay this suggestion to them, because i need this to get a true authentic experience.  
---
Heck, i'd even use it in any retail version of the game, if i ever step foot outside of Classic :P
---
It was 1x xp, so as original, but most stuff wasnt scripted and server was small popularity but we know each other very well. It wasnt retail but nice memories. Maybe we can recreate feeling with classic release
---
Ah I see, was just a thought. 
---
I heard that school is hard to get into on account of the bubble encasing the whole thing.
---
north east cave in wpl
---
Play what you want to play. The reason those classes are played a lot is because they are strong. You will have a better time getting into stuff as a mage or rogue versus something like a ret pally.
---
It’s worth noting that there are generally less raid spots available for the less popular classes. You may have less competition, but also less demand. 
---
Right?? The whole time in the Demo i was fuming telling my friends that this is wrong.. to which they responded, you're imagining things.
---
Slow is good. I lately played RDR2 and awesome experience because slowness, feeding character, sleep, hunt etc etc. I read some people dont like when game is slow,because they have little time and want invest better, but where is rush? 
---
cons
---
tediousness
---
did I mention how grindy it is?
---
Hey! I resemble that comment! 
---
&gt; No flying mounts.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; No new races. 
---
I think perhaps a more realistic answer to flying mounts is to make it extremely expensive. Think about it in terms of the real world, who owns jets and airplanes? Only the richest, the 1% of the 1%. So I think the same standard should apply. I am curious as to why you say there should be no new races?
---
Not really sure why, but in vanilla on my first character I used to solo the elite mobs at Ruins of Scarlet Enclave in EPL to pay for my level 60 mount. I think I would clear the whole place out a couple times then go and vendor all the trash. Was like 11-12 years old at the time and maybe someone in my old guild told me that was a solid place to farm gold. I was a noob.
---
Nice. Flying isnt con in my opinion. At least people interact and wpvp feels alive.
---
What’s great about there?
---
So I might get gear quicker with, say, a druid, but I'll get to do the content more often with a mage?
---
They were in vanilla but also not having them was awful. "OK, Warlock 1, /assist me, this is your Garr add target. Got it? OK, Warlock 2, /assist me, this is your Garr add target." One at a time so everyone had their jobs. It was just terrible design to not have lucky charms. 
---
The first 3D Zelda, Ocarina of Time, maxed out at 20 FPS. I can't remember people complaining about that, that was pretty normal at the time.
---
And by the time you're in MC, it's too late to bail out anyway.
---
They don’t have a hard taunt and have mana issues in extended fights. I’d bet you won’t find a raid spot as tank MT or OT.  
---
That being said, you could make it work in low man content.
---
&gt;Letting some classes have things from different patch versions pushes into a version of WoW that never actually existed in much more dramatic fashion than simply gating the content does.
---
Hmm, maybe I can convince you otherwise.
---
If your point is that content gating as opposed to balance changes would be a more "dramatic departure" from WoW as it was in 1.12... then I ask you to step into the shoes of the person who went into a coma in 2006 and came back just in time for Classic's release. (I think Blizzard used a similar analogy with somebody logging in as if no time had passed).
---
Which do you think is going to surprise him more?
---
1) That he's probably going to have to wait over a year for some raids (AQ and Naxx) to be available? That even that entry level raid that he pugged all the time (ZG) probably won't be available for 8-10 months, and BWL would only be available shortly before that. Hell, he might not even have access to any of the battlegrounds that he queued all day for, or even the honor system. And if he was playing a paladin or warlock, he's going to have to wait to get his epic mount because DM is closed (and if he's a mage or hunter, his farming route will be massively curtailed). [And though he probably doesn't notice, a lot of items are unavailable for a year as well]. 
---
Or 
---
2) Some of the damage output numbers of various specs for certain classes is changed. 
---
Now look, I played Vanilla WoW, but I was also like 13 at the time, so my perception might be skewed. But I certainly remember all the new content releases that I had access to over time, and in comparison cared very little about any balance changes (though to be fair, I wasn't really checking the patch notes, but instead paying more attention to the announcement of new content hype videos).
---
But to me, the answer seems obvious. Gating content will not only feel like a much more significant change from 1.12 than any balance change, but it would also be much more likely to piss me off if I was "just coming out of a coma kid." I mean seriously, imagine you were playing back then, and Blizzard announces a patch 1.13. And in 1.13, they make some balance changes, but also remove all raids besides MC and Ony, remove dire maul, remove a bunch of items, and remove all battlegrounds. Which do you think is going to feel more like a departure from WoW as it was? The loss of the content, or the balance changes?
---
&gt; Yes they do, when you're wiping on the easiest wing because you're trying to progress.
---
Nobody wiping on the easiest wing of Naxxramas will be "dedicated" to the point of soulstoning themselves with alts. Stop deluding yourself. The people hardcore enough to do those things aren't going to need the soulstones.
---
You're giving terrible advice and purposefully saying misleading like "bringing 800g worth of consumes to raid", conveniently not mentioning that you are barely going to use a quarter of that if you go hard on every pull, or outright false statements like "getting revered with several factions are required" which are straight up misinformation.
---
&gt; Read OPs post and stop belittling people who actually gives answers
---
You're giving a completely misleading answer, which is why I'm correcting it.
---
If anything you may enjoy the classic experience more, with everything working as intended and a massive amount of players. Community really does mean everything in a game like WoW
---
I can only speak for leveling dungeons, but there are only two classes that are sought out for dungeons: warriors and mages.  You need a healer, but people aren't picky about which healer they get (some don't like druids because they don't have a rez).
---
Depends what you're concerned about. For levelling 5 mans I'd say mage has a fair advantage over every other dps, but in general it's still a dps so you have to expect a fair wait and organising to get in a 5 man.  
---
For raiding I wouldn't be too concerned, really everyone's on a pretty level playing field trying to get a raid slot with the exception of healing paly or shaman which you can rarely have enough of. Mostly getting a raid slot just comes down to finding a guild that you're comfortable with, having regular high attendance and meeting their consumable requirements. Whether they're desperate for another warlock or hunter or rogue is really complete luck, the fact one is 12% or 10% realm class popularity really makes almost no difference.  
---
My tips... 
---
Your main's professions: skinning and herbalism. 
---
Make one bank alt, get to level 5. Enchanting and alchemy. The alchemy is just a plus for early level pots, the low level herbs used in them won't go for much anyway. 
---
Vendor light and medium leather if the AH doesn't offer a good price, but always AH heavy and thick. Those will always be bought unless the market is temporarily flooded. 
---
Disenchant and AH the mats from all boe greens your main gets. 
---
Don't train all your skills. Get rank 1 of everything you can, and decide as you play which ones you don't really need. 
---
Make an effort to get honored with your faction and PVP rank 3, for a total discount of 20%. That's 20g saved, and the earlier you get these the more money you save on everything else. 
---
Don't do any mob grinding for money til 35+, there's a spike in vendor trash value that makes any grinding before kind of a waste in terms of time:money. What you heard is true, if you really are desperate for funds you can probably do a pure mob grind from 36-40 and make the full cost if you're in a good grinding spot. 
---
I most likely will not raid and if I do it’ll be as a dps
---
Holy shit
---
Yeah, I’d give up too
---
Yes. Melee DPS take the brunt of the nature damage volley thrown out by Huhu (hence soakers), so they needed it the most in order to survive.
---
Anvilmar NA here. I remember who you are talking about.
---
I believe he was in the same guild where a gnome rogue had tanked Fel Reaver (Tempest Keep) down from 15% to 0 when their main tank died.
---
Boss is like ”uuuh cough cough, i suddenly have this weird disease as well, I better go out too and take some time off”
---
Darn skippy
---
DPS meter and there's a button at the minimap. I think that's the old CT button.
---
The bar is default as far as I can tell. There's a button in the middle of it, but that is below, and I think it's one of the handles to drag CT widgets around with.
---
There's also a "Send Page" button. No idea what that is.
---
Ahh, those both make sense. What about the Spul Bag?
---
If, as you join you state your intent, there shouldn't be a problem, if someone has issue with that, find another group
---
I feel like a lot of the private server community plays it because it’s free. I’m sure some people will switch and pay for a sub but I’m wondering what percentage that will be. 
---
Great info, thanks a bunch!
---
&gt;non-consensual 
---
So what you are saying is "Raping with authority" the other faction. I like it.
---
Mage is best in lower gear because of the inate control, they are all equally as easy/hard to gear as most of the gear is the same/similar
---
You too? I go through the whole sub like 3 times a day... help...
---
yea I know.  Sometimes i'll just go on construction sites and start roofing shit even though i don't have a fucking clue what i'm doing.  Fuck those roofers for getting mad at me for helping.
---
Can't even joke around here kek
---
I happens 1-2 times per year. This is the first one during BfA however.
---
5 man dream. Probably rolling pal, but gonna heal raids and hopefully get a decent set that way to maybe OT when needed.

That wall of text is too much.
---
Then why does it regenerate their health? 
---
There's such a strange contradiction in the Classic community. 
---
Raider: Most of the raid content in classic will be too easy. You can pug MC in quest greens. World buffs trivialise everything up to AQ40, and people just know the fights now thanks to better information. 
---
Same raider: No-one will ever take off-specs like Enhancement Shamans or Moonkin to a raid because they're not optimal. Everyone must be playing their best spec in order to progress though any raid content. 
---
Alterac Royale coming soon.
---
**&lt;TBD&gt;   {Alliance PvP}   {West Coast Semi-Hardcore}   {LC}**  
---
**What are our goals?**   
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We won't be chasing server firsts but we do intend to be among the top guilds on the server, and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.  
---
Depending on the way classic pvp is released, we may have a ranking pvp group from the start. We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged.    
---
**Why should you join us?**   
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids  to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released.  
---
**Want to know more?**  
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly. 
---
By then your aq should hopefully take less than 2 hours and BWL and MC should be done on off nights with pugs or alts and new recruits so that it's all dedicated progression time which is plenty if your guild is up to snuff. And if your guild isnt good enough yet no extra amount of time in naxx is going to fix that. 
---
Yeah...
---
Old WoW was something special. It had a kind of magic borne out of it being greater than the sum of its parts. The social aspect was unparalleled. You can capture the essence of that, if you play classic. Times have changed but that won't stop it being great.

It really bothers me that almost every single one of this guy's posts is being spam downvoted.  He isn't being hostile and *most* of his responses have fair points that are being presented in a non hostile way.  Its okay to have discussions guys come on.
---
Settle down there, flower child.
---
This has been extensively discussed and debated. The general consensus is that they are NOT viable main tanks for the most part. Possibly off tanks or tanks for very specific fights but a big NO for the following reasons: lack of threat generation in comparison to warriors and caster gear combined with defense doesn't really exist (something palys need to keep aggro).
---
Even with the likelihood that private servers got some of the specific server mechanics wrong when it comes to how boss fights work, the best you can expect is a +25% boost to paly tanking, and that's simply not enough to be viable. 
---
I for one would love to see paly and druid tanks but it would require drastic changes to the way vanilla works and that won't happen... 
---
Rogue, you go stealth through all map looking for loot, when you have everything just kill and stealth 
---
No idea :D. I did this in Vanilla. Guess it should still work :).
---
Probably, if only as proof since we probably won't have armory stats.
---
But that is an alt character that's going to come well after my main gets to 60 and our guild is raiding.
---
Just choose the class and role you like to play. It's far more important to enjoy playing. If you are good at what you do, you will always find a spot in some guild's endgame content
---
This entire post is why I'm #nochanges.   Who decides how much is too much?  That line is different for everyone.
---
Personally, there are changes I'd like.  How can I justify mine without justifying yours?  Why should I get mine and tell you that you can't have yours?  Any of the changes not on my list, I'd hate to have them made.  I know there changes I'd like that would upset a lot of other players. 
---
With #nochanges, there are still problems with the game, and most players on the #nochanges crowd know this.  It's not about thinking the game is perfect.  It's about recognizing that any change is going to alienate *some* players, and the best compromise to keep everyone happy is to not change anything.  It's consistent, and it's most in line with the spirit of making a Classic game.
---
I don’t care what anyone says, they need to overhaul some of the classes. 
---
Name sounds super familiar. I was a NE hunter in Vanquish then Deus vox on LS. Was he a big pvper?
---
We used CT Raid Assist for it.
---
I was in one of the first few NA guilds to full clear it on the most recent big private server to go to Naxx. You need 40 solid players who are willing to put the time in to get consumables and learn the fights. There are somewhat gear checks but people got it in classic so I don't think that's as big but you're still going to want full BWL gear and some good pickups from AQ for your raid at the very least. The amount of time you're willing to put in is probably the largest factor as to how quickly you clear. Expect at least 8-16hr of raiding per week at the beginning if you want to make progress. Just the number of bosses and amount of running makes it hard for most guilds to squeeze a clear into their regular raid schedule, without having months of practice. 
---
Are you me?
---
Yeah he Pvp'd a lot, and I remember him shitposting on the forums when the Blizzard forums were fun.
---
Thanks for giving me flashbacks to that.
---
And than after the pull your target gets banished, no one know which warlock messed up (or leader?), an unbanished add tears through the raid, mayhem ensues, wipe.
---
This is making the perfect the enemy of the good. Enhance shamans are clearly in need of some "special treatment": they suck in PvE, they suck in PvP, they have no endgame role that is not better filled by a resto shaman, they are strictly a levelling spec.
---
Boomkin are in the same boat, nobody wants them in PvE, in PvP balance druids don't even bother getting the boomkin talent, they need something or other to make them something other than a totally failed spec.
---
I am pretty sure that stun resist is better than wotf. Also Orc has a decent dps racial for PvE as well, so overall it is the stronger choice. And I don't think anyone really cares about the pet racial
---
&gt; This is why a lot of folks used to say that WoW only left beta when it hit 2.0.
---
I can say so, so much negative stuff about TBC, but class design and fixing hybrids isn't one of them. Maybe some light homogenization, but nothing as egregious as Wrath and beyond.
---
I'm ultimately team \#nochanges, but I'd hoped that Blizzard would take Classic as an opportunity to create rather than simply preserve.
---
Genuinely can't tell if you're kidding but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt: that stuff is never coming to classic.
---
*hopefully*
---
Nope. Of all the meme-spec dps, moonkins scale the best with gear and can maintain full dps without running oom for a typical fight duration. Their big issue is simply that mages and warlocks both scale substantially better. Shadow priest scales worse than boomkin, but adds 15% to warlock dps (with no party restriction), while boomkin aura only adds about 4% dps to 4 locks. Maybe close to 5% dps for a really stacked group of fire mages due to rolling ignite uptime.
---
That said though, if you have a player who went straight As boom can, and has the gear appropriate for the level of content you're doing, and will show up and do their job, just bring them. They can switch to Healing while still spect boomkin and are only slightly less efficient than a Resto druid. The moonkin buff, while not as powerful as shadow weaving, is more flexible AND stacks with all other buffs. Their overall dps is on par with an equally geared ap/frost mage. But it you bring a boomkin and let them get items like Blackstone ring, lokamir, firemaws clutch, etc- they will be beating hunter and Shadow priest dps. 
---
Dota 2, some, but very little, Apex Legends. Mostly just browsing this subreddit for content to keep me saturated until classic launches.
---
daggers isnt terrible for raiding, but its pretty rough doing anything solo, and there just aren't very many fist weapons that are any good
---

---
\^ This video has weapon progression lists for Alliance and Horde starting at 21:35.
---
Whirlwind Axe and Bonebiter (quest rewards from 30 warrior class Q and for running the bosses of Scarlet Monastery respectively) will get you from 30-50 by themselves. 
---
Fly? Why not take a classic, leisurely jog? ;)
---
YES! Absolutely right!
---
Then you are the strongest aoe dungeon tank. You can do some fun things in the high level undead dungeons. Just make sure you have a ton of water and pull enough things to make your downtime worth it.
---
Also understand that population status statistics mean nothing end game. Although the majority of players might play mages, rogues or warriors, a few of them won't make 60, of the ones who do,  some won't bother raiding, of the ones who do raid some won't be very dedicated, and of the ones who are dedicated, some won't be very skilled/good.
---
If the stats existed to show the few remainders,  then I'd suppose that really only 15-20% will be your competition. So don't worry about it. Stay focused on your goal to be in raiding guild and always be working toward that goal and the majority of others will be left by your wayside. 
---
My PC used to suffer really badly in early vanilla (before I upgraded it) on flightpaths I turned my camera to the sky else I'd get a frame every 10 seconds or so, and I had to ask a friend to log on and move my character when I got disconnected in an auction house, also the load time for the zeppelin was often shorter than the time the zeppelin was docked so I either had to jump off when it had already left or again as a friend to save me 😂 
---
And that is bad... why?
---
Not to mention, a lot of the bosses aren't tauntable. So once the boss stops hitting the tank, his rage generation goes to shit and the DoTs ticking on the boss or anyone who doesn't stop attacking is going to quickly start passing the tank on threat.
---
I'm not giving any advice. I'm saying what people that are progressing through Naxxramas are doing to help their efforts.
---
Stop assuming everyone will not wipe. You **completely** missed the point, and even after I spoon fed you why you're wrong, you try to justify your post somehow.
---
Just stop, you're embarrassing yourself 
---
Ultimately it'd be a field full of stealthed cats and rogues stood still in stealth until someone had to log off.
---
What else did you expect in a 15 year old game?
---
You are asking 60 farmers to reveal their secret farming spots... expect some misdirection. 😋
---
All that druid vs druid at the end is going to be a nightmare.  
---
What happened to your channel?
---
I know about changing fonts, ElvUI does it too.  
---
However, simply changing the font won't affect how the text is animated on the screen though right? but surely that can be made into an addon? i have hopes afterall!
---
&gt; Vendor everything - dont bother with AH, it's a fresh server it will take a while for economic to establish
---
I was making a lot of money selling green weapons on the AH as I leveled.
---
[What a time to be alive](https://i.imgur.com/yQ2tHHb.jpg)
---
Moonkin form is kind of bad anyway. The druid playstyle doesn't lend itself to staying in one form for extended amounts of time and moonkin form lacks high impact abilities like bash, feral charge, prowl and dash. Compared to cat and bear form, moonkin also doesn't have a way of dealing damage while conserving mana for healing and shapeshifting. You will actually end up wasting mana, since you'll be shifting in and out of the form in order to cast your healing spells.
---
The armor bonus is nice, but it's not like you want to just spam wrath while tanking melee damage from a character that can interrupt your casts.
---
Fair enough. I remember the BWL fist weapon going to a non orc warrior, and I was jealous as it looked so good, and we had no deathbringers drop for the first 3 months or so of onyxia kills 
---
They were humanoid. Like you said in your post they would drop around 50s each along with cloth or decent vendor trash with high chance for greens. I think I got at least 3 or 4 BoE epics while farming that spot too that I sold on the AH for 50-100g.
---
Was always a really under populated spot too so there wasn't much competition there. 
---
But again that was 15 years ago so I'm not really sure why I picked that spot and even if it was worth grinding out 
---
They’re tough but not that heavy. 
---
Stoked to do 5 man dungeons with my buddies. Wailing caverns and Mara are probably the most nostalgic for me. Gonna slow down and enjoy the leveling experience. See parts of the game I never found as a kid. Initial goals are to get tier 0 and .5 gear, then see if that leads into raiding. 
---
Its not about font though. Its about how it was displayed. It was very punchy and in your face back then, compared to "flowy" and "unimpactful".
---
As long as it’s only as they say then no not even close.
---
Fighting 200 people for the same 15 mobs while the server crashes once an hour does not sound fun in the slightest.
---
I'll always have a soft spot for MC and BWL, although BWL was better.  It may be heretical on classicWoW, but my favorite ever may actually be Kharazan.
---
If the horde was 50% shaman I would still role one.
---
I don't think he's really asking for "special treatment" in this way. He's not asking for a reversion to pre 1.4 windfury where it could chain off itself, after all. He's merely pointing out that for the majority of Vanilla, Windfury worked a particular way, and it was only near the very end of the game that it was changed. Thus 1.12 isn't a great representation of how this mechanic worked in Vanilla. 
---
This principle could be expanded to slightly buff hunters (revert the 1.10 ranged AP normalization, and possibly the 1.9 lupos changes - but 1.9 is only slightly after the halfway point of the game), and to nerf rogues and mages (talent revamps in 1.12 and 1.11 respectively). Is this such a bad outcome for you? I mean, isn't it something which is both better balanced, and also more representative of Vanilla as it was?
---
Well eventually the circle would close and they would overlap. 
---
I will level a prot warrior to 60 and then level a frost mage for farming. I might swap to fire for PvP eventually though as I'm a firm believer that the vanilla fire mage is just as competent in PvP and I had a shit load of fun as fire back in the day.
---
Doom maxed out at 35 FPS in 1993.
---
I forgot there were 5 discs. Holy shit, great find OP.
---
I'm really not sure how blizzard views it. Based on their history, it's possible (even likely) they are only really doing this thing because Activision is ordering them to. Blizzard has a history of making controversy decisions and sticking with them until they lose players in droves. And they made it very, very clear that classic wow would NEVER come back....
---
Regarding the PSs, I think most people who currently play on PSs are well aware that their time there is limited. Either the PS already let the players know it will shutdown when classic launches OR they will ALL be shutdown by blizzard since there's no way they will tolerate direct competition. 
---
Thus forcing me to be an addon nazi. "No raid for you!"
---
I started 20 twinking on a f2p account. Its actually pretty fun. That and ive been playing Old School Runescape for that good early 2000s nostalgia. 
---
You were dead right btw lol
---
Depends on your class really, mages can farm zg strat live brd even mobs in naxx if you'd like some info send me a message 
---
If you say no reason to play because launch day is like any other day, then you also have no reason to play on those any other days.
---
Noobs
---
Oh yeah, the horse version doesn’t have a 2h Weapon. Thanks for the recommendations though. 
---
Hey man, you're asking some heavy questions. I don't know if I can handle this. 
---
Yea, this is why I understand the no changes idea. It's just easiest. However, I don't think the easiest thing is always automatically correct. If I could be given a reason why adjusting numbers (the ability changes/additions was supposed to be a relative extreme) would negatively impact the classic feel that is what I'm wondering. As I can easily argue that tuning numbers to viable points is very different than some more niche thing that only benefits myself. I would argue it's similar to fixing bugs that broke the game. Although, I know some people wanted even those. That said, people's experience of it being classic surely can't be reliant upon there being dead classes. If that dictates their enjoyment that borders sadism, does it not?
---
This is great and all, but what about DKP guilds? I prefer loot council. People will be buying items for people in exchange for gold.. or if they just have a bunch banked up,buy some items for their buddy. How about you win an item and someone pm's you"ILL GIVE U 1000g FOR THAT!".The system is still flawed. How many guilds actually /roll for BiS gear. 
---
Not complaining just pointing out flaws. At first glance i loved it, more i think about it the more flaws that keep popping up in my head.
---
Lore and ingame mechanics don't always match up well.
---
It was definitely pre-TBC. Had to be a certain rank to talk on it though
---
There is no paying for mounts in classic.
---
i think almost all, most guilds etc.
---
i never felt that way, id still be on private if my friend wasnt bored all the time in game( lack of players presence and other activities , although that can be attributed to the people who were stirring up drama 
---
There's a few ways this can play out.
---
One being consumables are going to be harder to get compared to private servers. Private servers have dynamic respawns meaning herbs and other materials spawn a lot faster than they did in retail vanilla. So if they stay true to retail vanilla consumables will be harder to get by and in my opinions won't be used as much.
---
Second, you could possibly join a guild that doesn't require you to grind 24/7 throughout the week to be completely decked out in consumes to even start progress. It's debatable how far you'll come with this strategy, again we'll have to wait and see how naxxramas is tuned in classic wow, you might be able to clear it without having to farm 10 years straight.
---
Third is the obvious one ofcourse. Do the grind, in many ways vanilla was about that, putting time in the game awarded you. And if you're not about that grind you don't have to do it, there's plenty for you to do elsewhere. 
---
I think i'm in the same boat as you though, i find it hard to justify grinding whole week so i can use consumes for naxxramas progress. All though I think if you join a half decent raiding guild you'll be able to clear naxx in a week, meaning if the kills is what you're after you might only need to do the consumables grind only once. Maybe your guild won't even require you to get them all after you get a little geared.
---
But honestly if I were you, which in this case i guess I am I'll just try to join a guild that doesn't require the insane amount of grind from their players and see how that plays out.
---
DS3 randomized (too poor to afford Sekiro rn) and planning 1-20. Wands bro, wands. 
---
&gt;  can maintain full dps without running oom for a typical fight duration. 
---
What is a typical fight duration, and what is full dps?
---
But it never procs unless the boomkin is intent on beating up the boss with his staff instead of casting spells.
---
I forget the cost to switch in. How much more is it than Bear Form?
---
Tried separating it some, sorry about that!
---
Not needing addons to heal
---
2017? Try 2007. I won’t even have time to hit 60 within the first year and I’m still thirsting 
---
Well, I remember Doom at 4-10 FPS, and that was a treat compared to the SNES version.
---
There were games running at full 60/50 Hz, like R-Type, that needed that speed but that was the exception back then.
---
No one was at all phased at that time when you had sub-30FPS in a game on a not particularly new PC. And the upgrade cycles back then were brutal. It's not at all like today where I can play the newest Tomb Raider on High settings at 60 FPS with my 3 year old PC. 
---
You play a class not a spec.
---
Every class has its place in a raid.
---
Reddit being hyperbolic and hostile?
---
Dare I never!
---
Cool thanks 
---
This was before they were PvE DPS powerhouses.
---
CT RA really was a godsend.
---
At least we had a readycheck addon before CT RA was a thing (or discovered by our guild).
---
Apparently theres quite a few of us, which I think bodes well for how the game will do. For every obsessive fan theres got to be at least a dozen normies that will play.
---
I don’t think the community is that petty 
---
The most jarring thing with 2.0 pre-patch was the total rework of ALL talent trees to include 41 pt talents, and the fact the pvp system was made into "do 5 BG's to get R14 gear".  It was a pretty big turn off for tons of players who realized everything they did or accomplished up to that point was about to be flushed down the toilet.
---
I played on Khadgar during vanilla as well. I remember the big raiding guilds on horde being Remnant and Voltage. And also the decked out warriors named Parax and Beyotaurs always sitting near the AH in Org 
---
Never thought of running lower instances but makes sense. 
---
Thanks.  I appreciate it.  That's the reaction I was going for.
---
I've been posting one a day for a few days now, but I don't have many left that are worthy, and once they're gone that's it.  
---
I'll see what I can scrounge up for tomorrow... I know I have a few of the world boss dragons.
---
imagine being angry at a guy for being wrong about shaman healers in wow, to the point that he gets dog piled. Trolling vanilla players in classic will be so easy.
---
"fhking blizz removed death knights"
---
I wouldn't say overhaul, but some classes could definitely use a "unnerfing" that occurred during the lifespan of vanilla.
---
That's interesting. I never really thought about multibox but it could be fun. Is there an advantage over solo? Just being able to do group content?
---
What makes alliance warlocks bad?
---
Ok, but you lose your threat modifiers in zerker stance you got in 1.12
---
=D
---
They wont die from not eating. But restoring your body requires outside material.
---
People playing the game for longer times and not rushing immediately no matter what changes you make is more "blizzlike" than 1.12. 
---
Sorry I just don't see it. One is an RNG CC break while the other is on demand CC immunity. There are more fear/charm/sleep spells than stuns in classic. 
---
For a PvP racial you'd never want the random one, since you have to count on it going off at a good time. 
---
I think a lot of people want to see post naxx content stay at 60. The level 70 move after putting all that time into raiding is what turns a lot of people off because their gear becomes useless. Maybe they could just add stuff on like elder scrolls does? 
---
Or even leveling up based on raids? You can stay 60 and naxx will be the last raid you do, or you can transfer servers and the next raid you complete would level you up to 61. Then the next content batch would be BC stuff. After completing all that you can do Black Temple. When black temple is finished you go up to level 62.
---
This way you would still be leveling up and the raids you were doing would actually matter(naxx gear would be required to do BC stuff). It would be a very slow process but I think it’d be pretty cool
---
They will switch when the private servers are shut down with legal notices
---
I think mages in particular can sneak up to the last few mobs in sm cath and then have them chain pull every mob behind them while you run back to the entrance. 
---
This was a rather famous way at the time when the first multiboxer (Magtheridon US-East PvP) farmed enough gold for his 5 epic mounts on the 4 mages and priest. He would just instantly pull the whole SM instance and aoe them all down.  Took him like 10 straight minutes to actually loot everything.
---
I bet with current player knowledge it could be done with a single mage.
---
I’ll most likely stick to one character, rank 13 or 14, clear all endgame content etc.
---
If they after naxx open a fresh realm with stage 1 content, ill do it all again on a different class lol.
---
Let’s force hunters to use one pet for the whole duration of vanilla wow.  Please no
---
It’s the consumable grind coupled with gearing the tanks that’s usually the biggest hurdle. Our guild stopped at 4H for that reason alone. 
---
We had plenty of geared and interchangeable dps on paper, but most couldn’t handle on average 2-3 wipes per boss (that we had ‘on farm’) that required popping consumables for each try, for very long. 
---
When you straight up lose one of your 4H tanks on a medium pop server, you really struggle to find a replacement. 
---
I still think Naxx will be for the very few, even with lots of resources, simply because of the grind required. 
---
I'd need to see a side by side to be sure of anything.  An addon can completely disable damage numbers, so I see no reason to think you couldn't put them back in fade or what-have-you.
---
Right. If 3 million check it out and even 1 million stay that’s huge. 
---
I compromised and took the flight path instead of using my flying mount lol
---
Two of them actually.
---
Thick and rugged make good money, once the economy has stabilized a bit after launch. 
---
That's a bit far fetched. I'd say runescape and vanilla wow has a lot of crossover players, I'm more interested in how the younger audiences will consume this. I think it just won't be relevant to an extent other big games are after a week or two, truthfully the game mechanics are old and don't cater to the twitch reaction player base like the newer games do. Its going to be big for sure at the start, but once the dust settles I think classic will do average at best. I hope i'm wrong though, if classic succeeds on a global level through time it will shake up the game industry for sure.
---
The very definition of level 60 farmers is petty, isn't it?? 😑
---
Yeah, even the graphics are trying to ruin our nostalgia, but either way free is a good price for getting a screenshot :P
---
We almost reached 100 signatures. Keep up the good work all!
---
No, it was definitely in vanilla. I played vanilla. It was first implemented to where only high ranked players could chat in it, along with global attack notifications. I used it constantly to engage in World PvP, especially Tauren Mill and South shore.
---
Private server I played, there were often idiots watching the dps meter instead of KTM (threat meter) and pulling off the tanks. Warlocks were fairly notorious for this, and occasionally wiped the raid. Especially on Nefarion, pulling him over and getting all the healers cleaved/breathed fire on/feared. Same on onyxia too. 
---
Yeah, I had a blast in Kharazan too.  It was new content.  It wasn't like we had much choice back then, either accept the game evolving or abandon your character(s) and quit.
---
This was a great game
---
Ahhhh fair enough!
---
Yep. But the only one your should even consider buying is the executioners cleaver at like 43 iirc. And that's only if its cheap enough or you dont get lucky on the Uldaman 2h drops. 
---
Alright, it's your right to disagree, but afaik the majority of people, who do way more theory crafting than me, also say that the Orc racials are superior to the undead ones.
---
ya man right on, those roofers are assholes, imagine being mad
---
No you don't understand. If they buff ret then pallies will have a reason to roll on 2 handers and then i won't be able to get it for my PvP warrior. 
---
Therefore delicate house of cards or some crap. 
---
Yeah, being able to make food and water was great. Every time I play Warrior nowadays I think about playing Mage...and vice versa. Love both, lol.
---
Ugh.. it's so far awayyyyyy
---
&gt; Do you think blizzard pays attention to or even acknowledges this subreddit?
---
They 100% do.  There's a community manager who posts here from time to time.
---
I can't say how they would roll out a beta though.  I'm speculating here, but it wouldn't surprise me to see them automatically invite a large number of people who cancelled their account between TBC and WotLK.  Might help them model and project how many inactive accounts they could potentially expect to come back for Classic.
---
The weapon cap goes up by 5 points every level 
---
Beats stuff up with his wings* :V
---
Dead classes? There are dead specs, or specs that are not viable for both pve and pvp, but which class is dead?
---
Taking 1.5-2 weeks off work, so going to try to blast my way to 60.
---
But after that since I'm now 31 and need to go to work every day, which is fucking lame I'll be a lot more casual after that.
---
Probably just a little PvE with my friends and weekend raids when I can.
---
1000% this. One of the few changes I’d be super on board for 
---
Pros:
---
Good and meaningful progression
---
Strong community
---
Many actual RPG elements
---
More immersion
---
Personal choices such as class and race matter much more
---
Your rewards scaled based on commitment and time spent
---
Tedious at times
---
You can't get too far in the end game playing solo
---
You will never be as powerful as the hardcore players
---
Charisma can arguably be more important than performance
---
Requires a large amount of time commitment to keep up with others 
---
Yeah, they got some weird crap in Ashenvale these days. I haven't really seen all the zones post-Cataclysm. Every time I see how they butchered the old zones, I sigh. I was worried when I got to WSG it wouldn't be the same either, but luckily it was both still there and pretty much untouched.
---
It's not about easiest.  It's about fairness.
---
The only way to be fair, and not have changes that you don't like, is to not have any changes.
---
Unless you're so arrogant to believe that you are the arbiter of game balance.
---
yes, unless you are in guild which attempts full clear first week it should be possible to craft enough by mats you get up until you encounter sapph
---
I know what you mean, but I also know myself.  I won't be able to help myself; I'll want to be pushing server firsts because that's just the way I am.  I also like the type of camaraderie you get in a progression raiding guild that you just don't get in casual guilds.  
---
It's actually cheaper, but I'd say that bear form is still much more convenient. Moonkin is definitely cooler though :)
---
I'll edit, simply meant sub classes and misspoke.
---
Definitely AQ (20 and 40) AQ20 had very fun bosses while AQ40 had such a visual and psychological impact on my 17 years old self  (you're going to fight a god, damn). The first time you go up the stairs, enter it and see these huge anubis-like mobs ... just breathtaking. 
---
Sadly we never cleared Naxx thou, we moved on to tbc content before we finished it. 
---
5 man dungeon healing can be frustrating, you don’t have as many options as a priest and it will take time to get enough gear to not go oom after every couple pulls.  
---
Doing 5 man Dire Maul West is a nightmare as a shaman healer because of the lack of shackle undead.  DMW also has most of your pre-raid BiS gear so you have to power through it.
---
Resto Shaman will always be needed for raids.  You could realistic have room for as many as 8.  As long as you drop your totems before drinking, you won’t get anyone whining about not having windfury totem up.
---
The worst part about Resto shamans is the full Resto spec is so bad outside of dungeons and raids.  You will be at such a disadvantage farming by yourself and PvPing.  You can get away with a 30/0/21 build In raids/dungeons but you won’t be performing to the best of your ability.  
---
Alts parked at rare recipe vendors.
---
Maybe..

You're right, I'm probably just biased because warlock has always been a pretty hard counter to mages.

---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/e5kfKf](https://discord.gg/e5kfKf)
---
That’s fair, however I do disagree with you still, Classic to me is Classic, changing classes and you won’t have an authentic classic experience.
---
I have a weird urge to stealth and stalk that gnome mage
---
A clothie wearing leveling greens with no stamina on it, when the stars align, one swing out of five hundred.
---
Once you have the content on farm / massively outgear it and everyone is trying to push DPS numbers to be top of the meters, the only way you can wipe is one of these "DPS pulled aggro right before the breath attack" moments. Depending on the content release schedule and your guild's gear / minmax level, this will be a significant portion of the time playing.
---
I've seen DPS pull aggro on bosses in BWL causing a breath that only killed all the squishy casters, but the melee and Paladins survive, so the boss still dies and it's not technically a "wipe", but half the raid lost their world buffs on a farm raid and they are fucking pissed
---
Some people just don't have the frame of mind to play casters.  If your preferred playstyle is to get right up in the mob's face and bash its brains in you're going to try caster and be like, "I have to kite to excel?  What is this tomfoolery?"
---
Which is not to say mage is hard (unless by "hard" you mean, hard on your "2" key), just that casters aren't for everyone.  
---
Druid can never beat a pally or a warlock, but a Druid can run away from them. Loser would just be whoever afks first.
---
The biggest issue by far these days, is going to be finding enough people who are willing to invest that kind of time.  When you log in to raid, you can't just set aside 4-6 hours for the raid itself.  You also need almost that much time again in order to get materials required for consumables; and that is probably going to be worse nowadays than it was during live, because of pathological things like the Devilsaur Mafia, and people having made a science out of how to corrupt the auction house, etc.
---
The other major challenge will be finding people who are willing to tolerate WoW's level of difficulty.  Back when WoW itself came out, more difficult raiding games existed, at least in terms of EQ.  The gaming population has dumbed down almost beyond description in the last ten years, however; and these days pretty much everyone expects everything to be handed to them on a plate, and will scream blue murder if it isn't.  I would have been derided as a casual during TBC for using leatherworking as a source of gear, yet there probably aren't many people around now who would be willing to put up with what I did even for that.
---
&gt; The problem is only that the intense farming for consumables and such is a big turn-off for me, and therefore I doubt if I should even bother to play Classic at all. I unfortunately need to keep my full-time job, get my 6-8 hours of sleep every night etc.
---
Then I honestly wouldn't bother.
---
WoW at its' best wasn't a game; it was a way of life.  It was designed primarily for those of us who didn't have marital partners, jobs, or kids, and who were therefore able to single-mindedly devote our entire focus to it.  Naxx was also the very pinnacle of raiding; for it, the "no-life" aspect was more consuming and intense than probably any other raid in the game.
---
You essentially have two choices, my friend.  The American Dream, or Orcish war paint.  I know which of those two I chose, and which I would choose again.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZenmglXcF4M
---
I'm not sure they have to deal with it. People wanted classic, and classic featured many imbalances and design quirks. That's all part of the overall vanilla experience, is it not? If the classic community then turns around and demands change, wouldn't that exactly prove the controversial, 'you think you do, but you don't'?
---
I missed vanilla at the time, I didn't start playing until TBC, but I'm definitely looking forward to classic WoW, including all its shortcomings.
---
I totally agree with you on the tediousness, but I personally count that as a pro. There are tons of times when you have to either get smart or work with others due to the difficulty, which is really satisfying. 
---
They will have an rp pvp server at launch. Gut feeling
---
After being mainly a healer in my past raiding career, I want to tank this time around. With a wife, kids, job and other responsibilities it will be hard to put insane amounts of time into WoW. 
---
My absolute goal will be acquiring Thunderfury and full T2. 
---
i solo farmed mara resist gear with bwl geared warr lol
---
Melee also happen to do the most DPS, so they are the ones that tend to pull aggro. The only exception is late geared Warlocks with a crit streak, or the mage with the first Ignite.
---
I see. As a guy that wants to do both raiding and PvP, what race you think is the best for all around job?
---
My top goal is probably Scarab Lord, and don't know if I'll be able to get it. It's pretty much the only major achievement I have left. I've hit R14 multiple times on private servers, cleared naxx multiple times, etc. I've had a black qiraji resonating crystal on some more 'fun' servers, but never had the scarab lord title.  
---
Rank 14 is again another goal.  
---
Pretty much everything below that is a given for me, naxx, t3, etc, you'll get them eventually if you don't quit. R14 and SL are the ones you need to go ham for.
---
Is it truly arrogance if it is true? How often do you stop and let a beetle walk past you, most of the time you don't even see them.
---
I think they should just have an open beta. They'd get a good idea of how many people are going to play, and possibly reduce some of the tourists stopping by to see what it's like with no real intention of playing.
---
Rogue repellent is pretty much all it does though. It's only marginally useful against other melee, and a straight up waste of a GCD/mana against casters. It's generally better to just be smarter about your shifts and try your darnest not to get caught in caster form against a melee. That allows you to get Feral Charge (29/11/11) or Nature's Swiftness (30/0/21), which are big in every fight.
---
They'll do it. There's zero reason they can't/won't.
---
I’m definitely not playing on a vanilla private server to see which class I like the best /s
---
i solo farmed mara resist gear with bwl geared warr lol trick is cheap resist pots
---
I think there's no doubt that they will have open beta... but probably just to stress test and it will likely be only 60-72 hours over the weekend. 
---
Wasn't trying to attack you by saying that. I'm curious why fairness necessitates inaction when the only goal of the change is to literally balance something--the aim of being fair.
---
Right now, I’m thinking I’m going to multibox a group to 60, going with a Fury Warrior as tank with the idea I’ll get in to a raiding guild as an off-tank or MT swapping to Prot if necessary, generally working my way through raid content, getting the rest of my group pre-raid BIS where possible and farming or leveling craft alts in my down time so I can churn out that sweet sweet Mooncloth and Arcanite.  
---
Paladins are by far the best tank for AoE threat and can do very high single-target threat until they run OOM. This makes them great for 5m/10m dungeons.
---
Paladins *can* tank every raid boss in the game, but not as well as warriors or druids. The main drawbacks being they can't taunt and it's impossible for them to become uncrushable.
---
If your guild is pushing for server firsts you won't be allowed to tank in raids. At least not on progression nights. Back in real Vanilla most guilds were far more relaxed, however. My guild used to let me tank farm content on my *warlock* just for fun. We even had a hunter tank Nef once.
---
Holy fuck you said that name and I felt a thump in my chest. I was on Stormreaver hordeside.
---
My first lvl 60 kill was when I was a lvl 52 frostmage, it was a dwarf warrior from &lt;Black Star&gt;. 
---
Contesting other classes for open world herbs / mining via sap / stunlock-&gt;kill
---
If you're wanting to be pushing server firsts, go with what you know and roll a mage
---
I literally just searched up one Ming's hemo video the other day for nostalgia reasons - I wasn't on their server, but I did visit the Rogue forums a lot
---
Looks like my paladin shall live again in classic
---
It was definitely in Vanilla and I’m pretty sure it required rank to access and higher rank to talk
---
&gt; If you want less competition then play Shaman, Hunter, or Druid.
---
Hunter is normally overpopulated on Alliance side. Ymmv on horde side.
---
After the normal main a character to raid bla bla.
---
I'll twink 19's wsg. Got so many great memories from that in tbc. Vanilla will be similar.
---
I'll be rolling a holy/prot paladin to tank low level dungeons and realise my hobbs dream.
---
I'm honestly surprised it took this long for this answer to come up
---
Lmao I love it, I need it!
---
Main tank gear is like the only gear that really really matters in vanilla. Especially once Thunderfury comes into play. So most guilds expect their MT to be consistently available.
---
Why can’t they fully restore their physicality to look like humans again? 
---
get smart or not its still very tedious
---
People post this same thread every single day dude. I'm sure you will have no trouble finding a fun casual guild of like minded people. Just shut up about it already.
---
Well there's a persuasive argument
---
To this day i still remember getting ganked by Cyrk troll rogue in WPL every time i landed, And man fuck The Cabal those guys we're always roaming in packs in the plaguelands.
---
lots of undeads on horde ( racial ability for fear removal/immunity)
---
but if u don't care much about pvp or just play on a pve realm raiding then its totally fine
---
ackshually, you can't dual wield Thunderfury since it's Unique.
---
Gotcha. That explains it then. 
---
Almost all of the changes people want are aiming to make the game better in some way.  Players who want to increase backpack size or stack sizes want to eliminate the problem of not having enough bag space, but they don't think what that does for the economy for tailors.  Players want to let you use modern graphics instead of classic graphics, but they aren't thinking about what effect that will have on your ability to sneak around, if it's easier for modern graphics to see you in the water.
---
Similarly, players who look at balance are looking at it through one lens.  Most players are looking at 40-man raids when everyone is in T2+ gear.  They aren't looking at battlegrounds, 5-man dungeons, solo grinding, or world PvP.  A lot of the "weak" classes are very strong in one of those other areas.  In order to "balance" them, you either make them too strong in the other area (see WotLK frost mage) or you nerf them in the other area and lose out on their identity.
---
Do I want rebalancing?  Sure.  I think TBC did class design way better.  But, some people don't like TBC class design.  My balance changes might ruin the class for someone else, or make certain classes now too strong in areas they were already strong.
---
If you want to raid as ret, you really have to be human. Ret dps is so lacking, you need every little bonus you can get. Dwarf is better for pvp, but other than using stoneform to escape blinds, it’s not a major difference. You can use bubble, or potentially abuse blessing of sacrifice to avoid blinds 
---
I can totally understand that for any ability additions/removals. Do you feel that way for numbers as well? By that, I mean do you feel part of classic being classic necessitates overtly problematic performance in terms of numbers alone? I ask because like I mentioned in another comment, some specialization performance felt simply unbalanced to a point that it would obviously be amended eventually. There was just so much to fix that they were met with the back burner. So, do you feel that class diversity alone would impact the experience of classic in any meaningful way other than having less specializations you immediately didn't want to be grouped with?
---
I will do lots of ganking
---
my pve goal would be tier 0.5
---
Just vendor/AH everything and don't buy anything. Ever.
---
The Xins. I played on magtheridon alliance and they were a nightmare in BGs because at one point they were all pom pyro. Even without pom pyro they were scary AF haha
---
Are you currently healing? If so, need. If not, use caution and at least ask. 
---
Maybe stick with 30/0/21 for leveling and dungeons, switch to full resto for lvl 60 content?
---
Improved Concussive Shot and Frostbite are both very popular for PvP. Impact not so much as it is too deep in the Fire tree and Frost is the go-to PvP spec.
---
you don't want to put much time ... so  u want to tank?
---
Rockstar's and Bethesda's games have been pretty consistent.  The only thing to get me to buy one of these next next gen consoles will be GTA6.
---
It’s not just numbers, it’s abilities/mechanics as well. You start revamping a spec, then it would change the whole PvP game as well, you can’t try to change something for pve performance, without it totally changing the PvP gameplay as well.
---
I'ts really fun tbh and you can clear BWL and MC without world buffs, so everyone can just corpse run and get inside. It'll just make your raid longer :)
---
So you can go from 10-60 with just using your voidwalker, which is effective if you just let it auto attack and auto cast its taunt.
---
Locks have probably one of, if not the easiest leveling experience in the game.
---
That being said, unless you go destruction, its nothing like a mage, and dest isnt really great before endgame.
---
Slaughter poor ally warriors
---
frostbolts that noncrit for 1k without consumables, thats my goal.
---
Hey! I was on Anvilmar! Was horde though lol. Glad to see our small server mentioned though.
---
Yeah, and the smaller raids were kind of a sweet spot for me (I also really liked AQ20).  I was an officer in a 40 man guild, and while I have a lot of good memories from that time I also have absolutely no desire do that again.  If I try to raid at all on classic it will be as just a faceless raid member.
---
If we decide to have a 40v40 guild brawl and the server decides this is an appropriate time to turn on the "limited sharding" feature I'm gonna be pissed
---
Which is unfortunately set to Ironforge...
---
As horde on mag, they were great to play AB with, send them to a node and have them delete 2 players instantly.
---
Chen, Uchiha, Fireboll, Daxpedda, Zizu, Toastbrot, Banane, Gelidus, Thros, Decki, Wolfsoul, Narcissa, Kinzslayer, Agobärt, Ares, Craven, Akasha, Moron, Damien, Witchmaster, Baltazar, Rammar, Zarash, Kiuan, Lea, Nathan, Thunderhorn, Kodiak, Flashi, Kandor, Exo, Sabbi, Scryer, Keyhork, Breakestyle, Oocrashoo, Suicidesarah ...
---
Where y'all at? :((
---
&gt; Ya I remember the 8/8 is better for pve
---
8/8 T2 is great for PVE because the debuff increases the dps of all the hunters in the raid. Unfortunately most guilds these days only have 2-3 hunter spots so the uptime isn't great =(
---
Mage
---
Back in vanilla I was a noob hunter. I played all the time. I ditched class, ditched friends, ditched women and parties to play wow. Regardless of my time /played I was a scrub in blues by the time BC released with no epic mount no gold no elite rare pet no professions to 300. What I accomplished in game is accomplished by some players in a matter of 1 month which when I look back was just sad how inefficient and stupid I was. Most of my time was spent in some ADD mind haze pursuing random unique items and novelty pets like Hydrocane or Black Whelpings.
---
My plan this time around was to play efficiently because I don't have all the time in the world like I did as a youngling. I'm not so focused on leveling efficiently but I am definitely focused on getting Pre raid BIS and an epic mount within a few months of dinging 60. I want to meet a smal group of friends that I can run 5 mans with nightly I have no interest in raiding anything above a 20 man. 
---
And finally I'd like to have a level 60 rogue. As a hunter back in vanilla I was extremely envious of rogues invisibility. Seeing them spring out of stealth in PvP and surprise people was so cool. Or sneaking by areas you weren't supposed to go. Plus Rogues always lookeds super cool in their gear sets. I rolled an alt rogue back in vanilla but never made it past 40.
---
World first KT kill, what else
---
Warlocks are badass mages are badass I prefer mages because they are fucking ridic pve and combustion fire with crit gear is insane in pvp I'd top the charts in bgs cause I'd just be 1-2 shooting everyone but my boy rolled a warlock and he could take on 3 60s at the same time if you get the chance look up his videos it's spread pvp but as combo we killed 200+ people in a couple hours in searing gorge it's up to you tho insane dmg and crowd control or insane survivability with good dmg, dependant on the spec you roll
---
I'm going to sound like a complete cookie saying this, but I might actually cry if this happens. Tears of joy.
---
Home for some of us was an RP-PvP server. We deserve to go home, too.
---
I was previously a hunter main for a long time during classic, tbc, and through wotlk.  Can confirm you have to get good at running for your life lol.
---
Everything that improves the leveling experience should be left in. This is why we're getting Maraudon.
---
Everything that would rearrange the level 60 gear progression should be as it was originally.
---
So that's the threshold for you where suspension of belief comes to a screeching halt? Orcs, gnomes, trolls, magic and monsters... Hordes of undead? Why not. Hold on a minute, is that zombie priest with a skeleton ghost horse eating a BAGEL? Literally unplayable.
---
No there wasn't. Moonkin was sadly one of the most useless specs in the game. Deep arcane mages were better than a moonkin. You couldn't really get gear since you'd be taking it from mages and warlocks, even if you did it was cloth so it nullified one of the benefits of them in pvp of having good armor. In addition, even if you did manage to get a bunch of good non-set items for it you'd be better off staying in humanoid anyway so you can access resto spells and also spec into NS. Almost all of the spells in balance are really cool, but druids just got really shafted in vanilla.
---
Ion just explained that they won't do it during the last stream, and said because "it's niche without enough interest" despite the fact that surveys and polls show there is as much, if not more, interest in RP-PvP compared to RP-PvE servers.
---
hmm how did  he make it there first? stealth pots?
---
looks like  u need bwl gear

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers. 
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids. 
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.

Yeah I remember wrath boomkins being pretty good. I guess if you like a class for long enough, eventually they will be good? 
---
At level 60 you can just casually walk past everything, mobs 20+ levels lower than you have a super tiny aggro radius.
---
I won‘t be able to play 8+ hours per day anymore. 
---
But I will level steadily, tanking as many dungeons as possible and work on my pre raid gear. The one thing that I can offer is stability. I will be looking for a guild that raids 2-3 nights per week and I will be there 99% of the time. 
---
I think this will be of value for a more casual guild. 
---
This was beautiful poetry. 
---
In theory it would be best executed as a classless experience, and you would collect abilities and equipment throughout the match, kind of like Realm Royale was.
---
Min max an Ele shaman and nuke people endlessly in AV.
---
In a simple man with a simple dream. Show alliance players the power of lightning.
---
As a Druid, I know Shaman are absolutely based healers. Chain heals are fantastic and really a great augment considering Priests and Druid’s are so much better at single target healing. Just don’t roll on my Lok’Amir and everything will be great.
---
I can't past your opening remarks. 
---
"I've seen the posts--I'm sure everyone has--that suggest any changes to the game that weren't originally existent during specific patches would be tantamount to blasphemy."
---
I can't recall ever seeing anyone say this. I've seen "no changes," but never "patch 1.4 exactly no changes."
---
"This post is more about the other side of the "reasonable" spectrum. That is to say, the opinion that anything implemented in the whole of vanilla should be free game to work with and/or revert to for classic
---
"This is where I'm most curious about everyone's opinion--and might range to an "extreme" of giving a class something like a taunt for prot paladins"
---
How can you say this post is about things that were implemented in vanilla and then immediately go into things that weren't implemented in vanilla?
---
Sorry for the dumb question.. but will Classic have those rewards during the first phase when everyone will be leveling?
---
Unless im missing something, one thing ive found interesting so far is there isnt a way to opt into a *Classic* beta.  They obviously have WoW as an option, along with Diablo, Starcraft, etc...but there wasnt a specific option for Classic.
---
If theyre going to do a closed beta, im not really sure how they'd get people with interest for it based just on that.  Sure theres some overlap, but it'd be much more efficient for them to have an option *just* for Classic.
---
Heres to hoping for an open beta, though.  Only problem with that is they may actually get too many people, and get flooded with reports on the same thing.
---
Because the state of decay is beyond full recovery, but the decay itself can be prolonged for very extensive periods. Flesh and muscles still need energy to move because there's no necromancer animating them.
---
For those of us out of the loop apparently, what stream? 
---
Shaman tank
---
Definitely agree with this much more. I do see how it hits other activities. Raiding was the easiest to point out but I should have certainly included your consideration of other activities in the post. Do you feel class/spec identity relies on it being stronger or weak in an activity vs. how it plays in that activity? 
---
I suppose I also didn't explain myself as well as I would have liked to with the time I spent on the post. That said, I came to the question of is number tuning being acceptable with the assumption that changes are on the table in some way. Your response is a good one to why not though assuming identity or authenticity is reliant on the strength of a spec in a given activity. Thanks.
---
You just kinda do it.After the first few months of hype, that longing set in and I personally had to distance myself from subreddits like this one and away from retail WoW too (which wasn't very hard).
---
I recommend either cutting off of the subreddit if it is that bad for you, or start planning things if you haven't already. After that, if you must think about it, just run through memories you had or memories you want to have.
---
They can say that now, I'm just saying that there's no way they don't make it in. Seems like easy good faith points to change their stance on it later. 
---
Doubt it
---
Blizz is way too politically correct.
---
You may need to use some CC spells to flip that answer. Casting things like "Wash Dishes" and "Clean Bathroom" can help. You may also want to go to one of the local vendors and purchase "Chocolate" or "Flowers." Giving her "Wine" and some currency can also lower her resistance to these techniques. 
---
&gt; Paladins can tank every raid boss in the game, but not as well as warriors or druids. 
---
Paladins can tank every raid boss in game in the same manner that anyone the boss is currently hitting is "tanking" until they're dead.
---
They would only not be included in the Chinese client then. The removal from the "normal" client is because they are drug references. 
---
I would do enhancement until lvl 40, elemental 30/0/21 until 60.  Then switch to 0/5/46 to farming pre-BiS.  Once you get some good gear from dungeons and MC then you can get away with being 30/0/21.  Maybe switch back to full Resto when BWL launches.  
---
I played on a few private servers but lately I've been putting off playing on private servers knowing that official ones are coming. So hyped.  I am doing something slightly different by playing a class I didn't play in vanilla. Kind of a mix of knowing what I am doing and going in blind as well.
---
That map is something that was a big part of my childhood believe it or not. If I recall correctly, it's sometimes used as the loading screen for WC3, and of course has always been there in WoW as well.
---
There was plenty of space for them to hav just added the island in the size that it is, and just make sure the words "Kul Tiras" are well labeled, and no one would have a problem with that. It's one of like five things you can click on. Making them and Zanadalar gigantic on the map honestly was really annoying to me. I know it sounds like a small gripe, but it just really harms the "World" of Warcraft that had been established thus far through WC1 (slightly), WC2 (largely), WC3 (mainly), and WoW. 
---
Everyone has their things that they associate with immersion in WoW and for me, the map was always a large piece of it. Massively changing the map was really frustrating for me. 
---
Depending on how different things end up being between pservers and classic.  I can say that on pservers 2 nightly blocks of 3-4 hours is pretty standard for a lot of guilds.  The one I helped lead progressed and eventually cleared Naxx for several months on this schedule.
---
Usually the other raids are scheduled for weekends and are optional with PUGs filling the empty spots.  While there are still a bunch of good (even BIS) items from BWL/AQ40, interest in those raids tends to suffer over time once the newer ones are released in my experience.
---
&gt;I'm not sure they have to deal with it.
---
They don't have to deal with it, but it's going to be there.
---
&gt;People wanted classic, and classic featured many imbalances and design quirks. That's all part of the overall vanilla experience, is it not? If the classic community then turns around and demands change, wouldn't that exactly prove the controversial, 'you think you do, but you don't'?
---
I think the hope in general is that the population that plays the game is much larger than the "classic community."  No one put pressure on Pservers to change class balance because there is an understanding going into it as to what you are getting, that understanding is totally different here because of two things, one people are paying for it, and two it's a multi billion dollar company behind it.
---
There are a signifigant number of classes and specs that suck in vanilla, and I'm telling you now, a shit load of people are not going to be happy once they get their feral druid (or any other druid spec), ret pally, Spries, hunter (all once you start moving past MC gear) to 60 and they suck.  And they are going to be especially intolerant of the insane power imbalances, the dps graphs for vanilla will make the retail ones look downright balanced, and there is a ton of bitching done there.
---
I'm not necessarily arguing for change, I'm merely bring up this is going to be an issue, one I'm hoping Blizz has thought about one way or the other.  I know I for one won't play a druid despite maining one for almost 15 years, it's horrible in vanilla.
---
As the other guy said, it was originally going to be a series, but the guy got hired by Blizzard and then always had other projects to work on. Still an epic video though. 
---
Hold on brother.
---
While I hope they do roll a RPPVP out the statement about the "poll" . . well. . the facts and stats that Blizz have skew differently.   The "live" server count is/was 17 RPPVE to 6 RPPVP

---
Just want to give you the possible reasons behind Ion's statement. 
---
But again.. I HOPE they hear our requests and surprises us with an update. So don't lose complete faith just yet.
---
I never said they would, I said that they didn’t specify the limits of where they’re going to use it like OP claimed
---
Yeah it's that Firelands or Ulduar 
---
Good call!
---
As an addition to this. Retail is free for another 2 hours as of right now. I'd recommend just logging on and making sure everything works. 
---
That was not the whole instance. I'm pretty sure that was just the one room.
---
then if u can raid 3 times a week 4h each and brings consumables then  u can play in the semihardcore ones
---
But it's not replacing anything.
---
/pvp
---
Upvote threads like this so it's clear to Blizzard the community wants this :)
---
1. The slow methodical levelling of both character and professions.
---
2. Running the old dungeons. 
---
3. World PvP.
---
4.  It just taking so long to do everything.
---
Sweet! I'll do that!
---
(dear god... I'm actually excited about current retail....)
---
I wonder what we can infer based on that.
---
* /r/apexlegends sits at 723k subs with 50mm players.  So we can do the math to say that about 1.4% of players who ever played the game are subbed.  
---
* WoW in total has surpassed 100 million accounts created, and /r/wow has just under 1 million subs.  About 1% again.  
---
* Last I saw, Overwatch sold 40 million copies.  /r/Overwatch has just over 2mm subs, so ~2% there.
---
I think obviously a larger sample size would be needed to make this remotely reliable or statistically relevant, but let's assume for fun that subreddit subscribers account for 1.5% of a games total players.  That would mean ~4 million subs at least somewhat interested in Classic.
---
Because most other specs are at least good in a niche in some way. Enhance is just garbage in PVE for many reasons (such as needing +hit and +spell hit) and you'd have to constantly have some priest spamming abolish magic on them and a mage throwing out rank 1 frostbolts for the shaman to feel like he could do anything in pvp. It's just useless outside of leveling. Even then, elemental isn't really all that much worse if you do it right.
---
I played a shaman and it was cool being able to do ele/resto hybrid specs for pvp once you got into a good mix of T2 and ZG stuff, but the enhance tree might as well be blacked out once you hit 60. It's purpose is just grab imp weapon totems in high tier raids for tryhards since mana tide doesn't scale at all. It's about as good of a tree if Arms had mortal strike on a 1 minute cd.
---
**Classic team:** We've listened to your feedback and concerns and have made changes to how loot trading will work in Classic. It will only be possible for soulbound equipment that drops in any raid content with weekly lockouts.
---
**Retail team:** We've removed portals from the game. LOL do you guys even have mages.
---
Classic is bringing back Vanilla. As it was. Warts and all. Not creating a new game. Not creating a "Vanilla+"/"WoW 2"/whatever. Not creating a "better" game, whatever that means.
---
It should exist just like a million other old games. Vanilla WoW is a very important part of gaming culture, perhaps even culture at large. It should be available for anyone to play.
---
Want a different game? Ask Blizzard to create that different game for you. Leave Classic alone.
---
Certainly, you'd have to take the other activities into consideration. I shouldn't have omitted that thought I suppose.    I do feel, however, that changes to the numbers aren't nearly so hard (especially within the realm of classic numbers vs. the amount of abilities that would be tuned). That's exactly what balancing teams are for. Though, I doubt there is one assigned to classic.  I can respect that you may feel this would be too detrimental to the gameplay of the classes though (assuming I read that right). Thanks for your thoughts.
---
Stop saying this. Shaman is literally _most_ played class after warriors for horde.  Druid is the least played, that one is correct.
---
Enhance isn’t completely useless. You have the niche task of using Nightfall to apply the 15% spell msg debuff.
---
It will be close though 😆 shaman is really popular
---
If the clothie has a decent brain the shaman will never be able to be within melee range of them xD
---
Hell, it only stopped being BiS after Kara cuz they nerfed it....
---
Exactly. And the other glossed-over fact about this is that when the boss is in melee range of the casters the agro threshold goes down to 110% - it doesn’t stay at 130 just because the boss is looking at casters.
---
I wrote a little story just to retconn it and allow retail to continue toward. I had this same thought!
---
Depends entirely on the fight whether or not it will wipe the raid.  DPS pulls aggro on a Garr add right as it's about to explode and it knocks half of the raid away, killing most and preventing healers from reaching the tanks, DPS pulling Patchwerk into the raid causes anyone nearby to take hateful strikes 1 shotting them... any dragon breath aimed at the raid, DPS pulling off a tank on Twin Emperors can cause them to get too close, activating their massive healing ability... These are just some examples of the myriad where a single person can doom the whole encounter.
---
Hmm. I'm thinking rope, leather, and duct tape will also immobilize and silence the problem. 
---
That's for unneeded prot warriors. That enhance shaman might as well be another real dps class.
---
I'd argue they are the best dungeon healers in groups that dont screw up too much and need clutch heals from paladins or priess. They are much better than paladins, because you bring windfury/agi totem + str totem + mana totem + any fire totem. No other support class brings 3 buffs into the group and still heals very well. 
---
In the past RP minded folks got together and chose a PvP server as the unofficial RP-PvP server . In some ways I think that might be the best outcome.
---
I think that’s not too bad of an estimate. Although I agree, there are threats to validity here including as you mentioned, sample size, but also age of subreddit and age of game (meaning WoW Classic, not WoW in general) as potential confounds.
---
Still, I think it’s a pretty reasonable number. There were WAY more accounts on p servers than I would have thought without doing my research, and one would expect the vast majority of those would rather play on an officially supported server, and one would think also that only a fraction of people who want to play vanilla want it badly enough to play on a private server. 
---
I’m estimating 3 million subs, but could definitely see anywhere from 2 million to 5 million. 
---
I believeits called Combat Text, not sure
---
Regarding hunter weapons:
---
If I make a dwarf hunter, I only want to use guns or crossbows for RP reasons. Is it possible to be competitive at all brackets given this restriction? Or are there bows that you absolutely need to be using?
---
Once you have some t2+ gear you can do some insane stuff on a frost mage.  Two mages is better than one tho ;)
---
Just started last week. Enjoying it so much. I don't even mind having to start over from scratch when Classic launches.
---
Truly epic
---
we've got a core group ready to level to 60, get the ubrs key, recruit members and start raiding Ony

"You wanna buy my bread? It's perfeckly good bread, it is. Here, have a bite on the house. Thas good bread, innit?"
---
I am against making the world too large. I don't want tbc and wotlk areas because it will lower interaction. I do however want higher level areas.
---
Having an "oh shit" healing potion at all times really makes the difference for me. Saves me a lot of time corpse running.
---
Turns out the Scarab Lord title came about during TBC. I had the good fortune of being corrected on this a few days ago.
---
When WoW first launched in 2004 there were people who were hardcore MMO players from other games and came into it with optimized everything. That didn't bother you back then because you just didn't know about it.
---
If you play casually now and just don't worry about them it'll be pretty much the same.
---
I hear you. I don't think I'd mind some changes myself for the exact reason you pointed out, some specs are just underwhelming. But I'm also worried it'll be used to once and for all discredit the whole classic server idea... 
---
Plus I'm not sure Blizzard is willing to dedicate the resources needed to keep the game relatively balanced and updated. We'll see though :)
---
I’m not the same person now as 15 years ago though. Kids, wife, house, new job and responsibilities. The thought of playing a computer game for 8 hours straight is almost horrifying.
---
I believe it was the 2.0 prepatch, correct?
---
TBC launch
---
I dunno if anyone from Shattered Hand EU remembers Karabasan? The legend. 
---
I am running a semi-hardcore guild that will be raiding Noon PST to 4:00 pm PST Saturday and Sunday. We will be on a PvP server and doing world bosses and PvP premades. You don't have to PvP if you don't want to. We have many people planning to get out of the gates quickly and hit 60 asap. If you are interested or want to know more hmu. -Kich
---
For the first one, that sentence doesn't imply the second quote you said. It's basically just another way of wording no changes.
---
The line mentions things implemented in vanilla should be free to work with was supposed to mean any changes would be closely in line with what was already in existence. 
---
The taunt example was supposed to be a nearly ridiculous amount of change that I didn't say should be done but mentioned as a sort of thing that could be considered should every player somehow magically be on board with (I'm aware they won't).
---
Sorry it wasn't as clear as I would have liked or meant it to be.
---
Credit to Kakio for this video. It never fails to make me smile.
---
"Oh the struggles!"
---
What's tanking like for a warrior in dungeons and raids? As a DPS and/or tank spec.
---
This needs to be higher up. Basically this was a nerf to Resto/Ele getting too much value out of WF, and a change/buff to Enhancement with StSt change.
---
Every class needs to do their part and farm out their consumables. It's pretty scummy when you show up to raid with no enchants or flasks. 
---
Thank god you’re here to speak for every guild in game. 
---
If this is actually their reasoning then holy shit these people are stupid and greedy
---
I'm probably gonna main Paladin. For me the holy warrior class fantasy appeals to me and I have memories of helping my brother level his pally back when he played in Vanilla.
---
What I am looking forward to is the classic Paladin playstyle coming back. 30 second Seals, Judgements, an actual rotation, a list of abilities that didn't mock your IQ, actual buffs, etc.
---
What I am not looking forward to is being an absolute fucking healbot until Naxxramas.
---
Protection Paladins can't tank raids at all in Vanilla and this is partially due to bad itemization and bad talent design which didn't get fixed until patch 2.0.
---
Retribution Paladins on the other hand can't DPS until they've acquired Tier 2.5 gear that they're gonna be forced to compete with Warriors for, and even then they need to be fighting Undead mobs to use their fully optimal rotation.
---
They're setting us up so they can be good guys again and announce they've listened to the fans and will have an RP-PVP server.
---
Mmm, wonder how pservers are doing it now, or if it'll be in Classic then.
---
T2.5 would be sick if the cd reduction brought rapid fire to 1minute or maybe instead they increased the uptime of the buff. Hunters drop off dps charts around 2.5 and if blizzard had more of the data we have now I think they would have done something really cool with the set. I’ve never raided as a hunter but it would be fun if they had something to look forward to in aq40 outside of like 2 or 3 items. 
---
We had paladins in our guild that intentionally and successfully tanked everything in the game up to but not including Cthun. There have been paladins on private servers that tanked every boss including KT. 
---
Is it optimal? No. Is it possible? Yes, demonstrably so.
---
As a Horde player:
---
Please resist from creating gnomes.
---
Thank you.
---
It should definitely not be in Classic. 
---
I mean, cosmetic changes like titles are the easiest things to hold the #NoChanges line on.
---
You could only mail 1 attachment at a time also and they already said that they are changing it to the modern system.
---
By early you mean level 17. 14 if you're with friends/group so you're going to get more of a benefit from Spirit tap.
---
Unless you have a wand before level 10 Spirit tap would be better.
---
reckoning 1 shot becomes more reliable in pvp.
---
Where's the rest of your GUI?
---
If eventually the servers were to de-populate, do you think they could merger servers to stabilise numbers?
---
Despite what you may hear, there's no shame in that. 
---
I checked out the Demon Hunter intro as well as the BFA intro and they're both pretty cool in that they're related to lore I care about (unlike, for example, the Draenai stuff, ugh, I'm still mad at the damn space goats). 
---
Well, I'm pretty irritated I did actually... all my characters have been deleted...
---
Mate just don’t worry, play what you want and please don’t let this sub reddit scare you, most of the people here are like you and I. There’s no way I’ll be farming a crazy amount of consumes either, cbf and that’s fine for most guilds. 
---
The short answer is resistance potions are needed for everyone to live. However, a non mana based dps is probably your answer. DPS warrior comes to mind. No mana pots or runes. Without making you question more it’s getting gear which is harder, dps warrior competes with so many for gear. 
---
You clearly never played vanilla, only p servers.  Back in the day no one farmed consumables, it really didn’t matter.  This private server mentality will be the dead of classic before it starts.
---
Stealthception
---
I agree. This community has a rare passion and the game lends itself to word of mouth. We’ll have to see what happens though. 
---
I'm not here to make changes or ask for them. I wanted to hear more of why people thought so or thought not to make them; and, if they did, where a line might be drawn. I appreciate that your opinion is it should be as is. That's totally cool. I'm not certain on one side or the other and I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I wanted to hear why you thought that. The defensive stance isn't necessary.
---
Raiding as a Shaman in vanilla you better be ready to spec resto. Some guilds maybe have 1 enhancement shaman. I healed on a shaman and it’s pretty fun. Make sure you don’t forget your WF totem 
---
Make expansions seasonal.... that way one season is WotLK and you go kill Arthas in Northrend, but scale back everything and at the end of the season you get to keep some rewards from the dungeons... but keep the itemization leveled out instead of going up. Like you walk away from Northrend was some interesting gear combos but all have frost resist so.. say next season you do naxx the gear is helpful to start but you need to start picking up shadow resist to really progress... does that make sense? So Azeroth is never left empty for long. Stormwind would never be perma empty but during the Northrend campaign a majority of people would be there. Does that make sense? Or is that crazy? 
---
3-6 days? Do you mean hours?
---
Maybe not overhaul, but some classes need to be more like TBC. Obviously no 41 point talents. 
---
Yes, that was during Vanilla when game knowledge was limited. You can forgive that ignorance. Running a guild in retail and seeing someone show up with no consumables waa the most triggering thing. 
---
If you're in an organized guild expect to bring them.
---
People in pugs don't usually give a shit and thats why they don't get very far. 
---
Yeah it's really hard to turn those things into metrics. There were just a lot of forces that had people just...seeking out people to play with. It was something else.
---
A lot of guilds are looking for mages. My father Mained mage back in vanilla and was super successful(Funksback [Skullcrusher] ). Plus all the tips from portals is insane. 
---
Yea food and water sucks, but that makes you a better choice on dps. Plus your buff is pretty nice. Not to stay warlocks don’t have their fair share of abilities. (Summon, Imp buff, etc)
---
Plus it depends on what you like to see imo. Big numbers, or melting. Some people enjoy grouping up 6 mobs, Frost nova and blizzard. Others like melting with DoTs. 
---
They have a battle res, and you only need one priest left alive to res people after the battle anyhow.
---
&gt;True but.... so is the AOE stun as a Tauren.
---
Overrated.
---
And apparently we're talking about warriors now, so stoneform armor bonus will serve you better as a tank when shit gets real sometimes.  you're going to try so hard to be a great tank, so you will already have a bis weapon and deal good enough dps to hold aggro. If you can't hold aggro it isn't because of the racial, again, it's because your dps isn't doing their job right. And clearing crippling poison and blind is still fantastic as a warrior.
---
Sometimes you just have to accept that you don't want to play a Dwarf because of how they look. And that's okay.
---
You might find a CASUAL guild that will have you, but resto does everything better by far in raids.
---
It's not just the numbers.  For example, Affliction is built around DoTs and Drains, and by making Drain Life stronger and Siphon Life exist, it makes the warlock tankier.  So Affliction is tankier, but that's because it's built around drains.  The class identity is not "tanky class", but rather "drain class".
---
If you make it comparable DPS to destro, it becomes overpowered because now it's tanky and does damage.  So if you nerf the tankiness of it by reducing the amount of healing you can get from Drain Life and Siphon Life, then it loses its capability in the areas where draining was strong.
---
OK.
---
Please do consider classic as a brand new game for you :) 
---
&gt; TLDR: you need to farm consumables to do nax for progression. That’s just how it goes in vanilla sorry, not everyone just gets to do all the content cuz they want to.
---
So, if it's a progression night, you just drink like 20 elixers?
---
**LF RP-PVE Horde Group**
---
I have a feeling there's going to be only 10 Horde RPers in existence.
---
Exactly why I'm leveling a hunter alt. My Prot Warrior main isn't farming shit, lol.
---
Warlock is more like an anti-caster, caster. Mage is equipped with tools to make the life of melee miserable. It’s vanilla so everything is basically rock, paper and scissors. 
---
Zulian Slicer, Gutgore Ripper... and deadly poison? :o
---
Probably a hunter or rogue since they don't *need* to be flasked
---
Both solid options. I've tried the first one and it didnt work, the latter migjt be required.  She think's there's something wrong with me for wanting to book a week off and become a hermit for a week. Women, amirite.
---
Nice bait
---
People still won’t care, maybe the 1% of hardcore guilds will, but the majority won’t care.  It’s hard enough getting 40 people together in the first place.
---
Im not sure what that means, but its true. Even the polls that were posted here recently back that up. Shaman is around +15% on horde side, after warrior tied with mage
---
Never did BWL, hoping to take that next step!
---
big boy pants.
---
I know your pain brother, that spot is all to familiar.. So much of the GM grind was spent there, or azshara to grief the raid groups doing the dragon lol
---
It's honestly a question only you can answer, do you want your character to be an overall ultity for you and your friends aoe blizzard mobbing or PoM Pyroing people.
---
Or would you rather dot everything and run as your pet tanks and get free level 40 &amp; 60 mounts saving you gold early for your alts?
---
The way I'm approaching my first toon is going off I want to world PvP every chance I get, so it's between Druid, Rogue or Mage. Stealth is amazing for pvp in general but it's another level in world PvP as there are countless ways to approach and escape unlike in BGS.
---
And mage because PomPyro I just love doing that.
---
&gt;But I'm also worried it'll be used to once and for all discredit the whole classic server idea...
---
I guess that goes to the question of what the goal is, if the goal is a static representation of vanilla WoW, then sure it wouldn't make sense, I think there is a fair argument to be made, that it will have longevity issues.
---
&gt;Plus I'm not sure Blizzard is willing to dedicate the resources needed to keep the game relatively balanced and updated. We'll see though :)
---
This depends entirely on popularity, if 6 months after release there are only a hundred k or so play this is a moot point, however, if there are 500k it's a totally different scenario, time will tell.
---
I've always been curious about both how this will do, and how it will be developed if it's successful.
---
Top PVP guild on my server was named WORLD DEFENSE and the requirement to join was to be high enough level to chat in WORLD DEFENSE and use the WORLD DEFENSE channel instead of gchat and feel so cool talking about Chuck Norris in the channel designed to DEFEND the WORLD
---
If you deranked you got gkicked until you ranked yourself back up to spam the chat
---
I never said anything about raids. I was specifically talking about 5 man content, where most pugs are.
---
Also, once AQ is out. You should be able to find a pug MC that could finish with little wiping
---
It's fine up to the late 50s. No issue whatsoever tanking as fury. BRD is where it got tricky not being a prot warrior. 
---
Hard to get 8 tier 2 in MC, where the increased debuff limit will be "non blizzlike".
---
It's not reliable at all, its garbage :D
---
Just go full elitist mode for progression raiding and then once this is achieved, respec 30/0/21 and raid in elemental spec + healing gear. 5/8 T2 is actually great for elemental, so you will get your DPS gear naturally by healing.
---
If you want to be enhancer. Tough luck.
---
Yeah, the shadow oil or w/e its called
---
Sorry about that. Most people are not just curious. :)
---
But yes any talk about *any* changes to Classic misses the point of Classic completely. Which is to recreate a lost game, as it was. (And yes, I know it'll not be *exactly* the same but the goal is to get as close as is reasonably possible. Blizzard understands this. I hope they'll remember it years from now...)
---
Sending out invites to email addresses that match the description you gave could be a great way to get a lot of people to play who might otherwise be on the fence or not even aware that Classic is happening. I've reached out to a few people I used to play with who weren't even aware Classic was going to happen and at least two of them will be playing.
---
If you can do the other tasks I can do your wife 
---
I quit my shaman around the time ZG released, and heavily remember 0/30/21 as THE enhance build. Get a windfury into NS chain lightning was very satisfying 
---
Looking for a late night raiding guild on a PVP server, something after midnight CST is the earliest I can be on due to work. Willing to go either horde or alliance and planning on rolling a mage, paladin, shaman, or rogue depending on what the guild needs. Raided fairly hardcore from vanilla through wrath so I have experience farming consumables and mats needed for progression along with understanding the fights and boss mechanics. If there currently isn't a guild looking for something along these lines I'd also be willing to start one if there are more people interested. Add me on discord if you're wanting to talk or have further questions, Flohh#8607
---
Chain healing sounds kinda fun. That and totem upkeep seems like a rotation with variety. Maybe you’ll enjoy it
---
Thanks for the tips. One thing is that I’d like to heal a bit pre 60 as well. Maybe keep some healer gear around? My buddy will be tanking and we plan on doing dungeons often 
---
In 2019, people will be doing 95% of their jobs through Angry Assignments.
---
Unfortunate but because of the no changes making every class viable in each role paladin is the worst choice for pve unless you're a healer and then you're speccing into BoK as well...
---
Make the character you want, find a guild and people who aren't hardcore elitists and been min/maxing for 15 years and you'll be fine.
---
I'd personally go Human, besides the weapon skill the grand marshel set looks sexy on a human, now add the massive great sword!
---
Those are two totally different things.
---
*Difficulty* is fine and good, needing to work with others is fine and good. Quests that need 2+ players to tackle are good.
---
That has nothing to do with the tedium of almost every mob being functionally the same as every other mob, every fight being the same as every other fight, having to kill hundreds of mobs to level, and having to kill thousands to max out reputations.
---
Once you have fought The Mob That Runs At You, The Mob That Shoots At You and The Mob That Runs Away that is pretty much it, you have seen the complexity most of the game will offer you.
---
Rogue or warrior. Mana pots are the big sinks, so mana-less classes will be a lot easier.
---
We don't know everything 100% yet.
---
If your doing Naxx progression then you're going to need/want world buffs and as many consumes as possible. Regardless of class or roll.
---
If he's resto, he's not really losing anything from missing that last level.
---
When life was great
---
Yeah i love enhance shammy. Might just be PvP for my shaman, and raid on a different class
---

with the "viewform" replaced with "viewanalytics". Nothing is "mine", it is automatically generated by Google, who also own the form platform.
---
I posted this raw, unedited, third-party, auto-generated analytics, so that we have the full picture, which the restricted (10 000 votes) data might be hiding. The breakdowns are similar, yet to me it seemed like the other presentation (i.e. human paladins second most picked) misrepresented the low number of paladins, among other cognitively/optically biased differences.
---
Pre MC the best weapons are a gun and Xbow, the best ranged weapon that drop in BWL and Naxx are crossbows.  The only time you'd be really gimping yourself not using a bow is the end of MC to late BWL phase where Hunters use Rhok'Delar.  It drops off the 8th boss in MC but is also a high drop rate (50%) but requires another item from Onyxia and a really cool quest to actually complete.
---
Generally you'll be using that bow for a couple of months to a year, depending on your BWL progression and luck.  The Xbow that drops there is off the second to last boss and has a much lower drop rate, so if you aren't first in line as the hunter to get one in your guild it could be a while.  Not using Rhok in the mean time would definitely be gimping yourself but it's really the only bow that is BiS for a period of progression.
---
Its been proven to be by and far the worst class at upkeeping nightfall.
---
I share your sentiment and further evidence (MMO subscription data) agrees with it as well.
---
Classic wow will drop during the usual summer content drought in retail
---
I've been thinking something similar the last few days. I also play Lord of the Rings Online, and they've set up so-called legendary servers, where the game reverts back to the way it originally released. Then they incrementally unlock the expansions they have so far. 
---
If WoW's classic server turns out to be a huge success I could easily see them also setting up servers for TBC, for starters. If it's profitable Blizzard would be crazy not to.
---

The raw data is only available to the owner of the survey. I posted the Google auto-generated analytics of the form for completion/comparison sake.
---
With Overwatch Blizzard finally decided to just put up a big caveat of "GAME PLAY HAS NO EFFECT ON LORE WHATSOEVER"
---
Me and a couple buddies are trying to find a PvP Horde raiding guild that starts raiding at midnight CST.  Keep me in the loop man, us late night raiders are far and few between. Would be preferable to raid once or twice during week and then maybe once Sunday nights. Also very experienced through vanilla, tbc, and into wrath. We will be mage, Druid, rogue, so if you went shaman it could work out well for dungeons. I’m on discord as well but am not home to check my ID #, I’ll get back to ya.
---
Doubt it.
---
In 1.12 there is very little appealing about the shaman after the long list of nerfs in the last few months of Vanilla leading up to TBC pre-patch.
---
That's sounds like a great way to end up with premades farming the graveyard even more aggressively instead of focusing on fast games.
---
I also wouldn't be surprised if a disproportionate number of people interested in classic were on reddit for the CHOO CHOO HYPE TRAIN
---
With the declining subscription numbers for BfA I would not be surprised if that number was even bigger.
---
It's reasonable to get a wand at launch if you're willing to do a little bit of work for it. If you have a wand then wand spec max first for sure. In my personal experience the wand does such good damage that all you really have to do while leveling is cast shield on yourself, pull with one spell, and auto attack said mob to death. (Also buy a quiver for 40 copper because it will increase you attack speed with wand by 10%)
---
Point being, you'll usually only cast 2 spells per mob, and by the time they get through your shield to actually do damage to you you're like 2 auto attacks with you wand away from killing them. So you've spent maybe 15% of your mana pool (still have 85% of mana left) and like 80% percent of your health. Why would you need spirit tap? You don't really have much missing mana to restore.
---
Heck, since attacking with a wand doesn't count as casting a spell, you're mana regen is going for all but the first 5 seconds of combat. So on top of you only spending 15-20% of your total mana, you restored 5-10% back before you even pull the next mob.
---
IMHO even *if* you don't get a wand until you buy the vendor one at 15, it would seem worth it to me to have 5 points of wand specializion ready for when you get said wand.
---
Will we also be able to get drunk and shpeak shlurred... hic!?
---
That was 14 years ago, people are also expected to not back peddle. 
---
Oh no in this case its that i've been playing alliance for a long while and i'm swapping back. So i'm picking between horde races. 
---
No changes 
---
Nah bruh, you can do the cookin.
---
Its over. 
---
As a main tank all through BWL, priest call was the worst. No matter how many times I spammed "PRIESTS STOP HEALING" I'd always end up with like 5 or 6 dots on me from them not listening.
---
This is such a broken record question.
---
There are sooooooo many lists, rankings, mindless debates on whats good, whats bad. Some say nothings bad... 
---
Shadow priest is strongest 1v1 imo
---
He can because he's going all out.
---
I have been there, done that. At the end of it all, you have rushed the content and the only reasonable thing left to do is to start questioning your own existence. Taking your time and delaying gratification is really only taught by experiencing the alternative and losing the concept of meaning altogether.
---
Hi, /u/GrebiHemon
---
Want wc3 to drop first please
---
So they removed English jokes with English voice acting from the western version of the game, for reasons relating to the Chinese release of the game?
---
It's not 'outrage' to correctly identify the reason for the removal of the jokes - they were drug references in a time where recreational marijuana use was illegal everywhere in the US.
---
What!? That sucks man. Sorry to hear that. 
---
Are you sure? Did you make sure you were looking at the correct realm?
---
A solid chunk of private servers have already said they would shut down when classic comes out.
---
It could be you can't see your characters if you don't pay... Trying to work with customer support to confirm this. 
---
This is gunna be really random, but did you play halo back in the day? Maybe halo 2 or something. I vaguely remember my friend having a friend named Fiercegore. I forgot what my friends gametag was though. Like Bopermans or something 
---
You’re going to be guy whining on here when an “elitist” guild rejects your Ret paladin with 0 enchants or consumables. 
---
Thanks for the reply. Is it a lot of single target threat options/is it really difficult as fury?
---
Yeah, just ignore one of, if not the best zone in the game!
---
Ret pally, boomkin druid, enhancement shaman are imo the 3 Worst. With warrior any spec, mage anything but deep arcane, and rogue don’t know their specs being the 3 strongest classes. But I’m basing my oppinons pvp strictly. 
---
Yeah. My 4 characters were on servers over never played on and had very odd names... it's a little concerning. But.... I've read on the forums that you can't physically see your old characters if your subscription lapses... I hope that's the case. 
---
Even those of us that did play it might have false memories, it has been 14 years after all. Let us hope the "tediousness" results in better immersion in the world and pushes people more towards teamwork, as it used to back in the day.
---
I was able to see my characters after I selected the realm they were on. It defaulted to a different realm for some reason, so I was worried at first too but they were all there. 
---
&gt; Keeping a solid roster of 40+ players geared and ready to progress through Naxx is trickier than it sounds depending how good and fast your guild clears content.
---
It's a huge fucking time sink, regardless of whether your guild is good, or fast at clearing.
---
Roster management is a botomless time pit.
---
People keep acting like shamans are not a unique exception this patch. It's a patch where they have every nerf but, none of the reworks they were supposed to get during classic. They got fucked out of it back then and now blizz is freezing that into a snow globe. Sucks for Shamans and it's why I'll be playing a different class. Personally unless for some reason you get a hard on being a totems bitch. I would look else where for a class. The pay off for ele takes way too freaking long.
---
Veteran shaman player here. Wanted to raid as DPS. I'd do better I thought. I'd get better consumes and gear, I thought. The truth is nobody wants shaman DPS at 60. Made the switch to warrior and didn't look back.  
---
They're good for PvP, though.
---
I was a sub from Vanilla through till MoP then a brief interlude before Siege came out then through till nighthold in Legion then Tomb to about 3 months into BFA and i've only ever had 2 beta keys one was the MoP beta for the yearly pass and Legion one for WoD purely because they prio'd giving it to people who had killed Heroic Garrosh early. 
---
Honestly i think it is just random on who they give it to after streamers.
---
Getting a fury warrior to tank is like trying to pull teeth.
---
Right, the principle is really stretched to its limits at version 1.9, because that was only a month or so after the halfway point of the game (which happened in late 1.8). So if you take seriously the idea that the longer something was in Vanilla, the MORE Vanilla it is, then shadow damage Lupos is only very slightly more "vanilla" than non-shadow damage. 
---
In any event, I agree with you that giving Lupos shadow damage would not be the best way to rebalance hunters in a 1.12 world. If we wanted to make the pet stronger, we should probably do some sort of pet scaling, as in what happened in the patch directly after 1.12. 
---
More than 12 000 respondents (70%) played on a private server, so it is possible there is merit to your statement. Nevertheless, historically, PvP servers have always been more popular, so there will inevitably be a slight disbalance in their favour.
---
More like repair costs, mana pots, dark runes, two flasks/night, multiple elixirs, defensive potions, healing potions...
---
I think the exact opposite. Blizzard knows it's messed up and wants redemption. This isn't activisons doing, this is classic wow dev team. Numbers don't lie retail wow sucks. 
---
I think his point is that Shamans were supposed to get an overhaul but, they got fucked out of it over and over. It got pushed back to tbc patch. So this patch uniquely fucks Shamans to an extent it does not other classes except maybe a Druid. My response to that is to play neither his response is to hope they fix it. Lucky me mine will bear fruits. Personally no buff is going to change a shaman into a paladin so who cares. He always gonna be the garbage half the mirror image lol.
---
Yeah I think I remember! You like Panda Express, have a swimming pool in the backyard, and could say Bope in a fearsome, low, and staticy manner?
---
our guild didn’t kill c’thun but we did 9/14 naxx 
---
&gt; naxx
---
&gt; greatest raid the game had/has ever seen 
---
You've got a funny way of spelling Sunwell/Ulduar/Throne of Thunder/Blackrock Foundry/Nighthold.
---
Hi, /u/Minnesota_Lakers
---
Ive been saving it since classic was announced 
---
No shamans actually have the worst uptime on this, even worse than paladins!
---
If you're serious about nightfall, you usually have your prot warrior off-tanks equip it when they aren't offtanking, and you might even have a melee hunter (since R1 wingclip actually has the best NF uptime). These prot warriors and hunter are classes you're taking with you anyway, so there's no need to sacrifice a real dps spot for enhancement.
---
In any event - is there anything really at stake for you here? Like if you're right that shamans are needed for nightfall, does this lead you to believe that they shouldn't be buffed, and if in fact they are the worst nightfall users, does that lead you to believe that they should be? Like is the truth of the matter relevant at all to your assessment of whether shamans should be changed?
---
They are, as a healer they are most likely the one with the highest demand horde side. Their is normally a bigger dearth of druids but they are garbage and no one loves them. Hence why we make them sleep outside.
---
To raid the content I missed in Vanilla, half of AQ40, and almost all of Naxx. I choose to do it as a standard raid member of a guild this time, instead of an Officer and later co-GM like I did in Vanilla. All the fun with none of the stress (in theory)!
---
The girlfriend will be most likely playing this time around, so getting to re-explore Azeroth through her eyes will be exciting! She's played some older FPS shooters, but this is her first foray into an immersive MMORPG. Plus, I convinced her to roll a Priest or Paladin to complement my Warrior, so there's that!
---
I also look forward to twinking. I had a 39 Mage and a 29 Warrior in Vanilla, and enjoyed it more than most of the 60 battlegrounds. Twinking gets a lot of hate, but imo its a more level playing field than 60, especially when the powercreep sets in from the higher tier Raids. Are twinks going to destroy people casually bg'ing as they level? Absolutely. But anyone, regardless of time commitment or ability to raid, can make a twink.
---
Switch it up. 1 point in spirit tap and 1 point in wand spec and keep trading off. By the time you're level 20 both are maxed which is what you want anyways. I disagree with waiting until level 15 to get spirit tap, those levels are going to suck. At the very least get two points in spirit tap to keep yourself from having to drink every 3 mobs.
---
Gotta' teach those orc warriors dentistry some day!
---
BRD has a lot of groups where there's 5-6 mobs. It's a combination of AoE threat and taking too much damage for your healer to keep up with. 
---
Switching to protection for leveling at 50 isn't a horrible idea. You have the talent points to start AoE killing mobs with Revenge/Thunderclap, and you take less damage doing so. Fury/Arms questing is still faster, though. 
---
Prot and Paladins also got pushed off to 2.0, but yeah, point taken. 
---
&gt;You could spend all week farming
---
I can never get this part, to be honest. 
---
One of the biggest advantages we're getting this time is that we know how the game works. And we KNOW classes that is able to PRINT money. We know the techniques and places where you can do so, and we'll probably discover even more over the course of the game.
---
I think we can all agree that, due to 1.12 talents and itemization, MC and BWL are gonna be shitstomps. Consumables are appreciated, but never *needed*. You can do it for your own e-peen and meter padding, but that' pretty much about it. AQ is Phase 5, which lead us to the conclusion that you can get away with 4/6 of the content without the urge to farm stuff.
---
But you aren't gonna sit idle all that time, are you? Make yourself an alt on the very first day, Hunter or Mage, depending on your prefference. By the time Phase 5 hits, even if you're super casual player, you'll DEFINETELY will have one armed and ready, because:
---
*Since you've got your main, you don't need to worry about saving money for skills, bags, mount and so on. You're getting everything you want from level 1.
---
*There won't be that much of a competition, as most people will already be far ahead and you won't have compete with them.
---
*Those classes are GOD-TIER levellers by themselves.
---
*Not only that, but because those character aren't your "main", they're gonna get 200% exp boost, being "rested". You can play them from time to time, when your main character is busy with something. Getting corpsecamped? Switch to an alt, do a quest or two. Waiting for a dungeon group to assemble and arrive? Note the leader that you'll be on alt so he can message when you're needed, etc.
---
*You don't need any preparations, be it gear or anything else, to get the job done. Let me set a simple example: Warrior could have all purples in the world, but still would fail to kill 15 crocolisks in ZG alone. On the other hand, totally naked mage who knows what's up would still do it. Can you see the line? Fact that you've got a right class with a right spec is more than enough. Gear and consumables can create a buffer for possible mistakes, but you'll eventually get so familiar with the process that you'll simply stop making 'em.
---
So, yeah, if you've got a time to raid, you'll CERTAINLY have the time to get an alt ready by the time AQ kicks in. Let's say you spend raid 2 days, 4 hours each. Treat the farming as the third day with an *exception*: you can do it whenever you want! Allocate those additional hours thoughout the week: you don't have to spend more than 15 minutes per run, and you also don't need anybody to get this done.
---
Summing up, there's a 168 hours in one week. If you can't afford to dedicate 12 of them for gaming, perhaps it's too early to speak about dealing with the final raid of the game? :)
---
I want to be there when the first guy to get Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger shows it off it in front of the Ironforge Bank, and then take a screenshot with him.
---
Quiver is a private server thing
---
Ench favors PvE vs while engi favors PvP, really.  
---
Orrr you can go the long route and level an alt with tailoring and mining. But that's pretty hardcore.  
---
But alcoholic references are fine? It's a drug too.
---
I wish I could believe this. I think, as they have demonstrated with loot trading and 4 content stages, this is just plain mistake, not understanding the core audience, not understanding the game.
---
But again they have demonstrated that they (to a degree) really do care, are listening, are humble, and are trying to make Classic as it should be.
---
So there is a sliver of hope that they release at least one, if not more, RP-PvP servers at launch, a server type which retail Vanilla had.
---
Here's hoping.
---
Diminishing returns on honour prevents abuse like a mass multiboxer letting someone aoe them down at a graveyard over and over for stupid amounts of honour, and it also removes the incentive of endless camping people/camping graveyards in bgs.
---
Aka it was introduced for a good reason and is a necessary evil. 
---
Yea if it were up to me blizzard would make sure to have druid tanking as 100% clearly viable at launch. My reasoning being and if you played on a private server you may get me. Tanks tank entirely too long. Buffing feral to making it "clearly" viable would help to alleviate that without ruining the game.
---
I also think they should make Enhance and Ret work as a melee dps spec. Why? SO every server isn't 50% fury warriors because wow does not have enough melee options. That's just me though. I am a mad man.
---
I mean most of the hybrid classes are frankly unplayable and boring as hell prior to the pre-tbc patch.
---
I really wanted to play that, but the cash shop being included kept me from even trying it sadly.
---
Then what happens "if" they release an RP-PvP server like they claimed? Cross your fingers that your server will be allowed to pay for a transfer?
---
Reroll after months of investment?
---
I've always been under the impression that during progression nights, you don't pop elixers. I'm very familiar with repair costs, back in like 1.2, plate cost 5x as much to repair as cloth. My guildies had to pay my repair bill one night, because I couldn't farm gold faster than my repair bill racked up.
---
Why roll on any PvP server then? They should just release all PvE servers, much simpler.
---
After all, you can just /pvp.
---
Absolutely idiotic, but there's always at least one like you repeating this drivel of "just flag bro."
---
YEEES!!
---
Cross-realm battlegrounds were fucking terrible. God I fucking hated that change.
---
Its all a ploy to waste everyone’s pto. Stimulus plan
---
Druid doesn't have to beat the paladin or warlock in this situation.  
---
Hells yeah, and the game isn't even out yet. The eventual explosion when launch happens and people are like..... "Okay, this shit is fun, but I need a Warrior leveling guide"    LOL.
---
I think there's enough interest to support more than one.
---
So 1/3rd of all RP servers were PvP? How is that a bad statistic?
---
Instead of 3 RPPvE they should then release 2 RPPvE and 1 RPPvP server.
---
*Also keep in mind* that the playerbase of Classic is different. All server populations tended towards more PvP. Virtually all pservers are PvP. According to *the most recent surveys,* **interest in RPPvP servers is greater than interest in RPPvE.**
---
In modern WoW this is basically just the equivalent of a fish yelling that he is wet. No one gives a shit.
---
Turns out, the characters who had weird names were forced to change their names because of inactivity. And as for my mains, although blizzard says they are there, I can't see them. I'm logged into blizzard and I'm looking at wow and they aren't there. Even typing in there names reveals nothing... so, at this point, I'll consider them all lost to the ether..
---
Thanks for the info
---
&gt; I'm just saying that there's no way they don't make it in. 
---
I wish. But this may be one of those decisions more motivated by excecuti$$$ve concerns rather than gameplay or community ones.
---
It really can swing either way. It's mind boggling Ion would say something like that in the beginning. But there is hope they will see the light. They already backtracked on other mistakes like loot trading and 4 content stages.
---
There is hope, but it's just that: hope. There is no guarantee.
---
My main during vanilla was Ænima, couldn’t believe it wasn’t taken. Made a bunch of mates just from people whispering ‘damn why didn’t I think of that name!’ :) 
---
Neither can an endless one where nothing happens other than aimless fights or spamming your one aoe spell for 99% of it

That's fair. Coming from BfA WoW I enjoy the relative challenge in LotRO. I'm hoping Classic WoW will take it up another notch in terms of no handholding and not showering me in useless presents just for participating :P

Shadow Priests are monsters. By no means are they bad. Hunters are gross so I am not going to comment on them. Combat is not recommended at all though.

You had to be rank 11 or higher.  I remember the day I got it and it was awesome.  Ironically could only talk to the same 15 or so people I was already spending all day talking to though 
---
I love when changes are suggested without taking even 0.5 seconds to think about the consequences.  
---
It's from the in-game client from the character screen. I unfortunately just uninstalled it since it was taking up an ungodly amount of space on my computer. 
---
My vanilla account was hacked by some Chinese.
---
Honestly you might can talk your guild leader into letting you use nightfall and have the talent to make WF better. But I wouldn’t count on that. Also you may be descriminated later on lvling in 5 mans if a leader perceived shaman dps to be a joke. I always bring shaman dps in lvling dungeons because it helps my threat but in harder content later people may not choose you. 
---
Stormreaver Alliance side here
---
You probably killed me
---
I managed to get to level 20 over the weekend. (Private Server)
---
It was so much fun but the weekend ended up being really short.
---
RIP time.
---
Tyrs Hand? Loved farming there
---
/r/theydidthemath kinda
---
My goal is simple:
---
Be a hunter with Ashkandi 
---
Another thing to consider is that a lot of people won't sub until after the game is released.
---
As long as you had fun, that's all that matters!
---
Ever heard of totem twisting. Apparently skilled shamans could give wf and the agility buff. 
---
Come at me!
---
You can see them even if you're not a subscriber right?
---
Yeah, saw a video recently on it and learned about it. Never heard of it until recently. Sounds very involved, more than most other classes. I would never heal, but if I did, it’d be on shaman 
---
I still fondly remember horde mages wall jumping up the mountain from their side to ours and fireballing people at our entrance from an unreachable location. Ahh, the good ol' days :P
---
Hurricane has some really sick work. Wish things would have worked out and Blizzard would have been able to hire him for Classic releases. Trailer per "patch" would be 100% ok with me
---
Just a quick FYI, you can log into any account and play till lvl 20 for free so you can test access without re-subbing.
---
Not enough people care about this. Using the original damage text numbers is very important.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Fury Warriors &amp; Mages.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**

This may be dumb but why do I need to resub before classic is released. Does activating your retail account provide anything? Asking for a friend.

Nobody's said it, but the Gandalf cred should be given to the Nostalrius team that went to Blizz HQ, Mark Kern and everyone who signed the petition.
---
If your PC was made between now and when WoW first launched... it will probably run WoW Classic.
---
Yeah I was playing on one of my characters for a few hours this weekend. Previously I hadn't touched the game since about 2011, so it's not an age of account thing I think. 
---
I'll reinstall it to help you out :)

every arrow or bullet is a consumable, and depending on the guild sometimes vendor arrows wont cut it.
---
You have to have a retail sub to play Classic when it releases 
---
Realistically, what is the least amount you need to play for R14? Is it more or you need to get a certain amount of HKs in a day or in a week? 
---
Must be all these shooters that have been coming out for the last 20 years.
---
I enjoy a good slow game.
---
Using my old school name and class. Really trying to bring back the feels.
---
If you find a good tank you can stick with and help out you both benefit because having a good tank is going to make dungeons better. 
---
If you are going to be pushing server firsts you’ll have plenty of time to level a 2nd 60 and catch up before bwl drops. So go with what you are feeling like.

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built on a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, while competing with the best guilds in the world is unlikely, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible. If you're an adult, have a limited schedule, and are good a video games, then this is the guild for you.
---
Expectations: 
---
While we would certainly prefer that everyone play an optimal class/spec, we care much more about about the person behind the character. We expect, that regardless of class/spec, that all members show a willingness to learn and become exceptional at their role.
---
We expect that all members of the guild treat each other with respect. All members will work towards the overall goal of the guild, and not focus on personal gains. Any situation in which a person is causing conflict within the guild, putting themselves above the team, or causing any other sort of drama, will be swiftly removed from the guild.
---
We expect that all members of the raiding team come to raids prepared. This means that all encounters are researched and the player has a understanding of what is to come prior to entering a raid. While consumables are not required, due to ridiculous monetary reasons, we ask that members bring what they can afford. Similarly, attaining world buffs is not required; however, we ask that members contribute all that they have time and resources for.

We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. In terms of particular classes, our preference would certainly be to recruit the most optimal class/spec for the role; however, we are much more concerned with the player behind the class and will take the less wanted specs into consideration, yes even ret. It's important to note that this is a fresh guild that is also looking to add to our officer core. We are looking for experienced leadership members that can bring unique ideas and help our guild towards the goal of clearing Naxx. If becoming a part of the leadership team interests you, please contact me via PM to discuss this further.
---
Looting Policies: 
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. The entire guild leadership team, as well as a rotating elected position, will take on the role of the council. The council will distribute the loot based on the following factors:
---
1. Role Priorities
---
2. Main Item Role
---
3. Upgrade Size
---
4. Future Needs
---
5. Member Contribution
---
All items of epic quality will be distributed using loot council, legendary items will be distributed to a member determined prior to the raid. The person assigned to received legendary items will be selected based on the effectiveness of the item for the class, member contributions to the guild, and future guild considerations.
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

Me must ***SQUISH***
---
1. Find like-minded people. (you have a guild, that's a good starting point)
---
2. All of you roll on the same server.
---
3. Congratulations -- that's now the RP PVP server.
---
Just because it lacks the Official Blizzard Designation doesn't mean it won't work. The RP PVP server will be the one where the most RP PVPers roll.
---
If you can get a couple of guilds full of interested RP PVPers (both factions would be ideal), then you can set up your own official server without their official blessing. And then, when Blizzard finally realize it was a good idea, I bet they make your server the official one.
---
See the topright button where it says "change realm" here. I'm not a subscriber so all my characters that are &gt; level 20 say "inactive". 
---
Honestly in my opinion there are only two times you need to worry about a raid spot. First would be you are trying to play a hybrid in a spec that isn't it's most optimal. The second is you chose to play a warrior.
---
In the case of the first you will have trouble finding  a spot because you slow down the raid. It's still possible but don't expect to be in a T1 guild. For the warrior what makes it tricky isn't the pop or the demand. It's the players. Warrior players are the most hard core players in classic. They will put out crazy effort for the slightest edge. Unless you wanna go to war with super try hards for good spots I would avoid warrior.
---
FOr everything else though. It's pretty rosey imo.
---
Full T2 Rogue with CTS and Maladeth.
---
PvE 
---
Unless you go against Russians, who turtle 90% of the time.
---
I think that's clear too. But at least they should release *one,* anything else is patently absurd.
---
If there is too much demand, they can open more. If there is not enough demand, they can merge it with a PvP server.
---
If they release zero RP-PvP servers at launch, how will they "release it if there is demand after launch"? How the hell does that make sense? How will people express demand for a server choice that doesn't exist?
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** I have teamed up with a former guild leader from the server, Aegwynn. He is recruiting, alongside me. We still need many more players. **Come join us!**
---
What happens if/when Blizzard releases an RP-PvP server?
---
Just reroll after commiting months of time invested into your character?
---
How is converting a single PvP server to an RPPvP server fair to the people that roll there as a simple PvP server?
---
The only reasonable choice is to release Classic with *at least* one RPPvP server. If there is too much demand, they can release more. If there isn't enough, they can just merge it.
---
Dont know the patch. But I assume it will be there since they are using 1.12 as template.
---
True. But it's not until you crack open the hood on your account that you discover the issues. In my case, I lost my physical authenticator and I worked with blizz support today to get it removed. 
---
Not hating, but I'm curious what you do for work that allows you to hit R14 multiple times. I'm jelly. :(
---
Thanks 👍 I have a bfa I deactivated last month. When should I reactivate 
---
Is it even difficult or do they just select a realm title it RP pvp then enable pvp and launch it. 
---
I would just wait it out for now - they've changed course on a lot of decisions from community feedback and I wouldn't be surprised if they changed course on this too.
---
As someone who wanted to play an enh shaman this time around, this thread is making me sad and thinking of going rogue now..
---
As many have stated before, I don't think they'll do an open beta - doing that gives the opportunity to kill hype.  We may see a very short stress test similar to the Bcon demo, but don't expect a full 'entire world, ready to go'.
---
I ADORE his whole playlist on youtube
---
Ok. Figured it out. The realm list was not showing my characters (drop down list, characters) UNTIL I went to the actual server and clicked okay. And there they were!!!  Thanks everyone!
---
In Vanilla - non-viable.  
---
If TBC-Classic comes out?  They become VERY viable, but I wouldn't roll one now on the hopes they might get better later.
---
I thought it was unproven private server vs retail. Do you have a source for this so I can take note for future
---
You're lucky you could even get to the trench! I'd always end up stuck behind the pillars either side of the entrance, press a button and 5 seconds later I'd be at the other pillar, I had to have a friend log in and do city stuff for me for a couple of months before I got my own pc (with a graphics card!) instead of the family one!
---
The thing with classes are not everyone is good at them.  We're going to get a SHITTON of Warriors, but I would say maybe 20-30% of those warriors will actually be decent.  
---
If you make the effort to play your class well, you'll quickly rise above the rest.
---
Lol yea you are wrong, maybe if your in a meme guild. If you dont think that the vast majority of guilds are not going to look at these high end p server guilds when they roll into classic with a giant ace they have sharpened for ten years... you are out to lunch sir. The meta has changed, we knew nothing of the potential.
---
I'd suggest 3 days before and then log in and make sure everything is good. 
---
I still remember when I found out about AV. I think all I did was AV for like a week straight.
---
It was amazing.
---
If you're a raid tank can you also solo effectively with a raiding/dungeon tanking build or did warriors just have to respec all the time in vanilla? That's one of the features I am going to miss at least is dual spec lol
---
Nah it's a healer ironicly, mana pots are easy and basicly no other need for constant consumes outside of mage blood and oils.
---
Retri paladin. Just gonna chill, kick some asses in pvp, maybe do a raid or two if anyone will take me, go around the world meeting people running dungeons and immersing myself as much as I can.
---
It's simply a server designation. Just a PvP server with an RP handle in the name. Nothing more. Absolutely zero cost.
---
All it takes is the executive decision.
---
I tweet to Ion about it but I doubt he reads those tweets. I know I don't read any.

As ya boi asmongold says, if a game doesn’t make kids want to ruin their lives then it’s not a good game.
---
I am going to use a different name/different style in Classic.  I use the same naming scheme on retail/older xpacs.  It was inspired by a very good friend of mine that I am no longer in contact with :(
